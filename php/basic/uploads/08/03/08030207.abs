Title: A generalized non-Hermitian oscillator Hamiltonian, N-fold supersymmetry  and position-dependent mass models
Authors: Bijan Bagchi and Toshiaki Tanaka
Abstract: A generalized non-Hermitian oscillator Hamiltonian is proposed that consists of additional linear terms which break PT-symmetry explicitly. The model is put into an equivalent Hermitian form by means of a similarity transformation and the criterion of N-fold supersymmetry with a position-dependent mass is shown to reside in it.
