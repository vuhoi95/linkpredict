Title: Very Special (de Sitter) Relativity
Authors: Enrique √Ålvarez and Roberto Vidal
Abstract: The effects of a non-vanishing value for the cosmological constant in the scenario of Lorentz symmetry breaking recently proposed by Cohen and Glashow (which they denote as Very Special Relativity) are explored and observable consequences are pointed out.
