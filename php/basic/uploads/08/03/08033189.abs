Title: Five Dimensional Non-Supersymmetric Black Holes and Strings
Authors: J. B. Gutowski and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We study non-supersymmetric solutions of five dimensional N=2 supergravity theories coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets. The solutions constructed can be considered as deformations of known supersymmetric black hole and string solutions. General constraints coming from the analysis of the equations of motion are derived. These represent explicit conditions on the charges of the black holes and strings. The constraints are analyzed for theories where the scalar manifolds are symmetric spaces and explicit solutions are constructed in cases where the prepotential of the theory factorizes into a linear and a quadratic term.
