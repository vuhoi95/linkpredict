Title: On Six Dimensional Fundamental Superstrings as Holograms
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Subir Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: In this note we discuss a possible holographic dual of the two dimensional conformal field theory associated with the world-sheet of a macroscopic superstring in a compactification on four-torus. We assume the near horizon geometry of the black string has symmetries of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and construct a sigma model in the bulk. Analyzing the symmetries of the bulk theory and comparing them with those of the CFT in a special light-cone gauge we find agreement between global symmetries. Due to non-standard gauge realization it is not clear how affine symmetries can be realized.
