Title: Fermion Tunneling from Dynamical Horizons
Authors: Roberto Di Criscienzo and Luciano Vanzo
Abstract: The instability against emission of fermionic particles by the trapping horizon of an evolving black hole is analyzed using the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling method. This method automatically selects one special expression for the surface gravity of a changing horizon. The results also apply to point masses embedded in an expanding universe. As a bonus of the tunneling method, we gain the insight that the surface gravity still defines a temperature parameter as long as the evolution is sufficiently slow that the black hole pass through a sequence of quasi-equilibrium states, and that black holes should be semi-classically unstable even in a hypothetical world without bosonic fields.
