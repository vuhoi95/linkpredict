Abstract: We derive compact multiple integral formulas for several physical spin correlation functions in the semi-infinite XXZ chain with a longitudinal boundary magnetic field. Our formulas follow from several effective re-summations of the multiple integral representation for the elementary blocks obtained in our previous article (I). In the free fermion point we compute the local magnetization as well as the density of energy profiles. These quantities, in addition to their bulk behavior, exhibit Friedel type oscillations induced by the boundary; their amplitudes depend on the boundary magnetic field and decay algebraically in terms of the distance to the boundary.
