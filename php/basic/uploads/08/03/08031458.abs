Title: Remarks on bell-shaped lumps: stability and fermionic modes
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate
Abstract: We consider non-topological, "bell-shaped" localized and regular solutions available in some 1+1 dimensional scalar field theories. Several properties of such solutions are studied, namely their stability and the occurence of fermion bound states in the background of a kink and a kink-anti-kink solutions of the sine-Gordon model.
