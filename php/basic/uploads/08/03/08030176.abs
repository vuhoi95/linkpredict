Title: Reformulating SU(N) Yang-Mills theory based on change of variables
Authors: Kei-Ichi Kondo and Toru Shinohara and Takeharu Murakami
Abstract: We propose a new version of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory reformulated in terms of new field variables which are obtained by a nonlinear change of variables from the original Yang-Mills gauge field. The reformulated Yang-Mills theory enables us to study the low-energy dynamics by explicitly extracting the topological degrees of freedom such as magnetic monopoles and vortices to clarify the mechanism for quark confinement. The dual superconductivity in Yang-Mills theory is understood in a gauge-invariant manner, as demonstrated recently by a non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop operator, although the basic idea of this reformulation is based on the Cho-Faddeev-Niemi decomposition of the gauge potential.
