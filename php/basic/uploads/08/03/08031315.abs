Title: Gauge-String Dualities and Some Applications
Authors: Marcus K. Benna and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: The first part of these lectures contains an introductory review of the AdS/CFT duality and of its tests. Applications to thermal gauge theory are also discussed briefly. The second part is devoted to a review of gauge-string dualities based on various warped conifold backgrounds, and to their cosmological applications.
