Abstract: We compute the partition function of the su(m) Polychronakos-Frahm spin chain of BC_N type by means of the freezing trick. We use this partition function to study several statistical properties of the spectrum, which turn out to be analogous to those of other spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type. In particular, we find that when the number of particles is sufficiently large the level density follows a Gaussian distribution with great accuracy. We also show that the distribution of (normalized) spacings between consecutive levels is of neither Poisson nor Wigner type, but is qualitatively similar to that of the original Haldane-Shastry spin chain. This suggests that spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type are exceptional integrable models, since they do not satisfy a well-known conjecture of Berry and Tabor according to which the spacings distribution of a generic integrable system should be Poissonian. We derive a simple analytic expression for the cumulative spacings distribution of the BC_N-type Polychronakos-Frahm chain using only a few essential properties of its spectrum, like the Gaussian character of the level density and the fact the energy levels are equally spaced. This expression is in excellent agreement with the numerical data and, moreover, there is strong evidence that it can also be applied to the Haldane-Shastry and the Polychronakos-Frahm spin chains.
