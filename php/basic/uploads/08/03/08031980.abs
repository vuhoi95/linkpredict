Title: Enhanced Black Hole Horizon Fluctuations
Authors: R. T. Thompson and L. H. Ford
Abstract: We discuss the possible role of quantum horizon fluctuations on black hole radiance, especially whether they can invalidate Hawking's analysis based upon transplanckian modes. We are particularly concerned with ``enhanced'' fluctuations produced by gravitons or matter fields in squeezed vacuum states sent into the black hole after the collapse process. This allows for the possibility of increasing the fluctuations well above the vacuum level. We find that these enhanced fluctuations could significantly alter stimulated emission but have little effect upon the spontaneous emission. Thus the thermal character of the Hawking radiation is remarkably robust.
