Title: Self-consistent crystalline condensate in chiral Gross-Neveu and  Bogoliubov-de Gennes systems
Authors: Gokce Basar and Gerald V. Dunne
Abstract: We derive a new exact self-consistent crystalline condensate in the 1+1 dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model. This also yields a new exact crystalline solution for the one dimensional Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and the Eilenberger equation of semiclassical superconductivity. We show that the functional gap equation can be reduced to a solvable nonlinear equation, and discuss implications for the temperature-chemical potential phase diagram.
