Title: Fermions tunnelling from the charged dilatonic black holes
Authors: De-You Chen and Qing-Quan Jiang and Xiao-Tao Zu
Abstract: Kerner and Mann's recent work shows that, for an uncharged and non-rotating black hole, its Hawking temperature can be exactly derived by fermions tunnelling from its horizons. In this paper, our main work is to improve the analysis to deal with charged fermion tunnelling from the general dilatonic black holes, specifically including the charged, spherically symmetric dilatonic black hole, the rotating Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) black hole and the rotating Kaluza-Klein (KK) black hole. As a result, the correct Hawking temperatures are well recovered by charged fermions tunnelling from these black holes.
