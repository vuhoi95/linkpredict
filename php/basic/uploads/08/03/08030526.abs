Title: Quintics with Finite Simple Symmetries
Authors: Christoph Luhn and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: We construct all quintic invariants in five variables with simple Non-Abelian finite symmetry groups. These define Calabi-Yau three-folds which are left invariant by the action of A_5, A_6 or PSL_2(11).
