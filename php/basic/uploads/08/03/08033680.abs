Title: (De)quantization of black hole charges
Authors: Archil Kobakhidze and Bruce H. J. McKellar
Abstract: We argue that magnetic and electric charges of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole are quantized in CP conserving theories. Dequantization phenomenon occurs when CP is broken either explicitly or effectively, and, as a result, pure magnetic black holes are not possible. Two examples illustrating this phenomenon are discussed. One is the electric charge induced by the neutral pion field in a magnetically charged black hole, and another is the electric charge induced due to the massive spin-two field emerging from possible higher curvature terms.
