Title: The cohomology of superspace, pure spinors and invariant integrals
Authors: N. Berkovits and P. S. Howe
Abstract: The superform construction of supersymmetric invariants, which consists of integrating the top component of a closed superform over spacetime, is reviewed. The cohomological methods necessary for the analysis of closed superforms are discussed and some further theoretical developments presented. The method is applied to higher-order corrections in heterotic string theory up to $\a'^3$. Some partial results on $N=2,d=10$ and $N=1,d=11$ are also given.
