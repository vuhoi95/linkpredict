Title: Discrete evolution for the zero-modes of the Quantum Liouville Model
Authors: L. D. Faddeev and A. Yu. Volkov
Abstract: The dynamical system for the zero modes of the Liouville Model, which is separated from the full dynamics for the discrete shifts of time $ t \to t + \pi $, is investigated. The structure of the modular double in quantum case is introduced.
