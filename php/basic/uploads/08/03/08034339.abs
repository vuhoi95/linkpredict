Title: Twisted SUSY Invariant Formulation of Chern-Simons Gauge Theory on a  Lattice
Authors: Kazuhiro Nagata and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: We propose a twisted SUSY invariant formulation of Chern-Simons theory on a Euclidean three dimensional lattice. The SUSY algebra to be realized on the lattice is the N=4 D=3 twisted algebra that was recently proposed by D'Adda et al.. In order to keep the manifest anti-hermiticity of the action, we introduce oppositely oriented supercharges. Accordingly, the naive continuum limit of the action formally corresponds to the Landau gauge fixed version of Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group which was originally proposed by Witten. We also show that the resulting action consists of parity even and odd parts with different coefficients.
