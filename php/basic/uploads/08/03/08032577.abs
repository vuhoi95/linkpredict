Title: On the quartic curvature gravity in the context of FRW cosmology
Authors: M. Iihoshi and S. V. Ketov
Abstract: We consider the purely gravitational fourth-order (in the spacetime curvature) quantum corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert gravity action, coming from superstrings in the leading order with respect to the Regge slope parameter, and study their impact on the evolution of the Hubble scale in the context of the FRW cosmology, in four spacetime dimensions. We propose the generalized Friedmann equations, and rule out the most naive (Bel-Robinson tensor squared) gravity. Our new cosmological equations have exact inflationary solutions without a spacetime singularity.
