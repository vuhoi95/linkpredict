Title: The supergravity dual of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories with  unquenched flavors
Authors: Felipe Canoura and Paolo Merlatti and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We obtain the supergravity dual of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions with a large number of unquenched massless flavors. The geometries found are obtained by solving the equations of motion of supergravity coupled to a suitable continuous distribution of flavor branes. The background obtained preserves two supersymmetries. We find that when N_c\ge 2N_f the behavior of the solutions is compatible with having an asymptotically free dual gauge theory with dynamical quarks. On the contrary, when N_c<2N_f the theory develops a Landau pole in the UV. We also find a new family of (unflavored) backgrounds generated by D5-branes that wrap a three-cycle of a cone with G_2 holonomy.
