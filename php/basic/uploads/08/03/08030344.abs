Title: Center-stabilized Yang-Mills theory: confinement and large $N$ volume  independence
Authors: Mithat Unsal and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: We examine a double trace deformation of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory which, for large $N$ and large volume, is equivalent to unmodified Yang-Mills theory up to $O(1/N^2)$ corrections. In contrast to the unmodified theory, large $N$ volume independence is valid in the deformed theory down to arbitrarily small volumes. The double trace deformation prevents the spontaneous breaking of center symmetry which would otherwise disrupt large $N$ volume independence in small volumes. For small values of $N$, if the theory is formulated on $\R^3 \times S^1$ with a sufficiently small compactification size $L$, then an analytic treatment of the non-perturbative dynamics of the deformed theory is possible. In this regime, we show that the deformed Yang-Mills theory has a mass gap and exhibits linear confinement. Increasing the circumference $L$ or number of colors $N$ decreases the separation of scales on which the analytic treatment relies. However, there are no order parameters which distinguish the small and large radius regimes. Consequently, for small $N$ the deformed theory provides a novel example of a locally four-dimensional pure gauge theory in which one has analytic control over confinement, while for large $N$ it provides a simple fully reduced model for Yang-Mills theory. The construction is easily generalized to QCD and other QCD-like theories.
