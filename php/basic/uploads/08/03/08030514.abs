Title: Metastable vacua and geometric deformations
Authors: A. Amariti and D. Forcella and L. Girardello and A. Mariotti
Abstract: We study the geometric interpretation of metastable vacua for systems of D3 branes at non isolated toric deformable singularities. Using the L^{aba} examples, we investigate the relations between the field theoretic susy breaking and restoration and the complex deformations of the CY singularities.
