Title: Stability of Five-dimensional Myers-Perry Black Holes with Equal Angular  Momenta
Authors: Keiju Murata and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We study the stability of five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with equal angular momenta which have an enlarged symmetry, U(2). Using this symmetry, we derive master equations for a part of metric perturbations which are relevant to the stability. Based on the master equations, we prove the stability of Myers-Perry black holes under these perturbations. Our result gives a strong evidence for the stability of Myers-Perry black holes with equal angular momenta.
