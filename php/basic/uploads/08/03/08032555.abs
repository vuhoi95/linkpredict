Title: Schwinger Pair Production in dS_2 and AdS_2
Authors: Sang Pyo Kim and Don N. Page
Abstract: We study Schwinger pair production in scalar QED from a uniform electric field in dS_2 with scalar curvature R_{dS} = 2 H^2 and in AdS_2 with R_{AdS} = - 2 K^2. With suitable boundary conditions, we find that the pair-production rate is the same analytic function of the scalar curvature in both cases.
