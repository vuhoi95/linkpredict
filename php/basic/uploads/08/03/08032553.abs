Title: Vacuum Boundary Effects
Authors: M. Asorey and J. M. Munoz-Castaneda
Abstract: The effect of boundary conditions on the vacuum structure of quantum field theories is analysed from a quantum information viewpoint. In particular, we analyse the role of boundary conditions on boundary entropy and entanglement entropy. The analysis of boundary effects on massless free field theories points out the relevance of boundary conditions as a new rich source of information about the vacuum structure. In all cases the entropy does not increase along the flow from the ultraviolet to the infrared.
