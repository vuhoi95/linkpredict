Title: Trivializing a Family of Sasaki-Einstein Spaces
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Stanislav Kuperstein
Abstract: We construct an explicit diffeomorphism between the Sasaki-Einstein spaces Y^{p,q} and the product space S^3 \times S^2 in the cases q \le 2. When q=1 we express the K\"ahler quotient coordinates as an SU(2) bundle over S^2 which we trivialize. When q=2 the quotient coordinates yield a non-trivial SO(3) bundle over S^2 with characteristic class p, which is rotated to a bundle with characteristic class 1 and re-expressed as Y^{2,1}, reducing the problem to the case q=1. When q>2 the fiber is a lens space which is not a Lie group, and this construction fails. We relate the S^2 \times S^3 coordinates to those for which the Sasaki-Einstein metric is known. We check that the RR flux on the S^3 is normalized in accordance with Gauss' law and use this normalization to determine the homology classes represented by the calibrated cycles. As a by-product of our discussion we find a diffeomorphism between T^{p,q} and Y^{p,q} spaces, which means that T^{p,q} manifolds are also topologically S^3 \times S^2.
