Title: Hexagon Wilson loop = six-gluon MHV amplitude
Authors: J. M. Drummond and J. Henn and G. P. Korchemsky and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We compare the two-loop corrections to the finite part of the light-like hexagon Wilson loop with the recent numerical results for the finite part of the MHV six-gluon amplitude in N=4 SYM theory by Bern, Dixon, Kosower, Roiban, Spradlin, Vergu and Volovich (arXiv:0803.1465 [hep-th]) and demonstrate that they coincide within the error bars and, at the same time, they differ from the BDS ansatz by a non-trivial function of (dual) conformal kinematical invariants. This provides strong evidence that the Wilson loop/scattering amplitude duality holds in planar N=4 SYM theory to all loops for an arbitrary number of external particles.
