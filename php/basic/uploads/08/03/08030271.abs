Title: Relation between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in YM-theories
Authors: Franziska Synatschke and Andreas Wipf and Kurt Langfeld
Abstract: Spectral sums of the Dirac-Wilson operator and their relation to the Polyakov loop are thoroughly investigated. The approach by Gattringer is generalized to mode sums which reconstruct the Polyakov loop locally. This opens the possibility to study the mode sum approximation to the Polyakov loop correlator. The approach is re-derived for the ab initio continuum formulation of Yang-Mills theories, and the convergence of the mode sum is studied in detail. The mode sums are then explicitly calculated for the Schwinger model and SU(2) gauge theory in a homogeneous background field. Using SU(2) lattice gauge theory, the IR dominated mode sums are considered and the mode sum approximation to the static quark anti-quark potential is obtained numerically. We find a good agreement between the mode sum approximation and the static potential at large distances for the confinement and the high temperature plasma phase.
