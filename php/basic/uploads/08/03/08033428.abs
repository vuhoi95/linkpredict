Title: Geometric Phase for Neutral Particle in the Presence of a Topological  Defect
Authors: K. Bakke and J. R. Nascimento and C. Furtado
Abstract: In this paper we study the quantum dynamics of a neutral particle in the presence of a topological defect. We investigate the appearance of a geometric phase in the relativistic quantum dynamics of neutral particle which possesses permanent magnetic and electric dipole moments in the presence of an electromagnetic fields in this curved background. The nonrelativistic quantum dynamics are investigated using the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion. The gravitational Aharonov-Casher and He-Mckellar-Wilkens effects are investigated for a series of electric and magnetic fields configurations.
