Title: Dynamical noncommutativity and Noether theorem in twisted phi^*4 theory
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Leonardo Castellani and Marija Dimitrijevic
Abstract: A \star-product is defined via a set of commuting vector fields X_a = e_a^\mu (x) \partial_\mu, and used in a phi^*4 theory coupled to the e_a^\mu (x) fields. The \star-product is dynamical, and the vacuum solution phi =0, e_a^\mu (x)=delta_a^\mu reproduces the usual Moyal product. The action is invariant under rigid translations and Lorentz rotations, and the conserved energy-momentum and angular momentum tensors are explicitly derived.
