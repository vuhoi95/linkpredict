Title: Creating kinks from particles
Authors: Sourish Dutta and D. A. Steer and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We study the creation of solitons from particles, using the $\lambda \phi^4$ model as a prototype. We consider the scattering of small, identical, wave pulses, that are equivalent to a sequence of particles, and find that kink-antikink pairs are created for a large region in parameter space. We also find that scattering at {\it low} velocities is favorable for creating solitons that have large energy compared to the mass of a particle.
