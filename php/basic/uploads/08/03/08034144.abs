Title: Angular Momentum of a Brane-world Model
Authors: Bei Jia and Xi-Guo Lee and Peng-Ming Zhang
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the properties of the general covariant angular momentum of a five-dimensional brane-world model. Through calculating the total angular momentum of this model, we are able to analyze the properties of the total angular momentum in the inflationary RS model. We show that the space-like components of the total angular momentum of are all zero while the others are non-zero, which agrees with the results from ordinary RS model.
