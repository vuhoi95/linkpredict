Title: Resolution of Curvature Singularities in Higher Derivative Gravity
Authors: Philipp HÃ¶ffer v. Loewenfeld and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We consider possible resolutions of singularities in a contracting anisotropic universe for a class of higher derivative gravity theories. We give evidence that for our models the big crunch singularity may be replaced by a nearly flat Minkowski-like phase before the Universe reenters an anisotropic expansion in a time-symmetric manner.
