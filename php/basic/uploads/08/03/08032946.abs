Title: Higher-dimensional charged black holes solutions with a nonlinear  electrodynamics source
Authors: Mokhtar Hassaine and Cristian Martinez
Abstract: We obtain electrically charged black hole solutions of the Einstein equations in arbitrary dimensions with a nonlinear electrodynamics source. The matter source is deriving from a Lagrangian given by an arbitrary power of the Maxwell invariant. The form of the general solution suggests a natural partition for the different ranges of this power. For a particular range, we exhibit a class of solutions whose behavior resemble to the standard Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. There also exists a range for which the black hole solutions approach asymptotically the Minkowski spacetime slower than the Schwarzschild spacetime. We have also found a family of not asymptotically flat black hole solutions with an asymptotic behavior growing slower than the Schwarzschild (anti) de Sitter spacetime. In odd dimensions, there exists a critical value of the exponent for which the metric involves a logarithmic dependence. This critical value corresponds to the transition between the standard behavior and the solution decaying to Minkowski slower than the Schwarzschild spacetime.
