Title: Brane Inflation and Defect Formation
Authors: A. C. Davis and P. Brax and C. van de Bruck
Abstract: Brane inflation and the production of topological defects at the end of the inflationary phase are discussed. After a description of the inflationary setup we discuss the properties of the cosmic strings produced at the end of inflation. Specific examples of brane inflation are described: $D-\bar D$ inflation, $D3/D7$ inflation and modular inflation
