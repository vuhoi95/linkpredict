Title: Dense and Hot Holographic QCD: Finite Baryonic E Field
Authors: Keun-Young Kim and Sang-Jin Sin and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We investigate the response of dense and hot holographic QCD (hQCD) to a static and baryonic electric field E using the chiral model of Sakai and Sugimoto. Strong fields with E>(\sqrt\lambda M_{KK})^2 free quark pairs, causing the confined vacuum and matter state to decay. We generalize Schwinger's QED persistence function to dense hQCD. At high temperature and density, Ohm's law is derived generalizing a recent result by Karch and O'Bannon to the chiral case.
