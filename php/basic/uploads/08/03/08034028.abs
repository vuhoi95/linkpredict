Title: Finite Size Giant Magnon
Authors: Bojan Ramadanovic and Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: The quantization of the giant magnon away from the infinite size limit is discussed. We argue that this quantization inevitably leads to string theory on a Z_M-orbifold of S^5. This is shown explicitly and examined in detail in the near plane-wave limit.
