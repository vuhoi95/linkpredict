Title: Mapping out SU(5) GUTs with non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries
Authors: Florian Plentinger and Gerhart Seidl
Abstract: We construct a class of supersymmetric SU(5) GUT models that produce nearly tribimaximal lepton mixing, the observed quark mixing matrix, and the quark and lepton masses, from discrete non-Abelian flavor symmetries. The SU(5) GUTs are formulated on two five-dimensional throats in the flat limit and the neutrino masses become small due to the type-I seesaw mechanism. The discrete non-Abelian flavor symmetries are given by semi-direct products of cyclic groups that are broken at the infrared branes at the tip of the throats. As a result, we obtain SU(5) GUTs that provide a combined description of non-Abelian flavor symmetries and quark-lepton complementarity.
