Title: Conserved Quantities for Interacting Four Valent Braids in Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Jonahan Hackett and Yidun Wan
Abstract: We derive conservation laws from interactions of actively-interacting braid-like excitations of embedded framed spin networks in Quantum Gravity. Additionally we demonstrate that actively-interacting braid-like excitations interact in such a way that the product of interactions involving two actively-interacting braid-like excitations produces a resulting actively-interacting form.
