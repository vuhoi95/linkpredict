Title: Classical oscillator with position-dependent mass in a complex domain
Authors: Subir Ghosh and Sujoy Kumar Modak
Abstract: We study complexified Harmonic Oscillator with a position-dependent mass, termed as Complex Exotic Oscillator (CEO). The complexification induces a gauge invariance [19,11]. The role of PT -symmetry is discussed from the perspective of classical trajectories of CEO for real energy. Some trajectories of CEO are similar to those for the particle in a quartic potential in the complex domain [10, 32].
