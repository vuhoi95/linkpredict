Title: Reciprocity of gauge operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Valentina Forini
Abstract: A recently discovered generalized Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity holds for the anomalous dimensions of various twist operators in N=4 SYM. Here, we consider a class of scaling psu(2,2|4) operators that reduce at one-loop to twist-3 maximal helicity gluonic operators. We extract from the asymptotic long-range Bethe Ansatz a closed expression for the spin dependent anomalous dimension at four loop order and provide a complete proof of reciprocity. We comment about the interplay with possible, yet unknown, wrapping corrections.
