Title: Central Charge for AdS_2 Quantum Gravity
Authors: Thomas Hartman and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Two-dimensional Maxwell-dilaton quantum gravity on AdS_2 with radius $\ell$ and a constant electric field E is studied. In conformal gauge, this is equivalent to a CFT on a strip. In order to maintain consistent boundary conditions, the usual conformal diffeomorphisms must be accompanied by a certain U(1) gauge transformation. The resulting conformal transformations are generated by a twisted stress tensor, which has a central charge $c={3k E^2 \ell^4/4}$ where k is the level of the U(1) current. This is an AdS_2 analog of the Brown-Henneaux formula $c = 3\ell/2G$ for the central charge of quantum gravity on AdS_3.
