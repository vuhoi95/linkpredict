Title: The cosmological implications of a fundamental length: a DSR inspired  de-Sitter spacetime
Authors: N. Khosravi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We study a de-Sitter model in the framework of a Deformed Special Relativity (DSR) inspired structure. The effects of this framework appear as the existence of a fundamental length which influences the behavior of the scale factor. We show that such a deformation can either be used to control the unbounded growth of the scale factor in the present accelerating phase or account for the inflationary era in the early evolution of the universe.
