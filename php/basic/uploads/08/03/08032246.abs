Title: Charged Fermions Tunnelling from Kerr-Newman Black Holes
Authors: Ryan Kerner and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We consider the tunnelling of charged spin-(1/2) fermions from a Kerr-Newman black hole and demonstrate that the expected Hawking temperature is recovered. We discuss certain technical subtleties related to the obtention of this result.
