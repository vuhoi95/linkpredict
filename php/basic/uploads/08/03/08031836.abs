Title: Quantum gravity at a TeV and the renormalization of Newton's constant
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Stephen D. H. Hsu and David Reeb
Abstract: We examine whether renormalization effects can cause Newton's constant to change dramatically with energy, perhaps even reducing the scale of quantum gravity to the TeV region without the introduction of extra dimensions. We examine a model that realizes this possibility and describe experimental signatures from production of small black holes.
