Title: Non-anticommutative solitons
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: Certain supersymmetric sigma models in 2+1 dimensions feature multi-soliton solutions, with and without scattering. We subject these systems to a non-anticommutative deformation by replacing the Grassmann algebra of the odd superspace coordinates with a Clifford algebra. Static CP^1 and scattering U(2) solitons are constructed and carry an additional spin-1/2 degree of freedom due to the deformation. Abelian BPS solutions exist as well but have infinite action, in contrast to the Moyal case.
