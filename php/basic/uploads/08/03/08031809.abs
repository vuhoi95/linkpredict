Title: Pure Spinors for General Backgrounds
Authors: Pietro Fre' and Pietro Antonio Grassi
Abstract: We show the equivalence of the different types of pure spinor constraints geometrically derived from the Free Differential Algebras of N=2 d=10 supergravities. Firstly, we compute the general solutions of these constraints, using both a G_2 and an SO(8) covariant decomposition of the 10d chiral spinors. Secondly, we verify that the number of independent degrees of freedom is equal to that implied by the Poincare' pure spinor constraints so-far used for superstrings, namely twenty two. Thirdly, we show the equivalence between the FDA type IIA/B constraints among each other and with the Poincare' ones.
