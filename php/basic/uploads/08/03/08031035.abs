Title: Quantum field theory on the degenerate Moyal space
Authors: Harald Grosse and Fabien Vignes-Tourneret
Abstract: We prove that the self-interacting scalar field on the four-dimensional degenerate Moyal plane is renormalisable to all orders when adding a suitable counterterm to the Lagrangean. Despite the apparent simplicity of the model, it raises several non trivial questions. Our result is a first step towards the definition of renormalisable quantum field theories on a non-commutative Minkowski space.
