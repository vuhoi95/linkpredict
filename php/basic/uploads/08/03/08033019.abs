Title: Further discussion of Tomboulis' approach to the confinement problem
Authors: K. R. Ito and E. Seiler
Abstract: We discuss in some detail certain gaps and open problems in the recent paper by E. T. Tomboulis, which claims to give a rigorous proof of quark confinement in 4D lattice Yang-Mills theory for all values of the bare coupling. We also discuss what would be needed to fill the gaps in his proof.
