Title: Building an AdS/CFT superconductor
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and Christopher P. Herzog and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We show that a simple gravitational theory can provide a holographically dual description of a superconductor. There is a critical temperature, below which a charged condensate forms via a second order phase transition and the (DC) conductivity becomes infinite. The frequency dependent conductivity develops a gap determined by the condensate. We find evidence that the condensate consists of pairs of quasiparticles.
