Title: D-branes at multicritical points
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Dan Israel and Eliezer Rabinovici
Abstract: The moduli space of c=1 conformal field theories in two dimensions has a multicritical point, where a circle theory is equivalent to an orbifold theory. We analyse all the conformal branes in both descriptions of this theory, and find convincing evidence that the full brane spectrum coincides. This shows that the equivalence of the two descriptions at this multicritical point extends to the boundary sector. We also perform the analogous analysis for one of the multicritical points of the N=1 superconformal field theories at c=3/2. Again the brane spectra are identical for both descriptions, however the identification is more subtle.
