Title: Kerr-Taub-NUT Spacetime with Maxwell and Dilaton Fields
Authors: Alikram N. Aliev and Hakan Cebeci and Tekin Dereli
Abstract: We present an exact solution describing a stationary and axisymmetric object with electromagnetic and dilaton fields. The solution generalizes the usual Kerr-Taub-NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) spacetime in general relativity and is obtained by boosting this spacetime in the fifth dimension and performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction to four dimensions. We also discuss the physical parameters of this solution and calculate its gyromagnetic ratio.
