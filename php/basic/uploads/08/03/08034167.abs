Title: New twisted quantum deformations of D=4 super-Poincare algebra
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: We show how some classical r-matrices for the D=4 Poincare algebra can be supersymmetrized by an addition of part depending on odd supercharges. These r-matrices for D=4 super-Poincare algebra can be presented as a sum of the so-called subordinated r-matrices of super-Abelian and super-Jordanian type. Corresponding twists describing quantum deformations are obtained in an explicit form. These twists are the super-extensions of twists obtained in the paper arXiv:0712.3962.
