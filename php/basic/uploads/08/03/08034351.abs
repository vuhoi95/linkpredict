Title: Quantum Fields on the Groenewold-Moyal Plane
Authors: Earnest Akofor and A. P. Balachandran and Anosh Joseph
Abstract: We give an introductory review of quantum physics on the noncommutative spacetime called the Groenewold-Moyal plane. Basic ideas like star products, twisted statistics, second quantized fields and discrete symmetries are discussed. We also outline some of the recent developments in these fields and mention where one can search for experimental signals.
