Title: Warped generalized geometry compactifications, effective theories and  non-perturbative effects
Authors: P. Koerber and L. Martucci
Abstract: Summarizing the results of arXiv:0707.1038, we discuss the four-dimensional effective approach to type II N=1 supersymmetric flux compactifications with general SU(3)x SU(3)-structure. In particular, we study the effect of a non-trivial warp factor, which we argue leads naturally to a supergravity formulation invariant under local complexified Weyl transformations. We show that the full ten-dimensional supersymmetry equations can be obtained as F-flatness and D-flatness conditions from the superpotential and Kaehler potential. We then consider non-perturbative corrections to these supersymmetry conditions, following from adding instanton or gaugino condensation effects to the superpotential. As examples, we show how smeared instantons allow to understand the ten-dimensional geometry of KKLT-like AdS vacua and we give an explanation for the superpotential for "mobile" D3-branes in terms of a non-perturbatively induced generalized complex structure.
