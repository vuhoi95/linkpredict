Title: Triangle UD integrals in the position space
Authors: Igor Kondrashuk and Anatoly Kotikov
Abstract: We investigate triangle UD ladder integrals in the position space. The investigation is necessary to find an all-order in loop solution for an auxiliary Lcc correlator in Wess-Zumino-Landau gauge of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and to present correlators of dressed mean gluons in terms of it in all loops. We show that triangle UD ladder diagrams in the position space can be expressed in terms of the same UD functions Phi^(L) in terms of which they were represented in the momentum space, for an arbitrary number of rungs.
