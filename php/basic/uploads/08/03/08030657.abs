Title: Decoding the geometry of conformal field theories
Authors: Daniel Roggenkamp and Katrin Wendland
Abstract: To certain geometries, string theory associates conformal field theories. We discuss techniques to perform the reverse procedure: To recover geometrical data from abstractly defined conformal field theories. This is done by introducing appropriate notions of limits of conformal field theories and their degenerations, and by applying techniques from noncommutative geometry. This note is a summary of our work hep-th/0308143 , aimed to be less technical than the original paper, along with some new calculations confirming our interpretation of the rescaled limiting zero mode of the Virasoro field.
