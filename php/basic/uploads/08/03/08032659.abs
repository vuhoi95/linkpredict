Title: Covariant particle exchange for kappa-deformed theories in 1+1  dimensions
Authors: C. A. S. Young and R. Zegers
Abstract: We consider the exchange of identical scalar particles in theories with kappa-deformed Poincare symmetry. We argue that, at least in 1+1 dimensions, the symmetric group S_N can be realized on the space of N-particle states in a kappa-covariant fashion. For the case of two particles this realization is unique: we show that there is only one non-trivial intertwiner, which automatically squares to the identity.
