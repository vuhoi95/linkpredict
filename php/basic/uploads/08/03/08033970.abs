Title: Noncanonicaly Embedded Rational Map Soliton in Quantum SU(3) Skyrme  Model
Authors: D. Jurciukonis and E. Norvaisas
Abstract: The quantum Skyrme model is considered in non canonical bases SU(3) > SO(3) for the state vectors. A rational map ansatz is used to describe the soliton with the topological number bigger than one. The canonical quantization of the Lagrangian generates in Hamiltonian five different "moments of inertia" and negative quantum mass corrections, which can stabilize the quantum soliton solution. Explicit expressions of the quantum Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian are derived for this model soliton.
