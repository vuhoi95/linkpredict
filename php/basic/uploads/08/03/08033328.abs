Title: Killing-Yano Forms of a Class of Spherically Symmetric Space-Times II: A  Unified Generation of Higher Forms
Authors: O. Acik and U. Ertem and M. Onder and A. Vercin
Abstract: Killing-Yano (KY) two and three forms of a class of spherically symmetric space-times that includes the well-known Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Robertson-Walker and six different forms of de Sitter space-times as special cases are derived in a unified and exhaustive manner. It is directly proved that while the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom space-times do not accept any KY 3-form and they accept only one 2-form, the Robertson-Walker space-time admits four KY 2-forms and only one KY 3-form. Maximal number of KY-forms are obtained for Minkowski and all known forms of de Sitter space-times. Complete lists comprising explicit expressions of KY-forms are given.
