Title: Bound State Inequality for High Mass Exchanges in a Scalar Field Model
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: Ladder diagrams are relevant for the study of bound states. The condition upon the coupling strength for the existence of a bound state has been deduced in a scalar field theory for the case of low mass exchanges. We apply this approach to the case of very high mass exchanges.
