Title: Extremal vacuum black holes in higher dimensions
Authors: Pau Figueras and Hari K Kunduri and James Lucietti and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We consider extremal black hole solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations in dimensions greater than five. We prove that the near-horizon geometry of any such black hole must possess an SO(2,1) symmetry in a special case where one has an enhanced rotational symmetry group. We construct examples of vacuum near-horizon geometries using the extremal Myers-Perry black holes and boosted Myers-Perry strings. The latter lead to near-horizon geometries of black ring topology, which in odd spacetime dimensions have the correct number rotational symmetries to describe an asymptotically flat black object. We argue that a subset of these correspond to the near-horizon limit of asymptotically flat extremal black rings. Using this identification we provide a conjecture for the exact ``phase diagram'' of extremal vacuum black rings with a connected horizon in odd spacetime dimensions greater than five.
