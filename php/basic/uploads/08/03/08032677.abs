Title: $SQED_4$ and $QED_4$ on the null-plane
Authors: R. Casana and B. M. Pimentel and G. E. R. Zambrano
Abstract: We studied the scalar electrodynamics ($SQED_{4}$) and the spinor electrodynamics ($QED_{4}$) in the null-plane formalism. We followed the Dirac's technique for constrained systems to perform a detailed analysis of the constraint structure in both theories. We imposed the appropriated boundary conditions on the fields to fix the hidden subset first class constraints which generate improper gauge transformations and obtain an unique inverse of the second class constraint matrix. Finally, choosing the null-plane gauge condition, we determined the generalized Dirac brackets of the independent dynamical variables which via the correspondence principle give the (anti)-commutators for posterior quantization.
