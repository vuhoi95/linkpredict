Title: Helical Symmetry in Linear Systems
Authors: Jiri Bicak and Bernd G. Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate properties of solutions of the scalar wave equation and Maxwell's equations on Minkowski space with helical symmetry. Existence of local and global solutions with this symmetry is demonstrated with and without sources. The asymptotic properties of the solutions are analyzed. We show that the Newman--Penrose retarded and advanced scalars exhibit specific symmetries and generalized peeling properties.
