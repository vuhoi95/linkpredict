Title: On five-dimensional non-extremal charged black holes and FRW cosmology
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and V. Grass
Abstract: We consider static non-extremal charged black hole solutions in the context of N=2 gauged supergravity theories in five dimensions, and we show that they satisfy first-order flow equations. Then we analyze the motion of the dual brane in these black hole backgrounds. We express the entropy in terms of a Cardy-Verlinde-type formula, and we show that the equations describing the FRW cosmology on the brane have a form that is similar to the equations for the entropy and for the Casimir energy on the brane. We also briefly comment on the inclusion of a Gauss-Bonnet term in the analysis.
