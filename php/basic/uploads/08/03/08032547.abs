Title: Fermion evaporation of a black hole off a tense brane
Authors: H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Jason Doukas and Wade Naylor
Abstract: Using the WKBJ approximation we obtain numerical plots of the power emission spectrum for the evaporation of massless bulk Dirac fermions from six dimensional black holes off a tense 3-brane with codimension two. We also present the multiplicity factors for eigenvalues of the deficit four sphere and show that these reduce to the usual case in the tenseless limit.
