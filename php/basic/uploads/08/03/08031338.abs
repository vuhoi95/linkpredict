Title: Anomalies, effective action and Hawking temperatures of a Schwarzschild  black hole in the isotropic coordinates
Authors: Shuang-Qing Wu and Jun-Jin Peng and Zhan-Yue Zhao
Abstract: Motivated by the universality of Hawking radiation and that of the anomaly cancellation technique as well as that of the effective action method, we investigate the Hawking radiation of a Schwarzschild black hole in the isotropic coordinates via the cancellation of gravitational anomaly. After performing a dimensional reduction from the four-dimensional isotropic Schwarzschild metric, we show that this reduction procedure will, in general, result in two classes of two-dimensional effective metrics: the conformal equivalent and the inequivalent ones. For the physically equivalent class, the two-dimensional effective metric displays such a distinct feature that the determinant is not equal to the unity ($\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$), but also vanishes at the horizon, the latter of which possibly invalidates the anomaly analysis there. ... This is an updated version to replace our e-print arXiv:0709.0044 [hep-th]. Abstract is too long to exceed the limit of 24 lines by arXiv.
