Title: One-loop divergences in the two-dimensional non-anticommutative  supersymmetric sigma-model
Authors: I. Jack and R. Purdy
Abstract: We discuss the structure of the non-anticommutative N=2 non-linear sigma-model in two dimensions, constructing differential operators which implement the deformed supersymmetry generators and using them to reproduce the classical action. We then compute the one-loop quantum corrections and express them in a more compact form using the differential operators.
