Title: Baryons in the large N limit of the massive two-dimensional  Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model
Authors: Christian Boehmer and Felix Karbstein and Michael Thies
Abstract: Baryons in the massive Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions (the massive chiral Gross-Neveu model) are studied in the limit of an infinite number of flavors. The baryon mass is evaluated for a wide range of bare fermion masses and filling fractions, combining analytical asymptotic expansions with a full numerical Hartree-Fock calculation.
