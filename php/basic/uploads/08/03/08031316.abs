Title: Octonionic twists for supermembrane matrix models
Authors: Jens Hoppe and Douglas Lundholm and Maciej Trzetrzelewski
Abstract: A certain G_2 times U(1) invariant Hamiltonian arising from the standard membrane matrix model via conjugating any of the supercharges by a cubic, octonionic, exponential is proven to have a spectrum covering the whole positive half-axis. The model could be useful in determining a normalizable zero-energy state in the original SO(9) invariant SU(N) matrix model.
