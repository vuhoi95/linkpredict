Title: Spectral action on SU_q(2)
Authors: B. Iochum and C. Levy and A. Sitarz
Abstract: The spectral action on the equivariant real spectral triple over \A(SU_q(2)) is computed explicitly. Properties of the differential calculus arising from the Dirac operator are studied and the results are compared to the commutative case of the sphere S^3.
