Title: Aspects of Multiple Membranes
Authors: David S. Berman and Laura C. Tadrowski and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: This paper examines various aspects of the recently proposed theory of coincident membranes by Bagger and Lambert. These include the properties of open membranes and the resulting boundary theory with an interpretation in terms of the fivebrane and marginal supersymmetric deformations of the interactions with the relation to the holographic dual.
