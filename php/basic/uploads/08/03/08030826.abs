Title: Hierarchy Construction of Quantum Hall States and Non-Commutative  Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Zhao-Long Wang and Wei Huang and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: In this paper, we study the non-commutative Chern-Simons description of the hierarchy of quantum Hall states. Our method is based on the framework suggested by Susskind in hep-th/0101029. By using the area preserving diffeomorphism gauge symmetry of quasiparticle fluid, we show that non-commutative Chern-Simons description of the hierarchy construction of quantum Hall states with generic filling fraction can be realized in Susskind's approach. The relationship between our model and the pervious work on the effective field theory of quantum Hall states is also discussed.
