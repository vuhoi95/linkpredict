Title: Y-Formalism and Curved Beta-Gamma Systems
Authors: Pietro Antonio Grassi and Ichiro Oda and Mario Tonin
Abstract: We adopt the Y-formalism to study beta-gamma systems on hypersurfaces. We compute the operator product expansions of gauge-invariant currents and we discuss some applications of the Y-formalism to model on Calabi-Yau spaces.
