Title: AdS/CFT Duality for Non-Anticommutative Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Shou-Huang Dai and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We construct type IIB supergravity duals of non-anticommutative deformed N = 4 SU(N) gauge theories. We consider in particular deformations preserving N = (1,0) and N = (1/2,0) supersymmetry. Such theories can be realised on N D3-branes in specific self-dual 5-form backgrounds. We show that the required 5-form field strengths can be produced by configurations of intersecting D3-branes and we are then able to construct the supergravity solutions in the near-horizon limit. We consider some consequences of this duality, in particular showing that the gravity duals predict that the dimensions of a subset of BPS operators are not modified by the deformation.
