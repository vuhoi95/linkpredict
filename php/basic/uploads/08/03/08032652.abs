Title: Boundary monomers in the dimer model
Authors: Vyatcheslav B. Priezzhev and Philippe Ruelle
Abstract: The correlation functions of an arbitrary number of boundary monomers in the system of close-packed dimers on the square lattice are computed exactly in the scaling limit. The equivalence of the 2n-point correlation functions with those of a complex free fermion is proved, thereby reinforcing the description of the monomer-dimer model by a conformal free field theory with central charge c=1.
