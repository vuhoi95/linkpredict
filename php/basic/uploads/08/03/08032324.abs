Title: Interacting finite-size magnons
Authors: Thomas Klose and Tristan McLoughlin
Abstract: We explicitly construct a large class of finite-volume two-magnon string solutions moving on R x S^2. In particular, by making use of the relationship between the O(3) sigma model and sine-Gordon theory we are able to find solutions corresponding to the periodic analogues of magnon scattering and breather-like solutions. After semi-classically quantizing these solutions we invert the implicit expressions for the excitation energies in certain limits and find the corrections for the multi-magnon states. For the breather-like solutions we express the energies directly in terms of the action variable whereas for the scattering solution we express the result as a combination of corrections to the dispersion relation and to the scattering phase.
