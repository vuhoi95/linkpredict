Title: Instantons and Toric Quiver Gauge Theories
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Gabriele Ferretti and Christoffer Petersson
Abstract: We show how to construct the general action coupling (multi)instantons to gauge theories arising from branes probing arbitrary toric singularities. We give a general set of rules for how to construct such an action given the knowledge of the superpotential for the gauge theory. The main idea is to obtain the action by higgsing a theory whose instanton dynamics is known, namely an orbifold of N=4 super Yang-Mills. We find that the couplings of the fermionic zero-modes with the holomorphic fields are dictated by the structure of the superpotential describing the toric singularity. We present explicit examples such as the Suspended Pinch Point, the Conifold and the first three del Pezzo's. We perform various checks on these results by further higgsing to smaller orbifolds and present some applications, including both gauge theory and stringy instantons.
