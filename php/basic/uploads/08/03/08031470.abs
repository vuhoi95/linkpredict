Title: Gluon energy loss in the gauge-string duality
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Daniel R. Gulotta and Silviu S. Pufu and Fabio D. Rocha
Abstract: We estimate the stopping length of an energetic gluon in a thermal plasma of strongly coupled N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory by representing the gluon as a doubled string rising up out of the horizon.
