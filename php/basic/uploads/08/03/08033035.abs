Title: On the vacuum states for noncommutative gauge theory
Authors: Axel de Goursac and Jean-Christophe Wallet and Raimar Wulkenhaar
Abstract: Candidates for renormalisable gauge theory models on Moyal spaces constructed recently have non trivial vacua. We show that these models support vacuum states that are invariant under both global rotations and symplectic isomorphisms which form a global symmetry group for the action. We compute the explicit expression in the position space for these vacuum configurations in two and four dimensions.
