Title: Tensor gauge boson production in high energy collisions
Authors: Spyros Konitopoulos and Raffaele Fazio and George Savvidy
Abstract: We calculated the leading-order cross section for the helicity two tensor gauge bosons production in fermion pair annihilation process. We compare this cross section with a similar annihilation processes in QED with two photons in the final state and with two gluons in QCD.
