Title: A New Description of Cosmic Strings in Brane World Scenario
Authors: Yi-Shi Duan and Li-Da Zhang and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: In the light of $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, the structure of cosmic strings are obtained from the Abelian Higgs model, which is an effective description to the brane world cosmic string system. In this topological description of the cosmic string, combining the result of decomposition of U(1) gauge potential, we analytically reach the familiar conclusions that in the brane world scenario the magnetic flux of the cosmic string is quantized and the RR charge of it is screened.
