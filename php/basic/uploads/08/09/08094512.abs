Title: Conformal Field Theory as Microscopic Dynamics of Incompressible Euler  and Navier-Stokes Equations
Authors: Itzhak Fouxon and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamics of relativistic conformal field theories at finite temperature. We show that the limit of slow motions of the ideal hydrodynamics leads to the non-relativistic incompressible Euler equation. For viscous hydrodynamics we show that the limit of slow motions leads to the non-relativistic incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. We explain the physical reasons for the reduction and discuss the implications. We propose that conformal field theories provide a fundamental microscopic viewpoint of the equations and the dynamics governed by them.
