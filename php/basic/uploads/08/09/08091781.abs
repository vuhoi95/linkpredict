Title: Chiral Parametrization of QCD Vector Field in SU(3)
Authors: Victor Novozhilov and Yuri Novozhilov
Abstract: The chiral parametrization of gluons in SU(3) QCD is proposed extending an approach developed earlier for SU(2) case. A color chiral field is introduced, gluons are chirally rotated, and vector component of rotated gluons is defined on condition that no new color variables appeared with the chiral field. This condition associates such a vector component with SU(3)/U(2) coset plus an U(2) field. The topological action in SU(3) QCD is derived. It is expressed in terms of axial vector component of rotated gluons. The vector field in CP^2 sector is studied in new variables of chiral parametrization.
