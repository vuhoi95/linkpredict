Title: Algebraic solutions of the sixth Painleve equation
Authors: Oleg Lisovyy and Yuriy Tykhyy
Abstract: We describe all finite orbits of an action of the extended modular group $\bar{\Lambda}$ on conjugacy classes of SL(2,C)-triples. The result is used to classify all algebraic solutions of the general Painleve VI equation up to parameter equivalence.
