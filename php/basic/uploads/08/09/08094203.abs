Title: Induced gravity and gauge interactions revisited
Authors: Bogusław Broda and Michał Szanecki
Abstract: It has been shown that the primary, old-fashioned idea of Sakharov's induced gravity and gauge interactions, in the "one-loop dominance" version, works astonishingly well yielding phenomenologically reasonable results. As a byproduct, the issue of the role of the UV cutoff in the context of the induced gravity has been reexamined (an idea of self-cutoff induced gravity). As an additional check, the black hole entropy has been used in the place of the action. Finally, it has been explicitly shown that the induced coupling constants of gauge interactions of the standard model assume qualitatively realistic values.
