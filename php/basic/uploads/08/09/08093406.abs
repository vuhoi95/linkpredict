Title: Quantum scale invariance, cosmological constant and hierarchy problem
Authors: Mikhail Shaposhnikov and Daniel Zenhausern
Abstract: We construct a class of theories which are scale invariant on quantum level in all orders of perturbation theory. In a subclass of these models scale invariance is spontaneously broken, leading to the existence of a massless dilaton. The applications of these results to the problem of stability of the electroweak scale against quantum corrections, to the cosmological constant problem and to dark energy are discussed.
