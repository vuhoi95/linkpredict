Title: Solving non-abelian loop Toda equations
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: We construct soliton solutions for non-abelian loop Toda equations associated with general linear groups. Here we consider the untwisted case only and use the rational dressing method based upon appropriate block-matrix representation suggested by the initial $\bbZ$-gradation.
