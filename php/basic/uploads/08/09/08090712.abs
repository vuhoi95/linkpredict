Title: Small AdS black holes from SYM
Authors: Curtis T. Asplund and David Berenstein
Abstract: We provide a characterization of the set of configurations in N=4 SYM theory that are dual to small AdS black holes. Our construction shows that the black hole dual states are approximately thermal on a SU(M) subset of degrees of freedom of a SU(N) gauge theory. M is determined dynamically and the black hole degrees of freedom are dynamically insulated from the rest. These states are localized on the S^5 and have dynamical processes that correspond to matter absorption that make them behave as black objects.
