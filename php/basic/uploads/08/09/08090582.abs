Title: Dark consequences from light neutrino condensations
Authors: Raul Horvat and Peter Minkowski and Josip Trampetic
Abstract: In this paper we discuss light neutrino dipole moments, computed in the neutrino-mass extended standard model (SM), as a possible source for neutrino condensates which may cause cosmological constant observed today.
