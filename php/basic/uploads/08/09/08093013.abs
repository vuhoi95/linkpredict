Title: Vacuum energies due to delta-like currents: simulating classical objects  along branes with arbitrary codimensions
Authors: F. A. Barone and G. Flores-Hidalgo
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum energies of several models of quantum fields interacting with static external currents (linear couplings) concentrated along parallel branes with an arbitrary number of codimensions. We show that we can simulate the presence of static charges distributions as well as the presence of classical static dipoles in any dimension for massive and massless fields. We also show that we can produce confining potentials with massless self interacting scalar fields as well as long range anisotropic potentials.
