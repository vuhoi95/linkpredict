Title: Phase Transitions and Moduli Space Topology
Authors: D. D. Ferrante and G. S. Guralnik
Abstract: By means of an appropriate re-scaling of the metric in a Lagrangian, we are able to reduce it to a kinetic term only. This form enables us to examine the extended complexified solution set (complex moduli space) of field theories by finding all possible geodesics of this metric. This new geometrical standpoint sheds light on some foundational issues of QFT and brings to the forefront non-perturbative core aspects of field theory. In this process, we show that different phases of the theory are topologically inequivalent, i.e., their moduli space has distinct topologies. Moreover, the different phases are related by "duality transformations", which are established by the modular structure of the theory. In conclusion, after the topological structure is elucidated, it is possible to use the Euler Characteristic in order to topologically quantize the theory, in resonance with the content of the Atiyah-Singer Index theorem.
