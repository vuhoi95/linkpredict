Title: Hall-Littlewood plane partitions and KP
Authors: O Foda and M Wheeler
Abstract: MacMahon's classic generating function of random plane partitions, which is related to Schur polynomials, was recently extended by Vuletic to a generating function of weighted plane partitions that is related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials, S(t), and further to one related to Macdonald polynomials, S(t,q). Using Jing's 1-parameter deformation of charged free fermions, we obtain a Fock space derivation of the Hall-Littlewood extension. Confining the plane partitions to a finite s-by-s square base, we show that the resulting generating function, S_{s-by-s}(t), is an evaluation of a tau-function of KP.
