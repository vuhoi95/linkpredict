Title: Principal Chiral Model on Superspheres
Authors: Vladimir Mitev and Thomas Quella and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of the principal chiral model (PCM) on odd-dimensional superspheres as a function of the curvature radius R. For volume-filling branes on S^{3|2}, we compute the exact boundary spectrum as a function of R. The extension to higher dimensional superspheres is discussed, but not carried out in detail. Our results provide very convincing evidence in favor of the strong-weak coupling duality between supersphere PCMs and OSP(2S+2|2S) Gross-Neveu models that was recently conjectured by Candu and Saleur in arXiv:0801.0444.
