Title: Quantum deformations of Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter  spacetimes
Authors: Ding Wang and R. B. Zhang and Xiao Zhang
Abstract: A quantum Schwarzschild spacetime and a quantum Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime with cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are constructed within the framework of a noncommutative Riemannian geometry developed in an earlier publication. The metrics and curvatures of the quantum Schwarzschild spacetime and the quantum Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime are computed. It is shown that up to the second order in the deformation parameter, the quantum spacetimes are solutions of a noncommutative Einstein equation which is proposed in this paper.
