Title: D-brane worlds and the cosmological constant
Authors: P. Gusin and J. Warczewski
Abstract: The cosmological constant on a D-brane is analyzed. This D-brane is in the background produced by the p-brane solutions. The energy-momentum tensor in this model has been found and the form of the cosmological constant has been derived. This energy-momentum tensor is interpreted as an energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid on the D-brane. The energy density and the pressure for this fluid have been derived. As it turned out the pressure is negative but the speed of sound is real.
