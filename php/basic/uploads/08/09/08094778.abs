Authors: Toshiaki Fujimori and Koh Iwasaki and Yoshishige Kobayashi and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study a class of classical solutions of three-dimensional N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory coupled with U(N) \times U(N) bi-fundamental matter fields. Especially, time evolutions of fuzzy spheres are discussed for both massless and massive cases. For the massive case, there are a variety of solutions having different behaviors according to the value of the mass. In addition to the time-dependent solutions, we analyze non-BPS static solutions which represent parallel M5/M5 or M5/anti-M5-branes suspended by multiple M2-branes. These solutions are similar to the fundamental strings connecting two parallel (anti) Dp-branes in perturbative string theory. A moving M5-brane and domain wall solutions with constant velocity that are obtained by the Lorentz boost of the known BPS solutions are briefly addressed.
