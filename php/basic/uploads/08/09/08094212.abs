Title: Hopf algebras for ternary algebras
Authors: M. Goze and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: We construct an universal enveloping algebra associated to the ternary extension of Lie (super)algebras called Lie algebra of order three. A Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem is proven is this context. It this then shown that this universal enveloping algebra can be endowed with a structure of Hopf algebra. The study of the dual of the universal enveloping algebra enables to define the parameters of the transformation of a Lie algebra of order three. It turns out that these variables are the variables which generate the three-exterior algebra.
