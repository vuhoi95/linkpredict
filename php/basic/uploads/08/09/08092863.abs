Title: Supersymmetric Wilson Loops in N=6 Super Chern-Simons-matter theory
Authors: Bin Chen and Jun-Bao Wu
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Wilson loop operators in ABJM theory from both sides of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence. We first construct some supersymmetric Wilson loops. The perturbative computations are performed in the field theory side at the first two orders. A fundamental string solution ending on a circular loop is also studied.
