Title: Bogomol'nyi Bounds for Gravitational Cosmic Strings
Authors: Anne-Christine Davis and Senthooran Rajamanoharan
Abstract: We present a new method for finding lower bounds on the energy of topological cosmic string solutions in gravitational field theories. This new method produces bounds that are valid over the entire space of solutions, unlike the traditional approach, where the bounds obtained are only valid for cylindrically symmetric solutions. This method is shown to be a generalisation of the well-known Bogomol'nyi procedure for non-gravitational theories and as such, it can be used to find gravitational Bogomol'nyi bounds for models wherever the traditional Bogomol'nyi procedure can be applied in the non-gravitational limit. Furthermore, this method yields Bogomol'nyi equations that do not rule out the existence of asymmetric bound-saturating solutions.
