Title: Stochastic tunneling for strongly non-Gaussian inflationary theories
Authors: Andrew J. Tolley and Mark Wyman
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of stochastic or thermal tunneling in theories like Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation that have non-minimal kinetic terms and, as a result, strongly non-Gaussian perturbations. We first describe a local description of the tunneling process which gives results consistent with the standard Hawking-Moss tunneling. This result is under perturbative control as long as the fluctuation determinant is well approximated by a one-loop integral. We then move to a global description, using the methodology of stochastic inflation and the in-in path integral formalism. This approach shows clearly that the tunneling process becomes strongly coupled whenever the sound speed of the tunneling trajectory departs sufficiently from unity. We argue that these two very different perspectives are nevertheless consistent, and may imply the existence of a simple resummation of the strongly coupled interactions of the field.
