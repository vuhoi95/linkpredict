Title: Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Vacuum Alignment on Orbifolds
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Yuji Omura and Koichi Yoshioka
Abstract: Flavor symmetry has been widely studied for figuring out the masses and mixing angles of standard-model fermions. In this paper we present a framework for handling flavor symmetry breaking where the symmetry breaking is triggered by boundary conditions of scalar fields in extra-dimensional space. The alignment of scalar expectation values is achieved without referring to any details of scalar potential and its minimization procedure. As applications to non-abelian discrete flavor symmetries, illustrative lepton mass models are constructed where the S3 and A4 flavor symmetries are broken down to the directions leading to the tri-bimaximal form of lepton mixing and realistic mass patterns.
