Title: Fermion states on domain wall junctions and the flavor number
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and R. C. Fonseca
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of localizing fermion states on stable domain walls junctions. The study focus on the consequences of intersecting six independent 8d domain walls to form 4d junctions in a ten-dimensional spacetime. This is related to the mechanism of relaxing to three space dimensions through the formation of domain wall junctions. The model is based on six bulk real scalar fields, the phi-4 model in its broken phase, the prototype of the Higgs field, and is such that the fermion and scalar modes bound to the domain walls are the zero mode and a single massive bound state, which can be regarded as a two level system, at least at sufficiently low energy. Inside the junction, we use the fact that some states are statistically more favored to address the possibility of constraining the flavor number of the elementary fermions.
