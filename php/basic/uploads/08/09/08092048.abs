Title: Stability of higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-anti-de Sitter black  holes
Authors: R. A. Konoplya and A. Zhidenko
Abstract: We investigate stability of the D-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-anti-de-Sitter metrics as solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We have shown that asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes are dynamically stable for all values of charge and anti-de Sitter radius in $D=5,6...11$ dimensional space-times. This does not contradict to dynamical instability of RN-AdS black holes found by Gubser in $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauged supergravity, because the latter instability comes from the tachyon mode of the scalar field, coupled to the system. Asymptotically AdS black holes are known to be thermodynamically unstable for some region of parameters, yet, as we have shown here, they are stable against gravitational perturbations.
