Title: Truncated Heat Kernel and One-Loop Determinants for the BTZ Geometry
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and M. E. X. Guimaraes
Abstract: There is a special relation between the spectrum and the {\it truncated} heat kernel of the Euclidean BTZ black hole with the Patterson-Selberg zeta function. Using an orbifold description of this relation we calculate the on-shell corrections of the gravitational quantum fluctuations.
