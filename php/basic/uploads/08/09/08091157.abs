Title: Constraints on "rare" dyon decays
Authors: Sunil Mukhi and Rahul Nigam
Abstract: We obtain the complete set of constraints on the moduli of N=4 superstring compactifications that permit "rare" marginal decays of 1/4-BPS dyons to take place. The constraints are analysed in some special cases. The analysis extends in a straightforward way to multi-particle decays. We discuss the possible relation between general multi-particle decays and multi-centred black holes.
