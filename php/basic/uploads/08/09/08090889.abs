Title: Rainbow statistics
Authors: Michele Arzano and Dario Benedetti
Abstract: Non-commutative quantum field theories and their global quantum group symmetries provide an intriguing attempt to go beyond the realm of standard local quantum field theory. A common feature of these models is that the quantum group symmetry of their Hilbert spaces induces additional structure in the multiparticle states which reflects a non-trivial momentum-dependent statistics. We investigate the properties of this "rainbow statistics" in the particular context of $\kappa$-quantum fields and discuss the analogies/differences with models with twisted statistics.
