Title: Giant Magnons and Spiky Strings on S^3 with B-field
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Jia-Hao Tsai and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We study solutions for a rotating string on S^3 with a background NS-NS B-field and show the existence of spiky string and giant magnon as two limiting solutions. We make a connection to the sine-Gordon model via the Polyakov worldsheet action and study the effect of B-field. In particular, we find the magnon solution can be mapped to the excitation of a fractional spin chain. We conjecture a B-deformed SYM to be the gauge theory dual to this background.
