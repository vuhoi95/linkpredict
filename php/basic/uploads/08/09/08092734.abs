Title: Boundary Lax pairs for the $A_{n}^{(1)}$ Toda field theories
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou
Abstract: Based on the recent formulation of a general scheme to construct boundary Lax pairs,we develop this systematic construction for the $A_n^{(1)}$ affine Toda field theories (ATFT). We work out explicitly the first two models of the hierarchy, i.e. the sine-Gordon ($A_1^{(1)}$) and the $A_2^{(1)}$ models. The $A_2^{(1)}$ Toda theory is the first non-trivial example of the hierarchy that exhibits two distinct types of boundary conditions. We provide here novel expressions of boundary Lax pairs associated to both types of boundary conditions.
