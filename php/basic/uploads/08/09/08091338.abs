Title: Renormalization Group and Effective Potential in Classically Conformal  Theories
Authors: Krzysztof A. Meissner and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We derive a general formula for the RG improved effective (Coleman-Weinberg) potential for classically conformal models, applying it to several examples of physical interest, and in particular a model of QCD coupled via quarks to a colorless scalar field. The closed form expressions allow us to discuss the range of validity of the effective potential as well as the issue of `large logarithms' in a way different from previous such analyses. Remarkably, in all examples considered, convexity of the effective potential is restored by the RG improvement, or otherwise the potential becomes unstable. In the former case, symmetry breaking becomes unavoidable due to the appearance of an infrared barrier $\Lambda_{IR}$, which hints at a so far unsuspected link between $\Lambda_{QCD}$ and the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking.
