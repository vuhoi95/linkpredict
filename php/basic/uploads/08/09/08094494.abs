Title: Supercurrent: Vector Hair for an AdS Black Hole
Authors: Pallab Basu and Anindya Mukherjee and Hsien-Hang Shieh
Abstract: In arXiv:0803.3295 [hep-th] a holographic black hole solution is discussed which exhibits a superconductor like transition. In the superconducting phase the black holes show infinite DC conductivity. This gives rise to the possibility of deforming the solutions by turning on a time independent current (supercurrent), without any electric field. This type of deformation does not exist for normal (non-superconducting) black holes, due to the no-hair theorems. In this paper we have studied such a supercurrent solution and the associated phase diagram. Interestingly, we have found a "special point" (critical point) in the phase diagram where the second order superconducting phase transition becomes first order. Supercurrent in superconducting materials is a well studied phenomenon in condensed matter systems. We have found some qualitative agreement with known results.
