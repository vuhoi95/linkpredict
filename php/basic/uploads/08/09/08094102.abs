Title: Modulus stabilization of generalized Randall Sundrum model with bulk  scalar field
Authors: Ratna Koley and Joydip Mitra and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We study the stabilization of inter-brane spacing modulus of generalized warped brane models with a nonzero brane cosmological constant. Employing Goldberger-Wise stabilization prescription of brane world models with a bulk scalar field, we show that the stabilized value of the modulus generally depends on the value of the brane cosmological constant. Our result further reveals that the stabilized modulus value corresponding to a vanishingly small cosmological constant can only resolve the gauge hierarchy problem simultaneously. This in turn vindicates the original Randall-Sundrum model where the 3-brane cosmological constant was chosen to be zero.
