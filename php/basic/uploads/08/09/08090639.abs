Title: The Flavor Group Delta(6n^2)
Authors: J. A. Escobar and Christoph Luhn
Abstract: Many non-Abelian finite subgroups of SU (3) have been used to explain the flavor structure of the Standard Model. In order to systematize and classify successful models, a detailed knowledge of their mathematical structure is necessary. In this paper we shall therefore look closely at the series of finite non-Abelian groups known as Delta(6n^2), its smallest members being S3 (n = 1) and S4 (n = 2). For arbitrary n, we determine the conjugacy classes, the irreducible representations, the Kronecker products as well as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
