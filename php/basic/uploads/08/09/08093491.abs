Title: Modified Chaplygin Gas as Scalar Field and Holographic Dark Energy Model
Authors: B. C. Paul and P. Thakur and A. Saha
Abstract: We study the correspondence between field theoretic and holographic dark energy density of the universe with the modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) respectively both in a flat and non-flat FRW universe. We present an equivalent representation of the MCG with a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field by constructing the corresponding potential. A new scalar field potential is obtained here which is physically realistic and important for cosmological model building. In addition we also present holographic dark energy model described by the MCG. The dynamics of the corresponding holographic dark energy field is determined by reconstructing the potential in a non-flat universe. The stability of the holographic dark energy in this case in a non-flat universe is also discussed.
