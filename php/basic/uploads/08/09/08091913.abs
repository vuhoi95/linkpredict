Title: Correction to the Running of Gauge Couplings out of Extra Dimensional  Gravity
Authors: Feng Wu and Ming Zhong
Abstract: We study the gravitational correction to the gauge couplings in the extra dimension model where the gravity propagates in the (4+n)-dimensional bulk. We show by explicit calculation in the background field method that the one-loop correction coming from graviton Kaluza-Klein states is nontrivial and tends to make the theory anti-asymptotically free. For the theory characterized with asymptotic freedom, the correction will induce a nontrivial UV-stable fixed point. This may lead to an interesting possibility that the non-abelian gauge coupling constants $g_2$ and $g_3$ in the SM and that of the gravity $g_{\kappa}$ unify at the fixed point in the limit of high energy scale.
