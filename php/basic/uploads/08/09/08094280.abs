Title: Variational Formulation for Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: C. A. M. de Melo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: A quaternionic version of Quantum Mechanics is constructed using the Schwinger's formulation based on measurements and a Variational Principle. Commutation relations and evolution equations are provided, and the results are compared with other formulations.
