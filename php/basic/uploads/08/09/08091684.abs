Title: Coherent states approach to Penning trap
Authors: David J Fernandez C and Mercedes Velazquez
Abstract: By using a matrix technique, which allows to identify directly the ladder operators, the Penning trap coherent states are derived as eigenstates of the appropriate annihilation operators. These states are compared with the ones obtained through the displacement operator. The associated wave functions and mean values for some relevant operators in these states are also evaluated. It turns out that the Penning trap coherent states minimize the Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
