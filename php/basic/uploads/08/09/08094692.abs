Title: Exchange Interactions and Principle of Minimal Energy in Relativistic  Schroedinger Theory
Authors: M. Mattes and M. Sorg
Abstract: The principle of minimal energy, which has been set up in the preceding papers for systems of non-identical particles (e.g. positronium), is now generalized to include also identical particles. Since the latter kind of particles feels also the exchange forces (besides the usual electromagnetic forces), one has to deal with non-zero exchange potentials which render the theory nonlinear, according to the non-Abelian character of Relativistic Schroedinger Theory (RST). However, the present extension of the variational principle refers only to the linearized version of RST in order to keep the calculations sufficiently simple. It is also demonstrated that in RST the Dirac particles can occur in fermionic and bosonic quantum states; and the mathematical and physical consistency of the variational principle is validated for both types of states (concretely the fermionic hydrogen state 2p_3/2 and the bosonic positronium state 2^1P_1).
