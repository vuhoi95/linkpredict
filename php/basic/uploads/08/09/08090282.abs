Title: Fermion-Fermion Bound State Condition for Scalar Exchanges
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: The condition for the existence of a bound state between two fermions exchanging massive scalars is derived. For low scalar mass, we reproduce the scalar field model result. The high scalar mass result exhibits a somewhat different inequality condition.
