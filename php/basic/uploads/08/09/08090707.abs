Title: CCNV Spacetimes and (Super)symmetries
Authors: A. Coley and D. McNutt and N. Pelavas
Abstract: It is of interest to study supergravity solutions preserving a non-minimal fraction of supersymmetries. A necessary condition for supersymmetry to be preserved is that the spacetime admits a Killing spinor and hence a null or timelike Killing vector. Spacetimes admitting a covariantly constant null vector (CCNV), and hence a null Killing vector, belong to the Kundt class. We investigate the existence of additional isometries in the class of higher-dimensional CCNV Kundt metrics.
