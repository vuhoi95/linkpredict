Title: Large Extra Dimensions and Holography
Authors: Chao Cao and Yi-Xin Chen
Abstract: The holographic principle asserts that the entropy of a system cannot exceed its boundary area in Planck units. However, conventional quantum field theory fails to describe such systems. In this Letter, we assume the existence of large $n$ extra dimensions and propose a relationship between UV and IR cutoffs in this case. We find that if $n=2$, this effective field theory could be a good description of holographic systems. If these extra dimensions are detected in future experiments, it will help to prove the validity of the holographic principle. We also discuss implications for the cosmological constant problem.
