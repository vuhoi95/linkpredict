Title: Harmonic functions and instanton moduli spaces on the multi-Taub--NUT  space
Authors: Gabor Etesi and Szilard Szabo
Abstract: Explicit construction of the basic SU(2) anti-instantons over the multi-Taub--NUT geometry via the classical conformal rescaling method is exhibited. These anti-instantons satisfiy the so-called weak holonomy condition at infinity with respect to the trivial flat connection and decay rapidly. The resulting unital energy anti-instantons have trivial holonomy at infinity. We also fully describe their unframed moduli space and find that it is a five dimensional space admitting a singular disk-fibration over R^3. On the way, we work out in detail the twistor space of the multi-Taub--NUT geometry together with its real structure and transform our anti-instantons into holomorphic vector bundles over the twistor space. In this picture we are able to demonstrate that our construction is complete in the sense that we have constructed a full connected component of the moduli space of solutions of the above type. We also prove that anti-instantons with arbitrary high integer energy exist on the multi-Taub--NUT space.
