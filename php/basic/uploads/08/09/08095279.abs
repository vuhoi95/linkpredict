Abstract: We explain how the redefinitions of supermultiplet component fields, comprising what we call "frame shifts", can be used in conjuction with the graphical technology of multiplet Adkinras to render manifest the reducibility of off-shell representations of supersymmetry. This technology speaks to possibility of organizing multiplet constraints in a way which complements and extends the possibilities afforded by superspace methods.
