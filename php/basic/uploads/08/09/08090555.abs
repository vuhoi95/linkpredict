Title: Topological Black Holes in Brans-Dicke-Maxwell Theory
Authors: A. Sheykhi and H. Alavirad
Abstract: We derive a new analytic solution of $(n+1)$-dimensional Brans-Dikce-Maxwell theory in the presence of a potential for the scalar field, by applying a conformal transformation to the dilaton gravity theory. These solutions describe topological charged black holes with unusual asymptotics. We obtain the conserved and thermodynamic quantities through the use of the Euclidean action method. We also study the thermodynamics of the solutions and verify that the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the solutions satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics.
