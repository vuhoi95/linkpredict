Title: Flow Equation for Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Franziska Synatschke and Georg Bergner and Holger Gies and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: We study supersymmetric quantum mechanics with the functional RG formulated in terms of an exact and manifestly off-shell supersymmetric flow equation for the effective action. We solve the flow equation nonperturbatively in a systematic super-covariant derivative expansion and concentrate on systems with unbroken supersymmetry. Already at next-to-leading order, the energy of the first excited state for convex potentials is accurately determined within a 1% error for a wide range of couplings including deeply nonperturbative regimes.
