Title: Dark energy and particle mixing
Authors: A. Capolupo and S. Capozziello and G. Vitiello
Abstract: We show that the vacuum condensate due to particle mixing is responsible of a dynamically evolving dark energy. In particular, we show that values of the adiabatic index close to -1 for vacuum condensates of neutrinos and quarks imply, at the present epoch, contributions to the vacuum energy compatible with the estimated upper bound on the dark energy.
