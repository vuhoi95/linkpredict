Title: Boundary S-matrix in a (2,0) theory of AdS_{3} Supergravity
Authors: Payal Kaura and Bindusar Sahoo
Abstract: We will discuss two inequivalent generalizations of the standard (2,0) supergravity action gr-qc/9501018 to include gravitational Chern-Simons term. One is in the first order formalism where we treat \omega_{M}^{ab} as independent and the other is in the second order formalism where \omega_{M}^{ab} is determined in terms of other fields via a standard constraint equation. The two theories have different equations of motion and the solutions to the equations of motion of the first order theory spans only a subset of those of the second order theory. We will be interested in computing the boundary S-matrix, describing correlation functions in a dual conformal field theory, in this sector and hence we use the equations of motion coming out of the first order theory. We restrict ourselves to the gauge+fermionic sector of the theory to compute the boundary S-matrix. We will also look at the effect of higher derivative terms on the boundary S-matrix obtained using the standard supergravity action.
