Title: A new perspective in the dark energy puzzle from particle mixing  phenomenon
Authors: M. Blasone and A. Capolupo and S. Capozziello and G. Vitiello
Abstract: We report on recent results on particle mixing and oscillations in quantum field theory. We discuss the role played in cosmology by the vacuum condensate induced by the neutrino mixing phenomenon. We show that it can contribute to the dark energy of the universe.
