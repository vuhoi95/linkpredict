Title: Non-commutative Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Ashok Das and H. Falomir and J. Gamboa and F. Mendez
Abstract: General non-commutative supersymmetric quantum mechanics models in two and three dimensions are constructed and some two and three dimensional examples are explicitly studied. The structure of the theory studied suggest other possible applications in physical systems with potentials involving spin and non-local interactions.
