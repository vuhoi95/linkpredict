Title: From isospin generators to BRST quantization of higher spin massless  fields
Authors: J. Alfaro and M. Cambiaso
Abstract: Motivated by construction of isospin generators in particle physics (built form the SU(2) algebra), we find an equivalence between the algebra of these generators and those of the Virasoro algebra. The form of the starting generators is fixed and in order to obtain a full equivalence we introduce a new matrix product. The Cartan structure of the starting algebra is reproduced for the Virasoro-like case and a natural BRST quantization as in String Field Theory is ``induced'' in the Fock space of the creation/annihilation operators. Following this procedure, we find a rather trivial Lie algebra form which we obtain a gauge theory of an infinity on non-interacting massless particles of arbitrary integer spin and symmetry. Among others we find the free Maxwell field, the free (linearized) gravitational field and also the axion field with their appropriate gauge transformations.
