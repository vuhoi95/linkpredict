Title: Gauged supersymmetries in Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Matthieu Tissier and Nicolas Wschebor
Abstract: In this paper we show that Yang-Mills theory in the Curci-Ferrari-Delbourgo-Jarvis gauge admits some up to now unknown local linear Ward identities. These identities imply some non-renormalization theorems with practical simplifications for perturbation theory. We show in particular that all renormalization factors can be extracted from two-point functions. The Ward identities are shown to be related to supergauge transformations in the superfield formalism for Yang-Mills theory. The case of non-zero Curci-Ferrari mass is also addressed.
