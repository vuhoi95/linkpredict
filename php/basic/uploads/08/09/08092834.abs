Title: Dominance of Sign Geometry and the Homogeneity of the Fundamental  Topological Structure
Authors: Ivan Horvath and Andrei Alexandru and Thomas Streuer
Abstract: We propose and support the possibility that the shape of topological density 2-point function in pure-glue QCD is crucially, and possibly entirely, determined by the space-time folding (geometry) of the double-sheet sign-coherent structure of Ref.[1], while the distribution of topological density within individual sheets only determines the overall magnitude of the correlator at finite physical distances. A specific manifestation of this, discussed here, is that the shape of the correlation function (encoding e.g. the masses of pseudoscalar glueballs) is reproduced upon the replacement q(x) -> sgn(q(x)), i.e. by considering the double sheet of the same space-time geometry but with constant magnitude of topological density. Combined with previous results on the fundamental topological structure, this suggests that a collective degree of freedom describing topological fluctuations of QCD vacuum can be viewed as a global space-filling homogeneous double membrane. Selected possibilities for practical uses of this are discussed.
