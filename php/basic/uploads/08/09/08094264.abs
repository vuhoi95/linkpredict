Title: Holographic Description of AdS_2 Black Holes
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Daniel Grumiller and Finn Larsen and Robert McNees
Abstract: We develop the holographic renormalization of AdS_2 gravity systematically. We find that a bulk Maxwell term necessitates a boundary mass term for the gauge field and verify that this unusual term is invariant under gauge transformations that preserve the boundary conditions. We determine the energy-momentum tensor and the central charge, recovering recent results by Hartman and Strominger. We show that our expressions are consistent with dimensional reduction of the AdS_3 energy-momentum tensor and the Brown--Henneaux central charge. As an application of our results we interpret the entropy of AdS_2 black holes as the ground state entropy of a dual CFT.
