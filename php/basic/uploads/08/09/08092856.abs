Title: Restoration of supersymmetry on the lattice: Two-dimensional  $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Issaku Kanamori and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: By numerically investigating the conservation law of the supercurrent, we confirm the restoration of supersymmetry in Sugino's lattice formulation of the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with a scalar mass term. Subtlety in the case without the scalar mass term, that appears to ruin perturbative power counting, is also pointed out.
