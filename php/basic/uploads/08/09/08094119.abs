Title: Luscher Term for k-string Potential from Holographic One Loop  Corrections
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Vincent G. J. Rodgers and Kory Stiffler
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of k-strings in the framework of the gauge/gravity correspondence. We discuss the Klebanov-Strassler supergravity background which is known to be dual to a confining supersymmetric gauge theory with chiral symmetry breaking. We obtain the k-string tension in agreement with expectations of field theory. Our main new result is the study of one-loop corrections on the string theoretic side. We explicitly find the frequency spectrum for both the bosons and the fermions for quadratic fluctuations about the classical supergravity solution. Further we use the massless modes to compute 1/L contributions to the one loop corrections to the k-string energy. This corresponds to the Luscher term contribution to the k-string potential on the gauge theoretic side of the correspondence.
