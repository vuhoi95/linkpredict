Title: Quintom model with O($N$) symmetry
Authors: M. R. Setare and E. N. Saridakis
Abstract: We investigate the quintom model of dark energy in the generalized case where the corresponding canonical and phantom fields possess O($N$) symmetries. Assuming exponential potentials we find that this O$(N)$ quintom paradigm exhibits novel properties comparing to the simple canonical and phantom scenarios. In particular, we find that the universe cannot result in a quintessence-type solution with $w>-1$, even in the cases where the phantom field seems to be irrelevant. On the contrary, there are always late-time attractors which correspond to accelerating universes with $w<-1$ and with a recent crossing of the phantom divide, and for a very large area of the parameter space they are the only ones. This is in contrast with the previous simple-quintom results, where an accelerating universe is a possible late-time stable solution but it is not guaranteed.
