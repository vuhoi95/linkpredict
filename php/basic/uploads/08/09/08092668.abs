Title: Drag Force of Moving Quark at The N=2 Supergravity
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan
Abstract: In this paper we consider a moving quark in the thermal plasma at the N=2 Supergravity theory. By using the AdS/CFT correspondence we obtain energy loss of the quark. Then we consider the higher derivative corrections in charged AdS-black hole and calculate the drag force of the moving quark in the thermal plasma. Also we find a limit which N=2 Supergravity solutions are correspondening to the N=4 Super Yang-Mills solutions for the heavy quark.
