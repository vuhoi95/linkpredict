Title: Wolfgang Kummer and the Vienna School of Dilaton (Super-)Gravity
Authors: Luzi Bergamin and Rene Meyer
Abstract: Wolfgang Kummer was well known for his passion for axial gauges and for the formulation of gravity in terms of Cartan variables. The combination of the two applied to two dimensional dilaton gravity is the basis of the "Vienna School", which provided numerous significant results over the last seventeen years. In this review we trace the history of this success with particular emphasis on dilaton supergravity. We also present some previously unpublished results on the structure of non-local vertices in quantum dilaton supergravity with non-minimally coupled matter.
