Title: Remarks on Power Spectra of Chaotic Dynamical Systems
Authors: Gerald Guralnik and Zachary Guralnik and Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We develop novel methods to compute auto-correlation functions, or power spectral densities, for chaotic dynamical systems generated by an inverse method whose starting point is an invariant distribution and a two-form. In general, the inverse method makes some aspects of chaotic dynamics calculable by methods familiar in quantum field theory. This approach has the numerical advantage of being amenable to Monte-Carlo parallel computation. We demonstrate the approach on a specific example, and show how auto-correlation functions can be computed without any direct numerical simulation, by Pade approximants of a short time expansion.
