Abstract: We obtain static selfgravitating solitonic 3-brane solutions in the Einstein-Skyrme model in 7D. These solitons correspond to a smooth version of the previously discussed cosmic p-brane solutions. We show how the energy momentum tensor of the Skyrme field is able to smooth out the singularities found in the thin wall approximation and falls fast enough with the distance from the core of the object so that asymptotically approaches the flat cosmic p-brane metric.
