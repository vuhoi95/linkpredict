Title: Thick de Sitter brane solutions in higher dimensions
Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev and Vladimir Folomeev and Masato Minamitsuji
Abstract: We present thick de Sitter brane solutions which are supported by two interacting {\it phantom} scalar fields in five-, six- and seven-dimensional spacetime. It is shown that for all cases regular solutions with anti-de Sitter asymptotic (5D problem) and a flat asymptotic far from the brane (6D and 7D cases) exist. We also discuss the stability of our solutions.
