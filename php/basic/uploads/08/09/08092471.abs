Title: The decay-time of non-commutative micro-black holes
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Piero Nicolini
Abstract: Non-commutative black holes are characterised by a minimum mass which would result in a remnant after the Hawking evaporation ends. We numerically study the decay of neutral non-commutative black holes for up to ten spatial dimensions and typical parameters that would make their production possible at the LHC. Neglecting possible accretion mechanism, we find that decay-times are extremely short.
