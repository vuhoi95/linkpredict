Title: Evolution of the D3-brane for dynamical embeddings
Authors: Pawel Gusin and Jerzy Warczewski
Abstract: The Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action of the 3-dimensional brane for its dynamical embeddings and the gauge fields has been studied. The evolution of both the D3-brane and the ambient space has been obtained. For the special constraint put on the transverse coordinates a family of the contracting and expanding spaces has been found.
