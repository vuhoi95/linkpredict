Title: Strominger--Yau--Zaslow geometry, Affine Spheres and Painlev√© III
Authors: Maciej Dunajski and Prim Plansangkate
Abstract: We give a gauge invariant characterisation of the elliptic affine sphere equation and the closely related Tzitz\'eica equation as reductions of real forms of $SL(3, \C)$ anti--self--dual Yang--Mills equations by two translations, or equivalently as a special case of the Hitchin equation. We use the Loftin--Yau--Zaslow construction to give an explicit expression for a six--real dimensional semi--flat Calabi--Yau metric in terms of a solution to the affine-sphere equation and show how a subclass of such metrics arises from 3rd Painlev\'e transcendents.
