Title: AdS_4/CFT_3 -- Squashed, Stretched and Warped
Authors: Igor Klebanov and Thomas Klose and Arvind Murugan
Abstract: We use group theoretic methods to calculate the spectrum of short multiplets around the extremum of N=8 gauged supergravity potential which possesses N=2 supersymmetry and SU(3) global symmetry. Upon uplifting to M-theory, it describes a warped product of AdS_4 and a certain squashed and stretched 7-sphere. We find quantum numbers in agreement with those of the gauge invariant operators in the N=2 superconformal Chern-Simons theory recently proposed to be the dual of this M-theory background. This theory is obtained from the U(N)xU(N) theory through deforming the superpotential by a term quadratic in one of the superfields. To construct this model explicitly, one needs to employ monopole operators whose complete understanding is still lacking. However, for the U(2)xU(2) gauge theory we make a proposal for the form of the monopole operators which has a number of desired properties. In particular, this proposal implies enhanced symmetry of the U(2)xU(2) ABJM theory for k=1,2; it makes its similarity to and subtle difference from the BLG theory quite explicit.
