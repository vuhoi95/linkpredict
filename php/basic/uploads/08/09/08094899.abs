Title: Light-Front Holography: A First Approximation to QCD
Authors: Guy F. de Teramond and Stanley J. Brodsky
Abstract: Starting from the Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we identify an invariant light-front coordinate $\zeta$ which allows the separation of the dynamics of quark and gluon binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and internal orbital angular momentum. The result is a single variable light-front Schrodinger equation for QCD which determines the eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum. This light-front wave equation is equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-$J$ modes on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space.
