Title: Breaking of a metastable string at finite temperature
Authors: A. Monin and M. B. Voloshin
Abstract: We consider the phase transition of a string with tension $\eps_1$ to a string with a smaller tension $\eps_2$ at finite temperature. For sufficiently small temperatures the transition proceeds through thermally catalyzed quantum tunneling, and we calculate in arbitrary number of dimensions the thermal catalysis factor. At $\eps_2=0$ the found formula for the decay rate also describes a break up of a metastable string into two pieces.
