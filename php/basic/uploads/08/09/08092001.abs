Title: Charged Rotating Kaluza-Klein Black Holes Generated by G2(2)  Transformation
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Yukinori Yasui and Yoshiyuki Morisawa
Abstract: Applying the G_{2(2)} generating technique for minimal D=5 supergravity to the Rasheed black hole solution, we present a new rotating charged Kaluza-Klein black hole solution to the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations. At infinity, our solution behaves as a four-dimensional flat spacetime with a compact extra dimension and hence describes a Kaluza-Klein black hole. In particlar, the extreme solution is non-supersymmetric, which is contrast to a static case. Our solution has the limits to the asymptotically flat charged rotating black hole solution and a new charged rotating black string solution.
