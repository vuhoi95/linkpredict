Title: R-symmetric gauge mediation
Authors: Santiago De Lope Amigo and Andrew E. Blechman and Patrick J. Fox and Erich Poppitz
Abstract: We present a version of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking which preserves an R-symmetry - the gauginos are Dirac particles, the A-terms are zero, and there are four Higgs doublets. This offers an alternative way for gauginos to acquire mass in the supersymmetry-breaking models of Intriligator, Seiberg, and Shih. We investigate the possibility of using R-symmetric gauge mediation to realize the spectrum and large sfermion mixing of the model of Kribs, Poppitz, and Weiner.
