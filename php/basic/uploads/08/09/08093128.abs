Title: The geometry of Schr√∂dinger symmetry in non-relativistic CFT
Authors: C. Duval and M. Hassaine and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: The non-relativistic conformal "Schroedinger" symmetry of some gravity backgrounds proposed recently in the AdS/CFT context, is explained in the "Bargmann framework". The formalism incorporates the Equivalence Principle. Newton-Hooke conformal symmetries, which are analogs of those of Schroedinger in the presence of a negative cosmological constant, are discussed in a similar way. Further examples include topologically massive gravity with negative cosmological constant and the Madelung hydrodynamical description.
