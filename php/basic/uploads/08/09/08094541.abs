Title: Hydrodynamics with conserved current from the gravity dual
Authors: Jin Hur and Kyung Kiu Kim and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We determine the structure of the hydrodynamics with conserved current, using the gauge/gravity duality of charged black-hole background. It turns out that even in the presence of the external electromagnetic field at the boundary, bulk Einstein equation is equivalent to the boundary conservation of energy momentum tensor and that of current. As a consequence, the thermal conductivity and electric conductivity are calculated in terms of the parameters of the fundamental theory. We find that Wiedermann-Franz law hold with Lorentz number $1/e^2$
