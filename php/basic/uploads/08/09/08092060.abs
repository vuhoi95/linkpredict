Title: Laser frequency combs and ultracold neutrons to probe braneworlds  through induced matter swapping between branes
Authors: Michael Sarrazin and Fabrice Petit
Abstract: This paper investigates a new experimental framework to test the braneworld hypothesis. Recent theoretical results have shown the possibility of matter exchange between branes under the influence of suitable magnetic vector potentials. It is shown that the required conditions might be achieved with present-day technology. The experiment uses a source of pulsed and coherent electromagnetic radiation and relies on the Hansch frequency comb technique well-known in ultrahigh-precision spectroscopy. A good matter candidate for testing the hypothesis is a polarized ultracold neutron gas for which the number of swapped neutrons is measured.
