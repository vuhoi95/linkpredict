Title: Dynamical Lorentz symmetry breaking in 3D and charge fractionalization
Authors: B. Charneski and M. Gomes and T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We analyze the breaking of Lorentz invariance in a 3D model of fermion fields self-coupled through four-fermion interactions. The low-energy limit of the theory contains various sub-models which are similar to those used in the study of the graphene or in the description of irrational charge fractionalization.
