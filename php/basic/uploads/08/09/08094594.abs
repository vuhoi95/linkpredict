Title: Which BPS Baryons Minimize Volume?
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Stanislav Kuperstein
Abstract: A BPS 3-cycle in a Sasaki-Einstein 5-manifold in general does not minimize volume in its homology class, as we illustrate with several examples of non-minimal volume BPS cycles on the 5-manifolds Y(p,q). Instead they minimize the energy of a wrapping D-brane, extremizing a generalized calibration. We present this generalized calibration and demonstrate that it reproduces both the Born-Infeld and the Wess-Zumino parts of the D3-brane energy.
