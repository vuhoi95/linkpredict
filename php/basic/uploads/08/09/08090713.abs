Title: Ultra Minimal Technicolor and its Dark Matter TIMP
Authors: Thomas A. Ryttov and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We introduce an explicit model with technifermion matter transforming according to multiple representations of the underlying technicolor gauge group. The model features simultaneously the smallest possible value of the naive S parameter and the smallest possible number of technifermions. The chiral dynamics is extremely rich. We construct the low-energy effective Lagrangian. We provide both the linearly and non-linearly realized ones. We then embed, in a natural way, the Standard Model (SM) interactions within the global symmetries of the underlying gauge theory. Several low-energy composite particles are SM singlets. One of these Technicolor Interacting Massive Particles (TIMP)s is a natural cold dark matter (DM) candidate. We estimate the fraction of the mass in the universe constituted by our DM candidate over the baryon one. We show that the new TIMP, differently from earlier models, can be sufficiently light to be directly produced and studied at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
