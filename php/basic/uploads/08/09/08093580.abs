Title: Vulcanized Vortex
Authors: Inyong Cho and Youngone Lee
Abstract: We investigate vortex configurations with the "vulcanization" term inspired by the renormalization of $\phi_\star^4$ theory in the canonical $\theta$-deformed noncommutativity. We focus on the classical limit of the theory described by a single parameter which is the ratio of the vulcanization and the noncommutativity parameters. We perform numerical calculations and find that nontopological vortex solutions exist as well as Q-ball type solutions, but topological vortex solutions are not admitted.
