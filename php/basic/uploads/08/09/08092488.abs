Title: Fluid dynamics of R-charged black holes
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Michael Haack and Matthias Kaminski and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We construct electrically charged AdS_5 black hole solutions whose charge, mass and boost-parameters vary slowly with the space-time coordinates. From the perspective of the dual theory, these are equivalent to hydrodynamic configurations with varying chemical potential, temperature and velocity fields. We compute the boundary theory transport coefficients associated with a derivative expansion of the energy momentum tensor and R-charge current up to second order. In particular, we find a first order transport coefficient associated with the axial component of the current.
