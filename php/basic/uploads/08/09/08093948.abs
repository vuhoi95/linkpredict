Title: Symmetries of Spin Calogero Models
Authors: Vincent Caudrelier and Nicolas Crampe
Abstract: We investigate the symmetry algebras of integrable spin Calogero systems constructed from Dunkl operators associated to finite Coxeter groups. Based on two explicit examples, we show that the common view of associating one symmetry algebra to a given Coxeter group $W$ is wrong. More precisely, the symmetry algebra heavily depends on the representation of $W$ on the spins. We prove this by identifying two different symmetry algebras for a $B_L$ spin Calogero model and three for $G_2$ spin Calogero model. They are all related to the half-loop algebra and its twisted versions. Some of the result are extended to any finite Coxeter group.
