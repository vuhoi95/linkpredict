Title: Does The Lattice Zero Momentum Gluon Propagator for Pure Gauge SU(3)  Yang-Mills Theory Vanish in the Infinite Volume Limit?
Authors: O. Oliveira and P. J. Silva
Abstract: The Cucchieri-Mendes bounds for the gluon propagator are discussed for the four dimensional pure gauge SU(3) theory. Assuming a pure power law dependence on the inverse of the lattice volume, the lattice data gives a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator in the infinite volume limit. Our investigation shows that this result is robust against variations of the lattice volumes and corrections to the power law. Moreover, it is consistent with the Gribov-Zwanziger horizon condition and contradicts the SU(2) analysis, which assumed the same type of dependence on the inverse of the volume. Our analysis considers also more general ansatze that, although not conclusive, open the possibility of having $D(0) \ne 0$ in the infinite volume limit. A solution to this puzzle requires further investigations.
