Title: Aharonov-Bohm effect on AdS_2 and nonlinear supersymmetry of  reflectionless Poschl-Teller system
Authors: Francisco Correa and Vit Jakubsky and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We explain the origin and the nature of a special nonlinear supersymmetry of a reflectionless Poschl-Teller system by the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a nonrelativistic particle on the AdS_2. A key role in the supersymmetric structure appearing after reduction by a compact generator of the AdS_2 isometry is shown to be played by the discrete symmetries related to the space and time reflections in the ambient Minkowski space. We also observe that a correspondence between the two quantum non-relativistic systems is somewhat of the AdS/CFT holography nature.
