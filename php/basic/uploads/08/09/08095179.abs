Title: Expository Remarks on Three-Dimensional Gravity and Hyperbolic  Invariants
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and M. E. X. Guimaraes
Abstract: We consider complex invariants associated with compact real three-dimensional hyperbolic spaces. The contribution of the Chern-Simons invariants of irreducible U(n)-flat connections on hyperbolic fibered manifolds to the low order expansion of the quantum gravitational path integral is analyzed.
