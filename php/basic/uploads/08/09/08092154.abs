Title: 't Hooft tensor for generic gauge group
Authors: A. Di Giacomo and L. Lepori and F. Pucci
Abstract: We study monopoles in gauge theories with generic gauge group. Magnetic charges are in one-to-one correspondence with the second homotopy classes at spatial infinity (${\Pi}_2$), which are therefore identified by the 't Hooft tensor. We determine the 't Hooft tensor in the general case. These issues are relevant to the understanding of Color Confinement.
