Title: Finite mass gravitating Yang monopoles
Authors: Hakan Cebeci and Ozgur Sarioglu and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We show that gravity cures the infra-red divergence of the Yang monopole when a proper definition of conserved quantities in curved backgrounds is used, i.e. the gravitating Yang monopole in cosmological Einstein theory has a finite mass in generic even dimensions (including time). In addition, we find exact Yang-monopole type solutions in the cosmological Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Yang-Mills theory and briefly discuss their properties.
