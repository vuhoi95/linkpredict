Title: New Two Dimensional Massless Field Theory from Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson  Model
Authors: M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: By compactifying the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model on $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$, we obtain a new two dimensional massless field theory with dynamical fields valued in the Lie 3-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ coupled with an SO(1,1) scalar and vector field which are valued in the set $End(\mathcal{A})$ of the endomorphisms of the Lie 3-algebra. In the limit $g_{BLG} \to \infty$ the theory reduces to a supersymmetric Lie 3-valued generalization of the Green-Schwarz superstring in the light-cone gauge.
