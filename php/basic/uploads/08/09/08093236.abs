Abstract: We derive non-linear recursion relations for the leading chiral logarithms (LLs). These relations not only provide a very efficient method of computation of LLs (e.g. the 33-loop contribution is calculated in a dozen of seconds on a PC) but also equip us with a powerful tool for the summation of the LLs. Our method is not limited to the chiral perturbation theory only, it is pertinent for any non-renormalizable effective field theory such as, for instance, the theory of critical phenomena, the low-energy quantum gravity, etc.
