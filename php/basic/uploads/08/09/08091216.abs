Title: Friedman vs Abel equations: A connection unraveled
Authors: A. V. Yurov and V. A. Yurov
Abstract: We present an interesting connection between Einstein-Friedmann equations for the models of universe filled with scalar field and the special form of Abel equation of the first kind. This connection works in both ways: first, we show how, knowing the general solution of the Abel equation (corresponding to the given scalar field potential) one can obtain the general solution of the Friedman Equation (and use the former for studying such problems as existence of inflation with exit for particular models). On the other hand, one can invert the procedure and construct the B\"{a}cklund auto-transformations for the Abel equation.
