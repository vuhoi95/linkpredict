Title: Construction of the Zero-Energy State of SU(2)-Matrix Theory: Near the  Origin
Authors: Jens Hoppe and Douglas Lundholm and Maciej Trzetrzelewski
Abstract: We explicitly construct a (unique) Spin(9)xSU(2) singlet state, phi, involving only the fermionic degrees of freedom of the supersymmetric matrix-model corresponding to reduced 10-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory, resp. supermembranes in 11-dimensional Minkowski space. Any non-singular wavefunction annihilated by the 16 supercharges of SU(2) matrix theory must, at the origin (where it is assumed to be non-vanishing) reduce to phi.
