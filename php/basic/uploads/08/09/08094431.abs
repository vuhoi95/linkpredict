Title: Spectrum of closed k-strings in D=2+1
Authors: Andreas Athenodorou and Barak Bringoltz and Michael Teper
Abstract: We calculate the excitation spectrumof closed k-strings in 2+1 dimensional SU(N) gauge theories for N = 4, 5 and k = 2. Our results demonstrate that the low-lying spectrum of the k = 2 string falls into sectors that belong to nearly pure antisymmetric and symmetric representations, showing that k-strings know not only about the centre of the group, but also about the full group. We also observe that the lightest states in each irreducible representation are consistent with what one would expect from an effective string theory that belongs to the same bosonic universality class (Nambu-Goto) as the fundamental string. We find that the corrections compared to the free string theory are of O(1), in striking contrast to the very small correction observed for the fundamental string. We also observe unbound w = 2 states.
