Title: Casimir energy in the gauge/gravity description of Bjorken flow?
Authors: K. Kajantie and Jorma Louko and T. Tahkokallio
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT description of four-dimensional QCD matter undergoing Bjorken expansion, does the holographic energy-momentum tensor contain a Casimir-type contribution that should not be attributed to thermal matter? When the bulk isometry ansatz that yielded such a Casimir term for (1+1)-dimensional boundary matter is generalised to a four-dimensional boundary, we show that a Casimir term does not arise, owing to singularities in the five-dimensional bulk solution. The geometric reasons are traced to a difference between the isometries of AdS_3 and AdS_{d+1} for d>=3.
