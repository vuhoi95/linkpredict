Title: Phase Diagram for Nflation
Authors: Iftikhar Ahmad and Yun-Song Piao and Cong-Feng Qiao
Abstract: Recently, it was showed that there is a large N phase transition in Nflation, in which when the number of fields is large enough, the slow roll inflation phase will disappear. In this brief report, we illustrate the phase diagram for Nflation, and discuss the entropy bound and some relevant results. It is found that near the critical point the number of fields saturates dS entropy.
