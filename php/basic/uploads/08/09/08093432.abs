Title: Stringy Instantons as Strong Dynamics
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Luciano Girardello and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We study the relation between stringy instantons and strong dynamics effects in type IIB toric quiver gauge theories. By exploiting the involutive property of Seiberg duality we relate the classical constraint on the moduli space of the gauge theory with the stringy instanton contribution to the superpotential. The result holds for unitary, orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups.
