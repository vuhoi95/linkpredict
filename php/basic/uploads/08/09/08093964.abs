Title: Exotic phases of finite temperature SU(N) gauge theories with massive  fermions: F, Adj, A/S
Authors: Joyce C. Myers and Michael C. Ogilvie
Abstract: The phase diagrams at high temperature of SU(N) gauge theories with massive fermions are calculated by numerically minimizing the one-loop effective potential. We consider fermions in the Fundamental (F), Adjoint (Adj), Antisymmetric (AS), and Symmetric (S) representations, for N from 3 to 9, with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions applied. For one flavour of AS/S (Dirac) fermion with periodic boundary conditions the C-breaking phase is favoured perturbatively for all values of the fermion mass. In the case of one flavour of adjoint Majorana fermion, and periodic boundary conditons, the deconfined phase is favoured for any fermion mass. For one or more adjoint Dirac fermion (two or more Majorana fermions) we find partially-confining phases as well as new phases with unusual properties. Our results for SU(3) and SU(4) are consistent with our lattice simulations of a related model.
