Title: Spin(9) Average of SU(N) Matrix Models I. Hamiltonian
Authors: Jens Hoppe and Douglas Lundholm and Maciej Trzetrzelewski
Abstract: We apply a method of group averaging to states and operators appearing in (truncations of) the Spin(9) x SU(N) invariant matrix models. We find that there is an exact correspondence between the standard supersymmetric Hamiltonian and the Spin(9) average of a relatively simple lower-dimensional model.
