Title: Superconformal defects in the tricritical Ising model
Authors: Dongmin Gang and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We study superconformal defect lines in the tricritical Ising model in 2 dimensions. By the folding trick, a superconformal defect is mapped to a superconformal boundary of the N=1 superconformal unitary minimal model of c=7/5 with D_6-E_6 modular invariant. It turns out that the complete set of the boundary states of c=7/5 D_6-E_6 model cannot be interpreted as the consistent set of superconformal defects in the tricritical Ising model since it does not contain the "no defect" boundary state. Instead, we find a set of 18 consistent superconformal defects including "no defect" and satisfying the Cardy condition. This set also includes some defects which are not purely transmissive or purely reflective.
