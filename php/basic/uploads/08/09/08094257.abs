Title: Holographic Multiverse

Abstract: We explore the idea that the dynamics of the inflationary multiverse is encoded in its future boundary, where it is described by a lower dimensional theory which is conformally invariant in the UV. We propose that a measure for the multiverse, which is needed in order to extract quantitative probabilistic predictions, can be derived in terms of the boundary theory by imposing a UV cutoff. In the inflationary bulk, this is closely related (though not identical) to the so-called scale factor cutoff measure.
