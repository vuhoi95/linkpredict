Title: Supersymmetric partners of the trigonometric Poschl-Teller potentials
Authors: Alonso Contreras-Astorga and David J Fernandez C
Abstract: The first and second-order supersymmetry transformations are used to generate Hamiltonians with known spectra departing from the trigonometric Poschl-Teller potentials. The several possibilities of manipulating the initial spectrum are fully explored, and it is shown how to modify one or two levels, or even to leave the spectrum unaffected. The behavior of the new potentials at the boundaries of the domain is studied.
