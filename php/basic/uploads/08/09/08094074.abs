Title: Dynamic critical phenomena in the AdS/CFT duality
Authors: Kengo Maeda and Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: In critical phenomena, singular behaviors arise not only for thermodynamic quantities but also for transport coefficients. We study this dynamic critical phenomenon in the AdS/CFT duality. We consider black holes with a single R-charge in various dimensions and compute the R-charge diffusion in the linear perturbations. In this case, the black holes belong to model B according to the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin.
