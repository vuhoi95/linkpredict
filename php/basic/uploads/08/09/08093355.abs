Title: Wilson Loops in 3d QFT from D-branes in AdS(4) x CP**3
Authors: J. Kluson and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study the Wilson loops and defects in the three dimensional QFT from the D-branes in the AdS(4) x CP**3 geometry. We find out explicit D-brane configurations in the bulk which correspond to both straight and circular Wilson lines extended to the boundary of AdS(4). We analyze critically the role of boundary contributions to the D2-branes with various topology and to the fundamental string actions.
