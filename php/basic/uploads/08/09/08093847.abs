Abstract: The cosmological evolution of an interacting scalar field model in which the scalar field interacts with dark matter, radiation, and baryon via Lorentz violation is investigated. We propose a model of interaction through the effective coupling $\bar{\beta}$. Using dynamical system analysis, we study the linear dynamics of an interacting model and show that the dynamics of critical points are completely controlled by two parameters. Some results can be mentioned as follows. Firstly, the sequence of radiation, the dark matter, and the scalar field dark energy exist and baryons are sub dominant. Secondly, the model also allows the possibility of having a universe in the phantom phase with constant potential. Thirdly, the effective gravitational constant varies with respect to time through $\bar{\beta}$. In particular, we consider a simple case where $\bar{\beta}$ has a quadratic form and has a good agreement with the modified $\Lambda$CDM and quintessence models. Finally, we also calculate the first post--Newtonian parameters for our model.
