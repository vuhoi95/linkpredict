Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Mohammad Edalati and Robert G. Leigh and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of a proposal by Aharony and Kutasov arXiv:0803.3547 [hep-th] for the gravity dual of an open Wilson line in the Sakai-Sugimoto model or its non-compact version. In particular, we use their proposal to determine the effect of finite temperature, as well as background electric and magnetic fields, on the chiral symmetry breaking order parameter. We also generalize their prescription to more complicated worldsheets and identify the operators dual to such worldsheets.
