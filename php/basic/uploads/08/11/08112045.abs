Title: Remarks on Chern-Simons invariants
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Pavel Mnev
Abstract: The perturbative Chern-Simons theory is studied in a finite-dimensional version or assuming that the propagator satisfies certain properties (as is the case, e.g., with the propagator defined by Axelrod and Singer). It turns out that the effective BV action is a function on cohomology (with shifted degrees) that solves the quantum master equation and is defined modulo certain canonical transformations that can be characterized completely. Out of it one obtains invariants.
