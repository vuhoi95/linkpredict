Title: The noncommutative sine-Gordon breather
Authors: Andre Fischer and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: As shown in [hep-th/0406065], there exists a noncommutative deformation of the sine-Gordon model which remains (classically) integrable but features a second scalar field. We employ the dressing method (adapted to the Moyal-deformed situation) for constructing the deformed kink-antikink and breather configurations. Explicit results and plots are presented for the leading noncommutativity correction to the breather. Its temporal periodicity is unchanged.
