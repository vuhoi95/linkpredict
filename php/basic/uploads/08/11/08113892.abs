Title: Zhu's algebra, the C_2 algebra, and twisted modules
Authors: M. R. Gaberdiel and T. Gannon
Abstract: In his landmark paper, Zhu associated two associative algebras to a vertex operator algebra: what are now called Zhu's algebra and the C_2-algebra. The former has a nice interpretation in terms of the representation theory of the VOA, while the latter only serves as a finiteness condition. In this paper we undertake first steps to unravel the interpretation of the C_2 vector space. In particular we suggest that it seems and controls the twisted representations of the VOA.
