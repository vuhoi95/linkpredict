Title: Effect of Modified Dispersion Relations on Immirzi Parameter
Authors: Ö. Açık and Ü. Ertem
Abstract: Black hole entropy calculations which are based on counting of microstates and based on modified dispersion relations in the framework of loop quantum gravity are considered. We suggest that the inconsistency of two approaches can be explained by different ways. This inconsistency can affect the definition and constancy of the Immirzi parameter or order of the modification constants of dispersion relations. Possible results of these effects are discussed.
