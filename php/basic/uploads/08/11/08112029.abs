Title: Analogs of the double-Reissner-Nordstrom solution in magnetostatics and  dilaton gravity: mathematical description and some physical properties
Authors: V. S. Manko and E. Ruiz and J. Sanchez-Mondragon
Abstract: In this paper we consider a magnetic analog of the double-Reissner-Nordstrom solution and construct the corresponding magnetic potential A_\varphi in the explicit form. The behavior of the resulting solution under the Harrison transformation then naturally singles out the asymmetric black diholes - configurations composed of two non-extreme black holes possessing unequal masses, and charges equal in magnitude but opposite in sign - as its most general subclass for which equilibrium of the black-hole constituents can be achieved with the aid of the external magnetic (or electric) field. We also generalize the double-Reissner-Nordstrom solution to the dilaton gravity with arbitrary dilaton coupling, yielding as the result the 4-dimensional double-Gibbons-Maeda spacetime. The study of some physical properties of the solutions obtained leads, in particular, to very simple formulas for the areas of the horizons and surface gravities.
