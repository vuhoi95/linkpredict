Title: Addendum to Reconciling Grand Unification with Strings by Anisotropic  Compactifications
Authors: Ben Dundee and Stuart Raby and Akin Wingerter
Abstract: In a recent paper, by working in the orbifold GUT limit of the Heterotic string, we showed how one could accommodate gauge coupling unification in the "mini-landscape" models of Lebedev et al. Furthermore, it was shown how one of the solutions was consistent with the decoupling of other exotics with F=0. In this short addendum, we show that this solution is also consistent with D=0.
