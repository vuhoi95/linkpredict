Abstract: We analyse 1/2 BPS IIA Dp-brane supergravity solutions with $B$-fields and their Killing spinor equations. Via probe analysis, we rederive the supersymmetry conditions for D0-Dp with $B$-fields. In the case of D6 with $B$-fields, the D0-probe sees a multi-centred BPS configuration where the $B$-fields give the location of a wall of marginal stability. Finally we go beyond the probe approximation and construct a 1/8 BPS supergravity solution for a fully back-reacted D0-D6 with $B$-fields.
