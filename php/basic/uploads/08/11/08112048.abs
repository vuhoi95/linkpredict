Title: A note on conformal symmetry in projective superspace
Authors: Radu A. Ionas and Andrew Neitzke
Abstract: We describe a sufficient condition for actions constructed in projective superspace to possess an SU(2) R-symmetry. We check directly that this condition implies that the corresponding hyperkahler varieties, constructed by means of the generalized Legendre transform, have a Swann bundle structure.
