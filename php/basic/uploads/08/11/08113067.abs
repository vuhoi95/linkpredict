Title: Non-relativistic CFT and Semi-classical Strings
Authors: Amin Akhavan and Mohsen Alishahiha and Ali Davody and Ali Vahedi
Abstract: We study different features of 3D non-relativistic CFT using gravity description. As the corresponding gravity solution can be embedded into the type IIB string theory, we study semi-classical closed/open strings in this background. In particular we consider folded rotating and circular pulsating closed strings where we find the anomalous dimension of the dual operators as a function of their quantum numbers. We also consider moving open strings in this background which can be used to compute the drag force. In particular we find that for slowly moving particles, the energy is lost exponentially and the characteristic time is given in terms of the temperature, while for fast moving particles the energy loss goes as inverse of the time and the characteristic time is independent of the temperature.
