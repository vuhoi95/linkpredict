Title: Compact gauge K vortices
Authors: C. Adam and P. Klimas and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We investigate a version of the abelian Higgs model with a non-standard kinetic term (K field theory) in 2+1 dimensions. The existence of vortex type solutions with compact support (topological compactons) is established by a combination of analytical and numerical methods. This result demonstrates that the concept of compact solitons in K field theories can be extended to higher dimensions.
