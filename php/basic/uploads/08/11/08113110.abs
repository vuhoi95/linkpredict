Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Nilanjan Bondyopadhaya
Abstract: By using the exact partition function of su(m|n) Polychronakos spin chain associated with A_{N-1} root system, we study some statistical properties of the related spectrum. It is found that the corresponding energy level density satisfies the Gaussian distribution and the cumulative distribution of spacing between consecutive energy levels obeys a certain `square root of a logarithm' law.
