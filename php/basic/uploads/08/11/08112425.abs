Abstract: In this paper we investigate the time evolution of the energy density for a real massless scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime, inside a non-static cavity, taking as basis the exact numerical approach purposed by Cole and Schieve. Considering Neunmann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, we investigate the following initial states of the field: vacuum, thermal state, the coherent state and the Schrodinger cat state.
