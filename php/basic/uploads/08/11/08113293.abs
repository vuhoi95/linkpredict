Title: Instability of the Perturbation Theoretical Chromodynamic Vacuum
Authors: Y. N. Srivastava and O. Panella and A. Widom
Abstract: The standard model of strong interactions invokes the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of quarks and gluons interacting within a fluid. At sufficiently small length scales, the effective interactions between the color charged particles within the fluid are thought to be weak. Short distance asymptotic freedom provides the perturbation theory basis for comparisons between QCD theory and laboratory high energy scattering experiments. It is here shown that the asymptotically free vacuum has negative dissipation implicit in the color electrical conductivity. Negative dissipation implies an asymptotically free QCD negative temperature {\em excited state amplifier} unstable to decay. The qualitative experimental implications of this instability are explored.
