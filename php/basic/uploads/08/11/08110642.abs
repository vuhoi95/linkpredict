Title: AdS/QCD and its Holographic Light-Front Partonic Representation
Authors: Guy F. de Teramond and Stanley J. Brodsky
Abstract: Starting from the Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD we find a single variable light-front equation for QCD which determines the eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum. This light-front wave equation is equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-$J$ modes on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space.
