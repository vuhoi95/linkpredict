Title: Noncommutative epsilon-graded connections
Authors: Axel de Goursac and Thierry Masson and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: We introduce the new notion of epsilon-graded associative algebras which takes its root into the notion of commutation factors introduced in the context of Lie algebras. We define and study the associated notion of epsilon-derivation-based differential calculus, which generalizes the derivation-based differential calculus on associative algebras. A corresponding notion of noncommutative connection is also defined. We illustrate these considerations with various examples of epsilon-graded algebras, in particular some graded matrix algebras and the Moyal algebra. This last example permits also to interpret mathematically a noncommutative gauge field theory.
