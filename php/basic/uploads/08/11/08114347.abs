Title: Gluonic vacuum, q-theory, and the cosmological constant
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and G. E. Volovik
Abstract: In previous work, q-theory was introduced to describe the gravitating macroscopic behavior of a conserved microscopic variable q. In this article, the gluon condensate of quantum chromodynamics is considered in terms of q-theory. The remnant vacuum energy density (i.e., cosmological constant) of an expanding universe is estimated as K_{QCD}^3 / E_{Planck}^2, with string tension K_{QCD} \approx (10^2 MeV)^2 and gravitational scale E_{Planck} \approx 10^{19} GeV. The only input for this estimate is general relativity, quantum chromodynamics, and the Hubble expansion of the present Universe.
