Title: On billiard approach in multidimensional cosmological models
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: A short overview of the billiard approach for cosmological-type models with n Einstein factor-spaces is presented. We start with the billiard representation for pseudo-Euclidean Toda-like systems of cosmological origin. Then we consider cosmological model with multicomponent "perfect-fluid" and cosmological-type model with composite branes. The second one describes cosmological and spherically-symmetric configurations in a theory with scalar fields and fields of forms. The conditions for appearance of asymptotical Kasner-like and oscillating behaviors in the limit \tau \to +0 and \tau \to + \infty (where \tau is a "synchronous-type" variable) are formulated (e.g. in terms of inequalities on Kasner parameters). Examples of billiards related to the hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras E_{10}, AE_3 and A_{1,II} are given.
