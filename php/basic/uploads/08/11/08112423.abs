Title: Giant Magnons in AdS4 x CP3: Embeddings, Charges and a Hamiltonian
Authors: Michael C. Abbott and InÃªs Aniceto
Abstract: This paper studies giant magnons in CP3, which in all known cases are old solutions from S5 placed into two- and three-dimensional subspaces of CP3, namely CP1, RP2 and RP3. We clarify some points about these subspaces, and other potentially interesting three- and four-dimensional subspaces. After confirming that E-(J1-J4)/2 is a Hamiltonian for small fluctuations of the relevant 'vacuum' point particle solution, we use it to calculate the dispersion relation of each of the inequivalent giant magnons. We comment on the embedding of finite-J solutions, and use these to compare string solutions to giant magnons in the algebraic curve.
