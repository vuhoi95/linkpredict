Title: Free Fermion Orientifolds
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Michael Lennek and Bert Schellekens
Abstract: We investigate a class of orientifold models based on tensor products of 18 Ising models. Using the same search criteria as for the comparable case of Gepner model orientifolds we find that there are no three-family standard model configurations with tadpole cancellation. Even if we do not impose the latter requirement, we only find one such configuration in the special case of complex free fermions. In order to allow a comparison with other approaches we enumerate the Hodge numbers of the type-IIB theories we obtain. We provide indications that there are fermionic IIB vacua that are not $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifolds.
