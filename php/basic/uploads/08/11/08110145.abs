Title: Giant magnons and spiky strings on the conifold
Authors: Sergio Benvenuti and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We find explicit solutions for giant magnons and spiky strings on the squashed three dimensional sphere. For a special value of the squashing parameter the solutions describe strings moving in a sector of the conifold, while for another value of the squashing parameter we recover the known results on the round three dimensional sphere. A new feature is that the energy and the momenta enter in the dispersion relation of the conifold in a transcendental way.
