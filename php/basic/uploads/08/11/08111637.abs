Title: Can the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal be an alternative to the firewall?
Authors: Dong-han Yeom and Heeseung Zoe
Abstract: Recently, there have been discussions that black hole complementarity is inconsistent and that the firewall is required to prohibit the observation of duplicated information. It is thought that if the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal works as a selection principle, then this may be an alternative to the firewall. In this paper, we first point out that the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal seems to help black hole complementarity for charged black holes. However, if we consider the Hayden-Preskill argument further, which states that a black hole can function as an information mirror after the information retention time, then we can show that the Horowitz-Maldaceana proposal cannot help black hole complementarity. This can be extended to neutral black hole cases. Therefore, in conclusion, we find that dynamical black holes do not respect complementarity, even with the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal.
