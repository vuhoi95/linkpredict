Title: Color Lie algebras and Lie algebras of order F
Authors: R. Campoamor-Stursberg and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: The notion of color algebras is generalized to the class of F-ary algebras, and corresponding decoloration theorems are established. This is used to give a construction of colored structures by means of tensor products with Clifford-like algebras. It is moreover shown that color algebras admit realisations as q=0 quon algebras.
