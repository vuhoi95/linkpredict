Title: Colliding Waves on a Brane, the Big Bounce and Reconnection
Authors: Tae-Hun Lee and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We present a time-dependent solution of the Nambu-Goto action which represents two colliding waves moving at the speed of light. This solution can be decomposed into two distinct regions with different geometries corresponding to shrinking or expanding brane universe and two colliding branes. The former describes the Big Bounce without singularity while the latter describes that two branes collide and reconnect to each other. The colliding brane region has a signature change. Classical dynamics of a massive particle on the brane is studied through the geodesics.
