Title: An Arena for Model Building in the Cohen-Glashow Very Special Relativity
Authors: M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and A. Tureanu
Abstract: The Cohen-Glashow Very Special Relativity (VSR) algebra [arXiv:hep-ph/0601236] is defined as the part of the Lorentz algebra which upon addition of CP or T invariance enhances to the full Lorentz group, plus the space-time translations. We show that noncommutative space-time, in particular noncommutative Moyal plane, with light-like noncommutativity provides a robust mathematical setting for quantum field theories which are VSR invariant and hence set the stage for building VSR invariant particle physics models. In our setting the VSR invariant theories are specified with a single deformation parameter, the noncommutativity scale \Lambda_{NC}. Preliminary analysis with the available data leads to \Lambda_{NC}\gtrsim 1-10 TeV. This note is prepared for the Proceedings of the G27 Mathematical Physics Conference, Yerevan 2008, and is based on arXiv:0806.3699[hep-th].
