Title: Second order hydrodynamic coefficients from kinetic theory
Authors: Mark Abraao York and Guy D. Moore
Abstract: In a relativistic setting, hydrodynamic calculations which include shear viscosity (which is first order in an expansion in gradients of the flow velocity) are unstable and acausal unless they also include terms to second order in gradients. To date such terms have only been computed in supersymmetric N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory at infinite coupling. Here we compute these second-order hydrodynamic coefficients in weakly coupled QCD, perturbatively to leading order in the QCD coupling, using kinetic theory. We also compute them in QED and scalar lambda phi^4 theory.
