Title: Contraction based classification of supersymmetric extensions of  kinematical Lie algebras
Authors: R. Campoamor-Stursberg and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: We study supersymmetric extensions of classical kinematical algebras from the point of view of contraction theory. It is shown that contracting the supersymmetric extension of the anti-de Sitter algebra leads to a hierarchy similar in structure to the classical Bacry-L\'evy-Leblond classification
