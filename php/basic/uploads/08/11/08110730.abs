Title: Charged black holes on a Kaluza-Klein bubble
Authors: Jutta Kunz and Stoytcho Yazadjiev
Abstract: We construct a solution of two black holes on a Kaluza-Klein bubble in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We explore the consequences of the presence of charge for the properties of this solution, and obtain a generalized Smarr relation and first law.
