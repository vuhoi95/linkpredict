Title: Behavior of tachyon in string cosmology based on gauged WZW model
Authors: Sunggeun Lee and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We investigate a string theoretic cosmological model in the context of the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Our model is based on a product of non-compact coset space and a spectator flat space; $[SL(2,R)/U(1)]_k \times {\bf R}^2$. We extend the formerly studied semiclassical consideration with infinite Kac-Moody level $k$ to a finite one. In this case, the tachyon field appears in the effective action, and we solve the Einstein equation to determine the behavior of tachyon as a function of time. We find that tachyon field dominates over dilaton field in early times. In particular, we consider the energy conditions of the matter fields consisting of the dilaton and the tachyon which affect the initial singularity. We find that not only the strong energy but also the null energy condition is violated.
