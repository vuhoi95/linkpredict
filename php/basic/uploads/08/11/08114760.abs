Title: From global symmetries to local currents: the free (scalar) case in 4  dimensions
Authors: Gerardo Morsella and Luca Tomassini
Abstract: Within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory, we propose a new method of constructing local generators of (global) gauge symmetries in field theoretic models, starting from the existence of unitary operators implementing locally the flip automorphism on the doubled theory. We show, in the simple example of the internal symmetries of a multiplet of free scalar fields, that through the pointlike limit of such local generators the conserved Wightman currents associated with the symmetries are recovered.
