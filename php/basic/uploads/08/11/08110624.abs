Title: Spectral function and quasi-particle damping of interacting bosons in  two dimensions
Authors: Andreas Sinner and Nils Hasselmann and Peter Kopietz
Abstract: We employ the functional renormalization group to study dynamical properties of the two-dimensional Bose gas. Our approach is free of infrared divergences, which plague the usual diagrammatic approaches, and is consistent with the exact Nepomnyashchy identity, which states that the anomalous self-energy vanishes at zero frequency and momentum. We recover the correct infrared behavior of the propagators and present explicit results for the spectral line-shape, from which we extract the quasi-particle dispersion and damping.
