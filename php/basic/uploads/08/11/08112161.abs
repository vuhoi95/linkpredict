Title: Infinite Degeneracy of States in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Jonathan Hackett and Yidun Wan
Abstract: The setting of Braided Ribbon Networks is used to present a general result in spin-networks embedded in manifolds: the existence of an infinite number of species of conserved quantities. Restricted to three-valent networks the number of such conserved quantities in a given network is shown to be invariant barring a single case. The implication of these conserved quantities is discussed in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity.
