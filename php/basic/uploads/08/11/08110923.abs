Title: The structure of supersymmetry in ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum  mechanics
Authors: D. Bazeia and Ashok Das and L. Greenwood and L. Losano
Abstract: The structure of supersymmetry is analyzed systematically in ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanical theories. We give a detailed description of supersymmetric systems associated with one dimensional ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanical theories. We show that there is a richer structure present in these theories compared to the conventional theories associated with Hermitian Hamiltonians. We bring out various properties associated with these supersymmetric systems and generalize such quantum mechanical theories to higher dimensions as well as to the case of one dimensional shape invariant potentials.
