Title: Four loop twist two, BFKL, wrapping and strings
Authors: Zoltan Bajnok and Romuald A. Janik and Tomasz Lukowski
Abstract: The anomalous dimensions of twist two operators have to satisfy certain consistency requirements derived from BFKL. For N=4 SYM it was shown that at four loops, the anomalous dimensions derived from the all-loop asymptotic Bethe ansatz do not pass this test. In this paper we obtain the remaining wrapping part of these anomalous dimensions from string theory and show that these contributions exactly cure the problem and lead to agreement with both LO and NLO BFKL expectations.
