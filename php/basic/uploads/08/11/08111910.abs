Title: Solitons with Cubic and Quintic Nonlinearities Modulated in Space and  Time
Authors: A. T. Avelar and D. Bazeia and W. B. Cardoso
Abstract: This work deals with soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities. We extend the procedure put forward in a recent Letter and we solve the equation in the presence of linear background, and cubic and quintic interactions which are modulated in space and time. As a result, we show how a simple parameter can be used to generate brightlike or darklike localized nonlinear waves which oscillate in several distinct ways, driven by the space and time dependence of the parameters that control the trapping potential, and the cubic and quintic nonlinearities.
