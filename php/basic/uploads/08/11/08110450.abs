Title: On Correlation Numbers in 2D Minimal Gravity and Matrix Models
Authors: A. A. Belavin and A. B. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We test recent results for the four-point correlation numbers in Minimal Liouville Gravity against calculations in the one-Matrix Models, and find full agreement. In the process, we construct the resonance transformation which relates coupling parameters of the Liouville Gravity with the couplings of the Matrix Models, up to the terms of the order 4. We also conjecture the general form of this transformation.
