Title: Two-Dimensional Gauge Theory and Matrix Model
Authors: Goro Ishiki and Kazutoshi Ohta and Shinji Shimasaki and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We study a matrix model obtained by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simon theory on S^3. We find that the matrix integration is decomposed into sectors classified by the representation of SU(2). We show that the N-block sectors reproduce SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on S^2 as the matrix size goes to infinity.
