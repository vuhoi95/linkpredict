Title: Superconformal Indices for Orbifold Chern-Simons Theories
Authors: Jaehyung Choi and Sangmin Lee and Jaewon Song
Abstract: We calculate the superconformal indices of recently discovered three-dimensional N=4,5 Chern-Simons-matter theories and compare them with the corresponding indices of supergravity on AdS4 times orbifolds of S7. We find perfect agreement in the large N and large k limit, provided that the twisted sector contributions at the fixed loci of the orbifolds are properly taken into account. We also discuss the index for the so-called "dual ABJM" proposal.
