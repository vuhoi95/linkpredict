Title: On conformal field theories with low number of primary fields
Authors: Roman Dovgard and Doron Gepner
Abstract: Using Verlinde formula and the symmetry of the modular matrix we describe an algorithm to find all conformal field theories with low number of primary fields. We employ the algorithm on up to eight primary fields. Four new conformal field theories are found which do not appear to come from current algebras. This supports evidence to the fact that rational conformal field theories are far richer than suspected before.
