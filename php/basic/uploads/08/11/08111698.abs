Title: Fixed points in interacting dark energy models
Authors: Xi-ming Chen and Yungui Gong
Abstract: The dynamical behaviors of two interacting dark energy models are considered. In addition to the scaling attractors found in the non-interacting quintessence model with exponential potential, new accelerated scaling attractors are also found in the interacting dark energy models. The coincidence problem is reduced to the choice of parameters in the interacting dark energy models.
