Title: N=8 Supergravity 4-point Amplitudes
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Ching Hua Lee and Tomas Rube
Abstract: We present the explicit expressions in N=8 supergravity for the bosonic 4-particle tree and 1-loop amplitudes including vectors and scalars. We also present the candidate 4-point UV divergences in a form of helicity amplitudes, corresponding to 3-loop manifestly N=8 supersymmetric and Lorentz covariant counterterm. This may shed some light on the 3-loop finiteness of N=8 SG and on a conjectured higher loop finiteness. We perform a supersymmetric deformation to complex momentum of the 4-point generating function including higher-loop counterterms and the 1-loop UV finite amplitudes. Using the explicit form of the scalar part of the 3-loop counterterm and of the 1-loop UV finite scalar 4-point amplitudes we find that they both have an unbroken E7 symmetry. We derive from E7 symmetry the low-energy theorem for the 1-loop n-point amplitudes.
