Title: Twist Quantization of String and B Field Background
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Masashi Mori and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: In a previous paper, we investigated the Hopf algebra structure in string theory and gave a unified formulation of the quantization of the string and the space-time symmetry. In this paper, this formulation is applied to the case with a nonzero B-field background, and the twist of the Poincare symmetry is studied. The Drinfeld twist accompanied by the B-field background gives an alternative quantization scheme, which requires a new normal ordering. In order to obtain a physical interpretation of this twisted Hopf algebra structure, we propose a method to decompose the twist into two successive twists and we give two different possibilities of decomposition. The first is a natural decomposition from the viewpoint of the twist quantization, leading to a new type of twisted Poincare symmetry. The second decomposition reveals the relation of our formulation to the twisted Poincare symmetry on the Moyal type noncommutative space.
