Title: One-loop Self Energies in Softly Broken Supersymmetric QED
Authors: Tino S. Nyawelo and Paolo Gondolo
Abstract: We apply the supergraph with spurion technique to compute the renormalization of one-loop diagrams that contributes to electron and selectron self energies in a softly broken Supersymmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (SQED). In particular, we calculate the one-loop gauge superfield contribution to the two-point function.
