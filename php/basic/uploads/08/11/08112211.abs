Title: Nucleon Form Factors from 5D Skyrmions
Authors: Giuliano Panico and Andrea Wulzer
Abstract: Several aspects of hadron physics are well described by a simple 5D effective field theory. Baryons arise in this scenario as "large" (and therefore calculable) 5D skyrmions. We extend and refine the existing analysis of this 5D soliton, which is fairly non-trivial due to the need of numerical methods. We perform the complete quantization of those collective coordinates which are relevant for computing the static observables like the nucleon form factors. We compare the result with simple expectations about large-N_c QCD and with the experimental data. An agreement within 30% is found.
