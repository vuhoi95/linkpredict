Title: Generalized Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of Kaehler supermanifolds
Authors: Calin Iuliu Lazaroiu and Daniel McNamee and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We extend the construction of generalized Berezin and Berezin-Toeplitz quantization to the case of compact Hodge supermanifolds. Our approach is based on certain super-analogues of Rawnsley's coherent states. As applications, we discuss the quantization of affine and projective superspaces. Furthermore, we propose a definition of supersymmetric sigma-models on quantized Hodge supermanifolds. The corresponding quantum field theories are finite and thus yield supersymmetry-preserving regularizations for QFTs defined on flat superspace.
