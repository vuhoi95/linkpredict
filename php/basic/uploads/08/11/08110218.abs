Title: Chiral formulation for hyperkaehler sigma-models on cotangent bundles of  symmetric spaces
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Joseph Novak
Abstract: Starting with the projective-superspace off-shell formulation for four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric sigma-models on cotangent bundles of arbitrary Hermitian symmetric spaces, their on-shell description in terms of N = 1 chiral superfields is developed. In particular, we derive a universal representation for the hyperkaehler potential in terms of the curvature of the symmetric base space. Within the tangent-bundle formulation for such sigma-models, completed recently in arXiv:0709.2633 and realized in terms of N = 1 chiral and complex linear superfields, we give a new universal formula for the superspace Lagrangian. A closed form expression is also derived for the Kaehler potential of an arbitrary Hermitian symmetric space in Kaehler normal coordinates.
