Title: Smoothing out Negative Tension Brane
Authors: Kin-ya Oda and Takao Suyama and Naoto Yokoi
Abstract: We propose an extension of the five dimensional gravitational action with an external source in order to allow arbitrary smoothing of the negative tension brane in the Randall-Sundrum model. This extended action can be derived from a model with an auxiliary four form field coupled to the gravity. We point out a further generalization of our model in relation to tachyon condensation. A possible mechanism for radion stabilization in our model is also discussed.
