Title: Braiding and fusion properties of the Neveu-Schwarz super-conformal  blocks
Authors: Damian Chorazkiewicz and Leszek Hadasz
Abstract: We construct, generalizing appropriately the method applied by J. Teschner in the case of the Virasoro conformal blocks, the braiding and fusion matrices of the Neveu-Schwarz super-conformal blocks. Their properties allow for an explicit verification of the bootstrap equation in the NS sector of the N=1 supersymmetric Liouville field theory.
