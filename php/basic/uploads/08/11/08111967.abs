Title: Quantum scale invariance on the lattice
Authors: Mikhail E. Shaposhnikov and Igor I. Tkachev
Abstract: We propose a scheme leading to a non-perturbative definition of lattice field theories which are scale-invariant on the quantum level. A key idea of the construction is the replacement of the lattice spacing by a propagating dynamical field -- the dilaton. We describe how to select non-perturbatively the phenomenologically viable theories where the scale invariance is broken spontaneously. Relation to gravity is also discussed.
