Title: Principal Realization of the Yangian Y(gl(n))
Authors: Chengming Bai and Mo-Lin Ge and Naihuan Jing
Abstract: Motivated to simplify the structure of tensor representations we give a new set of generators for the Yangian $Y(sl(n))$ using the principal realization in simple Lie algebras. The isomorphism between our new basis and the standard Cartan-Weyl basis is also given. We show by example that the principal basis simplifies the Yangian action significantly in the tensor product of the fundamental representation and its dual.
