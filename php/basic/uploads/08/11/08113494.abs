Title: Quantum Lift of Non-BPS Flat Directions
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Ferrara and A. Marrani and A. Shcherbakov
Abstract: We study N=2, d=4 attractor equations for the quantum corrected two-moduli prepotential $\mathcal{F}=st^2+i\lambda$, with $\lambda$ real, which is the only correction which preserves the axion shift symmetry and modifies the geometry. In the classical case the black hole effective potential is known to have a flat direction. We found that in the presence of D0-D6 branes the black hole potential exhibits a flat direction in the quantum case as well. It corresponds to non-BPS $Z\neq 0$ solutions to the attractor equations. Unlike the classical case, the solutions acquire non-zero values of the axion field. For the cases of D0-D4 and D2-D6 branes the classical flat direction reduces to separate critical points which turn out to have a vanishing axion field.
