Title: Some physics of the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric  Yang-Mills theory: Lattice Monte Carlo study
Authors: Issaku Kanamori and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: We illustrate some physical application of a lattice formulation of the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with a (small) supersymmetry breaking scalar mass. Two aspects, power-like behavior of certain correlation functions (which implies the absence of the mass gap) and the static potential $V(R)$ between probe charges in the fundamental representation, are considered. For the latter, for $R\lesssim1/g$, we observe a linear confining potential with a finite string tension. This confining behavior appears distinct from a theoretical conjecture that a probe charge in the fundamental representation is screened in two-dimensional gauge theory with an adjoint massless fermion, although the static potential for $R\gtrsim1/g$ has to be systematically explored to conclude real asymptotic behavior in large distance.
