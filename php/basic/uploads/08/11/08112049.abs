Title: Conformal non-relativistic hydrodynamics from gravity
Authors: Mukund Rangamani and Simon F. Ross and D. T. Son and Ethan G. Thompson
Abstract: We show that the recently constructed holographic duals of conformal non-relativistic theories behave hydrodynamically at long distances, and construct the gravitational dual of fluid flows in a long-wavelength approximation. We compute the thermal conductivity of the holographic conformal non-relativistic fluid. The corresponding Prandtl number is equal to one.
