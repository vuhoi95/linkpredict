Title: Three-body forces in Bethe-Salpeter and light-front equations
Authors: V. A. Karmanov and P. Maris
Abstract: In relativistic frameworks, given by the Bethe-Salpeter and light-front bound state equations, the binding energies of system of three scalar particles interacting by scalar exchange particles are calculated. In contrast to two-body systems, the three-body binding energies obtained in these two approaches differ significantly from each other: the ladder kernel in light-front dynamics underbinds by approximately a factor of two compared to the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation. By taking into account three-body forces in the light-front approach, generated by two exchange particles in flight, we find that most of this difference disappears; for small exchange masses, the obtained binding energies coincide with each other.
