Title: Phase space measure concentration for an ideal gas
Authors: Anthony J. Creaco and Nikos Kalogeropoulos
Abstract: We point out that a special case of an ideal gas exhibits concentration of the volume of its phase space, which is a sphere, around its equator in the thermodynamic limit. The rate of approach to the thermodynamic limit is determined. Our argument relies on the spherical isoperimetric inequality of L\'{e}vy and Gromov.
