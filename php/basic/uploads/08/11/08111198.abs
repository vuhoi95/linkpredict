Title: SU(2) Kinetic Mixing Terms and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
Authors: J. Lopez-Sarrion and Paola Arias and J. Gamboa
Abstract: The non-abelian generalization of the Holdom model --{\it i.e.} a theory with two gauge fields coupled to the kinetic mixing term $g {tr}(F_{\mu \nu} (A) F_{\mu \nu} (B))$-- is considered. Contrarily to the abelian case, the group structure $G\times G$ is explicitly broken to $G$. For SU(2) this fact implies that the residual gauge symmetry as well as the Lorentz symmetry is spontaneusly broken. We show that this mechanism provides of masses for the involved particles. Also, the model presents instanton solutions with a redefined coupling constant.
