Title: From multiple scattering to van der Waals interactions: exact results  for eccentric cylinders
Authors: Kimball A. Milton and Prachi Parashar and Jef Wagner
Abstract: In this paper, dedicated to the career of Iver Brevik, we review the derivation of the retarded van der Waals or Casimir-Polder interaction between polarizable molecules from the general multiple scattering formulation of Casimir interactions between bodies. We then apply this van der Waals potential to examine the interaction between tenuous cylindrical bodies, including eccentric cylinders, and revisit the vanishing self-energy of a tenuous dielectric cylinder. In each case, closed-form expressions are obtained.
