Title: N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills on S^3 in Plane Wave Matrix Model at  Finite Temperature
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Koichiro Matsumoto
Abstract: We investigate the large N reduced model of gauge theory on a curved spacetime through the plane wave matrix model. We formally derive the action of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R \times S^3 from the plane wave matrix model in the large N limit. Furthermore, we evaluate the effective action of the plane wave matrix model up to the two-loop level at finite temperature. We find that the effective action is consistent with the free energy of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on S^3 at high temperature limit where the planar contributions dominate. We conclude that the plane wave matrix model can be used as a large N reduced model to investigate nonperturbative aspects of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R \times S^3.
