Title: Boundary operators in the O(n) and RSOS matrix models
Authors: J. -E. Bourgine and K. Hosomichi
Abstract: We study the new boundary condition of the O(n) model proposed by Jacobsen and Saleur using the matrix model. The spectrum of boundary operators and their conformal weights are obtained by solving the loop equations. Using the diagrammatic expansion of the matrix model as well as the loop equations, we make an explicit correspondence between the new boundary condition of the O(n) model and the "alternating height" boundary conditions in RSOS model.
