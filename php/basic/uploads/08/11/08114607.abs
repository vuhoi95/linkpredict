Title: Tachyon-Dilaton-induced Inflation as an alpha'-resummed String  Background
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Anna Kostouki and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: Within the framework of a novel functional method on the world-sheet of the string, we discuss simple but re-summed (in the Regge slope) inflationary scenarios in the context of closed Bosonic strings, living in four target-space dimensions, in the presence of non-trivial tachyon, dilaton and graviton cosmological backgrounds. The inflationary solutions are argued to guarantee the vanishing of the corresponding Weyl anomaly coefficients in a given world-sheet renormalization scheme, thereby ensuring conformal invariance of the corresponding sigma-model to all orders in the Regge slope. The key property is the requirement of "homogeneity" of the corresponding Weyl anomaly coefficients. Inflation entails appropriate relations between the dilaton and tachyon field configurations, whose form can lead to either a de Sitter vacuum, incompatible though (due to the cosmic horizons) with the perturbative string scattering amplitudes, or to cosmic space-times involving brief inflationary periods, interpolating smoothly between power-law and/or Minkowski Universes. The latter situation is characterized by well-defined scattering amplitudes, and is thus compatible with a perturbative string framework. It is this scenario that we consider a self-consistent ground state in our framework, which is based on local field redefinitions of background fields.
