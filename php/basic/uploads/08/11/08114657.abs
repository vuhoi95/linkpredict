Title: Green-Schwarz superstring action for (p,q)-strings from a wrapped  supermembrane on a 2-torus
Authors: Hiroyuki Okagawa and Shozo Uehara and Satoshi Yamada
Abstract: We consider a wrapped supermembrane around non-trivial two cycles of a 2-torus. We examine the double dimensional reduction and the T-dual transformation to deduce Green-Schwarz type IIB superstring action for (p,q)-strings directly from the wrapped supermembrane on the 2-torus. The resulting action has the couplings with both the NSNS- and the RR-background fields and has the tension of the (p,q)-string.
