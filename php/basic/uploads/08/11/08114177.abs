Title: Holographic Duals of Kaluza-Klein Black Holes
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Noriaki Ogawa and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We apply Brown-Henneaux's method to the 5D extremal rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes essentially following the calculation of the Kerr/CFT correspondence, which is not based on supersymmetry nor string theory. We find that there are two completely different Virasoro algebras that can be obtained as the asymptotic symmetry algebras according to appropriate boundary conditions. The microscopic entropies are calculated by using the Cardy formula for both boundary conditions and they perfectly agree with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes contain a 4D dyonic Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and Myers-Perry black hole. Since the D-brane configurations corresponding to these black holes are known, we expect that our analysis will shed some light on deeper understanding of chiral CFT2's dual to extremal black holes.
