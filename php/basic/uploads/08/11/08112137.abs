Authors: Marisa Fernandez and Stefan Ivanov and Luis Ugarte and Raquel Villacampa
Abstract: We construct explicit compact supersymmetric solutions with non-zero field strength, non-flat instanton and constant dilaton to the heterotic string equations in dimension five. We present a quadratic condition on the curvature which is necessary and sufficient the heterotic supersymmetry and the anomaly cancellation to imply the heterotic equations of motion in dimension five. We supply compact nilmanifold in dimension 5 satisfying the heterotic supersymmetry equations with non-zero fluxes and constant dilaton which obey the three-form Bianchi identity and solves the heterotic equations of motion in dimension five.
