Title: World Sheet Superstring and Superstring Field Theory: a new solution  using Ultradistributions of Exponential Type
Authors: C. G. Bollini and A. L. De Paoli and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In this paper we show that Ultradistributions of Exponential Type (UET) are appropriate for the description in a consistent way world sheet superstring and superstring field theories. A new Lagrangian for the closed world sheet superstring is obtained. We also show that the superstring field is a linear superposition of UET of compact support (CUET), and give the notion of anti-superstring. We evaluate the propagator for the string field, and calculate the convolution of two of them.
