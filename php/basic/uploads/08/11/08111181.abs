Title: The Shape of Mesons in Holographic QCD
Authors: Mahdi Torabian and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: Based on the expectation that constituent quark model may capture right physics in the large N limit, we point out that orbital angular momentum of the quark-antiquark pair inside light mesons of low spins in the constituent quark model may provide a clue for the holographic dual string model of large N QCD. Our discussion, relying on a few suggestive assumptions, leads to a necessity of world-sheet fermions in the bulk of dual strings that can incorporate intrinsic spins of fundamental QCD degrees of freedom. We also comment on an interesting issue of the size of mesons in the context of holographic QCD.
