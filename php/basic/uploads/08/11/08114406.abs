Title: Electrodynamics at non-zero temperature, chemical potential, and Bose  condensate
Authors: Alexander D. Dolgov and Angela Lepidi and Gabriella Piccinelli
Abstract: Electrodynamics of charged scalar bosons and spin 1/2 fermions is studied at non-zero temperature, chemical potentials, and possible Bose condensate of the charged scalars. Debye screening length, plasma frequency, and the photon dispersion relation are calculated. It is found that in presence of the condensate the time-time component of the photon polarization operator in the first order in electric charge squared acquires infrared singular parts proportional to inverse powers of the spatial photon momentum k.
