Title: Note on Rotating Charged Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons  Theory
Authors: Alikram N. Aliev and Dilek K. Ciftci
Abstract: We show that the general solution of Chong, Cvetic, Lu and Pope for nonextremal rotating charged black holes in five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, or equivalently in the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a negative cosmological constant and with the Chern-Simons coefficient $ \nu=1 $, admits a simple description in a Kerr-Schild type framework with two scalar functions. Next, assuming this framework as an ansatz, we obtain new analytic solutions for slowly rotating charged black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with $ \nu\neq 1 .$ Using a covariant superpotential derived from Noether identities within the Katz-Bicak-Lynden-Bell approach, we calculate the mass and angular momenta for the general supergravity solution as well as for the slowly rotating solution with two independent rotation parameters. For the latter case, we also calculate the gyromagnetic ratios and obtain simple analytic formulas, involving both the parameters of the black holes and the Chern-Simons coefficient.
