Title: Quasinormal modes of charged squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes in the  GÃ¶del Universe
Authors: Xi He and Bin Wang and Songbai Chen
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of scalar perturbation in the background of five-dimensional charged Kaluza-Klein black holes with squashed horizons immersed in the G\"{o}del universe. Besides the influence due to the compactness of the extra dimension, we disclose the cosmological rotational effect in the wave dynamics. The wave behavior affected by the G\"{o}del parameter provides an interesting insight into the G\"{o}del universe.
