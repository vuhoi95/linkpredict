Title: Asymptotically AdS_3 Solutions to Topologically Massive Gravity at  Special Values of the Coupling Constants
Authors: Alan Garbarz and Gaston Giribet and Yerko VÃ¡squez
Abstract: We study exact solutions to Cosmological Topologically Massive Gravity (CTMG) coupled to Topologically Massive Electrodynamics (TME) at special values of the coupling constants. For the particular case of the so called chiral point l\mu_G=1, vacuum solutions (with vanishing gauge field) are exhibited. These correspond to a one-parameter deformation of GR solutions, and are continuously connected to the extremal Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole (BTZ) with bare constants J=-lM. At the chiral point this extremal BTZ turns out to be massless, and thus it can be regarded as a kind of ground state. Although the solution is not asymptotically AdS_3 in the sense of Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions, it does obey the weakened asymptotic recently proposed by Grumiller and Johansson. Consequently, we discuss the holographic computation of the conserved charges in terms of the stress-tensor in the boundary. For the case where the coupling constants satisfy the relation l\mu_G=1+2l\mu_E, electrically charged analogues to these solutions exist. These solutions are asymptotically AdS_3 in the strongest sense, and correspond to a logarithmic branch of selfdual solutions previously discussed in the literature.
