Title: Off-diagonal correlations in one-dimensional anyonic models: A replica  approach
Authors: Pasquale Calabrese and Raoul Santachiara
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the replica trick that allows to calculate the large distance asymptotic of off-diagonal correlation functions in anyonic models with a proper factorizable ground-state wave-function. We apply this new method to the exact determination of all the harmonic terms of the correlations of a gas of impenetrable anyons and to the Calogero Sutherland model. Our findings are checked against available analytic and numerical results.
