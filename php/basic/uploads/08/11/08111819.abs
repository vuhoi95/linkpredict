Title: Geometric aspects of dibaryon operators
Authors: Charlie Beil and David Berenstein
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence for N=1 Super conformal field theories suggests that dibaryon operators are dual to D-brane states that are point like in AdS and that wrap various cycles in a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. It also suggests that the volume of the D-brane gives the R-charge of the corresponding operator. We elucidate various aspects of this correspondence, paying particular care to study the case of branes at the tip of three different Calabi Yau cones. We show that the arrows in the quiver diagram describing the conformal field theory can be thought of as global sections of a non-trivial holomorphic vector bundle over the Calabi-Yau geometry. We suggest that the zero locus of these sections gives the geometric map that lets us tie a particular dibaryon to a holomorphic cycle, by intersecting the corresponding cycle with the Sasaki-Einstein locus at fixed distance from the origin. We show that this can be compared with the corresponding volumes of the Sasaki-Einstein space and that one gets exact agreement between the volumes of the cycles identified with this procedure and the R-charges of the operators.
