Title: A general CFT model for antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ladders with Mobius  boundary conditions
Authors: Gerardo Cristofano and Vincenzo Marotta and Adele Naddeo and Giuliano Niccoli
Abstract: We show how the low-energy properties of the 2-leg XXZ spin-1/2 ladders with general anisotropy parameter $\Delta $ on closed geometries can be accounted for in the framework of the m-reduction procedure developed in [1]. In the limit of quasi-decoupled chains, a conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge c=2 is derived and its ability to describe the model with different boundary conditions is shown. Special emphasis is given to the Mobius boundary conditions which generate a topological defect corresponding to non trivial single-spinon excitations. Then, in the case of the 2-leg XXX ladders we discuss in detail the role of various perturbations in determining the renormalization group flow starting from the ultraviolet (UV) critical point with c=2.
