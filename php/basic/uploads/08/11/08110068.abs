Authors: I. Radinschi and F. Rahaman and M. Kalam and K. Chakraborty
Abstract: We provide a new electromagnetic mass model admitting Chaplygin gas equation of state. We investigate three specializations, the first characterized by a vanishing effective pressure, the second provided with a constant effective density and the third is described by a constant effective pressure. For these specializations two particular cases are discussed. In addition, for specialization I, case I we found isotropic coordinate as well as Kretschmann scalar, and for specialization III, case II two special scenarios have been studied.
