Title: Representations of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1|4) and  paraboson coherent states
Authors: R. Chakrabarti and N. I. Stoilova and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: We introduce and obtain multimode paraboson coherent states. In appropriate subspaces these coherent states provide a decomposition of unity where the measure, when expressed using the cat-type states, is positive definite. Bicoherent states where the mutually commuting lowering operators are diagonalized are also obtained. Matrix elements in the coherent state basis are calculated.
