Title: Single impurity operators at critical wrapping order in the  beta-deformed N=4 SYM
Authors: Francesco Fiamberti and Alberto Santambrogio and Christoph Sieg and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We study the spectrum of one single magnon in the superconformal beta-deformed N=4 SYM theory in the planar limit. We compute the anomalous dimensions of one-impurity operators O_{1,L}= tr(phi Z^{L-1}), including wrapping contributions at their critical order L.
