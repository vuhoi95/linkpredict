Title: Meson supercurrents and the Meissner effect in the Sakai-Sugimoto model
Authors: Anton Rebhan and Andreas Schmitt and Stefan A. Stricker
Abstract: The Sakai-Sugimoto model provides a holographic description for chiral symmetry breaking. We use this model to investigate chirally broken phases in an external magnetic field at finite isospin and baryon chemical potentials. The equations of motion for the bulk gauge fields are solved analytically and the free energy is computed from the Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons contributions to the D8 brane action. In the case of a neutral pion condensate, a magnetic field is found to induce nonzero gradients of the Goldstone boson fields corresponding to meson supercurrents. A charged pion condensate, on the other hand, expels the magnetic field due to the Meissner effect. Upon comparing the Gibbs free energies of these two phases we find that the rotation of the chiral condensate into a charged pion condensate for finite isospin chemical potentials is partially undone by switching on a magnetic field, and we determine the critical magnetic field which removes the charged pion condensate in a first-order phase transition.
