Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We study asymptotically AdS topological black hole solutions with k=0 (plane symmetric) in the Einstein gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term, the dilaton and a "cosmological constant" in various dimensions. We derive the field equations for suitable ansatz for general D dimensions. We determine the parameter regions including dilaton couplings where such solutions exist and construct black hole solutions of various masses numerically in D=4,5,6 and 10 dimensional spacetime with (D-2)-dimensional hypersurface of zero curvature.
