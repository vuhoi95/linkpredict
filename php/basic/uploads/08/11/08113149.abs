Title: Conformal perturbation theory beyond the leading order
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Anatoly Konechny and Cornelius Schmidt-Colinet
Abstract: Higher order conformal perturbation theory is studied for theories with and without boundaries. We identify systematically the universal quantities in the beta function equations, and we give explicit formulae for the universal coefficients at next-to-leading order in terms of integrated correlation functions. As an example, we analyse the radius-dependence of the conformal dimension of some boundary operators for the case of a single Neumann brane on a circle, and for an intersecting brane configuration on a torus, reproducing in both cases the expected geometrical answer.
