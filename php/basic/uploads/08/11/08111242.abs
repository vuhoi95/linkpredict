Title: Exploring a new peak in the heterotic landscape
Authors: Anthony Bak and Vincent Bouchard and Ron Donagi
Abstract: We study the existence of realistic heterotic vacua on a new Abelian surface fibered Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_8 x Z_8 fundamental group. Our main result is a no-go theorem, which says that (under mild assumptions) there is no stable holomorphic vector bundle on X satisfying the constraints required by global consistency of the heterotic vacuum and phenomenology. To prove the theorem we explore in some detail the Fourier-Mukai transform of vector bundles on Abelian surface fibrations.
