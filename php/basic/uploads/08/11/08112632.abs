Title: Absorption Cross Section in Warped AdS$_3$ Black Hole
Authors: John J. Oh and Wontae Kim
Abstract: The absorption cross section is studied in the low-frequency region for a propagating scalar field under the warped AdS$_3$ black hole background in the topologically massive gravity. It can be shown that the absorption cross section is significantly deformed by the gravitational Chern-Simons term, which is proportional to the scattering area of black hole with an additional contribution depending on the left-moving and right-moving temperatures. It means that the cross section is larger than the area in spite of the s-wave limit. Finally, we discuss the left-right quasinormal modes for the scalar perturbation in this black hole.
