Title: Generalized Kahler geometry and gerbes
Authors: C. M. Hull and U. Lindström and M. Roček and R. von Unge and M. Zabzine
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of a biholomorphic gerbe with connection. The biholomorphic gerbe provides a natural geometrical framework for generalized Kahler geometry in a manner analogous to the way a holomorphic line bundle is related to Kahler geometry. The relation between the gerbe and the generalized Kahler potential is discussed.
