Abstract: We construct the classical action of the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) model in the N=3, d=3 harmonic superspace. In such a formulation three out of six supersymmetries are realized off shell while the other three mix the superfields and close on shell. The superfield action involves two hypermultiplet superfields in the bifundamental representation of the gauge group and two Chern-Simons gauge superfields corresponding to the left and right gauge groups. The N=3 superconformal invariance allows only for a minimal gauge interaction of the hypermultiplets. Amazingly, the correct sextic scalar potential of ABJM emerges after the elimination of auxiliary fields. Besides the original U(N)xU(N) ABJM model, we also construct N=3 superfield formulations of some generalizations. For the SU(2)xSU(2) case we give a simple superfield proof of its enhanced N=8 supersymmetry and SO(8) R-symmetry.
