Authors: Yu Nakayama and Shinsei Ryu and Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We investigate non-relativistic limits of the N=3 Chern-Simons matter system in 1+2 dimensions. The relativistic theory can generate several inequivalent super Schodinger invariant theories, depending on the degrees of freedom we choose to retain in the non-relativistic limit. The maximally supersymmetric Schrodinger invariant theory is obtained by keeping all particle degrees of freedom. The other descendants, where particles and anti-particles coexist, are also Schrodinger invariant but preserve less supersymmetries. Thus, we have a family of super Schrodinger invariant field theories produced from the parent relativistic theory.
