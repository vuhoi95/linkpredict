Title: Universality of second order transport coefficients from the  gauge-string duality
Authors: Michael Haack and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We consider the strongly coupled limit of conformal gauge theory plasmas with conserved U(1) charges which have a gravity dual. We show that, under mild restrictions, the second order transport coefficients of such theories satisfy a universal relation among themselves, similar to the shear viscosity to entropy ratio.
