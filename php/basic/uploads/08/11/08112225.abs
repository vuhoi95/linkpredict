Title: Kerr-AdS/CFT Correspondence in Diverse Dimensions
Authors: H. Lu and Jianwei Mei and C. N. Pope
Abstract: It was proposed recently that the near-horizon states of an extremal four-dimensional Kerr black hole could be identified with a certain chiral conformal field theory whose Virasoro algebra arises as an asymptotic symmetry algebra of the near-horizon Kerr geometry. Supportive evidence for the proposed duality came from the equality of the microscopic entropy of the CFT, calculated by means of the Cardy formula, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal Kerr black hole. In this paper we examine the proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence in a broader context. In particular, we show that the microscopic entropy and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy agree also for the extremal Kerr-AdS metric in four dimensions, and also for the extremal Kerr-AdS metrics in dimensions 5, 6 and 7. General formulae for all higher dimensions are also presented.
