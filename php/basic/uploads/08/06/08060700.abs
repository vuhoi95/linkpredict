Title: Nonlocal field theory driven by a deformed product. Generalization of  Kalb-Ramond duality
Authors: Elisabetta Di Grezia and Giampiero Esposito and Gennaro Miele
Abstract: A modification of the standard product used in local field theory by means of an associative deformed product is proposed. We present a class of deformed products, one for every spin S=0,1/2,1, that induces a nonlocal theory, displaying different form for different fields. This type of deformed product is naturally supersymmetric and it has an intriguing duality.
