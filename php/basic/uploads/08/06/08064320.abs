Title: Geodesic Properties and Orbits in 5-dimensional Hypercylindrical  Spacetime
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Bum-Hoon Lee and Wonwoo Lee
Abstract: We investigate the geodesic motions of a massive particle and light ray in the hyperplane orthogonal to the symmetry axis in the 5-dimensional hypercylindrical spacetime. The class of the solutions depends on one constant a which is the ratio of string mass density and tension. There exist unstable orbits in null geodesic only in some range of a. The innermost stable circular orbits in timelike geodesic also exist only in a certain range of the parameter a. The capture cross section and the deflection angle of light ray are also computed.
