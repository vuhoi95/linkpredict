Title: Mach-like Angular Correlations Arise Only From the Head Zone of AdS/CFT  String Jets
Authors: Jorge Noronha and Miklos Gyulassy
Abstract: We show that Mach-like azimuthal correlations of associated hadrons in the wake of heavy quark jets modeled in the AdS/CFT string drag picture originate only from the near-quark ``Head'' region. The contributions from the far zones lead only to a yield peaked in the opposite direction with respect to the trigger jet.
