Title: Periodic Structures with Rashba Interaction in Magnetic Field
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Rachi Houca
Abstract: We analyze the behaviour of a system of particles living on a periodic crystal in the presence of a magnetic field B. This can be done by involving a periodic potential U(x) and the Rashba interaction of coupling constant k_{so}. By resorting the corresponding spectrum, we explicitly determine the band structures and the Bloch spinors. These allow us to discuss the system symmetries in terms of the polarizations where they are shown to be broken. The dynamical spin will be studied by calculating different quantities. In the limits: k_{so} and U(x)=0, we analyze again the system by deriving different results. Considering the strong $B$ case, we obtain an interesting result that is the conservation of the polarizations. Analyzing the critical point \lambda_{k,\sigma}=\pm\sq{1\over 2}, we show that the Hilbert space associated to the spectrum in z-direction has a zero mode energy similar to that of massless Dirac fermions in graphene. Finally, we give the resulting energy spectrum when B=0 and U(x) is arbitrary.
