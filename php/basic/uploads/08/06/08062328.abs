Title: Oddness from Rigidness
Authors: Stefan Forste and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing type IIA orientifolds on T^6/(Z2 x Z2) which admit (non)-factorisable lattices. More concretely, we consider a (Z2 x Z2') orientifold with torsion, where D6-branes wrap rigid 3-cycles. We derive the model building rules and consistency conditions in the case where the compactification lattice is non-factorisable. We show that in this class of configurations, (semi) realistic models with an odd number of families can be easily constructed, in contrast to compactifications where the D6-branes wrap non-rigid cycles. We also show that an odd number of families can be obtained in the factorisable case, without the need of tilted tori. We illustrate the discussion by presenting three family Pati-Salam models with no chiral exotics in both factorisable and non-factorisable toroidal compactifications.
