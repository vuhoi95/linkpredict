Title: Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in non-commutative space
Authors: Pulak Ranjan Giri and P Roy
Abstract: We study non Hermitian quantum systems in noncommutative space as well as a \cal{PT}-symmetric deformation of this space. Specifically, a \mathcal{PT}-symmetric harmonic oscillator together with iC(x_1+x_2) interaction is discussed in this space and solutions are obtained. It is shown that in the \cal{PT} deformed noncommutative space the Hamiltonian may or may not possess real eigenvalues depending on the choice of the noncommutative parameters. However, it is shown that in standard noncommutative space, the iC(x_1+x_2) interaction generates only real eigenvalues despite the fact that the Hamiltonian is not \mathcal{PT}-symmetric. A complex interacting anisotropic oscillator system has also been discussed.
