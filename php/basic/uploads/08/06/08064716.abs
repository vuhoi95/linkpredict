Abstract: A Hilbert space metric is found for the SU(2|1)-invariant `superflag' Landau models, parametrized by integer 2N' and real number M, such that the Hilbert space norm is positive definite. The spectrum of these unitary super-Landau models is determined. The M=0 case yields a unitary Landau model on the supersphere SU(2|1)/U(1|1) with U(1) charge 2N=2N'+1. For the generic unitary superflag model, the manifest SU(2|1) symmetry is dynamically enhanced to SU(2|2); this is the `spherical' analog of the hidden worldline supersymmetry found previously in the planar limit.
