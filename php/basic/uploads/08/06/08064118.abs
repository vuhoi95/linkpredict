Title: Inflationary Spectra from Lorentz Violating Dissipative Models
Authors: Julian Adamek and David Campo and Jens C. Niemeyer and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: The sensitivity of inflationary spectra to initial conditions is addressed in the context of a phenomenological model that breaks Lorentz invariance by dissipative effects above some threshold energy $\Lambda$. These effects are obtained dynamically by coupling the fluctuation modes to extra degrees of freedom which are unobservable below $\Lambda$. Because of the strong dissipative effects in the early propagation, only the state of the extra degrees of freedom is relevant for the power spectrum. If this state is the ground state, and if $\Lambda$ is much larger than the Hubble scale $H$, the standard spectrum is recovered. Using analytical and numerical methods, we calculate the modifications for a large class of dissipative models. For all of these, we show that the leading modification (in an expansion in $H/\Lambda$) is linear in the decay rate evaluated at horizon exit, and that high frequency superimposed oscillations are not generated. The modification is negative when the decay rate decreases slower than the cube of $H$, which means that there is a loss of power on the largest scales.
