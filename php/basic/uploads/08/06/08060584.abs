Title: Pure Spinor Partition Function and the Massive Superstring Spectrum
Authors: Yuri Aisaka and E. Aldo Arroyo and Nathan Berkovits and Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We explicitly compute up to the fifth mass-level the partition function of ten-dimensional pure spinor worldsheet variables including the spin dependence. After adding the contribution from the (x^{\mu}, \theta^{\alpha}, p_{\alpha}) matter variables, we reproduce the massive superstring spectrum. Even though pure spinor variables are bosonic, the pure spinor partition function contains fermionic states which first appear at the second mass-level. These fermionic states come from functions which are not globally defined in pure spinor space, and are related to the b ghost in the pure spinor formalism. This result clarifies the proper definition of the Hilbert space for pure spinor variables.
