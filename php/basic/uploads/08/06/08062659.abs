Title: A Twisted Kink Crystal in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Gokce Basar and Gerald V. Dunne
Abstract: We present the detailed properties of a self-consistent crystalline chiral condensate in the massless chiral Gross-Neveu model. We show that a suitable ansatz for the Gorkov resolvent reduces the functional gap equation, for the inhomogeneous condensate, to a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which is exactly soluble. The general crystalline solution includes as special cases all previously known real and complex condensate solutions to the gap equation. Furthermore, the associated Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation is also soluble with this inhomogeneous chiral condensate, and the exact spectral properties are derived. We find an all-orders expansion of the Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian and show how the gap equation is solved order-by-order.
