Title: Blow-up of generalized complex 4-manifolds
Authors: Gil R. Cavalcanti and Marco Gualtieri
Abstract: We introduce blow-up and blow-down operations for generalized complex 4-manifolds. Combining these with a surgery analogous to the logarithmic transform, we then construct generalized complex structures on nCP2 # m \bar{CP2} for n odd, a family of 4-manifolds which admit neither complex nor symplectic structures unless n=1. We also extend the notion of a symplectic elliptic Lefschetz fibration, so that it expresses a generalized complex 4-manifold as a fibration over a two-dimensional manifold with boundary.
