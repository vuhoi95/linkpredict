Title: On reduced models for superstrings on AdS_n x S^n
Authors: M. Grigoriev and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We review the Pohlmeyer reduction procedure of the superstring sigma model on AdS_n x S^n leading to a gauged WZW model with an integrable potential coupled to 2d fermions. In particular, we consider the case of the Green-Schwarz superstring on AdS_3 x S^3 supported by RR flux. The bosonic part of the reduced model is given by the sum of the complex sine-Gordon Lagrangian and its sinh-Gordon counterpart. We determine the corresponding fermionic part and discuss possible existence of hidden 2d supersymmetry in the reduced action. We also elaborate on some general aspects of the Pohlmeyer reduction applied to the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring.
