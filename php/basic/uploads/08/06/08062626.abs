Abstract: Solutions of five dimensional minimal de Sitter supergravity admitting Killing spinors are considered. It is shown that the "timelike'' solutions are determined in terms of a four dimensional hyper-Kahler torsion (HKT) manifold. If the HKT manifold is conformally hyper-Kahler the most general solution can be obtained from a sub-class of supersymmetric solutions of minimal N=2 ungauged supergravity, by means of a simple transformation. Examples include a multi-BMPV de Sitter solution, describing multiple rotating black holes co-moving with the expansion of the universe. If the HKT manifold is not conformally hyper-Kahler, examples admitting a tri-holomorphic Killing vector field are constructed in terms of certain solutions of three dimensional Einstein-Weyl geometry.
