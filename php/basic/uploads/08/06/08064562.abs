Abstract: We propose an effective model of strongly coupled gauge theory at finite temperature on $R^3$ in the presence of an infrared cutoff. It is constructed by considering the theory on $S^3$ with an infrared cutoff and then taking the size of the $S^3$ to infinity while keeping the cutoff fixed. This model reproduces various qualitative features expected from its gravity dual.
