Title: Dimensional reduction as a method to obtain dual theories for massive  spin two in arbitray dimensions
Authors: A. Khoudeir and R. Montemayor and Luis F. Urrutia
Abstract: Using the parent Lagrangian method together with a dimensional reduction from $D$ to $(D-1)$ dimensions we construct dual theories for massive spin two fields in arbitrary dimensions in terms of a mixed symmetry tensor $T_{A[A_{1}A_{2}... A_{D-2}]}$. Our starting point is the well studied massless parent action in dimension $D$. The resulting massive Stueckelberg-like parent actions in $(D-1)$ dimensions inherits all the gauge symmetries of the original massless action and can be gauge fixed in two alternative ways, yielding the possibility of having either a parent action with a symmetric or a non-symmetric Fierz-Pauli field $e_{AB}$. Even though the dual sector in terms of the standard spin two field includes only the symmetrical part $e_{\{AB\}}$ in both cases, these two possibilities yield different results in terms of the alternative dual field $T_{A[A_{1}A_{2}... A_{D-2}]}$. In particular, the non-symmetric case reproduces the Freund-Curtright action as the dual to the massive spin two field action in four dimensions.
