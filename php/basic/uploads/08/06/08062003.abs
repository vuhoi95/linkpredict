Title: Worldsheet theories for non-geometric string backgrounds
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Nikolaos Prezas
Abstract: We show that twisted doubled tori can be used to construct a general class of worldsheet models describing non-geometric string backgrounds. By employing a first order formulation of interacting chiral bosons, we first refine the analysis on the general conditions of worldsheet Lorentz invariance and then prove that twisted doubled tori provide good duality symmetric backgrounds. Subsequently we apply our general analysis to several examples which enable us to gain new insight on the difference between geometric, locally geometric and genuine non-geometric backgrounds.
