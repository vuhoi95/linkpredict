Title: Quasi-Normal Modes in Topologically Massive Gravity
Authors: Ivo Sachs and Sergey N. Solodukhin
Abstract: We determine the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum for tensor perturbations in topologically massive AdS-gravity. In the special case of chiral gravity quasi-normal modes are absent despite of the presence of a horizon. In the process we uncover a simple algebraic structure in the quasi normal modes spectrum: the tower of QNM's consists of descendents of a "chiral highest weight'' QNM which in turn satisfies a first order equation.
