Title: Magnetized baryonic matter in holographic QCD
Authors: Ethan G. Thompson and Dam T. Son
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the Sakai-Sugimoto model at finite magnetic field and baryon chemical potentials. We show that in a finite magnetic field, there exists a spatially homogeneous configuration carrying finite baryon number density. At low magnetic field and baryon chemical potential the equation of state of the matter coincides with that obtained from the chiral perturbation theory Lagrangian with an anomalous term. We discuss the behavior of the system at larger magnetic fields.
