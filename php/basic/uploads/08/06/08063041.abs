Title: Baryonic matter in holographic QCD
Authors: Kanabu Nawa and Hideo Suganuma and Toru Kojo
Abstract: We study baryons and baryonic matter in holographic QCD with $D4/D8/\bar{D8}$ multi-$D$ brane system. In large-$N_c$ holographic QCD, the baryon appears as a topologically non-trivial chiral soliton, which is called ``brane-induced Skyrmion''. We also analyze the features of the baryonic matter in holographic QCD by investigating the system of single brane-induced Skyrmion on a three-dimensional closed manifold $S^3$. We propose a new interesting picture of ``pion dominance'' near the critical density.
