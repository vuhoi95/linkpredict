Title: Spin Chains in N=6 Superconformal Chern-Simons-Matter Theory
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Simone Giombi and Xi Yin
Abstract: In this note we study spin chain operators in the N=6 Chern-Simons-matter theory recently proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena to be dual to type IIA string theory in AdS4xCP3. We study the two-loop dilatation operator in the gauge theory, and compare to the Penrose limit on the string theory side.
