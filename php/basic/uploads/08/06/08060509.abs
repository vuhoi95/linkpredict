Title: Complete and Consistent Non-Minimal String Corrections to Supergravity
Authors: S. Bellucci and D. O'Reilly
Abstract: We give a complete and consistent solution to string corrected (deformed), D=10, N=1 supergravity as the non-minimal low energy limit of string theory. We solve the Bianchi identities with suitable constraints to second order in the string slope parameter. In so doing we pave the way for continuing the study of the many applications of these results. We also modify, reaffirm and correct a previously given incomplete solution, and we introduce an important adjustment to the known first order results.
