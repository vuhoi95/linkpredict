Title: Lorentz-Covariant Non-Abelian Gauging of Supermembrane
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We perform the Lorentz-covariant non-Abelian gauging of supermembrane (M-2 brane) action. This is a generalization of our previous work based on teleparallel formulation, in which Lorentz covariance was not manifest. We introduce the Killing supervector \xi^{A I} with the adjoint index I for a non-Abelian gauge group H. This formulation is applicable to the compactification of supermembrane from eleven dimensions into D dimensions, such as H = SO(11-D) for the compactification M_{11} \to S^{11-D} \times M_D (1\le D \le 9).
