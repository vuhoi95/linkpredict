Title: An Infinite Number of Static Soliton Solutions to the 5D  Einstein-Maxwell Equations with a Dilaton Field
Authors: Takahiro Azuma and Takao Koikawa
Abstract: We study the 5D static Einstein-Maxwell equations with a dilaton field. We construct an infinte number of solutions by using a soliton technique. We study the rod structure of 2-soliton solution and show the 5D dilatonic black ring and black hole solutions are included.
