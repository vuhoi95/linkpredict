Abstract: We study baryons in SU(N) gauge theories at finite temperature according to the gauge/string correspondence based on IIB string theory. The baryon is constructed out of D5 brane and $N$ fundamental strings to form a color singlet $N$-quark bound state. At finite temperature and in the deconfining phase, we could find $k(<N)$-quark ``baryons''. Thermal properties of such $k$-quark baryons and also of the $N$-quark baryon are examined. We study the temperature dependence of color screening distance and Debye length of the baryon of $k$-quark and $N$-quark. We also estimate the melting temperature, where the baryons decay into quarks and gluons completely.
