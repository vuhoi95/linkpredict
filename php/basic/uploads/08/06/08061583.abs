Title: Charged-Rotating Black Holes in Higher-dimensional (A)DS-Gravity
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate
Abstract: We present numerical evidences for the existence of rotating black hole solutions in d-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant and for $d$ odd. The metric used possesses $(d+1)/2$ Killing vectors and the solutions have $(d-1)/2$ equal angular momenta. A Schwarschild-type coordinate is used for the radial variable and both signs of the cosmological constant are emphasized. Several properties of the solutions are studied, namely their surface gravity, mass and angular momentum as functions of two parameters: the magnetic field and the angular velocity at the horizon. The influence of the electromagnetic field on the domain of existence of the black holes is studied are compared to the vacuum case where analytic solutions are available.
