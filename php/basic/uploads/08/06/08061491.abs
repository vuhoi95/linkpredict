Title: N-point functions in rolling tachyon background
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matti Jarvinen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri
Abstract: We study n-point boundary correlation functions in Timelike Boundary Liouville theory, relevant for open string multiproduction by a decaying unstable D-brane. We give an exact result for the one-point function of the tachyon vertex operator and show that it is consistent with a previously proposed relation to a conserved charge in string theory. We also discuss when the one-point amplitude vanishes. Using a straightforward perturbative expansion, we find an explicit expression for a tachyon n-point amplitude for all n, however the result is still a toy model. The calculation uses a new asymptotic approximation for Toeplitz determinants, derived by relating the system to a Dyson gas at finite temperature.
