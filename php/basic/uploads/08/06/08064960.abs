Title: Ample D4-D2-D0 Decay
Authors: Evgeny Andriyash and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: We study the wall-crossing behavior of the index of BPS states for D4-D2-D0 brane systems on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold at large radius and point out that not only is the ``BPS index at large radius'' chamber-dependent, but that the changes in the index can be large in the sense that they dominate single-centered black hole entropy. We discuss implications for the weak coupling OSV conjecture. We also analyze the near horizon limit of multicentered solutions, introduced in arXiv:0802.2257, for these particular configurations and comment on a general criterion, conjectured in arXiv:0802.2257, which identifies those multicentered solutions whose near horizon limit corresponds to a geometry with a single asymptotic AdS_3 x S^2 boundary.
