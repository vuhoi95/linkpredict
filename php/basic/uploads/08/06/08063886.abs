Title: One-loop $Î²$ functions of a translation-invariant renormalizable  noncommutative scalar model
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Adrian Tanasa
Abstract: Recently, a new type of renormalizable $\phi^{\star 4}_{4}$ scalar model on the Moyal space was proved to be perturbatively renormalizable. It is translation-invariant and introduces in the action a $a/(\theta^2p^2)$ term. We calculate here the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ functions at one-loop level for this model. The coupling constant $\beta_\lambda$ function is proved to have the same behaviour as the one of the $\phi^4$ model on the commutative $\mathbb{R}^4$. The $\beta_a$ function of the new parameter $a$ is also calculated. Some interpretation of these results are done.
