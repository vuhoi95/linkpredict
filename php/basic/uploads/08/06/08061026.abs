Title: Higher derivative corrections to R-charged AdS_5 black holes and field  redefinitions
Authors: James T. Liu and Phillip Szepietowski
Abstract: We consider four-derivative corrections to the bosonic sector of five-dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity. Since this theory includes the N=2 graviphoton, we consider both curvature and graviphoton field-strength terms that show up at the four-derivative level. We construct, to linear order, the higher-derivative corrections to the non-rotating R-charged AdS_5 black hole and demonstrate how this solution transforms under field redefinitions.
