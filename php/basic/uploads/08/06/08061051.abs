Abstract: We study M-theory compactified on a specific class of seven-dimensional manifolds with SU(3) structure. The manifolds can be viewed as a fibration of an arbitrary Calabi-Yau threefold over a circle, with a U-duality twist around the circle. In some cases we find that in the four dimensional low energy effective theory a (broken) non-Abelian gauge group appears. Furthermore, such compactifications are shown to be dual to previously analyzed compactifications of the heterotic string on K3 x T^2, with background gauge field fluxes on the T^2.
