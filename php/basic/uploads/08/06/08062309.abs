Title: Pair creation in non-extremal fuzzball geometries
Authors: Borun D. Chowdhury and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: It is possible to construct a special family of nonextremal black hole microstates. These microstates are unstable, and emit radiation at a rate which is found to exactly equal the Hawking radiation rate predicted for them by the dual CFT. In this paper we analyze in more detail the nature of the radiation created by these unstable modes. The energy and angular momentum of the mode is found to be localized in two regions: one near infinity corresponding to the emitted quanta, and the other in the ergoregion which is deep inside the interior of the geometry. The energy and angular momenta are equal and opposite for these two contributions, as expected for emission from ergoregions. We conjecture that more general nonextremal microstates will possess ergoregions (with no axial symmetry), and radiation from these regions can be part of the general Hawking emission for the microstates.
