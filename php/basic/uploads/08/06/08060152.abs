Title: On the spectra of scalar mesons from HQCD models
Authors: Oded Mintakevich and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: We determine the holographic spectra of scalar mesons from the fluctuations of the embedding of flavor D-brane probes in HQCD models. The models we consider include a generalization of the Sakai Sugimoto model at zero temperature and at the "high-temperature intermediate phase", where the system is in a deconfining phase while admitting chiral symmetry breaking and a non-critical 6d model at zero temperature. All these models are based on backgrounds associated with near extremal N_c D4 branes and a set of N_f<<N_c flavor probe branes that admit geometrical chiral symmetry breaking. We point out that the spectra of these models include a 0^{--} branch which does not show up in nature. At zero temperature we found that the masses of the mesons M_n depend on the "constituent quark mass" parameter m^c_q and on the excitation number n as M_n^2 m^c_q and M^2_n n^{1.7} for the ten dimensional case and as M_n m^c_q and M_n n^{0.75} in the non-critical case. At the high temperature intermediate phase we detect a decrease of the masses of low spin mesons as a function of the temperature similar to holographic vector mesons and to lattice calculations.
