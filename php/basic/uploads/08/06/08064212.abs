Title: Partition Functions for Membrane Theories
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Noppadol Mekareeya and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: Partition functions for M2-brane theories in various backgrounds are computed. We consider in particular configurations of membranes at orbifold singularities preserving N=5 or N=6 supersymmetry. The worldvolume membrane theory for some of these configurations has been recently constructed in terms of N=6 Chern-Simons theories. The detailed structure of the partition functions as well as their transformation rules under the R-symmetry are explicitly computed using the Plethystic Programme.
