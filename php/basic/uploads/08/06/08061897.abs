Title: Thermodynamics of Plasmaballs and Plasmarings in 3+1 Dimensions
Authors: Shanthanu Bhardwaj and Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya
Abstract: We study localized plasma configurations in 3+1 dimensional massive field theories obtained by Scherk-Schwarz compactification of 4+1 dimensional CFT to predict the thermodynamic properties of localized blackholes and blackrings in Scherk-Schwarz compactified $AdS_6$ using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We present an exact solution to the relativistic Navier-Stokes equation in the thin ring limit of the fluid configuration. We also perform a thorough numerical analysis to obtain the thermodynamic properties of the most general solution. Finally we compare our results with the recent proposal for the phase diagram of blackholes in six flat dimensions and find some similarities but other differences.
