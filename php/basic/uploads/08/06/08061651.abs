Title: Instabilities in Thermal Gravity with a Cosmological Constant
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel
Abstract: It is shown that in quantum gravity at finite temperature, the effective potential evaluated in the tadpole approximation can have a local minimum below a certain critical temperature. However, when the leading higher order thermal loop corrections are included, one finds that no static solution exists at high temperature.
