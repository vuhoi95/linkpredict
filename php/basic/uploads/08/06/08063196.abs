Title: d=4 Attractors, Effective Horizon Radius and Fake Supergravity
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Gnecchi and A. Marrani
Abstract: We consider extremal black hole attractors (both BPS and non-BPS) for N=3 and N=5 supergravity in d=4 space-time dimensions. Attractors for matter-coupled N=3 theory are similar to attractors in N=2 supergravity minimally coupled to Abelian vector multiplets. On the other hand, N=5 attractors are similar to attractors in N=4 pure supergravity, and in such theories only 1\N-BPS non-degenerate solutions exist. All the above mentioned theories have a simple interpretation in the first order (fake supergravity) formalism. Furthermore, such theories do not have a d=5 uplift. Finally we comment on the "duality" relations among the attractor solutions of N\geq2 supergravities sharing the same full bosonic sector.
