Title: Turbulence and Holography
Authors: Vishnu Jejjala and Djordje Minic and Y. Jack Ng and Chia-Hsiung Tze
Abstract: We examine the interplay between recent advances in quantum gravity and the problem of turbulence. In particular, we argue that in the gravitational context the phenomenon of turbulence is intimately related to the properties of spacetime foam. In this framework we discuss the relation of turbulence and holography and the interpretation of the Kolmogorov scaling in the quantum gravitational setting.
