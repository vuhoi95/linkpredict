Title: Magnetized orbifold models
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We study (4+2n)-dimensional N=1 super Yang-Mills theory on the orbifold background with non-vanishing magnetic flux. In particular, we study zero-modes of spinor fields. The flavor structure of our models is different from one in magnetized torus models, and would be interesting in realistic model building.
