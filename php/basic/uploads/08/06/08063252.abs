Title: On Matrix Model Formulations of Noncommutative Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Masanori Hanada and Tomoyoshi Hirata
Abstract: We study stability of noncommutative spaces in matrix models and discuss the continuum limit which leads to noncommutative Yang-Mills theories (NCYM). It turns out that most of noncommutative spaces in bosonic models are unstable. This indicates perturbative instability of fuzzy R^D pointed out by Van Raamsdonk and Armoni et al. persists to nonperturbative level in these cases. In this sense, these bosonic NCYM are not well-defined, or at least their matrix model formulations studied in this paper do not work. We also show that noncommutative backgrounds are stable in a supersymmetric matrix model deformed by a cubic Myers term, though the deformation itself breaks supersymmetry.
