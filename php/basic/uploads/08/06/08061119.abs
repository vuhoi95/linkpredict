Title: Entropy of charged dilaton-axion black hole
Authors: Tanwi Ghosh and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: Using brick wall method the entropy of charged dilaton-axion black hole is determined for both asymptotically flat and non-flat cases. The entropy turns out to be proportional to the horizon area of the black hole confirming the Beckenstien, Hawking area-entropy formula for black holes. The leading order logarithmic corrections to the entropy are also derived for such black holes.
