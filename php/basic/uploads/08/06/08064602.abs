Title: Nonlinear viscous hydrodynamics in various dimensions using AdS/CFT
Authors: Michael Haack and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We compute coefficients of two-derivative terms in the hydrodynamic energy momentum tensor of a viscous fluid which has an AdS_D dual with D between 3 and 7. For the case of D=3 we obtain an exact AdS_3 black hole solution, valid to all orders in a derivative expansion, dual to a perfect fluid in 1+1 dimensions.
