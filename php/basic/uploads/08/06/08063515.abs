Title: Ternary Virasoro - Witt Algebra
Authors: Thomas L Curtright and David B Fairlie and Cosmas K Zachos
Abstract: A 3-bracket variant of the Virasoro-Witt algebra is constructed through the use of su(1,1) enveloping algebra techniques. The Leibniz rules for 3-brackets acting on other 3-brackets in the algebra are discussed and verified in various situations.
