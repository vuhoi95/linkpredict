Title: Polymer Quantum Dynamics of the Taub Universe
Authors: Marco Valerio Battisti and Orchidea Maria Lecian and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: Within the framework of non-standard (Weyl) representations of the canonical commutation relations, we investigate the polymer quantization of the Taub cosmological model. The Taub model is analyzed within the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner reduction of its dynamics, by which a time variable arises. While the energy variable and its conjugate momentum are treated as ordinary Heisenberg operators, the anisotropy variable and its conjugate momentum are represented by the polymer technique. The model is analyzed at both classical and quantum level. As a result, classical trajectories flatten with respect to the potential wall, and the cosmological singularity is not probabilistically removed. In fact, the dynamics of the wave packets is characterized by an interference phenomenon, which, however, is not able to stop the evolution towards the classical singularity.
