Title: Local Heterotic Torsional Models
Authors: Ji-Xiang Fu and Li-Sheng Tseng and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We present a class of smooth supersymmetric heterotic solutions with a non-compact Eguchi-Hanson space. The non-compact geometry is embedded as the base of a six-dimensional non-Kahler manifold with a non-trivial torus fiber. We solve the non-linear anomaly equation in this background exactly. We also define a new charge that detects the non-Kahlerity of our solutions.
