Title: New Charged Black Holes in Five Dimensions
Authors: H. Lu and Jianwei Mei and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We obtain new stationary charged solutions of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We first obtain purely dipole charged solutions, by extending a technique that we developed for five-dimensional Ricci-flat metrics in a previous paper, which could be viewed as being analogous to a four-dimensional construction by Demianski and Plebanski. The further introduction of electric charge is achieved by means of a solution-generating technique, which exploits the global SL(2,R) symmetry of five-dimensional minimal supergravity reduced on a timelike direction to four dimensions. We present this procedure in detail, since it provides a particularly simple general way of adding charge to any stationary solution of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. The new charged solutions we obtain limit in special cases to black rings carrying electric and magnetic dipole charge, or to charged Myers-Perry rotating black holes. We analyse the general solutions in detail, showing that they can describe asymptotically locally flat black holes whose horizon is a lens space L(n;m)=S^3/\Gamma(n;m). At infinity they approach Minkowski_5/\Gamma(m;n).
