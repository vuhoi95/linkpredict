Title: Recoherence by Squeezed States in Electron Interferometry
Authors: Jen-Tsung Hsiang and L. H. Ford
Abstract: Coherent electrons coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field undergo decoherence which can be viewed as due either to fluctuations of the Aharonov-Bohm phase or to photon emission. When the electromagnetic field is in a squeezed vacuum state, it is possible for this decoherence to be reduced, leading to the phenomenon of recoherence. This recoherence effect requires electrons which are emitted at selected times during the cycle of the excited mode of the electromagnetic field. We show that there are bounds on the degree of recoherence which are analogous to quantum inequality restriction on negative energy densities in quantum field theory. We make some estimates of the degree of recoherence, and show that although small, it may be observable.
