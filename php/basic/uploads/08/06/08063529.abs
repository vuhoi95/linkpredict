Title: Geometric phases and quantum phase transitions in open systems
Authors: Alexander I. Nesterov and S. G. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: The relationship between quantum phase transition and complex geometric phase for open quantum system governed by the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian with the accidental crossing of the eigenvalues is established. In particular, the geometric phase associated with the ground state of the one-dimensional dissipative Ising model in a transverse magnetic field is evaluated, and it is demonstrated that related quantum phase transition is of the first order.
