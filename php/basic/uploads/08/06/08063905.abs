Title: From strings to the MSSM
Authors: Hans Peter Nilles and Saul Ramos-Sanchez and Michael Ratz and Patrick K. S. Vaudrevange
Abstract: We review recent progress in embedding the supersymmetric standard model into string theory. We discuss how, with the incorporation of certain aspects of grand unification, a search strategy can be developed that allows to efficiently find rather large numbers of promising string vacua. Global string-derived models with the following features are discussed: (i) exact MSSM spectrum below the unification scale; (ii) R parity; (iii) hierarchical Yukawa couplings with non-trivial mixing; (iv) solution to the mu problem; (v) see-saw suppressed neutrino masses.
