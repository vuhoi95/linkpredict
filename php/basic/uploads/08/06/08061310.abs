Title: Acceleration-extended Newton-Hooke symmetry and its dynamical  realization
Authors: Fu-Li Liu and Yu Tian
Abstract: Newton-Hooke group is the nonrelativistic limit of de Sitter (anti-de Sitter) group, which can be enlarged with transformations that describe constant acceleration, as well as central charges. We consider a higher order Lagrangian that is quasi-invariant under the acceleration-extended Newton-Hooke symmetry, and obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger equation quantizing the Hamiltonian corresponding to its first order form. We show that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is invariant under the acceleration-extended Newton-Hooke transformations. We also discuss briefly the exotic conformal Newton-Hooke symmetry in 2+1 dimension.
