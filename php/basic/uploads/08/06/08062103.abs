Title: Finite-size effects in the superconformal beta-deformed N=4 SYM
Authors: F. Fiamberti and A. Santambrogio and C. Sieg and D. Zanon
Abstract: We study finite size effects for composite operators in the SU(2) sector of the superconformal beta-deformed N=4 SYM theory. In particular we concentrate on the spectrum of one single magnon. Since in this theory one-impurity states are non BPS we compute their anomalous dimensions including wrapping contributions up to four loops and discuss higher order effects.
