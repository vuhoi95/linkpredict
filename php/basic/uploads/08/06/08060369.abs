Abstract: We compute of the lowest order quantum radiative correction to the mass of the kink in $\phi^4$ theory in 1+1 dimensions using an alternative renormalization procedure which has been introduced earlier. We use the standard mode number cutoff in conjunction with the above program. Our results show a small correction to the previously reported values.[The paper has been withdraw by the authors because a new version is been written to better emphasize on renormalization in problems with nontrivial background. The new version has been submitted by our new co-author (arXiv:1205.2775).]
