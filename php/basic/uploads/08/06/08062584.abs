Title: Multiple Membranes from Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Mees de Roo and Olaf Hohm and Diederik Roest
Abstract: Starting from gauged N=8 supergravity in three dimensions we construct actions for multiple membranes by taking the limit to global supersymmetry for different choices of the embedding tensor. This provides a general framework that reproduces many recent results on multiple membrane actions as well as generalisations thereof. As examples we discuss conformal (non-conformal) gaugings leading to multiple M2-branes (D2-branes) and massive deformations of these systems.
