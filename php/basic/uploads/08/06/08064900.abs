Title: A note on Quantum Aspects of Multiple Membranes
Authors: James Bedford and David Berman
Abstract: In this note we investigate quantum aspects of the newly proposed theory of multiple membranes put forward by Bagger and Lambert. In particular we analyse the possibility of a finite renormalisation of the coupling at one loop.
