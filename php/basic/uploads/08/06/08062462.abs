Title: Chiral bosons on Bargmann space associated with A$_r$ Statistics
Authors: M. Daoud and A. Hamama
Abstract: We consider a large collection of particles obeying $A_r$ statistics. The system behaves like a quantum droplet characterized by a constant Husimi distribution. We show that the excitations of this system live on the boundary of the droplet and they are described by an effective chiral boson action generalizing the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory in two dimension. Our analysis is based on the Fock-Bargmann analytical representations associated to $A_r$ statistics. The quantization of the theory describing the dynamics on the edge is achieved. As by product, we prove that the edge excitations are given by a tensorial product of $r$ abelian bosonic fields.
