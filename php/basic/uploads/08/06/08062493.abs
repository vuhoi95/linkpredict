Title: Congruence Subgroups and Generalized Frobenius-Schur Indicators
Authors: Siu-Hung Ng and Peter Schauenburg
Abstract: We introduce generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators for pivotal categories. In a spherical fusion category C, an equivariant indicator of an object in C is defined as a functional on the Grothendieck algebra of the quantum double Z(C) via generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. The set of all equivariant indicators admits a natural action of the modular group. Using the properties of equivariant indicators, we prove a congruence subgroup theorem for modular categories. As a consequence, all modular representations of a modular category have finite images, and they satisfy a conjecture of Eholzer. In addition, we obtain two formulae for the generalized indicators, one of them a generalization of Bantay's second indicator formula for a rational conformal field theory. This formula implies a conjecture of Pradisi-Sagnotti-Stanev, as well as a conjecture of Borisov-Halpern-Schweigert.
