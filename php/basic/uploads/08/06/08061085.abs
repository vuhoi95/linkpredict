Title: Finite-size Effects for Single Spike
Authors: Changrim Ahn and P. Bozhilov
Abstract: We use the reduction of the string dynamics on R_t x S^3 to the Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system to map all string solutions described by this dynamical system onto solutions of the complex sine-Gordon integrable model. This mapping relates the parameters in the solutions on both sides of the correspondence. In the framework of this approach, we find finite-size string solutions, their images in the (complex) sine-Gordon system, and the leading finite-size effects of the single spike "E-\Delta\phi" relation for both R_t x S^2 and R_t x S^3 cases.
