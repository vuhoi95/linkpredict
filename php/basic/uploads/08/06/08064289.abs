Title: Deterministic Dense Coding and Faithful Teleportation with Multipartite  Graph States
Authors: Ching-Yu Huang and I-Ching Yu and Feng-Li Lin and Li-Yi Hsu
Abstract: We proposed novel schemes to perform the deterministic dense coding and faithful teleportation with multipartite graph states. We also find the sufficient and necessary condition of a viable graph state for the proposed scheme. That is, for the associated graph, the reduced adjacency matrix of the Tanner-type subgraph between senders and receivers should be invertible.
