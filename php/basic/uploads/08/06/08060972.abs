Title: Thermal photon dispersion law and modified black-body spectra
Authors: Josef Ludescher and Ralf Hofmann
Abstract: Based on the postulate that photon propagation is governed by an SU(2) gauge principle we numerically compute the one-loop dispersion for thermalized photon propagation on the radiatively induced mass shell. Formerly, the dispersion was addressed by assuming $p^2=0$. While this approximation turns out to be excellent for temperatures $\le 2 T_{\tiny{CMB}}$ the exact result exhibits a much faster (power-like) shrinking of the gap in the black-body spectral intensity with rising temperature. Our previous statements on anomalous large-angle CMB temperature-temperature correlations, obtained in the approximation $p^2=0$, remain valid.
