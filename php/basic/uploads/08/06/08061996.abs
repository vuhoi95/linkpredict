Title: On explicit free field realizations of current algebras
Authors: Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We construct the explicit free field representations of the current algebras $so(2n)_k$, $so(2n+1)_k$ and $sp(2n)_k$ for a generic positive integer $n$ and an arbitrary level $k$. The corresponding energy-momentum tensors and screening currents of the first kind are also given in terms of free fields.
