Authors: Mechthild Huebscher and Patrick Meessen and Tomas Ortin and Silvia Vaula
Abstract: We find the general form of all the supersymmetric configurations and solutions of N=2,d=4 Einstein-Yang-Mills theories. In the timelike case, which we study in great detail, giving many examples, the solutions to the full supergravity equations can be constructed from known flat spacetime solutions of the Bogomol'nyi equations. This allows the regular supersymmetric embedding in supergravity of regular monopole solutions ('t Hooft-Poyakov's, Weinberg's, Wilkinson and Bais's) but also embeddings of irregular solutions to the Bogomol'nyi equations which turn out to be regular black holes with different forms of non-Abelian hair once the non-triviality of the spacetime metric is taken into account. The attractor mechanism is realized in a gauge-covariant way. In the null case we determine the general equations that supersymmetric configurations and solutions must satisfy but we do not find relevant new supersymmetric solutions.
