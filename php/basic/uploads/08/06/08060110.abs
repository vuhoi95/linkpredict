Title: Universal conductivity and central charges
Authors: Pavel Kovtun and Adam Ritz
Abstract: We discuss a class of critical models in d>1+1 dimensions whose electrical conductivity and charge susceptibility are fixed by the central charge in a universal manner. We comment on possible bounds on conductivity, as suggested by holographic duality.
