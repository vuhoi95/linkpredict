Title: Description of D-branes invariant under the Poisson-Lie T-plurality
Authors: Ladislav Hlavaty and Libor Snobl
Abstract: We write the conditions for open strings with charged endpoints in the language of gluing matrices. We identify constraints imposed on the gluing matrices that are essential in this setup and investigate the question of their invariance under the Poisson-Lie T-plurality transformations. We show that the chosen set of constraints is equivalent to the statement that the lifts of D-branes into the Drinfel'd double are right cosets with respect to a maximally isotropic subgroup and therefore it is invariant under the Poisson-Lie T-plurality transformations.
