Title: Aspects of Diffeomorphism and Conformal invariance in classical  Liouville theory
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Shailesh Kulkarni
Abstract: The interplay between the diffeomorphism and conformal symmetries (a feature common in quantum field theories) is shown to be exhibited for the case of black holes in two dimensional classical Liouville theory. We show that although the theory is conformally invariant in the near horizon limit, there is a breaking of the diffeomorphism symmetry at the classical level. On the other hand, in the region away from the horizon, the conformal symmetry of the theory gets broken with the diffeomorphism symmetry remaining intact.
