Title: Free field realization of the $osp(2n|2n)$ current algebra
Authors: Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: The $osp(2n|2n)$ current algebra for a {\it generic} positive integer $n$ at general level $k$ is investigated. Its free field representation and corresponding energy-momentum tensor are constructed. The associated screening currents of the first kind are also presented.
