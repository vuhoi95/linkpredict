Title: Is Confinement a Phase of Broken Dual Gauge Symmetry?
Authors: J. Greensite and B. Lucini
Abstract: We study whether broken dual gauge symmetry, as detected by a monopole order parameter introduced by the Pisa group, is necessarily associated with the confinement phase of a lattice gauge theory. We find a number of examples, including SU(2) gauge-Higgs theory, mixed fundamental-adjoint SU(2) gauge theory, and pure SU(5) gauge theory, which appear to indicate a dual gauge symmetry transition in the absence of a transition to or from a confined phase. While these results are not necessarily fatal to the dual superconductor hypothesis, they may pose some problems of interpretation for the present formulation of the Pisa monopole criterion.
