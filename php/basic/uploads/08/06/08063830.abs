Title: Dynamical holographic QCD with area-law confinement and linear Regge  trajectories
Authors: W. de Paula and T. Frederico and H. Forkel and M. Beyer
Abstract: We construct a new solution of five-dimensional gravity coupled to a dilaton which encodes essential features of holographic QCD backgrounds dynamically. In particular, it implements linear confinement, i.e. the area law behavior of the Wilson loop, by means of a dynamically deformed anti-de Sitter metric. The predicted square masses of the light-flavored natural-parity mesons and their excitations lie on linear trajectories of approximately universal slope with respect to both radial and spin quantum numbers and are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data.
