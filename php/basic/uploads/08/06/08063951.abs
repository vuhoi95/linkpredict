Title: The Bethe ansatz for superconformal Chern-Simons
Authors: J. A. Minahan and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We study the anomalous dimensions for scalar operators for a three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory recently proposed in arXiv:0806.1218. We show that the mixing matrix at two-loop order is that for an integrable Hamiltonian of an SU(4) spin chain with sites alternating between the fundamental and the anti-fundamental representations. We find a set of Bethe equations from which the anomalous dimensions can be determined and give a proposal for the Bethe equations to the full superconformal group of OSp(2,2|6).
