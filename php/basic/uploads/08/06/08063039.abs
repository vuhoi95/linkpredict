Title: Millions of Standard Models on Z6-prime?
Authors: Florian Gmeiner and Gabriele Honecker
Abstract: Using previous results on the statistics of intersecting D6-brane models on T^6/Z_6' we analyse solutions that resemble the gauge group and matter content of the supersymmetric standard model. In particular the structure of the hidden sector, the gauge coupling constants and chiral exotic matter content are computed and classified for all possible standard model-like configurations on this background. It turns out that the number of chiral exotics, Higgses and values of gauge couplings are strongly correlated. Some examples with the chiral spectrum of the supersymmetric standard model plus vector-like states and a massless U(1) B-L are discussed in detail.
