Title: On Cancellations of Ultraviolet Divergences in Supergravity Amplitudes
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: Concrete calculations have pointed out that amplitudes in perturbative gravity exhibit unanticipated cancellations taming their ultraviolet behaviour independently of supersymmetry. Similar ultraviolet behaviour of N=4 super-Yang-Mills and N=8 maximal supergravity has explicitly been observed until three loops. These cancellations can be connected to two manifest features of gravitational theories: firstly gauge invariance from diffeomorphism symmetries and secondly that amplitudes are colourless and exhibits crossing symmetry. We will give a simple physical explanation of the cancellations exhibited in gravity amplitudes. We will discuss these two properties in turn as well as the role of supersymmetry and string theory dualities in the structure of multiloop amplitudes in supergravity.
