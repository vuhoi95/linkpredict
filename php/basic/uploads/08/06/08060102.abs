Title: GUTs and Exceptional Branes in F-theory - II: Experimental Predictions
Authors: Chris Beasley and Jonathan J. Heckman and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We consider realizations of GUT models in F-theory. Adopting a bottom up approach, the assumption that the dynamics of the GUT model can in principle decouple from Planck scale physics leads to a surprisingly predictive framework. An internal U(1) hypercharge flux Higgses the GUT group directly to the MSSM or to a flipped GUT model, a mechanism unavailable in heterotic models. This new ingredient automatically addresses a number of puzzles present in traditional GUT models. The internal U(1) hyperflux allows us to solve the doublet-triplet splitting problem, and explains the qualitative features of the distorted GUT mass relations for lighter generations due to the Aharanov-Bohm effect. These models typically come with nearly exact global symmetries which prevent bare mu terms and also forbid dangerous baryon number violating operators. Strong curvature around our brane leads to a repulsion mechanism for Landau wave functions for neutral fields. This leads to large hierarchies of the form exp(-c/B^(2*g)) where c and g are order one parameters and B ~ M_(GUT)/(M_(pl)*alpha_(GUT)). This effect can simultaneously generate a viably small mu term as well as an acceptable Dirac neutrino mass on the order of 0.5 * 10^(-2 +/- 0.5) eV. In another scenario, we find a modified seesaw mechanism which predicts that the light neutrinos have masses in the expected range while the Majorana mass term for the heavy neutrinos is ~ 3 * 10^(12 +/- 1.5) GeV. Communicating supersymmetry breaking to the MSSM can be elegantly realized through gauge mediation. In one scenario, the same repulsion mechanism also leads to messenger masses which are naturally much lighter than the GUT scale.
