Abstract: It has been suggested that the quantum generalization of the Wald entropy for an extremal black hole is the logarithm of the ground state degeneracy of a dual quantum mechanics in a fixed charge sector. We test this proposal for supersymmetric extremal BTZ black holes for which there is an independent definition of the quantum entropy as the logarithm of the degeneracy of appropriate states in the dual 1+1 dimensional superconformal field theory. We find that the two proposals agree. This analysis also suggests a possible route to deriving the OSV conjecture.
