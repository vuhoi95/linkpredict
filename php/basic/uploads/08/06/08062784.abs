Title: Integrable theory of quantum transport in chaotic cavities
Authors: Vladimir Al. Osipov and Eugene Kanzieper
Abstract: The problem of quantum transport in chaotic cavities with broken time-reversal symmetry is shown to be completely integrable in the universal limit. This observation is utilised to determine the cumulants and the distribution function of conductance for a cavity with ideal leads supporting an arbitrary number $n$ of propagating modes. Expressed in terms of solutions to the fifth Painlev\'e transcendent and/or the Toda lattice equation, the conductance distribution is further analysed in the large-$n$ limit that reveals long exponential tails in the otherwise Gaussian curve.
