Authors: J. Kluson and Bum-Hoon Lee and Kamal L. Panigrahi and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We study the solutions for fundamental string rotating in a background generated by a 1+1 dimensional intersection of two orthogonal stacks of fivebranes in type IIB string theory. We show the existence of magnon like solutions for the string moving simultaneously in the two spheres in this background and find the relevant dispersion relation among the various conserved charges.
