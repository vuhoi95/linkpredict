Abstract: This paper deals with situations that illustrate how the violation of Lorentz symmetry in the gauge sector may contribute to magnetic moment generation of massive neutral particles with spin-1/2 and spin-1. The procedure we adopt here is based on Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. We work out the non-relativistic regime that follows from the wave equation corresponding to a certain particle coupled to an external electromagnetic field and a background that accounts for the Lorentz symmetry violation, and we read thereby the magnetic dipole moment operator for the particle under consideration.We keep track of the parameters that govern the non-minimal electromagnetic coupling and the breaking of Lorentz symmetry in the expressions we get for the magnetic moments in the different cases we contemplate. Our claim is that the tiny magnetic dipole moment of truly elementary neutral particles might signal Lorentz symmetry violation.
