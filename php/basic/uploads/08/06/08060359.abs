Title: Inconsistencies of a purported probability current in the  Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory
Authors: T. R. Cardoso and L. B. Castro and A. S. de Castro
Abstract: The Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation with a square step potential is used in a simple way with polymorphic purposes. It proves adequate to refuse a proposed new current that is currently interpreted as a probability current,to show that the Klein paradox does exist in the DKP theory and to revise other minor misconceptions diffused in the literature.
