Title: Issues of duality in Abelian Gauge Theory and in Linearized Gravity
Authors: J. A. Nieto and E. A. Leon
Abstract: We start by describing two of the main proposals for duality in Abelian gauge theories, namely $F$(ield strength)-duality approach and the $S$% -duality formalism. We then discuss how $F$-duality and $S$-duality can be applied to the case of linearized gravity. By emphasizing the similarities and differences between these two type of dualities we explore the possibility of combining them in just one duality formalism.
