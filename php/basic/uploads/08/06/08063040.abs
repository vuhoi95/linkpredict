Title: Baryons with holography
Authors: Kanabu Nawa and Hideo Suganuma and Toru Kojo
Abstract: We perform the first study of baryons in holographic QCD with $D4/D8/\bar{D8}$ multi-$D$ brane system in type IIA superstring theory. The baryon is described as a chiral soliton solution in the four-dimensional meson effective action derived from holographic QCD. We also present a brief review of the holographic model from the viewpoints of recent hadron physics and QCD phenomenologies.
