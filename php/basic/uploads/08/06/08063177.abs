Title: Noncommutative resolutions of ADE fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds
Authors: Alexander Quintero Velez and Alex Boer
Abstract: In this paper we construct noncommutative resolutions of a certain class of Calabi-Yau threefolds studied by F. Cachazo, S. Katz and C. Vafa. The threefolds under consideration are fibered over a complex plane with the fibers being deformed Kleinian singularities. The construction is in terms of a noncommutative algebra introduced by V. Ginzburg, which we call the "N=1 ADE quiver algebra".
