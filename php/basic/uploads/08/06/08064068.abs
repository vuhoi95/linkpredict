Title: A Non-Supersymmetric Large-N 3D CFT And Its Gravity Dual
Authors: Adi Armoni and Asad Naqvi
Abstract: We propose a three dimensional non-supersymmetric theory that is conformal in the large N limit. In a certain well defined bosonic sub-sector of gauge invariant operators, this theory is planar equivalent to the theory recently proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena as the theory on multiple M2 branes at an orbifold singularity. We discuss the realization of the theory on a brane configuration of type 0B string theory. Moreover, we propose an 11D gravity dual, obtained by a projection of M-theory on AdS4 x S7 / Z_k.
