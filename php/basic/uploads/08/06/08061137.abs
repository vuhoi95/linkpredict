Title: On Inflation Potentials in Randall-Sundrum Braneworld Model
Authors: M. Bennai and H. Chakir and Z. Sakhi
Abstract: We study the inflationary dynamics of the universe in the Randall-Sandrum typeII Braneworld model. We consider both an inverse-power law and exponential potentials and apply the Slow-Roll approximation in high energy limit to derive analytical expression of relevant inflationary quantities. An upper bound for the coupling constant was also obtained and a numerical value of perturbation spectrum is calculated in good agreement with observation.
