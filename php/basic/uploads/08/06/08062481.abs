Title: Black Holes in the Dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theory in Various  Dimensions I -- Asymptotically Flat Black Holes --
Authors: Zong-Kuan Guo and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole solutions in the low-energy effective heterotic string theory, which is the Einstein gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term and the dilaton, in various dimensions. We derive the field equations for suitable ansatz for general D dimensions and construct black hole solutions of various masses numerically in D=4,5,6 and 10 dimensional spacetime with (D-2)-dimensional hypersurface with positive constant curvature. A detailed comparison with the non-dilatonic solutions is made. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of the solutions. It is found that the dilaton has significant effects on the black hole solutions, and we discuss physical consequences.
