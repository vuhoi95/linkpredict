Title: Hilbert space of curved βγsystems on quadric cones
Authors: Yuri Aisaka and E. Aldo Arroyo
Abstract: We clarify the structure of the Hilbert space of curved \beta\gamma systems defined by a quadratic constraint. The constraint is studied using intrinsic and BRST methods, and their partition functions are shown to agree. The quantum BRST cohomology is non-empty only at ghost numbers 0 and 1, and there is a one-to-one mapping between these two sectors. In the intrinsic description, the ghost number 1 operators correspond to the ones that are not globally defined on the constrained surface. Extension of the results to the pure spinor superstring is discussed in a separate work.
