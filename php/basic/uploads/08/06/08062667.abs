Title: String GUT Scenarios with Stabilised Moduli
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Sebastian Moster and Erik Plauschinn
Abstract: Taking into account the recently proposed poly-instanton corrections to the superpotential and combining the race-track with a KKLT respectively LARGE Volume Scenario in an intricate manner, we show that we gain exponential control over the parameters in an effective superpotential. This allows us to dynamically stabilise moduli such that a conventional MSSM scenario with the string scale lowered to the GUT scale is realised. Depending on the cycles wrapped by the MSSM branes, two different scenarios for the hierarchy of soft masses arise. The first one is a supergravity mediated model with M_3/2=1TeV while the second one features mixed anomaly-supergravity mediation with M_3/2=10^10GeV and split supersymmetry. We also comment on dynamically lowering the scales such that the tree-level cosmological constant is of the order \Lambda=(10^-3eV)^4.
