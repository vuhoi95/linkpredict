Title: Superconformal Indices for ${\cal N}=6$ Chern Simons Theories
Authors: Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya and Shiraz Minwalla
Abstract: Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena have recently proposed a dual gravitational description for a family of superconformal Chern Simons theories in three spacetime dimensions. In this note we perform the one loop computation that determines the field theory superconformal index of this theory and compare with the index computed over the Fock space of dual supersymmetric gravitons. In the appropriate limit (large $N$ and large $k$) we find a perfect match.
