Title: Bouncing Braneworld with Born-Infeld and Gauss-Bonnet
Authors: Sudipta Mukherji and Supratik Pal
Abstract: We show the existence of some bouncing cosmological solutions in the braneworld scenario. More specifically, we consider a dynamical three-brane in the background of Born-Infeld and electrically charged Gauss-Bonnet black hole. We find that, in certain range of parameter space, the brane universe, at least classically, never shrinks to a zero size, resulting in a singularity-free cosmology within the classical domain.
