Title: Liouville-like solutions in dilaton gravity with Gauss-Bonnet  modifications
Authors: D. Bazeia and R. Menezes and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We investigate nonperturbative dilatonic solutions of the wide class of the modified gravity models including the Gauss-Bonnet terms with a general $F(G)$ Lagrangian. We show that presence of the Liouville-like solutions is a characteristic feature of these models.
