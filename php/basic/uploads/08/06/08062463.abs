Title: Noncommutative scalar fields from symplectic deformation
Authors: M. Daoud and A. Hamama
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the quantum theory of noncommutative scalar fields in two dimensional space time. It is shown that the noncommutativity originates from the the deformation of symplectic structures. The quantization is performed and the modes expansions of the fields, in presence of an electro-magnetic background, are derived. The Hamiltonian of the theory is given and the degeneracies lifting, induced by the deformation, is also discussed.
