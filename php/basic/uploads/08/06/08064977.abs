Abstract: We explore further our recent generalization of the $\CN=4$ superconformal Chern-Simons theories of Gaiotto and Witten. We find and construct explicitly theories of enhanced $\CN=5$ or 6 supersymmetry, especially $\CN=5$, $Sp(2M)\times O(N)$ and $\CN=6$, $Sp(2M)\times O(2)$ theories. The $U(M)\times U(N)$ theory coincides with the $\CN=6$ theory of Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena (ABJM). We argue that the $\CN=5$ theory with $Sp(2N)\times O(2N)$ gauge group can be understood as an orientifolding of the ABJM model with $U(2N)\times U(2N)$ gauge group. We briefly discuss the Type IIB brane construction of the $\CN=5$ theory and the geometry of the M-theory orbifold.
