Title: Heat trace asymptotics with singular weight functions
Authors: M. van den Berg and P. Gilkey and K. Kirsten and R. Seeley
Abstract: We study the weighted heat trace asymptotics of an operator of Laplace type with Dirichlet boundary conditions where the weight function exhibits radial blowup. We give formulas for the first few terms in the expansion in terms of geometrical data.
