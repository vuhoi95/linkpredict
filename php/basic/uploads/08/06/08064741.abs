Title: The deformation quantizations of the hyperbolic plane
Authors: Pierre Bieliavsky and St√©phane Detournay and Philippe Spindel
Abstract: We describe the space of (all) invariant deformation quantizations on the hyperbolic plane as solutions of the evolution of a second order hyperbolic differential operator. The construction is entirely explicit and relies on non-commutative harmonic analytical techniques on symplectic symmetric spaces. The present work presents a unified method producing every quantization of the hyperbolic plane, and provides, in the 2-dimensional context, an exact solution to Weinstein's WKB quantization program within geometric terms. The construction reveals the existence of a metric of Lorentz signature canonically attached (or `dual') to the geometry of the hyperbolic plane through the quantization process.
