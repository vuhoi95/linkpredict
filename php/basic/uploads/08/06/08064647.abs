Title: Top Quark Production from Black Holes at the CERN LHC
Authors: Andrew Chamblin and Fred Cooper and Gouranga C. Nayak
Abstract: LHC is expected to be a top quark factory. If the fundamental Planck scale is near a TeV, then we also expect the top quarks to be produced from black holes via Hawking radiation. In this paper we calculate the cross sections for top quark production from black holes at the LHC and compare it with the direct top quark cross section via parton fusion processes at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We find that the top quark production from black holes can be larger or smaller than the pQCD predictions at NNLO depending upon the Planck mass and black hole mass. Hence the observation of very high rates for massive particle production (top quarks, higgs or supersymmetry) at the LHC may be an useful signature for black hole production.
