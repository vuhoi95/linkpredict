Title: Ground State Energy of Extended Hubbard Model by self-consistent RPA
Authors: S. Harir and M. Bennai and Y. Boughaleb
Abstract: Using the SCRPA, we study the intersite interaction effect on the dynamics of N electrons system. We have considered an extended Hubbard model including intrasite and intersite interactions, and we have applied this model to a system of two neighbouring atoms containing a free electron. The application of SCRPA to this model allows us to study the intersite interaction effect on the ground state and the excitation energies of system. We show that the repulsive interaction between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms is the origin of an supplementary conductivity of the system.
