Title: Relaxation time of a CFT plasma at finite coupling
Authors: Alex Buchel and Miguel Paulos
Abstract: Following recent formulation of second order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics for conformal fluids, we compute finite coupling corrections to the relaxation time of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The result is expected to be universal for any strongly coupled conformal gauge theory plasma in four dimensions.
