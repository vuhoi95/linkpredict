Title: The rational dressing for abelian twisted loop Toda systems
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: We consider abelian twisted loop Toda equations associated with the complex general linear groups. The Dodd--Bullough--Mikhailov equation is a simplest particular case of the equations under consideration. We construct new soliton solutions of these Toda equations using the method of rational dressing.
