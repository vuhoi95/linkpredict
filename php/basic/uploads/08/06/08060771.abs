Title: Feynman operator calculus and singular quantum oscillator
Authors: V. S. Popov and M. A. Trusov
Abstract: New applications of Feynman disentangling method in quantum mechanics are studied and the time-dependent singular oscillator problem is solved in this approach. The important role of representation group theory is discussed in this context.
