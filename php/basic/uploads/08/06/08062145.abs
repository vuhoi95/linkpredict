Title: Hidden entanglement at the Planck scale: loss of unitarity and the  information paradox
Authors: Michele Arzano and Alioscia Hamma and Simone Severini
Abstract: We discuss how relaxing the requirement of locality for quantum fields can equip the Hilbert space of the theory with a richer structure in its multi-particle sector. A physical consequence is the emergence of a "planckian" mode-entanglement, invisible to an observer that cannot probe the Planck scale. To the same observer, certain unitary processes would appear non-unitary. We show how entanglement transfer to the additional degrees of freedom can provide a potential way out of the black hole information paradox.
