Title: Flux Parameter Spaces in Type II Vacua
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and Tianjun Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We study the flux parameter spaces for semi-realistic supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in the AdS vacua on Type IIA orientifold and realistic supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in the Minkowski vacua on Type IIB orientifold. Because the fluxes can be very large, we show explicitly that there indeed exists a huge number of semi-realistic Type IIA and realistic Type IIB flux models. In the Type IIA flux models, in the very large flux limit, the theory can become weakly coupled and the AdS vacua can approach to the Minkowski vacua. In a series of realistic Type IIB flux models, at the string scale, the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry, the gauge coupling unification can be achieved naturally, all the extra chiral exotic particles can be decoupled, and the observed SM fermion masses and mixings can be obtained as well. In particular, the real parts of the dilaton, K\"ahler moduli, and the unified gauge coupling are independent of the very large fluxes. The very large fluxes only affect the real and/or imaginary parts of the complex structure moduli, and/or the imaginary parts of the dilaton and K\"ahler moduli. However, these semi-realistic Type IIA and realistic Type IIB flux models can not be populated in the string landscape.
