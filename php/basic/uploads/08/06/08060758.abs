Title: $Îº$-Minkowski and Snyder algebra from reparametrisation symmetry
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: Following our earlier work \cite{sunandan1, sunandan2}, we derive noncommuting phase-space structures which are combinations of both the $\kappa$-Minkowski and Snyder algebra by exploiting the reparametrisation symmetry of the recently proposed Lagrangian for a point particle \cite{subir} satisfying the exact Doubly Special Relativity dispersion relation in the Magueijo-Smolin framework.
