Title: Effective Action and Schwinger Pair Production in Scalar QED
Authors: Sang Pyo Kim and Hyun Kyu Lee
Abstract: Some astrophysical objects are supposed to have very strong electromagnetic fields above the critical strength. Quantum fluctuations due to strong electromagnetic fields modify the Maxwell theory and particularly electric fields make the vacuum unstable against pair production of charged particles. We study the strong field effect such as the effective action and the Schwinger pair production in scalar QED.
