Title: Exact solutions for N-magnon scattering
Authors: Chrysostomos Kalousios and Georgios Papathanasiou and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: Giant magnon solutions play an important role in various aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We apply the dressing method to construct an explicit formula for scattering states of an arbitrary number N of magnons on R x S^3. The solution can be written in Hirota form and in terms of determinants of N x N matrices. Such a representation may prove useful for the construction of an effective particle Hamiltonian describing magnon dynamics.
