Title: The particle spectrum of the Tricritical Ising Model with spin reversal  symmetric perturbations
Authors: Luca Lepori and Giuseppe Mussardo and Gabor Zs. Toth
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of the particle spectrum of the Tricritical Ising Model by varying the couplings of the energy and vacancy density fields. The particle content changes from the spectrum of a supersymmetric theory (either of an exact or a spontaneously broken supersymmetric theory) to the spectrum of seven particles related to the underlying E_7 structure. In the low temperature phase some of these excitations are topologically charged particles that are stable under an arbitrary variation of the parameters. The high and low temperature phases of the model are related by duality. In some regions of the two couplings there are also present false vacua and sequences of bound states. In order to study the non-integrable features of this model we employ the Form Factor Perturbation Theory and the Truncated Conformal Space Approach.
