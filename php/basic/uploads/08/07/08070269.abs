Authors: M. C. Gama and J. A. Espichán Carrillo and A. Maia Jr
Abstract: We present a method to calculate small stationary fluctuations around static solutions describing bound states in a $(1+1)$-dimensional $\lambda \phi^{n+1}$ theory in a finite domain. We also calculate explicitly fluctuations for the $\lambda \phi^4$. These solutions are written in terms of Jacobi Elliptic functions and are obtained from both linear and nonlinear equations. For the linear case we get eingenvalues of a Lam\'e type Equation and the nonlinear one relies on Hirota's Method.
