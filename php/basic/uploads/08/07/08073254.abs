Title: On stability of false vacuum in supersymmetric theories with cosmic  strings
Authors: Brijesh Kumar and Urjit A. Yajnik
Abstract: We study the stability of supersymmetry breaking vacuum in the presence of cosmic strings arising in the messenger sector. For certain ranges of the couplings, the desired supersymmetry breaking vacua become unstable against decay into phenomenologically unacceptable vacua. This sets constraints on the range of allowed values of the coupling constants appearing in the models and more generally on the chosen dynamics of gauge symmetry breaking.
