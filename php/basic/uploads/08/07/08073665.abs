Title: Non-relativistic AdS/CFT and Aging/Gravity Duality
Authors: Djordje Minic and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: We point out that the recent discussion of non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspondence has a direct application in non-equilibrium statistical physics, the fact which has not been emphasized in the recent literature on the subject. In particular, we propose a duality between aging in systems far from equilibrium characterized by the dynamical exponent $z=2$ and gravity in a specific background. The key ingredient in our proposal is the recent geometric realization of the Schr\"{o}dinger group. We also discuss the relevance of the proposed correspondence for the more general aging phenomena in systems where the value of the dynamical exponent is different from 2.
