Title: Improved model for the topological soliton-potential interaction in  Phi^4 Model
Authors: Ensieh Hakimi and Kurosh Javidan
Abstract: An improved model for the soliton-potential interaction is presented. This model is constructed with a better approximation for adding the potential to the lagrangian through a space-time metric. The results of the model are compared with other models and the differences are discussed.
