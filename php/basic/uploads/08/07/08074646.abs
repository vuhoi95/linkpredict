Title: On the algebra of quantum observables for a certain gauge model
Authors: Gerd Rudolph and Matthias Schmidt
Abstract: We prove that the algebra of observables of a certain gauge model is generated by unbounded elements in the sense of Woronowicz. The generators are constructed from the classical generators of invariant polynomials by means of geometric quantization.
