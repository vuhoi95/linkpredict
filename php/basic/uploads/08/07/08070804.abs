Title: Duality between normal and superconducting junctions of multiple quantum  wires
Authors: Sourin Das and Sumathi Rao
Abstract: We study junctions of single-channel spinless Luttinger liquids using bosonisation. We generalize earlier studies by allowing the junction to be superconducting and find new charge non-conserving low energy fixed points. We establish the existence of $g \leftrightarrow 1/g$ duality (where $g$ is the Luttinger Liquid parameter) between the charge conserving (normal) junction and the charge non-conserving (superconducting) junction by evaluating and comparing the scaling dimensions of various operators around the fixed points in normal and superconducting sectors of the theory. For the most general two-wire junction, we show that there are two conformally invariant one-parameter families of fixed points which are also connected by a duality transformation. We also show that the stable fixed point for the two-wire superconducting junction corresponds to the situation where the crossed Andreev reflection is perfect between the wires. For the three-wire junction, we study, in particular, the superconducting analogs of the chiral, $D_P$ and the disconnected fixed points obtained earlier in the literature in the context of charge conserving three-wire junctions. We show that these fixed points can be stabilized for $g < 1$ (repulsive electrons) within the superconducting sector of the theory which makes them experimentally relevant.
