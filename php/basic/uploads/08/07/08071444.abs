Title: From N M2's to N D2's
Authors: Yi Pang and Tower Wang
Abstract: In this short note, we reduce the N=6, U(N)xU(N) Chern-Simons gauge theories to N=8, U(N) Yang-Mills gauge theories. This process corresponds to recovering the world-volume theory of N D2-branes from that of N M2-branes in an intermediate energy range. The supersymmetries are enhanced because in this limit the branes localize far away from the orbifold singularity. Our main scheme is exactly in accordance with Mukhi and Papageorgakis's earlier work, although the Higgs mechanism becomes trickier in the present case. We also speculate on applying the scheme to a large class of new Bagger-Lambert models more generally.
