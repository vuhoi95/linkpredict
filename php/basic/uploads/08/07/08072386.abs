Title: Holomorphic Superspace
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Alexis Martin
Abstract: We give a twisted holomorphic superspace description for the super-Yang-Mills theory, using holomorphic and antiholomorphic decompositions of twisted spinors. We consider the case of the N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. We solve the constraints in two different manners, without and with a prepotential. This might have further application for an holomorphic superspace description of N=1,d=10 theory. We also explain how the N=1 and N=2 holomorphic superspaces are related.
