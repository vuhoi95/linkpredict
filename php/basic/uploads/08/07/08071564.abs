Title: Charged Black Holes in a Rotating Gross-Perry-Sorkin Monopole Background
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Akihiro Ishibashi
Abstract: We present a new class of stationary charged black hole solutions to five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories. We construct the solutions by utilizing so called the squashing transformation. At infinity, our solutions behave as a four-dimensional flat spacetime plus a `circle' and hence describe a Kaluza-Klein black hole. More precisely, our solutions can be viewed as a charged rotating black hole in a rotating Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole background with the black hole rotation induced from the background rotation.
