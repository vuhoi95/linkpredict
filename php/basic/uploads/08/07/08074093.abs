Title: Commutative limit of a renormalizable noncommutative model
Authors: Jacques Magnen and Vincent Rivasseau and Adrian Tanasa
Abstract: Renormalizable $\phi^{\star 4}_4$ models on Moyal space have been obtained by modifying the commutative propagator. But these models have a divergent "naive" commutative limit. We explain here how to obtain a coherent such commutative limit for a recently proposed translation-invariant model. The mechanism relies on the analysis of the uv/ir mixing in general Feynman graphs.
