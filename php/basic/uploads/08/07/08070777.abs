Title: The all loop AdS4/CFT3 Bethe ansatz
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We propose a set of Bethe equations yielding the full asymptotic spectrum of the AdS4/CFT3 duality proposed in arXiv:0806.1218 to all orders in the t'Hooft coupling. These equations interpolate between the 2-loop Bethe ansatz of Minahan and Zarembo arXiv:0806.3951 and the string algebraic curve of arXiv:0807.0437. The several SU(2|2) symmetries of the theory seem to highly constrain the form of the Bethe equations up to a dressing factor whose form we also conjecture.
