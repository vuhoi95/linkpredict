Title: Scattering Amplitudes, Wilson Loops and the String/Gauge Theory  Correspondence
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We review, in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, recent developments and techniques for the evaluation of the scattering amplitudes of planar N=4 SYM theory at both weak and strong coupling. Special emphasis is placed on the newly discovered connection between a special class of amplitudes and the expectation values of particular cusped light-like Wilson loops.
