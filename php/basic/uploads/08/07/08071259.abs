Title: Generalized Instantons on Complex Projective Spaces
Authors: Hironobu Kihara and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We study a class of generalized self-duality relations in gauge theories on the complex projective space with the Fubini-Study metric. Our theories consist of only gauge fields with gauge group U(n). The pseudo-energies which we consider contain higher orders of field strength and are labeled by an integer p smaller than or equal to [n/2]. For making the Bogomol'nyi completion we need non-single trace terms in the pseudo-energies, unlike the models defined on spheres, which were studied previously. We construct an explicit solution of codimension 2n to generalized self-duality equations as Bogomol'nyi equations, by using a part of the spin connection.
