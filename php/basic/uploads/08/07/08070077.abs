Title: Bouncing Universe with Non-minimally Coupled Quintom Matter
Authors: M. R. Setare and J. Sadeghi and A. Banijamali
Abstract: In this letter, we study the condition for a generalized DBI action providing a quintom scenario of dark energy. We consider a development of string-inspired quintom by introducing non-minimal coupling. Then we show that the bouncing solution can appear in the universe dominated by the non-minimally coupled quintom matter.
