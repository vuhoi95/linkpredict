Title: Integrable systems from supergravity BPS equations
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and John Estes
Abstract: Integrable systems of the sine-Gordon/Liouville type, which arise from reducing the BPS equations for solutions invariant under 16 supersymmetries in Type IIB supergravity and M-theory, are shown to be special cases of an infinite family of integrable systems, parametrized by an arbitrary real function $f$ of a real variable. It is shown that, for each function $f$, this generalized integrable system may be mapped onto a system of linear equations, which in turn may be integrated in terms of the two linearly independent solutions of an ordinary linear second order differential equation which depends only on the function $f$.
