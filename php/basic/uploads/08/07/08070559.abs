Title: Weakly Renormalized Near 1/16 SUSY Fermi Liquid Operators in N = 4 SYM
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Dori Reichmann
Abstract: We discuss a class of Fermi Liquid Operators in N = 4 SYM. We show that these operators are eigenstates of the full quantum dilatation operator. We compute their 1 and 2 loop anomalous dimensions, and show that, similar to Fermi liquids in condensed matter systems, these corrections are suppressed by an arbitrarily small parameter, which is the equivalent of one over the Fermi energy. These operators are, at the classical level, descendants of 1/16 BPS operators, with some scaling properties similar to those of the 1/16 Black Holes in AdS_5.
