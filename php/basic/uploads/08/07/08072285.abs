Title: Gluino zero-modes for calorons at finite temperature
Authors: Margarita Garcia Perez and Antonio Gonzalez-Arroyo and Alfonso Sastre
Abstract: We study the solutions of the Dirac equation in the adjoint representation(gluinos) in the background field of SU(2) unit charge calorons. Our solutions are forced to be antiperiodic in thermal time and would occur naturally in a semiclassical approach to N=1 Super-symmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature.
