Title: Loss of Spin Entanglement For Accelerated Electrons in Electric and  Magnetic Fields
Authors: Jason Doukas and Lloyd C. L. Hollenberg
Abstract: Using an open quantum system we calculate the time dependence of the concurrence between two maximally entangled electron spins with one accelerated uniformly in the presence of a constant magnetic field and the other at rest and isolated from fields. We find at high Rindler temperature the proper time for the entanglement to be extinguished is proportional to the inverse of the acceleration cubed.
