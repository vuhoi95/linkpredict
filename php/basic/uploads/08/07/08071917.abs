Title: Deep inelastic scattering from gauge string duality in D3-D7 brane model
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: We calculate deep inelastic structure functions for mesons in the D3-D7 brane model, that incorporates flavour to the AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider two different prescriptions for the hadronic current dual: a gauge field in the AdS bulk and a gauge field on the D7 brane. We also calculate elastic form factors in both cases. We compare our results with other holographic models.
