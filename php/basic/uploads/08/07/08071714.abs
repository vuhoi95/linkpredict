Title: Integrality theorems in the theory of topological strings
Authors: Albert Schwarz and Vadim Vologodsky
Abstract: We give a simplified derivation of the expression of instanton numbers and of mirror map in terms of Frobenius map on p-adic cohomology and use this expression to prove integrality theorems. Modifying this proof we verify that the Aganagic-Vafa formulas for the number of holomorphic disks can be expressed in terms of Frobenius map on p-adic relative cohomology; this expression permits us to prove integrality of this number.
