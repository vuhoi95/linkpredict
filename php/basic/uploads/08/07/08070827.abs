Title: New Heterotic Non-Kahler Geometries
Authors: Melanie Becker and Li-Sheng Tseng and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: New heterotic torsional geometries are constructed as orbifolds of T^2 bundles over K3. The discrete symmetries considered can be freely-acting or have fixed points and/or fixed curves. We give explicit constructions when the base K3 is Kummer or algebraic. The orbifold geometries can preserve N=1,2 supersymmetry in four dimensions or be non-supersymmetric.
