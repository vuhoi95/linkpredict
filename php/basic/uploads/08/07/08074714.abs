Abstract: Half-supersymmetric geometries of N=2 five-dimensional gauged supergravity have recently been fully classified using spinorial geometry techniques. We use this classification to determine all possible regular half-supersymmetric near-horizon geometries, assuming that all of the gauge-invariant spinor bilinears are regular at the horizon. Four geometries are found, two of which have been found previously in hep-th/0611351 and arXiv:0708.3695.
