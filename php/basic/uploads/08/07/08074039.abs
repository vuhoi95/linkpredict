Title: Duality Rotations in Nonlinear Electrodynamics and in Extended  Supergravity
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Sergio Ferrara and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We review the general theory of duality rotations which, in four dimensions, exchange electric with magnetic fields. Necessary and sufficient conditions in order for a theory to have duality symmetry are established. A nontrivial example is Born-Infeld theory with n abelian gauge fields and with Sp(2n,R) self-duality. We then review duality symmetry in supergravity theories. In the case of N=2 supergravity duality rotations are in general not a symmetry of the theory but a key ingredient in order to formulate the theory itself. This is due to the beautiful relation between the geometry of special Kaehler manifolds and duality rotations.
