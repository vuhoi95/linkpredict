Title: Topological susceptibility in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in the Hamiltonian  approach in Coulomb gauge
Authors: Davide R. Campagnari and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: The topological susceptibility is calculated within the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge, using the vacuum wave functional previously determined by a variational solution of the Yang-Mills Schroedinger equation. The numerical result agrees qualitatively with the predictions of lattice simulations.
