Title: Mode Regularization for N=1,2 SUSY Sigma Model
Authors: Roberto Bonezzi and Marco Falconi
Abstract: Worldline N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric sigma models in curved background are useful to describe spin one-half and spin one particles coupled to external gravity, respectively. It is well known that worldline path integrals in curved space require regularization: we present here the mode-regularization for these models, finding in particular the corresponding counterterms, both in the case of flat and curved indices for worldline fermions. For N=1, using curved indices we find a contribution to the counterterm from the fermions that cancels the contribution of the bosons, leading to a vanishing total counterterm and thus preserving the covariance and supersymmetry of the classical action. Conversely in the case of N=2 supersymmetries we obtain a non-covariant counterterm with both curved and flat indices. This work completes the analysis of the known regularization schemes for N=1,2 nonlinear sigma models in one dimension.
