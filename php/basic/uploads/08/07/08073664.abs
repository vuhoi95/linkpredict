Title: A new spectral triple over a space of connections
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup and Ryszard Nest
Abstract: A new construction of a semifinite spectral triple on an algebra of holonomy loops is presented. The construction is canonically associated to quantum gravity and is an alternative version of the spectral triple presented in hep-th/08021784.
