Title: Sources for Chern-Simons theories
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: The coupling between Chern-Simons theories and matter sources defined by branes of different dimensionalities is examined. It is shown that the standard coupling to membranes, such as the one found in supergravity or in string theory, does not operate in the same way for CS theories; the only p-branes that naturally couple seem to be those with p=2n; these p-branes break the gauge symmetry (and supersymmetry) in a controlled and sensible manner.
