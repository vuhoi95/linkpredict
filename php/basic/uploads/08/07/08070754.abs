Title: Dynamically assisted Schwinger mechanism
Authors: Ralf Sch√ºtzhold and Holger Gies and Gerald Dunne
Abstract: We study electron-positron pair creation {from} the Dirac vacuum induced by a strong and slowly varying electric field (Schwinger effect) which is superimposed by a weak and rapidly changing electromagnetic field (dynamical pair creation). In the sub-critical regime where both mechanisms separately are strongly suppressed, their combined impact yields a pair creation rate which is {dramatically} enhanced. Intuitively speaking, the strong electric field lowers the threshold for dynamical particle creation -- or, alternatively, the fast electromagnetic field generates additional seeds for the Schwinger mechanism. These findings could be relevant for planned ultra-high intensity lasers.
