Title: Light-like Wilson Loops and Cusp Anomalous Dimensions in Non-conformal  Gauge Theories
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Daniel J. Phalen and Cesar A. Terrero-Escalante
Abstract: We emphasize that non-conformal theories provide a natural playground for the ideas of the Maldacena conjecture, opening the possibility of exploring properties that could potentially be in the same universality class as QCD. In particular, we discuss in detail how light-like Wilson loops, an important ingredient in the prescription for scattering amplitudes, can be described in a number of gravity duals of non-conformal gauge theories. We point out to a few universal properties and the prominent role of the strong scale.
