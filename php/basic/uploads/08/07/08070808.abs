Title: Multiple M2-branes and Generalized 3-Lie algebras
Authors: Sergey Cherkis and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson action as a candidate for the description of an arbitrary number of M2-branes. The action is formulated in terms of N=2 superfields in three dimensions and corresponds to an extension of the usual superfield formulation of Chern-Simons matter theories. Demanding gauge invariance of the resulting theory does not imply the total antisymmetry of the underlying 3-Lie algebra structure constants. We relax this condition and propose a class of examples for these generalized 3-Lie algebras. We also discuss how to associate various ordinary Lie algebras.
