Title: Electromagnetic Baryon Form Factors from Holographic QCD
Authors: Keun-Young Kim and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: In the holographic model of QCD suggested by Sakai and Sugimoto, baryons are chiral solitons sourced by D4 instantons in bulk of size 1/\sqrt{\lambda} with \lambda=g^2N_c. We quantize the D4 instanton semiclassically using \hbar=1/(N_c\lambda) and non-rigid constraints on the vector mesons. The holographic baryon is a small chiral bag in the holographic direction with a Cheshire cat smile. The vector-baryon interactions occur at the core boundary of the instanton in D4. They are strong and of order 1/\sqrt{\hbar}. To order \hbar^0 the electromagnetic current is entirely encoded on the core boundary and vector-meson dominated. To this order, the electromagnetic charge radius is of order \lambda^0. The meson contribution to the baryon magnetic moments sums identically to the core contribution. The proton and neutron magnetic moment are tied by a model independent relation similar to the one observed in the Skyrme model.
