Title: Properties of hyperkahler manifolds and their twistor spaces
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek
Abstract: We describe the relation between supersymmetric sigma-models on hyperkahler manifolds, projective superspace, and twistor space. We review the essential aspects and present a coherent picture with a number of new results.
