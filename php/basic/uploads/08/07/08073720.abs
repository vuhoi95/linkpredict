Title: S-Duality of Boundary Conditions In N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Edward Witten
Abstract: By analyzing brane configurations in detail, and extracting general lessons, we develop methods for analyzing S-duality of supersymmetric boundary conditions in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. In the process, we find that S-duality of boundary conditions is closely related to mirror symmetry of three-dimensional gauge theories, and we analyze the IR behavior of large classes of quiver gauge theories.
