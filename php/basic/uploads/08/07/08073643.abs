Title: The Naimark dilated PT-symmetric brachistochrone
Authors: Uwe Guenther and Boris F. Samsonov
Abstract: The quantum mechanical brachistochrone system with PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is Naimark dilated and reinterpreted as subsystem of a Hermitian system in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space. This opens a way to a direct experimental implementation of the recently hypothesized PT-symmetric ultra-fast brachistochrone regime of [C. M. Bender et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 040403 (2007)] in an entangled two-spin system.
