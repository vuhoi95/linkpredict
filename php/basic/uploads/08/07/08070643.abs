Title: Finite-Size Effects for Multi-Magnon States
Authors: Yasuyuki Hatsuda and Ryo Suzuki
Abstract: We propose the generalized Luscher formula for multi-magnon states by which one can compute the finite-size correction to the energy of multi giant magnons at classical and one-loop levels. It is shown that the F-term of our formula is consistent with the exact finite-size spectrum of the sinh-Gordon model, and the mu-term agrees with the finite-size energy of magnon boundstate of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the su(2) sector at strong coupling. In an appendix, we evaluate our formula at weak coupling under some approximations, and find that the transcendental terms arise from a sum over an infinite tower of BPS boundstates.
