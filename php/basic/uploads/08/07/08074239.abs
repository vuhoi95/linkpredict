Title: CMB Temperature Anisotropy from Broken Spatial Isotropy due to an  Homogeneous Cosmological Magnetic Field
Authors: Tina Kahniashvili and George Lavrelashvili and Bharat Ratra
Abstract: We derive the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy two-point correlation function (including off-diagonal correlations) from broken spatial isotropy due to an arbitrarily oriented homogeneous cosmological magnetic field.
