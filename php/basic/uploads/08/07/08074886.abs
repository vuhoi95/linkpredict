Title: UV/IR mixing in noncommutative QED defined by Seiberg-Witten map
Authors: Peter Schupp and Jiangyang You
Abstract: Noncommutative gauge theories defined via Seiberg-Witten map have desirable properties that theories defined directly in terms of noncommutative fields lack, covariance and unrestricted choice of gauge group and charge being among them, but nonperturbative results in the deformation parameter \theta are hard to obtain. In this article we use a \theta-exact approach to study UV/IR mixing in a noncommutative quantum electrodynamics (NCQED) model defined via Seiberg-Witten map. The fermion contribution of the one loop correction to the photon propagator is computed and it is found that it gives the same UV/IR mixing term as a NCQED model without Seiberg-Witten map.
