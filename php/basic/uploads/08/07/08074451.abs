Title: Generalized Kac-Moody Algebras from CHL dyons
Authors: Suresh Govindarajan and K Gopala Krishna
Abstract: We provide evidence for the existence of a family of generalized Kac-Moody(GKM) superalgebras, G_N, whose Weyl-Kac-Borcherds denominator formula gives rise to a genus-two modular form at level N, Delta_{k/2}(Z), for (N,k)=(1,10), (2,6), (3,4), and possibly (5,2). The square of the automorphic form is the modular transform of the generating function of the degeneracy of CHL dyons in asymmetric Z_N-orbifolds of the heterotic string compactified on T^6. The new generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras all arise as different `automorphic corrections' of the same Lie algebra and are closely related to a generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra constructed by Gritsenko and Nikulin. The automorphic forms, Delta_{k/2}(Z), arise as additive lifts of Jacobi forms of (integral) weight k/2 and index 1/2. We note that the orbifolding acts on the imaginary simple roots of the unorbifolded GKM superalgebra, G_1 leaving the real simple roots untouched. We anticipate that these superalgebras will play a role in understanding the `algebra of BPS states' in CHL compactifications.
