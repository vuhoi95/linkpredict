Title: Chern-Simons gravity, based on a non-semisimple group
Authors: C. Duval and Z. Horváth and P. A. Horváthy
Abstract: The gauge theory-formulation of string-motivated lineal gravity proposed by Cangemi and Jackiw is obtained by dimensional reduction from $(2+1)$ dimensional gravity with a Chern-Simons Lagrangian.
