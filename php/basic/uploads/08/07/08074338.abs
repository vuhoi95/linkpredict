Title: On squashed black holes in Godel universes
Authors: Cristian Stelea and Kristin Schleich and Donald Witt
Abstract: We investigate five-dimensional rotating and charged black holes with squashed horizons in Godel universes. The general solution was recently derived by applying a squashing transformation on the general non-extremal charged and rotating black hole in the Godel universe found by Wu. We give a discussion of the squashed geometry and also consider its lift to ten dimensions and discuss the T-dual geometry. Finally, using the counterterms method we compute its conserved charges and explore its thermodynamics.
