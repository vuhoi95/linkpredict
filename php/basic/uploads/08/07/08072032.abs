Abstract: We report preliminary results of lattice super-Yang-Mills computations using domain wall fermions, performed at an actual rate of 1000 Gflop/s, over the course of six months, using two BlueGene/L racks at Rensselaer's CCNI supercomputing center. This has allowed us to compute the gluino condensate and string tension over a wide range of lattice parameters, setting the stage for continuum, chiral extrapolations.
