Title: Noncommutative Conformal Field Theory in the Twist-deformed context
Authors: Fedele Lizzi and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We discuss conformal symmetry on the two dimensional noncommutative plane equipped with Moyal product in the twist deformed context. We show that the consistent use of the twist procedure leads to results which are free from ambiguities. This lends support to the importance of the use of twist symmetries in noncommutative geometry.
