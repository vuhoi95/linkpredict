Title: Super Spin-Charge Separation for class A, C, and D disorder
Authors: Andr√© LeClair and Dean J. Robinson
Abstract: We prove versions of super spin-charge separation for all three of the symmetry groups SU(N), Sp(2N), and SO(N) of disordered Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions, which involve the supercurrent-algebras gl (1|1)_{N}, osp(2|2)_{-2N}, and osp(2|2)_N respectively. For certain restricted classes of disordered potentials, the latter supercurrent algebra based conformal field theories can arise as non-trivial low energy fixed points. For all cases with such a fixed point, we compute the density of states exponents as a function of N.
