Title: Gravitational radiation in d>4 from effective field theory
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias and Pau Figueras
Abstract: Some years ago, a new powerful technique, known as the Classical Effective Field Theory, was proposed to describe classical phenomena in gravitational systems. Here we show how this approach can be useful to investigate theoretically important issues, such as gravitational radiation in any spacetime dimension. In particular, we derive for the first time the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman Lagrangian and we compute Einstein's quadrupole formula for any number of flat spacetime dimensions.
