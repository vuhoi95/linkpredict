Title: On quark masses in holographic QCD
Authors: Robert McNees and Robert C. Myers and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: Recently certain nonlocal operators were proposed to provide quark masses for the holographic model of QCD developed by Sakai and Sugimoto. The properties of these operators at strong coupling are examined in detail using holographic techniques. We find the renormalization procedure for these operators is modified by the running of the five-dimensional gauge coupling. We explicitly evaluate the chiral condensate characterized by these operators.
