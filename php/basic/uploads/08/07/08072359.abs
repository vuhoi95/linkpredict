Title: Physical realization and possible identification of topological  excitations in quantum Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on a two dimensional  lattice
Authors: Ranjan Chaudhury and Samir K. Paul
Abstract: Physical spin configurations corresponding to topological excitations, expected to be present in the XY limit of a quantum spin 1/2 Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet, are probed on a two dimensional square lattice . Quantum vortices (anti-vortices) are constructed in terms of coherent staggered spin field components, as limiting case of meronic (anti-meronic) configurations . The crucial role of the associated Wess-Zumino-like (WZ-like) term is highlighted in our procedure . The time evolution equation of coherent spin fields used in this analysis is obtained by applying variational principle on the quantum Euclidean action corresponding to the Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on lattice . It is shown that the WZ-like term can distinguish between vortices and anti-vortices only in a charge sector with odd topological charges. Our formalism is distinctly different from the conventional approach for the construction of quantum vortices (anti-vortices) .
