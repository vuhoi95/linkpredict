Title: The AdS4/CFT3 algebraic curve
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We present the OSp(2,2|6) symmetric algebraic curve for the AdS4/CFT3 duality recently proposed in arXiv:0806.1218. It encodes all classical string solutions at strong t'Hooft coupling and the full two loop spectrum of long single trace gauge invariant operators in the weak coupling regime. This construction can also be used to compute the complete superstring semi-classical spectrum around any classical solution. We exemplify our method on the BMN point-like string.
