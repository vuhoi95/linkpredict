Title: Elliptic aspects of statistical mechanics on spheres
Authors: J. S. Dowker and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: Our earlier results on the temperature inversion properties and the ellipticisation of the finite temperature internal energy on odd spheres are extended to orbifold factors of odd spheres and then to other thermodynamic quantities, in particular to the specific heat. The behaviour under modular transformations is facilitated by the introduction of a modular covariant derivative and it is shown that the specific heat on any odd sphere can be expressed in terms of just three functions. It is also shown that the free energy on the circle can be written elliptically.
