Title: General F-Term Gauge Mediation
Authors: Jacques Distler and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: In a model-independent formalism of gauge mediation, Meade, Seiberg, and Shih have shown that hidden sector effects are captured by two-point correlation functions of the gauge current superfields and that, generically, many of the characteristic features of gauge mediated SUSY breaking do not survive. We review the general story, particularly the way that the correlators enter the low-energy effective action and give rise to soft-breaking terms. We then specialize to the case where there is a small parameter, F/m^2, where m is the mass scale characterizing the hidden sector, and F is the strength of the SUSY breaking. To leading nontrivial order in this small parameter, we show that many of the classic predictions of gauge mediated SUSY breaking are recovered.
