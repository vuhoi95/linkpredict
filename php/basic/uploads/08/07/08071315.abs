Title: Computation of the string tension in three dimensional Yang-Mills theory  using large N reduction
Authors: Joe Kiskis and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We numerically compute the string tension in the large N limit of three dimensional Yang-Mills theory using Wilson loops. Space-time loops are formed as products of smeared space-like links and unsmeared time-like links. We use continuum reduction and both unfolded and folded Wilson loops in the analysis.
