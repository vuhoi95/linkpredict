Abstract: We find the exact solution for a finite size Giant Magnon in the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ sector of the string dual of the $\CN=6$ superconformal Chern-Simons theory recently constructed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena. The finite size Giant Magnon solution consists of two magnons, one in each $SU(2)$. In the infinite size limit this solution corresponds to the Giant Magnon solution of arXiv:0806.4959. The magnon dispersion relation exhibits finite-size exponential corrections with respect to the infinite size limit solution.
