Title: Ultraviolet behavior of transverse gravity
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Anton F. Faedo and J. J. Lopez-Villarejo
Abstract: The structure of the divergences for transverse theories of gravity is studied to one-loop order. These theories are invariant only under those diffeomorphisms that enjoy unit Jacobian determinant (TDiff), so that the determinant of the metric transforms as a true scalar instead of a density. Generically, the models include an additional scalar degree of freedom contained in the metric besides the usual spin two component. When the cosmological constant is fine tuned to zero, there are only two theories which are on shell finite, namely the one in which the symmetry is enhanced to the full group of diffeomorphisms, i.e. Einstein's gravity, and another one denoted by WTDiff which enjoys local Weyl invariance. Both of them are free from the additional scalar.
