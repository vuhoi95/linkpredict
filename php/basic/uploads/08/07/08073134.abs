Title: Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system for strings on AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: Changrim Ahn and P. Bozhilov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We use the reduction of the string dynamics on AdS_4 x CP^3 to the Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system. All constraints can be expressed simply in terms of a few parameters. We analyze the giant magnon and single spike solutions on R_t x CP^3 with two angular momenta in detail and find the energy-charge relations. The finite-size effects of the giant magnon and single spike solutions are analyzed.
