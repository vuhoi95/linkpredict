Title: Isometries of Half Supersymmetric Time-Like Solutions In Five Dimensions
Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and Wafic A. Sabra
Abstract: Spinorial geometry techniques have recently been used to classify all half supersymmetric solutions in gauged five dimensional supergravity with vector multiplets. In this paper we consider solutions for which at least one of the Killing spinors generates a timelike Killing vector. We obtain coordinate transformations which considerably simplify the solutions, and in a number of cases, we obtain explicitly some additional Killing vectors which were hidden in the original analysis.
