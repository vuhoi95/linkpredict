Title: Di-Jet Conical Correlations Associated with Heavy Quark Jets in anti--de  Sitter Space/Conformal Field Theory Correspondence
Authors: Jorge Noronha and Miklos Gyulassy and Giorgio Torrieri
Abstract: We show that far zone Mach and diffusion wake ``holograms'' produced by supersonic strings in anti--de Sitter space/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence do not lead to observable conical angular correlations in the strict $N_c\to\infty$ supergravity limit if Cooper-Frye hadronization is assumed. However, a special {\em nonequilibrium} ``neck'' zone near the jet is shown to produce an apparent sonic boom azimuthal angle distribution that is roughly independent of the heavy quark's velocity. Our results indicate that a measurement of the dependence of the away-side correlations on the velocity of associated identified heavy quark jets at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and CERN LHC will provide a direct test of the nonperturbative dynamics involved in the coupling between jets and the strongly-coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP) implied by AdS/CFT correspondence.
