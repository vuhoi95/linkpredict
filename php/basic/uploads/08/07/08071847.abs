Title: Form factors of integrable higher-spin XXZ chains and the affine  quantum-group symmetry
Authors: Tetsuo Deguchi and Chihiro Matsui
Abstract: We derive exactly scalar products and form factors for integrable higher-spin XXZ chains through the algebraic Bethe-ansatz method. Here spin values are arbitrary and different spins can be mixed. We show the affine quantum-group symmetry, $U_q(\hat{sl_2})$, for the monodromy matrix of the XXZ spin chain, and then obtain the exact expressions. Furthermore, through the quantum-group symmetry we explicitly derive the diagonalized forms of the $B$ and $C$ operators in the $F$-basis for the spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, which was conjectured in the algebraic Bethe-ansatz calculation of the XXZ correlation functions. The results should be fundamental in studying form factors and correlation functions systematically for various solvable models associated with the integrable XXZ spin chains.
