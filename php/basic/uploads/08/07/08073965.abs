Title: Spinning strings at one-loop in AdS_4 x P^3
Authors: Tristan McLoughlin and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We analyze the folded spinning string in AdS_4 x P^3 with spin S in AdS_4 and angular momentum J in P^3. We calculate the one-loop correction to its energy in the scaling limit of both ln S and J large with their ratio kept fixed. This result should correspond to the first subleading strong coupling correction to the anomalous dimension of operators of the type Tr(D^S(Y^\dagger Y)^J) in the dual N=6 Chern-Simons-matter theory. Our result appears to depart from the predictions for the generalized scaling function found from the all-loop Bethe equations conjectured for this AdS_4/CFT_3 duality. We comment on the possible origin of this difference.
