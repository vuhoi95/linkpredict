Title: Semiclassical Quantization of Spinning Strings in AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Gleb Arutyunov and Dmitri Bykov
Abstract: We derive the one-loop correction to the space-time energy of a folded string in AdS_4 x CP^3 carrying spin S in AdS_4 and angular momentum J in CP^3 in the long string approximation. From this general result in the limit J << log S we obtain the one-loop correction to the cusp anomalous dimension which turns out to be -5 log 2/(2\pi). This value appears to be in conflict with the prediction from the recently conjectured all-loop Bethe ansatz.
