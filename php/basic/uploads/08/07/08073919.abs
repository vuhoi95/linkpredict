Title: Induced electrostatic self-interaction in the spacetime of a global  monopole with inner structure
Authors: D. Barbosa and J. Spinelly and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: In this work we analise the electrostatic self-energy and self-force on a point-like electric charged particle induced by a global monopole spacetime considering a inner structure to it. In order to develop this analysis we calculate the three-dimensional Green function associated with this physical system. We explicitly show that for points inside and outside the monopole's core the self-energy presents two distinct contributions. The first is induced by the geometry associated with the spacetime under consideration, and the second one is a correction due to the non-vanishing inner structure attributed to it. Considering specifically the ballpoint-pen model for the region inside, we were able to obtain exact expressions for the self-energies in the regions outside and inside the monopole's core.
