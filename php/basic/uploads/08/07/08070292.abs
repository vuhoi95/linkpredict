Title: Non-conformality and non-perfectness of fluid near phase transition
Authors: Bao-Chun Li and Mei Huang
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and transport properties of the real scalar field theory at weak as well as strong couplings in the Hartree approximation of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism. To our surprise, we find that near phase transition, all the thermodynamic and transport properties of the simplest real scalar model at certain strong coupling agree well with the lattice results of the complex QCD system. We also demonstrate that the system near phase transition is non-conformal, and behaves as a non-perfect fluid.
