Title: Group-quantization of non-linear sigma models: particle on S^2 revisited
Authors: V. Aldaya and M. Calixto and J. Guerrero and F. F. LÃ³pez-Ruiz
Abstract: We present the quantum mechanics of "partial-trace" non-linear sigma models, on the grounds of a fully symmetry-based procedure. After the general scheme is sketched, the particular example of a particle on the two-sphere is explicitly developed. As a remarkable feature, no explicit constraint treatment is required nor ordering ambiguities do appear. Moreover, the energy spectrum is recovered without extra terms in the curvature of the sphere.
