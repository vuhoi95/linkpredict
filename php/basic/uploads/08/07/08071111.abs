Abstract: Building on our earlier work and that of Son, we construct string theory duals of non-relativistic critical phenomena at finite temperature and density. Concretely, we find black hole solutions of type IIB supergravity whose asymptotic geometries realize the Schroedinger group as isometries. We then identify the non-relativistic conformal field theories to which they are dual. We analyze the thermodynamics of these black holes, which turn out to describe the system at finite temperature and finite density. The strong-coupling result for the shear viscosity of the dual non-relativistic field theory saturates the KSS bound.
