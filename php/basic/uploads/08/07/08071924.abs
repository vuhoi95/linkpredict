Title: N=6 super Chern-Simons theory S-matrix and all-loop Bethe ansatz  equations
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We propose the exact S-matrix for the planar limit of the N=6 super Chern-Simons theory recently proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena for the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence. Assuming SU(2|2) symmetry, factorizability and certain crossing-unitarity relations, we find the S-matrix including the dressing phase. We use this S-matrix to formulate the asymptotic Bethe ansatz. Our result for the Bethe-Yang equations and corresponding Bethe ansatz equations confirms the all-loop Bethe ansatz equations recently conjectured by Gromov and Vieira.
