Title: Absence of resonant decay for metastable vacua in gauge theories of  scalar fields
Authors: M. Cardella and S. Elitzur and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We prove the impossibility of resonant decay of a metastable vacuum in a theory of a scalar field coupled to a gauge field. Our result extends to gauge theories of scalar fields a recent no go theorem for resonant tunneling in a pure scalar field theory.
