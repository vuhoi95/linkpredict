Title: M2-M5 Systems in N=6 Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Kentaro Hanaki and Hai Lin
Abstract: We study two aspects of M5-branes in N=6 U(N)xU(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory. We first examine multiple M2-branes ending on a M5-brane. We study Basu-Harvey type cubic equations, fuzzy funnel configurations, and derive the M5-brane tension from the N=6 theory. We also find a limit in which the above M2-M5 system reduces to a D2-D4 system and we recover the Nahm equation from the N=6 theory. We then examine domain wall configurations in mass-deformed N=6 theory with a manifest SU(2)xSU(2)xU(1) global symmetry. We derive tensions of domain walls connecting between arbitrary M5-brane vacua of the deformed theory and observe their consistency with gravity dual expectations.
