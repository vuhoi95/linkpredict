Title: Relaxed Three-Algebras: Their Matrix Representations and Implications  for Multi M2-brane Theory
Authors: M. Ali-Akbari and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and J. Simon
Abstract: We argue that one can relax the requirements of the non-associative three-algebras recently used in constructing D=3, N=8 superconformal field theories, and introduce the notion of ``relaxed three-algebras''. We present a specific realization of the relaxed three-algebras in terms of classical Lie algebras with a matrix representation, endowed with a non-associative four-bracket structure which is prescribed to replace the three-brackets of the three-algebras. We show that both the so(4)-based solutions as well as the cases with non-positive definite metric find a uniform description in our setting. We discuss the implications of our four-bracket representation for the D=3, N=8 and multi M2-brane theory and show that our setup can shed light on the problem of negative kinetic energy degrees of freedom of the Lorentzian case.
