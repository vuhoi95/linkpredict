Title: On Gribov's supercriticality picture of quark confinement
Authors: Christian S. Fischer and Dominik Nickel and Richard Williams
Abstract: Some years ago Gribov developed the so-called supercritical light quark confinement scenario. Based on physical arguments he conjectured a drastic change in the analytical properties of the quark propagator when the back-reaction of Goldstone bosons (pions) is considered. We investigate this scenario and provide numerical solutions for the quark propagator in the complex plane with and without the pion back-reaction. We find no evidence for the scenario Gribov advocated. As an aside we present a novel method to solve the quark Dyson-Schwinger equation in the complex plane and discuss new characteristics of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in our truncation scheme.
