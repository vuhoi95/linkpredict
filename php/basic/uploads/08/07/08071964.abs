Title: The massless supersymmetric ladder with L rungs
Authors: G. C. Rossi and Ya . S. Stanev
Abstract: We show that in the massless N=1 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino theory it is possible to devise a computational strategy by which the x-space calculation of the ladder 4-point correlators can be carried out without introducing any regularization. As an application we derive a representation valid at all loop orders in terms of conformal invariant integrals. We obtain an explicit expression of the 3-loop ladder diagram for collinear external points.
