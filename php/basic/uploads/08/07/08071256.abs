Title: Hamilton-Jacobi Counterterms for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: James T. Liu and Wafic A. Sabra
Abstract: The on-shell gravitational action and the boundary stress tensor are essential ingredients in the study of black hole thermodynamics. We employ the Hamilton-Jacobi method to calculate the boundary counterterms necessary to remove the divergences and allow the study of the thermodynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes.
