Title: Orbifolding the Membrane Action
Authors: Seiji Terashima and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: We study a simple class of orbifolds of the N=6 Chern-Simons Matter theory proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena. They are considered as a world volume theory of membranes probing C^4/ (Z_k x Z_n) and include a new membrane theory with N=4 supersymmetries. We find that the moduli spaces of them are consistent with the fact that they probe C^4/ (Z_k x Z_n).
