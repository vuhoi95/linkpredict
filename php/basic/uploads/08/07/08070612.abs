Title: Neutrino Mixing and the Private Higgs
Authors: Rafael A. Porto and A. Zee
Abstract: We extend the Private Higgs scenario to account for charged lepton and neutrino masses by introducing a private Higgs field for each lepton family. We analyze a model in which neutrino Majorana masses are radiatively induced. Contrary to previous models the neutrino mass scale ~ 10^{-2} eV is naturally obtained without excessive fine tunings. The model requires the introduction of SU(2) singlet scalar fields, two charged and one neutral. We discuss a possible realization giving a normal neutrino mass hierarchy. Our model fits data and predicts a non-zero V_{e3}.
