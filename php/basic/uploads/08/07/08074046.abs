Title: New anatomy of quantum holonomy
Authors: Taksu Cheon and Atushi Tanaka
Abstract: We present a unified formulation of quantum holonomy which is capable of describing all of its known varieties. The full role of non-Abelian gauge connection is elucidated. As examples, solvable models of quantum kicked spin are analyzed. They are shown to exhibit spiral holonomy, as well as Berry phase and Wilczek-Zee holonomy.
