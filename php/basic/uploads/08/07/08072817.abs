Title: Dynamics of D3-D7 Brane Inflation in Throats
Authors: Fang Chen and Hassan Firouzjahi
Abstract: Dynamics of D3-branes in models of warped D3-D7 inflationary set up is studied where perturbative $\alpha'$ correction to the K\"ahler potential and the nonperturbative corrections to the superpotential are included. It is shown that a dS minimum can be obtained without introducing anti-branes. Some specific configurations of D7-branes embedding were studied. After stabilizing the angular directions, it is shown that the resulting D3-D7 potential of the radial position of the D3-brane is too steep to allow slow-roll inflation. Depending on D7-branes embedding and the stabilized angular directions, the mobile D3-brane can move either towards the tip of the throat or towards the D7-branes.
