Title: Z' boson detection in the Minimal Quiver Standard Model
Authors: D. Berenstein and R. Martinez and F. Ochoa and S. Pinansky
Abstract: We undertake a phenomenological study of the extra neutral Z' boson in the Minimal Quiver Standard Model and discuss limits on the model's parameters from previous precision electroweak experiments, as well as detection prospects at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We find that masses lower than around 700 GeV are excluded by the $Z$-pole data from the CERN-LEP collider, and below 620 GeV by experimental data from di-electron events at the Fermilab-Tevatron collider. We also find that at a mass of 1 TeV the LHC cross section would show a small peak in the di-lepton and top pair channel.
