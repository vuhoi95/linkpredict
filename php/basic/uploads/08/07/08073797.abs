Title: A Holographic Dual of Bjorken Flow
Authors: Shunichiro Kinoshita and Shinji Mukohyama and Shin Nakamura and Kin-ya Oda
Abstract: We propose a consistent setup for a holographic dual of Bjorken flow of strongly coupled large-Nc N=4 SYM-theory plasma. We employ Eddington-Finkelstein type coordinates for the dual geometry, and we propose a late-time expansion there. We construct the dual geometry order by order, and we show that the transport coefficients are determined by the regularity of the geometry. We also show that the dual geometry has an apparent horizon hence an event horizon, which covers the singularity at the origin. We prove that the dual geometry is regular at all orders under an appropriate choice of the transport coefficients. Our model is a concrete well-defined example of time-dependent AdS/CFT.
