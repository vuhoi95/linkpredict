Title: Z-prime Searches at the LHC: Some QCD Precision Studies in Drell-Yan
Authors: Claudio Coriano and Alon E. Faraggi and Marco Guzzi
Abstract: Discovery potentials for extra neutral interactions at the Large Hadron Collider in forthcoming experiments are analyzed in Drell-Yan. For this purpose we use high precision next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) determination of the mass invarian distributions and of the total cross sections in the kinematic region around 1 TeV. In this region we explore the possibility to make a preliminary distinction between different anomaly-free extentions of the Standard Model.
