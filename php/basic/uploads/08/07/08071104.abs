Title: Evidence for a bound on the lifetime of de Sitter space
Authors: Ben Freivogel and Matthew Lippert
Abstract: Recent work has suggested a surprising new upper bound on the lifetime of de Sitter vacua in string theory. The bound is parametrically longer than the Hubble time but parametrically shorter than the recurrence time. We investigate whether the bound is satisfied in a particular class of de Sitter solutions, the KKLT vacua. Despite the freedom to make the supersymmetry breaking scale exponentially small, which naively would lead to extremely stable vacua, we find that the lifetime is always less than about exp(10^(22)) Hubble times, in agreement with the proposed bound.
