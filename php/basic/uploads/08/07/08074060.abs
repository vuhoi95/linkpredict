Authors: Yuta Kodama and Kento Kokubu and Nobuyuki Sawado
Abstract: We construct brane solutions in six dimensional Einstein-Skyrme systems. A class of baby skyrmion solutions realize warped compactification of the extra dimensions and gravity localization on the brane for negative bulk cosmological constant. Coupling of the fermions with the brane skyrmions successfully lead to the brane localized fermions. The standard representation of the gamma matrices is used to obtain massive localized modes as well as the massless one. Nonlinear nature of the skyrmions brings richer information for the fermions level structure. In terms of the level crossing picture, emergence of the massive localized modes as well as the zero mode are observed.
