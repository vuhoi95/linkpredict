Title: Nonlinear Schrodinger-Pauli Equations
Authors: Wei Khim Ng and Rajesh R. Parwani
Abstract: We obtain novel nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger-Pauli equations through a formal non-relativistic limit of appropriately constructed nonlinear Dirac equations. This procedure automatically provides a physical regularisation of potential singularities brought forward by the nonlinear terms and suggests how to regularise previous equations studied in the literature. The enhancement of contributions coming from the regularised singularities suggests that the obtained equations might be useful for future precision tests of quantum nonlinearity.
