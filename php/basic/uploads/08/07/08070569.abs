Title: Supersymmetry of the magnetic vortex
Authors: C Duval and P Horvathy
Abstract: The N=2 supersymmetry of the Pauli Hamiltonian in any static magnetic field in the plane combines, for the magnetic vortex, with Jackiw's bosonic $o(2)\times o(2,1)$ symmetry, into an $o(2)\times osp(1/2)$ dynamical supersymmetry.
