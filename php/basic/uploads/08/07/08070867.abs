Title: Meta-stable Supersymmetry Breaking in an N=1 Perturbed Seiberg-Witten  Theory
Authors: Shin Sasaki and Masato Arai and Claus Montonen and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: In this contribution, we discuss the possibility of meta-stable supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking vacua in a perturbed Seiberg-Witten theory with Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. We found meta-stable SUSY breaking vacua at the degenerated dyon and monopole singular points in the moduli space at the nonperturbative level.
