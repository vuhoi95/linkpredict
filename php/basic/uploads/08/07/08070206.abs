Title: Reducible higher-spin multiplets in flat and AdS spaces and their  geometric frame-like formulation
Authors: Dmitri P. Sorokin and Mikhail A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We consider the frame-like formulation of reducible sets of totally symmetric bosonic and fermionic higher-spin fields in flat and AdS backgrounds of any dimension, that correspond to so-called higher-spin triplets resulting from the string-inspired BRST approach. The explicit relationship of the fields of higher-spin triplets to the higher-spin vielbeins and connections is found. The gauge invariant actions are constructed including, in particular, the reducible (i.e. triplet) higher-spin fermion case in AdS_D space.
