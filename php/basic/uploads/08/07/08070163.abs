Title: Three-Algebras and N=6 Chern-Simons Gauge Theories
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Neil Lambert
Abstract: We derive the general form for a three-dimensional scale-invariant field theory with N=6 supersymmetry, SU(4) R-symmetry and a U(1) global symmetry. The results can be written in terms of a 3-algebra in which the triple product is not antisymmetric. For a specific choice of 3-algebra we obtain the N=6 theories that have been recently proposed as models for M2-branes in an R^8/Z_k orbifold background.
