Title: Partition Functions of Three-Dimensional Quantum Gravity and the Black  Hole Entropy
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and M. E. X. Guimaraes
Abstract: We analyze aspects of the holographic principle relevant to the quantum gravity partition functions in Euclidean sector of AdS$_3$. The sum of the known contributions to the partitions functions can be presented exactly, including corrections, in the form where the Patterson-Selberg zeta function involves.
