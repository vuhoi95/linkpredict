Title: Thermal hadron spectrum in $e^+e^-$ annihilation from gauge/string  duality
Authors: Yoshitaka Hatta and Toshihiro Matsuo
Abstract: We compute the inclusive spectrum of produced particles in e+e- annihilation in confining gauge theories that have a gravity dual and show that the momentum distribution exhibits the thermal behavior.
