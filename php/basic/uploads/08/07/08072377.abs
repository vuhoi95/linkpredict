Title: Shear Viscosity from AdS Born-Infeld Black Holes
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: We calculate the shear viscosity in the frame of AdS/CFT correspondence for the field theory with a gravity dual of Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity. We find that the ratio of $\eta/s$ is still the conjectured universal value $1/4\pi$ at least up to the first order of the Born-Infeld parameter $1/b^2$.
