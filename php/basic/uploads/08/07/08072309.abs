Title: Maximal analytic extensions of the Emparan-Reall black ring
Authors: Piotr T. Chru≈õciel and Julien Cortier
Abstract: We construct a Kruskal-Szekeres-type analytic extension of the Emparan-Reall black ring, and investigate its geometry. We prove that the extension is maximal, globally hyperbolic, and unique within a natural class of extensions. The key to those results is the proof that causal geodesics are either complete, or approach a singular boundary in finite affine time. Alternative maximal analytic extensions are also constructed.
