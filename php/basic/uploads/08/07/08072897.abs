Title: A New Holographic Model of Chiral Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Stanislav Kuperstein and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: A new family of models of flavour chiral symmetry breaking is proposed. The models are based on the embedding of a stack of D7-branes and a stack of anti D7-branes in the conifold background. This family of gravity models is dual to a field theory with spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance and chiral flavour symmetry. We identify the corresponding Goldstone bosons and compute the spectra of massive scalar and vector mesons. The dual quiver gauge theory is also discussed. We further analyse a model where chiral symmetry is not broken.
