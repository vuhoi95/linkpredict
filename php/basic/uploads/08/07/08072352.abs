Title: N=4 Super Yang-Mills from the Plane Wave Matrix Model
Authors: Takaaki Ishii and Goro Ishiki and Shinji Shimasaki and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative definition of N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM). We realize N=4 SYM on RxS^3 as the theory around a vacuum of the plane wave matrix model. Our regularization preserves sixteen supersymmetries and the gauge symmetry. We perform the 1-loop calculation to give evidences that the superconformal symmetry is restored in the continuum limit.
