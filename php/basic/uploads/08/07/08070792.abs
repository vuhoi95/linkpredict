Title: Phase diagram of SU(2) with 2 flavors of dynamical adjoint quarks
Authors: Simon Catterall and Joel Giedt and Francesco Sannino and Joe Schneible
Abstract: We report on numerical simulations of SU(2) lattice gauge theory with two flavors of light dynamical quarks in the adjoint of the gauge group. The dynamics of this theory is thought to be very different from QCD -- the theory exhibiting conformal or near conformal behavior in the infrared. We make a high resolution survey of the phase diagram of this model in the plane of the bare coupling and quark mass on lattices of size 8^3 \times 16. Our simulations reveal a line of first order phase transitions extending from beta=0 to beta=beta_c \sim 2.0. For beta > beta_c the phase boundary is no longer first order but continues as the locus of minimum meson mass. For beta > 2.0 we observe the pion and rho masses along the phase boundary to be light, independent of bare coupling and approximately degenerate. We discuss possible interpretations of these observations and corresponding continuum limits.
