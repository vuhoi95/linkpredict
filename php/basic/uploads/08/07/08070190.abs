Title: Moduli Stabilization in non-Supersymmetric Minkowski Vacua with  Anomalous U(1) Symmetry
Authors: Diego Gallego and Marco Serone
Abstract: We study how two moduli can be stabilized in a Minkowski/de Sitter vacuum for a wide class of string-inspired Supergravity models with an effective Fayet-like Supersymmetry breaking. It is shown under which conditions this mechanism can be made natural and how it can give rise to an interesting spectrum of soft masses, with a relatively small mass difference between scalar and gaugino masses. In absence of a constant superpotential term, the above mechanism becomes completely natural and gives rise to a dynamical supersymmetry breaking mechanism. Some specific type IIB and heterotic string inspired models are considered in detail.
