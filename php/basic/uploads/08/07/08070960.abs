Title: Spherically Symmetric Noncommutative Space: d = 4
Authors: Maja Buric and John Madore
Abstract: In order to find a noncommutative analog of Schwarzschild or Schhwarzschild-de Sitter blackhole we investigate spherically symmetric spaces generated by four noncommutative coordinates in the frame formalism. We present two solutions which however do not posess the prescribed commutative limit. Our analysis indicates that the appropriate noncommutative space might be found as a subspace of a higher-dimensional space.
