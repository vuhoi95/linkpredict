Title: On kappa-deformation and triangular quasibialgebra structure
Authors: C. A. S. Young and R. Zegers
Abstract: We show that, up to terms of order 1/kappa^5, the kappa-deformed Poincare algebra can be endowed with a triangular quasibialgebra structure. The universal R matrix and coassociator are given explicitly to the first few orders. In the context of kappa-deformed quantum field theory, we argue that this structure, assuming it exists to all orders, ensures that states of any number of identical particles, in any representation, can be defined in a kappa-covariant fashion.
