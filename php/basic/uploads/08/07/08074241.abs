Title: Three-dimensional Chern-Simons black holes
Authors: K. Ait Moussa and G. Clement and H. Guennoune and C. Leygnac
Abstract: We construct black hole solutions to three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with both gravitational and electromagnetic Chern-Simons terms. These intrinsically rotating solutions are geodesically complete, and causally regular within a certain parameter range. Their mass, angular momentum and entropy are found to satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics. These Chern-Simons black holes admit a four-parameter local isometry algebra, which generically is $sl(2,R)\times R$, and may be generated from the corresponding vacua by local coordinate transformations.
