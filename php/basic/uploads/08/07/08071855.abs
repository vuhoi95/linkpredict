Title: Inclusion of Yang-Mills Fields in String Corrected Supergravity
Authors: S. Bellucci and D. O'Reilly
Abstract: We consistently incorporate Yang Mills matter fields into string corrected (deformed), D=10, N=1 Supergravity. We solve the Bianchi identities within the framework of the modified beta function favored constraints to second order in the string slope parameter $\g$ also including the Yang Mills fields. In the torsion, curvature and H sectors we find that a consistent solution is readily obtained with a Yang Mills modified supercurrent $A_{abc}$. We find a solution in the F sector following our previously developed method.
