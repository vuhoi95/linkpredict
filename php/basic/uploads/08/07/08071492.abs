Title: Noncommutative field theory with the Wick-Voros product
Authors: Salvatore Galluccio and Fedele Lizzi and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We study the noncommutative scalar field theory in the presence of the Wick-Voros product (or normally ordered product), a variant of the more studied Moyal product. We discuss both the classical and the quantum field theory in the quartic potential case, and calculate the Green's functions up to one loop, for the two and four points cases.
