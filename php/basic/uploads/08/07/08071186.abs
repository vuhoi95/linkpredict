Title: Quantum gravity equation in large N Yang-Mills quantum mechanics
Authors: Toshihiro Matsuo and Dan Tomino and Wen-Yu Wen and Syoji Zeze
Abstract: We propose a new interpretation of the BFSS large N matrix quantum mechanics analogous to a novel interpretation of the IKKT matrix model where infinitely large N matrices act as differential operators in a curved space. In this picture, the Schr\"odinger equation in the BFSS model is regarded as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation which determines the wave function of universe. An explicit solution of wave function is studied in a simple two-dimensional minisuperspace model.
