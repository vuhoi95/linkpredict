Title: On the low energy brane/anti-brane dynamics
Authors: J. X. Lu and Bo Ning and Guan-Nan Zhong
Abstract: We study the dynamical behavior of a pair of Dp-brane and anti Dp-brane ($0 \leq p \leq 6$) moving parallel to each other in the region where the brane and anti-brane annihilation will not occur and the low energy description is valid. Given this, we perform a general analysis, in the center of mass frame, of the behavior of the effective potential with respect to the relative brane separation and find that the classical orbits of this system are in general unbound except for $p = 6$ case for which classical bound orbits exist. The non-linearity of the low energy DBI action for D-brane is important for the underlying dynamics. We solve also the explicit orbits for $p = 6$ case.
