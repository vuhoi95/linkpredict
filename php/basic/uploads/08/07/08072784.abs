Title: The Bifurcation Theory of Magnetic Monopoles in a Charged Two-Condensate  Bose-Einstein System
Authors: Shu-Fan Mo and Ji-Rong Ren and Tao Zhu
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, that are particle-like field configurations with which one can associate a topological charge, widely exist in various three dimensional condensate systems. In this paper, by making use of \emph{Duan}'s topological current theory, we obtain the charge density of magnetic monopoles and their bifurcation theory in a charged two condensate Bose-Einstein system. The evolution of magnetic monopoles is studied from the topological properties of a three-dimensional vector field. The magnetic monopoles are found generating or annihilating at the limit points and encountering, splitting, or merging at the bifurcation points.
