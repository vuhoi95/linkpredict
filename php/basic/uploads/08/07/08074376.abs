Title: Non supersymmetric strong coupling background from the large N quantum  mechanics of two matrices coupled via a Yang-Mills interaction
Authors: Jo√£o P. Rodrigues and Alia Zaidi
Abstract: We derive the planar large N non-supersymmetric background of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of two hermitean matrices coupled via a Yang-Mills interaction, in terms of the density of eigenvalues of one of the matrices. This background satisfies an implicit non linear integral equation, with a perturbative small coupling expansion and a solvable large coupling solution, which is obtained. The energy of system and the expectation value of several correlators are obtained in this strong coupling limit. They are free of infrared divergences.
