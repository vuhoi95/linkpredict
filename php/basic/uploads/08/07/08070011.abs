Title: Breakdown of the operator product expansion in the 't Hooft model
Authors: Jorge Mondejar and Antonio Pineda
Abstract: We consider deep inelastic scattering in the 't Hooft model. Being solvable, this model allows us to directly compute the moments associated with the cross section at next-to-leading order in the 1/Q^2 expansion. We perform the same computation using the operator product expansion. We find that all the terms match in both computations except for one in the hadronic side, which is proportional to a non-local operator. The basics of the result suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in four dimensions in the large N_c limit.
