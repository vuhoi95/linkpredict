Title: Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory in the Hamiltonian approach
Authors: H. Reinhardt and D. Campagnari and D. Epple and M. Leder and M. Pak and W. Schleifenbaum
Abstract: Within the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge the ghost and gluon propagators are determined from a variational solution of the Yang-Mills Schroedinger equation showing both gluon and heavy quark confinement. The continuum results are in good agreement with lattice data. The ghost form factor is identified as the dielectric function of the Yang-Mills vacuum and a connection between the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario and the dual Meissner effect is established. The topological susceptibility is calculated.
