Title: Comments on string theory backgrounds with non-relativistic conformal  symmetry
Authors: Juan Maldacena and Dario Martelli and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We consider non-relativistic conformal quantum mechanical theories that arise by doing discrete light cone quantization of field theories. If the field theory has a gravity dual, then the conformal quantum mechanical theory can have a gravity dual description in a suitable finite temperature and finite density regime. Using this we compute the thermodynamic properties of the system. We give an explicit example where we display both the conformal quantum mechanical theory as well as the gravity dual. We also discuss the string theory embedding of certain backgrounds with non-relativistic conformal symmetry that were recently discussed. Using this, we construct finite temperature and finite density solutions, with asymptotic non-relativistic conformal symmetry. In addition, we derive consistent Kaluza-Klein truncations of type IIB supergravity to a five dimensional theory with massive vector fields.
