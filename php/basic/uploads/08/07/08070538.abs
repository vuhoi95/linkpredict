Title: Discrete Skyrmions in 2+1 and 3+1 Dimensions
Authors: Theodora Ioannidou and Panos Kevrekidis
Abstract: This paper describes a lattice version of the Skyrme model in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. The discrete model is derived from a consistent discretization of the radial continuum problem. Subsequently, the existence and stability of the skyrmion solutions existing on the lattice are investigated. One consequence of the proposed models is that the corresponding discrete skyrmions have a high degree of stability, similar to their continuum counterparts.
