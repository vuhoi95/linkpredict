Title: Holographic renormalization for coincident Dp-branes
Authors: Toby Wiseman and Benjamin Withers
Abstract: We consider holographic renormalization for the decoupling limit of coincident Dp-branes. We truncate the theory to the supergravity sector which is homogeneous on the (8-p)-sphere and carries only RR electric (p+2)-flux, leaving a graviton and two scalar degrees of freedom associated to the dilaton and the sphere radius. We non-linearly construct the asymptotic graviton and dilaton deformations - the analog of the Graham-Fefferman expansion for AdS/CFT - and compute counterterms to give a finite renormalized bulk action and dual one point functions. Restricting to linear deformations we find additional counterterms to include the remaining sphere deformations which strongly deform the asymptotic behaviour.
