Title: Noncommutative Supertori in Two Dimensions
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Hoil Kim and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: First we consider the deformations of superspaces with N=(1,1) and N=(2,2) supersymmetries in two dimensions. Among these the construction of noncommutative supertorus with odd spin structure is possible only in the case of N=(2,2) supersymmetry broken down to N=(1,1). However, for the even spin structures the construction of noncommutative supertorus is possible for both N=(1,1) and N=(2,2) cases. The spin structures are realized by implementing the translational properties along the cycles of commutative supertorus in the operator version: Odd spin structure is realized by the translation in the fermionic direction in the same manner as in the construction of noncommutative torus, and even spin structures are realized with appropriate versions of the spin angular momentum operator.
