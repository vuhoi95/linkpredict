Title: Spiky Strings on AdS(4) X CP**3
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Kamal L. Panigrahi and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We study a giant magnon and a spike solution for the string rotating on AdS(4) X CP**3 geometry. We consider rigid rotating fundamental string in the SU(2) X SU(2) sector inside the CP**3 and find out the general form of all the conserved charges. We find out the dispersion relation corresponding to both the known giant magnon and the new spike solutions. We further study the finite size correction in both cases.
