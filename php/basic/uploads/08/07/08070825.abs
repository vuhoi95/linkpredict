Abstract: We study the Hawking radiation of (4+n)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole imbedded in the space-time with positive cosmological constant. The greybody and energy emission rates of scalars, fermions, bosons, and gravitons are calculated in the full range of energy. The valuable information on the dimensions and curvature of space-time is revealed. Furthermore, we investigate the entropy radiated and lost by black hole. We find their ratio near unit in favor of the Bekenstein's conjecture.
