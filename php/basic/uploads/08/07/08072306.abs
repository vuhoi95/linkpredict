Title: A field-theoretic model for Hodge theory
Authors: Saurabh Gupta and R. P. Malik
Abstract: We demonstrate that the four (3 + 1)-dimensional free Abelian 2-form gauge theory presents a tractable field theoretical model for the Hodge theory where the well-defined symmetry transformations correspond to the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. The conserved charges, corresponding to the above continuous symmetry transformations, obey an algebra that is reminiscent of the algebra obeyed by the cohomological operators. The discrete symmetry transformation of the theory represents the realization of the Hodge duality operation that exists in the relationship between the exterior and co-exterior derivatives of differential geometry. Thus, we provide the realizations of all the mathematical quantities, associated with the de Rham cohomological operators, in the language of the symmetries of the present 4D free Abelian 2-form gauge theory.
