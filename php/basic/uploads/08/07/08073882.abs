Title: The SU(2) X U(1) Electroweak Model based on the Nonlinearly Realized  Gauge Group
Authors: Daniele Bettinelli and Ruggero Ferrari and Andrea Quadri
Abstract: The electroweak model is formulated on the nonlinearly realized gauge group SU(2) X U(1). This implies that in perturbation theory no Higgs field is present. The paper provides the effective action at the tree level, the Slavnov Taylor identity (necessary for the proof of unitarity), the local functional equation (used for the control of the amplitudes involving the Goldstone bosons) and the subtraction procedure (nonstandard, since the theory is not power-counting renormalizable). Particular attention is devoted to the number of independent parameters relevant for the vector mesons; in fact there is the possibility of introducing two mass parameters. With this choice the relation between the ratio of the intermediate vector meson masses and the Weinberg angle depends on an extra free parameter. We briefly outline a method for dealing with \gamma_5 in dimensional regularization. The model is formulated in the Landau gauge for sake of simplicity and conciseness: the QED Ward identity has a simple and intriguing form.
