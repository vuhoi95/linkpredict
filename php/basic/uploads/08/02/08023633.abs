Title: Casimir force for a sphere in front of a plane beyond Proximity Force  Approximation
Authors: M. Bordag and V. Nikolaev
Abstract: For the configuration of a sphere in front of a plane we calculate the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion for small separation of the Casimir force. We consider both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
