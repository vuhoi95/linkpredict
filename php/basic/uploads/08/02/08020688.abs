Title: Quantum cosmology with a minimal length
Authors: Marco Valerio Battisti and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: Quantum cosmology in the presence of a fundamental minimal length is analyzed in the context of the flat isotropic and the Taub cosmological models. Such minimal scale comes out from a generalized uncertainty principle and the quantization is performed in the minisuperspace representation. Both the quantum Universes are singularity-free and (i) in the isotropic model no evidences for a Big-Bounce appear; (ii) in the Taub one a quasi-isotropic configuration for the Universe is predicted by the model.
