Title: Dimensions of Supersymmetric Operators from AdS/CFT
Authors: G. Cacciapaglia and G. Marandella and J. Terning
Abstract: We examine the AdS/CFT correspondence through a manifestly 5D supersymmetric formalism, corresponding to a 4D N=1 supersymmetric CFT. We find that the dimensions of scalar and fermionic component operators are simply related, and that there is a smooth transition of scalar operator dimensions through the value d_s = 2. By using this formalism, we also show that the formula used in the string literature for the dimension of fermion operators is incomplete.
