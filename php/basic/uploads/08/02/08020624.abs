Title: PT-symmetric deformations of Calogero models
Authors: Andreas Fring and Miloslav Znojil
Abstract: We demonstrate that Coxeter groups allow for complex PT-symmetric deformations across the boundaries of all Weyl chambers. We compute the explicit deformations for the A_2 and G_2-Coxeter group and apply these constructions to Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models invariant under the extended Coxeter groups. The eigenspecta for the deformed models are real and contain the spectra of the undeformed case as subsystem.
