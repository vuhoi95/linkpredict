Title: Thermodynamics of Einstein-Born-Infeld black holes with negative  cosmological constant
Authors: Olivera Miskovic and Rodrigo Olea
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics associated to topological black hole solutions of AdS gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (Born-Infeld) in any dimension, using a background-independent regularization prescription for the Euclidean action given by boundary terms which explicitly depend on the extrinsic curvature (Kounterterms series). A finite action principle leads to the correct definition of thermodynamic variables as Noether charges, which satisfy a Smarr-like relation. In particular, for the odd-dimensional case, a consistent thermodynamic description is achieved if the internal energy of the system includes the vacuum energy for AdS spacetime.
