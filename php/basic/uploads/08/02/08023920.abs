Title: Acceleration radiation and the Planck scale
Authors: I. Agullo and J. Navarro-Salas and G. J. Olmo and L. Parker
Abstract: A uniformly accelerating observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of radiation. We point out that this field-theory effect can be derived, for any dimension higher than two, without actually invoking very high energy physics. This supports the view that this phenomenon is robust against Planck-scale physics and, therefore, should be compatible with any underlying microscopic theory.
