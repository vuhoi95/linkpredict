Title: Nonlocal Particles as Strings
Authors: Tai-Chung Cheng and Pei-Ming Ho and Tze-Kei Lee
Abstract: We find nonlocal particle theories with two dimensional conformal symmetry, including examples equivalent to the bosonic open string and closed string. This work provides a new approach to construct solvable consistent backgrounds in string theory.
