Abstract: We study the scalar perturbation in the background of the charged Kaluza-Klein black holes with squashed horizons. We find that the position of infinite discontinuities of the heat capacities can be reflected in quasinormal spectrum. This shows the possible non-trivial relation between the thermodynamical and dynamical properties of black holes.
