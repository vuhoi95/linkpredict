Title: Scattering of Topological Solitons on Barriers and Holes of Deformed  Sine-Gordon Models
Authors: Jassem H. Al-Alawi and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study scattering properties of topological solitons in two classes of models, which are generalizations of the Sine-Gordon model and which have recently been proposed by Bazeia et al. These two classes of models depend on an integer parameter n which, when n=2(for the first class) and n=1 (for the second class), reduce to the Sine-Gordon model. We take the soliton solutions of these models (generalizations of the 'kink' solution of the Sine-Gordon model) and consider their scattering on potential holes and barriers. We present our results for n=1,...6. We find that, like in the Sine Gordon models, the scattering on the barrier is very elastic while the scattering on the hole is inelastic and can at times, lead to a reflection. We discuss the dependence of our results on n and find that the critical velocity for the transmission through the hole is lowest for n=3.
