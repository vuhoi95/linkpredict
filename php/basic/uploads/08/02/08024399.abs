Title: Cosmon Lumps and Horizonless Black Holes
Authors: Timm Krueger and Matthias Neubert and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: We investigate non-linear, spherically symmetric solutions to the coupled system of a quintessence field and Einstein gravity. In the presence of a scalar potential, we find regular solutions that to an outside observer very closely resemble Schwarzschild black holes. However, these cosmon lumps have neither a horizon nor a central singularity. A stability analysis reveals that our static solutions are dynamically unstable. It remains an open question whether analogous stable solutions exist.
