Title: A fundamental length as a candidate for dark energy: a DSR inspired FRW  spacetime
Authors: N. Khosravi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We show that the existence of a fundamental length, introduced in Deformed Special Relativity (DSR) inspired minisuper (phase-) space, causes the behavior of the scale factor of the universe to change from that of a universe filled with dust to an accelerating universe driven by a cosmological constant.
