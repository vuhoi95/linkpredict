Title: Lorentz symmetry violation and an Analog of Landau levels
Authors: E. Passos and L. R. Ribeiro and C Furtado and J. R. Nascimento
Abstract: Within the context of Lorentz violating extended electrodynamics, we study an analog of Landau quantization for a system where a neutral particle moves in the presence of an electromagnetic field and a constant four-vector that breaks Lorentz symmetry. The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian associated to this system is obtained using the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for a Dirac spinor. The degenerated energy spectrum is obtained for a time-like and a space-like parameter Lorentz-breaking vector. The energy dependence of the cyclotron rotation direction in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is analyzed.
