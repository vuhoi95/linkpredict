Title: PP-waves on Superbrane Backgrounds
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Benjamin Harms
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a method of generating supersymmetric solutions of the Einstein equations. The method involves the embedding of one supersymmetric spacetime into another. We present two examples with constituent spacetimes which support "charges", one of which was known previously and the other of which is new. Both examples have PP-waves as one of the embedding constituents.
