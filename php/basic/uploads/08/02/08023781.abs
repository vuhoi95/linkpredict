Title: BRST operators for W algebras
Authors: A. P. Isaev and S. O. Krivonos and O. V. Ogievetsky
Abstract: The study of quantum Lie algebras motivates a use of non-canonical ghosts and anti-ghosts for non-linear algebras, like W-algebras. This leads, for the W_3 and W_3^(2) algebras, to the BRST operator having the conventional cubic form.
