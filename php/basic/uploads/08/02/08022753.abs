Title: Conformal Supersymmetry Breaking and Dynamical Tuning of the  Cosmological Constant
Authors: M. Ibe and Y. Nakayama and T. T. Yanagida
Abstract: We propose "conformal supersymmetry breaking" models, which tightly relate the conformal breaking scale (i.e. R-symmetry breaking scale) and the supersymmetry breaking scale. The both scales are originated from the constant term in the superpotential through the common source of the R-symmetry breaking. We show that dynamical tuning between those mass scales significantly reduces the degree of fine-tuning necessary for generating the almost vanishing cosmological constant.
