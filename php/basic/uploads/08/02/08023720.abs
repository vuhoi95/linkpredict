Title: Response of Holographic QCD to Electric and Magnetic Fields
Authors: Oren Bergman and Gilad Lifschytz and Matthew Lippert
Abstract: We study the response of the Sakai-Sugimoto holographic model of large N_c QCD at nonzero temperature to external electric and magnetic fields. In the electric case we find a first-order insulator-conductor transition in both the confining and deconfining phases of the model. In the deconfining phase the conductor is described by the parallel 8-brane-anti-8-brane embedding with a current of quarks and anti-quarks. We compute the conductivity and show that it agrees precisely with a computation using the Kubo formula. In the confining phase we propose a new kind of 8-brane embedding, corresponding to a baryonic conductor. In the magnetic field case we show that the critical temperature for chiral-symmetry restoration in the deconfined phase increases with the field and approaches a finite value in the limit of an infinite magnetic field. We also illustrate the nonlinear behavior of the electric and magnetic susceptibilities in the different phases.
