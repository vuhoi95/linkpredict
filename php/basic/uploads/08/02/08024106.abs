Title: Explicit Action of E7(7) on N=8 Supergravity Fields
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Masoud Soroush
Abstract: We present an explicit, exact to all orders in gravitational coupling E7(7) symmetry transformations of on-shell N=8 supergravity fields in the gauge with 70 scalars in E7(7)/SU(8) coset space, the local SU(8) symmetry being fixed. The non-linear realization of E7(7) includes a field-dependent SU(8) transformation preserving the unitary gauge. We find the conserved Noether-Gaillard-Zumino current of E7(7) symmetry, the linear part of it being a chiral SU(8) symmetry. We comment on the conformal realization of the E7(7) algebra which includes a dilatation operator. We hope that these results can be useful for studies of anomalies/absence of anomalies and the UV behavior of N=8 supergravity.
