Title: Decay of Massive Dirac Hair on a Brane-World Black Hole
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Marek Rogatko and Agnieszka Szyp≈Çowska
Abstract: We investigate the intermediate and late-time behaviour of the massive Dirac spinor field in the background of static spherically symmetric brane-world black hole solutions. The intermediate asymptotic behaviour of the massive spinor field exhibits a dependence on the field's parameter mass as well as the multiple number of the wave mode. On the other hand, the late-time behaviour power law decay has a rate which is independent of those factors.
