Title: Topological Entanglement Entropy in Chern-Simons Theories and Quantum  Hall Fluids
Authors: Shiying Dong and Eduardo Fradkin and Robert G. Leigh and Sean Nowling
Abstract: We compute directly the entanglement entropy of spatial regions in Chern-Simons gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions using surgery. We use these results to determine the universal topological piece of the entanglement entropy for Abelian and non-Abelian quantum Hall fluids.
