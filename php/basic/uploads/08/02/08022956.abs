Title: Remarks on Heavy-Light Mesons from AdS/CFT
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Stefan A. Stricker and Aleksi Vuorinen
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the energy spectrum of heavy-light mesons in a N=2 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory with two massive hypermultiplets. In the heavy quark limit, similar to QCD, we find that the excitation energies are independent of the heavy quark mass. We also make some remarks about related AdS/CFT models of flavor with less supersymmetry.
