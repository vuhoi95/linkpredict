Title: Mirage Pattern from the Heterotic String
Authors: Valeri Lowen and Hans Peter Nilles
Abstract: We provide a simple example of dilaton stabilization in the framework of heterotic string theory. It requires a gaugino condensate and an up-lifting sector similar to the one postulated in type IIB string theory. Its signature is a hybrid mediation of supersymmetry breakdown with a variant of a mirage pattern for the soft breaking terms. The set-up is suited for the discussion of heterotic MSSM candidates.
