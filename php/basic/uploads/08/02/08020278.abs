Title: Stable Mean Field Solution of a Short-Range Interacting SO(3) Quantum  Heisenberg Spin-Glass
Authors: C. M. S. da Conceição and E. C. Marino
Abstract: We present a mean-field solution for a quantum, short-range interacting, disordered, SO(3) Heisenberg spin model, in which the Gaussian distribution of couplings is centered in an AF coupling $\bar J>0$, and which, for weak disorder, can be treated as a perturbation of the pure AF Heisenberg system. The phase diagram contains, apart from a N\'eel phase at T=0, spin-glass and paramagnetic phases whose thermodynamic stability is demonstrated by an analysis of the Hessian matrix of the free-energy. The magnetic susceptibilities exhibit the typical cusp of a spin-glass transition.
