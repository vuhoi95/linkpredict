Title: Infrared-modified gravities and massive gravitons
Authors: V. A. Rubakov and P. G. Tinyakov
Abstract: We review some theoretical and phenomenological aspects of massive gravities in 4 dimensions. We start from the Fierz--Pauli theory with Lorentz-invariant mass terms and then proceed to Lorentz-violating masses. Unlike the former theory, some models with Lorentz-violation have no pathologies in the spectrum in flat and nearly flat backgrounds and lead to interesting phenomenology.
