Title: Emergent Gravity, Matrix Models and UV/IR Mixing
Authors: Harald Grosse and Harold Steinacker and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: We verify explicitly that UV/IR mixing for noncommutative gauge theory can be understood in terms of an induced gravity action, as predicted by the identification [1] of gravity within matrix models of NC gauge theory. More precisely, we obtain the Einstein-Hilbert action by integrating out a scalar field in the adjoint. It arises from the well-known UV/IR mixing of NC gauge theory, which is carefully re-analyzed and interpreted in terms of gravity. The matrix model therefore contains gravity as an IR effect, due to UV/IR mixing.
