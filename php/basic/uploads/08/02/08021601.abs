Title: Curvaton Decay into Baryons, anti-Baryons and Radiation
Authors: Martin Lemoine and Jerome Martin and Gregory Petit
Abstract: This paper calculates the amount of baryon/radiation isocurvature fluctuation produced through the decay of a curvaton field. It is shown in particular that if curvaton decay preserves baryon number and the curvaton dominates the energy density at the time of decay, the initial curvaton/radiation isocurvature mode is entirely transfered into a baryon/radiation isocurvature mode. This situation is opposite to that previously studied in three fluid models of curvaton decay; this difference is related to the conservation of the pre-existing baryon asymmetry and to the efficiency of the annihilation of all baryon/anti-baryon pairs produced in the decay. We study in detail the relevant cases in which the curvaton decay preserves or not baryon number and provide analytical and numerical calculations for each situation.
