Title: Holomorphic maps and the complete 1/N expansion of 2D SU(N) Yang-Mills
Authors: Yusuke Kimura and Sanjaye Ramgoolam
Abstract: We give a description of the complete 1/N expansion of SU(N) 2D Yang Mills theory in terms of the moduli space of holomorphic maps from non-singular worldsheets. This is related to the Gross-Taylor coupled 1/N expansion through a map from Brauer algebras to symmetric groups. These results point to an equality between Euler characters of moduli spaces of holomorphic maps from non-singular worldsheets with a target Riemann surface equipped with markings on the one hand and Euler characters of another moduli space involving worldsheets with double points (nodes).
