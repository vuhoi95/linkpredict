Title: Perverse coherent sheaves on blow-up. I. a quiver description
Authors: Hiraku Nakajima and Kota Yoshioka
Abstract: This is the first of two papers studying moduli spaces of a certain class of coherent sheaves, which we call {\it stable perverse coherent sheaves}, on the blowup of a projective surface. They are used to relate usual moduli spaces of stable sheaves on a surface and its blowup. In this first part, we give a quiver (or ADHM) description of moduli spaces for framed perverse coherent sheaves on the blowup of the projective plane.
