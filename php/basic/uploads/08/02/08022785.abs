Title: Nonlinear Supersymmetric General Relativity and Unity of Nature
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: The basic idea and some physical implications of nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity (NLSUSY GR) are discussed, which give new insights into the origin of mass and the mysterious relations between the cosmology and the low energy particle physics, e.g. the spontaneous SUSY breaking scale, the cosmological constant, the (dark) energy density of the universe and the neutrino mass.
