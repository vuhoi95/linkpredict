Title: Nonhermitian Supersymmetric Partition Functions: the case of one bosonic  flavor

Abstract: We discuss the supersymmetric formulation of the nonhermitian $\beta = 2$ random matrix partition function with one bosonic flavor. This partition function is regularized by adding one conjugate boson and fermion each. A supersymmetric nonlinear $\sigma$-model for the resulting Goldstone degrees of freedom is obtained using symmetry arguments only. For a Gaussian probability distribution the same results are derived using superbosonization and the complex orthogonal polynomial method. The symmetry arguments apply to any model with the same symmetries and a mass gap, and demonstrate the universality of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model.
