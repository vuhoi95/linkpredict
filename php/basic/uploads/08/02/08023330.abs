Title: Near Horizon Analysis of Extremal AdS5 Black Holes
Authors: Jaehyung Choi and Sungjay Lee and Sangmin Lee
Abstract: We study the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes in five dimensional gauged supergravity using Sen's entropy function formalism. Special attention is paid to the large black hole limit where the near horizon solution exhibits a universal dependence on the rotation. The physical properties of the large black hole solution are shown to agree with predictions from fluid mechanical description of the dual conformal field theory.
