Title: The Area Quantum and Snyder Space
Authors: Juan M. Romero and Adolfo Zamora
Abstract: We show that in the Snyder space the area of the disc and of the sphere can be quantized. It is also shown that the area spectrum of the sphere can be related to the Bekenstein conjecture for the area spectrum of a black hole horizon.
