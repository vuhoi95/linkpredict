Title: Six-Dimensional Yang Black Holes in Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Michael C. Abbott and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We study the six-dimensional dilaton gravity Yang black holes of hep-th/0607193, which carry (1,-1) charge in SU(2)xSU(2) gauge group. We find what values of the asymptotic parameters (mass and scalar charge) lead to a regular horizon, and show that there are no regular solutions with an extremal horizon.
