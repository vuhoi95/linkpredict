Abstract: We study the possibility of establishing the dual equivalence between the noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the noncommutative self-dual theory. It turns to be that whereas in the commutative case the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory can be mapped into the sum of the self-dual theory and the Chern-Simons theory, in the noncommutative case such a mapping is possible only for the theory with the modified Maxwell term.
