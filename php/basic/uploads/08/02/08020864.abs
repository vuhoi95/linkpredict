Title: Area-angle variables for general relativity
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Simone Speziale
Abstract: We introduce a modified Regge calculus for general relativity on a triangulated four dimensional Riemannian manifold where the fundamental variables are areas and a certain class of angles. These variables satisfy constraints which are local in the triangulation. We expect the formulation to have applications to classical discrete gravity and non-perturbative approaches to quantum gravity.
