Title: Twisted invariances of noncommutative gauge theories
Authors: Alvaro Duenas-Vidal and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We study noncommutative deformations of Yang-Mills theories and show that these theories admit a infinite, continuous family of twisted star-gauge invariances. This family interpolates continuously between star-gauge and twisted gauge transformations. The possible physical role of these start-twisted invariances is discussed.
