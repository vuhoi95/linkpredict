Title: A tunneling picture of dual giant Wilson loop
Authors: Akitsugu Miwa and Yoske Sumitomo and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We further discuss a rotating dual giant Wilson loop (D3-brane) solution constructed in Lorentzian AdS by Drukker et al. The solution is shown to be composed of a dual giant Wilson loop and a dual giant graviton by minutely examining its shape. This observation suggests that the corresponding gauge-theory operator should be a k-th symmetric Wilson loop with the insertions of dual giant graviton operators. To support the correspondence, the classical action of the solution should be computed and compared with the gauge-theory result. For this purpose we first perform a Wick rotation to the Lorentzian solution by following the tunneling prescription and obtain Euclidean solutions corresponding to a circular or a straight-line Wilson loop. In Euclidean signature boundary terms can be properly considered in the standard manner and the classical action for the Euclidean solutions can be evaluated. The result indeed reproduces the expectation value of the k-th symmetric Wilson loop as well as the power-law behavior of the correlation function of dual giant graviton operators.
