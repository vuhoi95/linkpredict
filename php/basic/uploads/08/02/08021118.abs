Title: Landau Problem in Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Sayipjamal Dulat and Kang Li
Abstract: The Landau problem in non-commutative quantum mechanics (NCQM) is studied. First by solving the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equations on noncommutative(NC) space we obtain the Landau energy levels and the energy correction that is caused by space-space noncommutativity. Then we discuss the noncommutative phase space case, namely, space-space and momentum-momentum non-commutative case, and we get the explicit expression of the Hamiltonian as well as the corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.
