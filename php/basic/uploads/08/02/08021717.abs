Title: Numerical Simulations of a Spherically Symmetric Yang-Mills system on a  de Sitter Manifold
Authors: H. Lux and K. Johannsen
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the dynamics of the cosmological Bartnick-McKinnon analogue with $n=1$ and $\Lambda=\Lambda_{reg}(n)$ . We derive boundary conditions from energy considerations. Numerical simulations are carried out to show the existence of a non-stationary solution.
