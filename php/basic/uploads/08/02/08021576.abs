Abstract: We consider the issue of statistics for identical particles or fields in kappa-deformed spaces, where the system admits a symmetry group G. We obtain the twisted flip operator compatible with the action of the symmetry group, which is relevant for describing particle statistics in presence of the noncommutativity. It is shown that for a special class of realizations, the twisted flip operator is independent of the ordering prescription.
