Title: The effective action of the heterotic string compactified on manifolds  with SU(3) structure
Authors: Iman Benmachiche and Jan Louis and Danny Martinez-Pedrera
Abstract: We derive the N=1 effective action of the heterotic string compactified on manifolds with SU(3) structure in the presence of background fluxes. We use a Kaluza-Klein reduction and compute the moduli dependence of the Kaehler potential, the gauge kinetic function and the superpotential entirely from fermionic terms of the reduced action.
