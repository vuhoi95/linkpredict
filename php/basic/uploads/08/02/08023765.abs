Title: Dynamical Casimir Effect for Two Oscillating Mirrors in 3-D
Authors: Cem Yuce and Zalihe Ozcakmakli
Abstract: The generation of photons in a three dimensional rectangular cavity with two moving boundaries is studied by using the Multiple Scale Analysis (MSA). It is shown that number of photons are enhanced for the cavity whose walls oscillate symmetrically with respect to the center of the cavity. The non-stationary Casimir effect is also discussed for the cavity which oscillates as a whole.
