Title: Gluon and ghost propagators in the Landau gauge: Deriving lattice  results from Schwinger-Dyson equations
Authors: A. C. Aguilar and D. Binosi and J. Papavassiliou
Abstract: We show that the application of a novel gauge invariant truncation scheme to the Schwinger-Dyson equations of QCD leads, in the Landau gauge, to an infrared finite gluon propagator and a divergent ghost propagator, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice data.
