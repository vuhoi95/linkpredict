Title: Janus and Multifaced Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: Chanju Kim and Eunkyung Koh and Ki-Myeong Lee
Abstract: We investigate the various properties Janus supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. A novel vacuum structure is found and BPS monopoles and dyons are studied. Less supersymmetric Janus theories found before are derived by a simpler method. In addition, we find the supersymmetric theories when the coupling constant depends on two and three spatial coordinates.
