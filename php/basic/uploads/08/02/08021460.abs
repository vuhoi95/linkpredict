Title: Photon and Dilepton Production in Soft Wall AdS/QCD
Authors: A. Nata Atmaja and K. Schalm
Abstract: We consider the Soft-Wall-model of AdS/QCD to calculate photon production in strongly coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP). The IR cut-off only affects the low-frequency-component of the production rate. The full spectral function is determined numerically and shows remarkable similarity to computations of the photon production rate in AdS-duals of $\cN=2$ theories with massive flavor. It is further support that Soft-Wall AdS-QCD correctly captures the IR physics of the chiral perturbation theory regime of QCD. We confirm this by relating the IR-effects of the massive flavor deformations to the AdS/QCD soft wall cut-off. The AdS/QCD spectral function is smooth, however, and unlike massive flavor models shows no spectral peaks.
