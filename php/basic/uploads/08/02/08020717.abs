Title: Long Distance Effects in Mixed Electromagnetic-Gravitational Scattering
Authors: Barry R. Holstein and Andreas Ross
Abstract: Using the methods of effective field theory we examine long range effects in mixed electromagnetic-gravitational scattering. Recent calculations which have yielded differing results for such effects are examined and corrected. We consider various spin configurations of the scattered particles and find that universality with respect to spin-dependence is obtained in agreement with expectations.
