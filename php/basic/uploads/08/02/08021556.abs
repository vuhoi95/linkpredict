Title: Partition Functions of Torsion >1 Dyons in Heterotic String Theory on  T^6
Authors: Shamik Banerjee and Ashoke Sen and Yogesh K. Srivastava
Abstract: The original proposal of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde for the quarter BPS dyon partition function in heterotic string theory on T^6 is known to correctly produce the degeneracy of dyons of torsion 1, i.e. dyons for which gcd(Q\wedge P)=1. We propose a generalization of this formula for dyons of arbitrary torsion. Our proposal satisfies the constraints coming from S-duality invariance, wall crossing formula, black hole entropy and the gauge theory limit. Furthermore using our proposal we derive a general wall crossing formula that is valid even when both the decay products are non-primitive half-BPS dyons.
