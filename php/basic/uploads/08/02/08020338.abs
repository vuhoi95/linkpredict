Title: On N = 2 superfield for N = 2 vector supermultiplet in two dimensional  spacetime
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We focus on the superfield formulation for a N = 2 vector supermultiplet in two dimensional spacetime and explicitly show that the Wess-Zumino gauge condition for a N = 2 superfield is compatible with familiar SUSY (plus U(1) gauge) transformations for the vector supermultiplet. N = 2 SUSY invariant mass and Yukawa interaction terms for the vector supermultiplet are also constructed from the superfield explicitly in addition to a free (kinetic) action.
