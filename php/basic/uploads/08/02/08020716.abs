Title: Spin Effects in Long Range Gravitational Scattering
Authors: Barry R. Holstein and Andreas Ross
Abstract: We study the gravitational scattering of massive particles with and without spin in the effective theory of gravity at one loop level. Our focus is on long distance effects arising from nonanalytic components of the scattering amplitude and we show that the spin-independent and the spin-dependent long range components exhibit a universal form. Both classical and quantum corrections are obtained, and the definition of a proper second order potential is discussed.
