Title: On the unitarity of gauged non-compact world-sheet supersymmetric WZNW  models
Authors: Jonas Bjornsson and Stephen Hwang
Abstract: In this paper we generalize our investigation of the unitarity of non-compact WZNW models connected to Hermitian symmetric spaces to the N=1 world-sheet supersymmetric extension of these models. We will prove that these models have a unitary spectrum in a BRST approach for antidominant highest weight representations if the level and weights of the gauged subalgebra are integers. We will find new critical string theories in 7 and 9 space-time dimensions.
