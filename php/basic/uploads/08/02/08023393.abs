Title: Is noncommutativity related with the smallness of $Λ$?
Authors: E. Mena and O. Obregón and M. Sabido
Abstract: In this letter we study the effects of a noncommutative minisuperspace, including matter degrees of freedom on a FRW universe with cosmological constant. In this setting the vacuum energy density can be calculated to be of the same order as the observed energy density of the universe.
