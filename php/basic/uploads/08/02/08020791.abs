Title: A translation-invariant renormalizable non-commutative scalar model
Authors: R. Gurau and J. Magnen and V. Rivasseau and A. Tanasa
Abstract: In this paper we propose a translation-invariant scalar model on the Moyal space. We prove that this model does not suffer from the UV/IR mixing and we establish its renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory.
