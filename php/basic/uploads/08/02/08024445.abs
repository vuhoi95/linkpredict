Title: Testing high-energy factorization beyond the next-to-leading-logarithmic  accuracy
Authors: V. Del Duca and E. W. N. Glover
Abstract: By taking the high-energy limit of the two-loop and the three-loop four-point amplitudes in the maximally supersymmetric N=4 Yang-Mill theory (MSYM), we test the validity of the loop expansion of the high-energy amplitude, beyond the next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) accuracy. We compute the three-loop Regge trajectory, and the two-loop and three-loop coefficient functions. These quantities are relevant for the BFKL evolution beyond NLL, as well as building MSYM two-loop and three-loop amplitudes with many legs in the high-energy limit, which in turn may be used as a powerful check of the evaluation of the corresponding exact amplitudes.
