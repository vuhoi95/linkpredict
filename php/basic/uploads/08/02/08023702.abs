Title: Extra Gauge Invariance from an Extra Dimension
Authors: Christopher D. Carone and Joshua Erlich and Marc Sher
Abstract: We describe higher-dimensional theories whose low-energy 4D descriptions contain larger gauge or global symmetry groups. As an example, we construct a Higgsless SU(2) x U(1) model of electroweak symmetry breaking. The 5D SU(2) gauge invariance contains both the weak SU(2) gauge group and a custodial symmetry that protects the rho parameter. Fermions obtain isospin-violating masses while maintaining universal gauge couplings among all three generations. As a further example, we construct a model of chiral color based on a single SU(3).
