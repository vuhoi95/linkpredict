Title: Classical and quantum gravity of brane black holes
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Simon F. Ross and Robin Zegers
Abstract: We test the holographic conjecture for brane black holes: that a full classical 5D solution will correspond to a quantum corrected 4D black hole. We show that a Schwarzschild-AdS black string in the bulk can be consistently interpreted as a quantum-corrected black hole on the brane, but the form of the quantum corrections is unlike what we would expect. The stress tensor extracted from the bulk solution does not have a thermal component corresponding to Hawking radiation outside the black hole. We compare this strong coupling prediction to a weak coupling calculation to study the differences in detail. We comment on implications for asymptotically flat black holes and for black holes localised in the extra dimension.
