Title: The Aharonov-Casher effect for spin-1 particles in non-commutative  quantum mechanics
Authors: Sayipjamal Dulat and Kang Li
Abstract: By using a generalized Bopp's shift formulation, instead of star product method, we investigate the Aharonov-Casher(AC) effect for a spin-1 neutral particle in non-commutative(NC) quantum mechanics. After solving the Kemmer equations both on a non-commutative space and a non-commutative phase space, we obtain the corrections to the topological phase of the AC effect for a spin-1 neutral particle both on a NC space and a NC phase space.
