Authors: Z. G. Huang and X. M. Song and H. Q. Lu and W. Fang
Abstract: Statefinder diagnostic is a useful method which can differ one dark energy model from the others. The Statefinder pair $\{r, s\}$ is algebraically related to the equation of state of dark energy and its first time derivative. We apply in this paper this method to the dilaton dark energy model based on Weyl-Scaled induced gravitational theory. We investigate the effect of the coupling between matter and dilaton when the potential of dilaton field is taken as the Mexican hat form. We find that the evolving trajectory of our model in the $r-s$ diagram is quite different from those of other dark energy models.
