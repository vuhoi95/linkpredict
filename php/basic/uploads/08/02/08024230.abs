Title: Spinflation from Geometric Tachyon
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Harvendra Singh
Abstract: We study the assisted inflation scenario from the rolling of $N$ BPS D3-brane into the NS5-branes, on a transverse geometry of $R^3 \times S^1$, coupled to four dimensional gravity. We assume that the branes are distributed along $S^1$ and the probe D3-branes spin along $R^3$ plane. Qualitatively this process is similar to that of N-tachyon assisted inflation on unstable D-branes. We further study the spinflation scenario numerically and analyze its effect.
