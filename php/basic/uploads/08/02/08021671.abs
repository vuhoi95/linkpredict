Title: Two--center quantum MICZ--Kepler system and the Zeeman effect in the  charge-dyon system
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Vadim Ohanyan
Abstract: The quantum two-center MICZ--Kepler system is considered in the limit when one of the interaction centers is situated at infinity, which leads to homogeneous electric and magnetic fields appearing in the system. The emerging system admits separation of variables in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and is integrable at the classical level. The first order corrections to the unperturbed spectrum of the ordinary MICZ--Kepler system are calculated. Particularly, the linear Zeeman--effect and effects of MICZ-terms are analyzed. The possible realizations of the system in some quantum dots are considered.
