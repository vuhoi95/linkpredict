Title: Invariant Killing spinors in 11D and type II supergravities
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We present all isotropy groups and associated $\Sigma$ groups, up to discrete identifications of the component connected to the identity, of spinors of eleven-dimensional and type II supergravities. The $\Sigma$ groups are products of a Spin group and an R-symmetry group of a suitable lower dimensional supergravity theory. Using the case of SU(4)-invariant spinors as a paradigm, we demonstrate that the $\Sigma$ groups, and so the R-symmetry groups of lower-dimensional supergravity theories arising from compactifications, have disconnected components. These lead to discrete symmetry groups reminiscent of R-parity. We examine the role of disconnected components of the $\Sigma$ groups in the choice of Killing spinor representatives and in the context of compactifications.
