Abstract: The He-McKellar-Wilkens(HMW) effect for spin one neutral particle in non-commutative quantum mechanics is studied. By solving the Kemmer like equations on non-commutative (NC) space and non-commutative phase space, we obtain topological He-McKellar-Wilkens phase on NC space and NC phase space respectively, where the additional terms related to the space-space and momentum-momentum non-commutativity are given explicitly.
