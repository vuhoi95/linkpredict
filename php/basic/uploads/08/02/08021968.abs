Title: Knots in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate
Authors: Yuki Kawaguchi and Muneto Nitta and Masahito Ueda
Abstract: We show that knots of spin textures can be created in the polar phase of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate, and discuss experimental schemes for their generation and probe, together with their lifetime.
