Title: Chirality Quantum Phase Transition in the Dirac oscillator
Authors: A. Bermudez and M. A. Martin-Delgado and A. Luis
Abstract: We study a relativistic spin-1/2 fermion subjected to a Dirac oscillator coupling and a constant magnetic field. An interplay between opposed chirality interactions culminates in the appearance of a relativistic quantum phase transition, which can be fully characterized. We obtain analytical expressions for the energy gap, order parameter, and canonical quantum fluctuations across the critical point. Moreover, we also discuss the effect of this phase transition on the statistics of the chiral bosonic ensemble, where its super- or sub-Poissonian nature can be controled by means of external parameters. Finally, we study the entanglement properties between the degrees of freedom in the relativistic ground state, where an interesting transition between a bi-separable and a genuinely tripartite entangled state occurs.
