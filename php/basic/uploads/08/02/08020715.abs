Title: Spin Effects in Long Range Electromagnetic Scattering
Authors: Barry R. Holstein and Andreas Ross
Abstract: We analyze the electromagnetic scattering of massive particles with and without spin and, using the techniques of effective field theory, we isolate the leading long distance effects beyond one photon exchange, both classical and quantum mechanical. Spin-independent and spin-dependent effects are isolated and shown to have a universal structure.
