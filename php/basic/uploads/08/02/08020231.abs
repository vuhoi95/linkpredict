Title: Null Half-Supersymmetric Solutions in Five-Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Jai Grover and Jan B. Gutowski and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: We classify half-supersymmetric solutions of gauged N=2, D=5 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets for which all of the Killing spinors generate null Killing vectors. We show that there are four classes of solutions, and in each class we find the metric, scalars and gauge field strengths. When the scalar manifold is symmetric, the solutions correspond to a class of local near horizon geometries recently found by Kunduri and Lucietti.
