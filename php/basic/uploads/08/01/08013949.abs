Title: On NS5-brane instantons and volume stabilization
Authors: Hugo Looyestijn and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We study general aspects of NS5-brane instantons in relation to the stabilization of the volume modulus in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II strings with fluxes, and their orientifold versions. These instantons correct the Kahler potential and generically yield significant contributions to the scalar potential at intermediate values of string coupling constant and volume. Under suitable conditions they yield uplifting terms that allow for meta--stable de Sitter vacua.
