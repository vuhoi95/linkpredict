Title: Stable cosmological models driven by a free quantum scalar field
Authors: Claudio Dappiaggi and Klaus Fredenhagen and Nicola Pinamonti
Abstract: In the mathematically rigorous analysis of semiclassical Einstein's equations, the renormalisation of the stress-energy tensor plays a crucial role. We address such a topic in the case of a scalar field with both arbitrary mass and coupling with gravity in the hypothesis that the underlying algebraic quantum state is of Hadamard type. Particularly, if we focus on highly symmetric solutions of the semiclassical Einstein's equations, the envisaged method displays a de Sitter type behaviour even without an a priori introduced cosmological constant. As a further novel result we shall show that these solutions turn out to be stable.
