Title: Quantum Field Theory on Star Graphs
Authors: B. Bellazzini and M. Burrello and M. Mintchev and P. Sorba
Abstract: We discuss some basic aspects of quantum fields on star graphs, focusing on boundary conditions, symmetries and scale invariance in particular. We investigate the four-fermion bulk interaction in detail. Using bosonization and vertex operators, we solve the model exactly for scale invariant boundary conditions, formulated in terms of the fermion current and without dissipation. The critical points are classified and determined explicitly. These results are applied for deriving the charge and spin transport, which have interesting physical features.
