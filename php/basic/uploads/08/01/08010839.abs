Title: First-order attractor flow equations for supersymmetric black rings in  N=2, D=5 supergravity
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Yong-Qiang Wang
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the attractor mechanism in the five dimensional low energy supergravity theory corresponding to M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold $CY_3$. Using very special geometry, we derive the general first-order attractor flow equations for BPS and non-BPS solutions in five-dimensional Gibbons-Hawking spaces. Especially, considering the supersymmetric solution, we obtain the first-order flow equations for supersymmetric (multi)black rings. We also solve the flow equations and discuss some properties of the solutions of flow equations.
