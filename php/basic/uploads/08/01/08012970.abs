Title: Collective cyclotron motion of the relativistic plasma in graphene
Authors: Markus Mueller and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We present a theory of the finite temperature thermo-electric response functions of graphene, in the hydrodynamic regime induced by electron-electron collisions. In moderate magnetic fields, the Dirac particles undergo a collective cyclotron motion with a temperature-dependent relativistic cyclotron frequency proportional to the net charge density of the Dirac plasma. In contrast to the undamped cyclotron pole in Galilean-invariant systems (Kohn's theorem), here there is a finite damping induced by collisions between the counter-propagating particles and holes. This cyclotron motion shows up as a damped pole in the frequency dependent conductivities, and should be readily detectable in microwave measurements at room temperature. We also discuss the large Nernst effect to be expected in graphene.
