Title: Rigid supersymmetry with boundaries
Authors: Dmitry V. Belyaev and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We construct rigidly supersymmetric bulk-plus-boundary actions, both in $x$-space and in superspace. For each standard supersymmetric bulk action a minimal supersymmetric bulk-plus-boundary action follows from an extended $F$- or $D$-term formula. Additional separately supersymmetric boundary actions can be systematically constructed using co-dimension one multiplets (boundary superfields). We also discuss the orbit of boundary conditions which follow from the Euler-Lagrange variational principle.
