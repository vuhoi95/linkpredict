Title: Real forms of very extended Kac-Moody algebras and theories with eight  supersymmetries
Authors: Fabio Riccioni and Antoine Van Proeyen and Peter West
Abstract: We consider all theories with eight supersymmetries whose reduction to three dimensions gives rise to scalars that parametrise symmetric manifolds. We conjecture that these theories are non-linear realisations of very-extended Kac-Moody algebras for suitable choices of real forms. We show for the most interesting cases that the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric theory is precisely reproduced by the corresponding non-linear realisation.
