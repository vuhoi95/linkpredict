Title: Microscopic Formulation of Puff Field Theory
Authors: Sheikh Shajidul Haque and Akikazu Hashimoto
Abstract: We describe a generalization of Puff Field Theory to p+1 dimensions where 0 \le p \le 5. We then focus on the case of p=0, ``Puff Quantum Mechanics,'' and construct a formulation independent of string theory.
