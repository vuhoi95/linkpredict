Title: Chaotic quantization and the mass spectrum of fermions
Authors: Muhammad Maher and Christian Beck
Abstract: In order to understand the parameters of the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions, one needs to embed the standard model into some larger theory that accounts for the observed values. This means some additional sector is needed that fixes and stabilizes the values of the fundamental constants of nature. We describe how such a sector can be constructed using the so-called chaotic quantization method applied to a system of coupled map lattices. We restrict ourselves in this short note on verifying how our model correctly yields the numerical values of Yukawa and gravitational coupling constants of a collection of heavy and light fermions using a simple principle, the local minimization of vacuum energy.
