Title: Gauged Supergravities, Tensor Hierarchies, and M-Theory
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Hermann Nicolai and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: Deformations of maximal supergravity theories induced by gauging non-abelian subgroups of the duality group reveal the presence of charged M-theory degrees of freedom that are not necessarily contained in supergravity. The relation with M-theory degrees of freedom is confirmed by the representation assignments under the duality group of the gauge charges and the ensuing vector and tensor gauge fields. The underlying hierarchy of these gauge fields is required for consistency of general gaugings. As an example gauged maximal supergravity in three space-time dimensions is presented in a version where all possible tensor fields appear.
