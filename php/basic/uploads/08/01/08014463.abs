Title: A new derivation of Luscher F-term and fluctuations around the giant  magnon
Authors: Michal P. Heller and Romuald A. Janik and Tomasz Lukowski
Abstract: In this paper we give a new derivation of the generalized Luscher F-term formula from a summation over quadratic fluctuations around a given soliton. The result is very general providing that S-matrix is diagonal and is valid for arbitrary dispersion relation. We then apply this formalism to compute the leading finite size corrections to the giant magnon dispersion relation coming from quantum fluctuations.
