Title: Worldsheet Instantons and Torsion Curves
Authors: Volker Braun and Maximilian Kreuzer and Burt A. Ovrut and Emanuel Scheidegger
Abstract: We study aspects of worldsheet instantons relevant to a heterotic standard model. The non-simply connected Calabi-Yau threefold used admits Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines, and a more detailed investigation shows that the homology classes of curves are H_2(X,Z)=Z^3+Z_3+Z_3. We compute the genus-0 prepotential, this is the first explicit calculation of the Gromov-Witten invariants of homology classes with torsion (finite subgroups). In particular, some curve classes contain only a single instanton. This ensures that the Beasley-Witten cancellation of instanton contributions cannot happen on this (non-toric) Calabi-Yau threefold.
