Title: Renormalization group functions for the Wess-Zumino model: up to 200  loops through Hopf algebras
Authors: Marc Bellon and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We obtain the contributions to the renormalization group functions of all the diagrams containing the unique one-loop primitive divergence of a simple supersymmetric Wess--Zumino model, up to more than 200 loops. The asymptotic behavior of the coefficients in the expansion of the anomalous dimension is analyzed.
