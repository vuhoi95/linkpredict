Title: Yang's Model as Triply Special Relativity and the Snyder's Model--de  Sitter Special Relativity Duality
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Chao-Guang Huang and Hong-Tu Wu
Abstract: We show that if Yang's model as the earliest TSR is completed, it should contain both Snyder's quantized space-time model as the earliest DSR, the de Sitter SR and their duality.
