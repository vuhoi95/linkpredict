Title: A-twisted heterotic Landau-Ginzburg models
Authors: Josh Guffin and Eric Sharpe
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the methods developed in recent work for constructing A-twisted (2,2) Landau-Ginzburg models to analogous (0,2) models. In particular, we study (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg models on topologically non-trivial spaces away from large-radius limits, where one expects to find correlation function contributions akin to (2,2) curve corrections. Such heterotic theories admit A- and B-model twists, and exhibit a duality that simultaneously exchanges the twists and dualizes the gauge bundle. We explore how this duality operates in heterotic Landau-Ginzburg models, as well as other properties of these theories, using examples which RG flow to heterotic nonlinear sigma models as checks on our methods.
