Title: On the Conformal Field Theory Duals of type IIA AdS_4 Flux  Compactifications
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Yaron E. Antebi and Micha Berkooz
Abstract: We study the conformal field theory dual of the type IIA flux compactification model of DeWolfe, Giryavets, Kachru and Taylor, with all moduli stabilized. We find its central charge and properties of its operator spectrum. We concentrate on the moduli space of the conformal field theory, which we investigate through domain walls in the type IIA string theory. The moduli space turns out to consist of many different branches. We use Bezout's theorem and Bernstein's theorem to enumerate the different branches of the moduli space and estimate their dimension.
