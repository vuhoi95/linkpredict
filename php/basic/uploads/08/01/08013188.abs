Title: Lower Dimensional Branes in Boundary Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Akira Ishida and Yoonbai Kim and Chanju Kim and O-Kab Kwon
Abstract: In the presence of constant background electromagnetic fields, we discuss three types of exactly marginal boundary tachyon operators for static kinks in boundary conformal field theory. Functional forms of three operators are hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, and exponential types, and they describe codimension-one solitons when the transverse electric field has overcritical value. The energy-momentum tensor and the source for antisymmetric tensor field are computed in the path integral approach for the exponential-type tachyon vertex operator.
