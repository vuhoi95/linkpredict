Title: Lorentz Gauge Theory and Spinor Interaction
Authors: Nakia Carlevaro and Orchidea Maria Lecian and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: A gauge theory of the Lorentz group, based on the different behavior of spinors and vectors under local transformations, is formulated in a flat space-time and the role of the torsion field within the generalization to curved space-time is briefly discussed. The spinor interaction with the new gauge field is then analyzed assuming the time gauge and stationary solutions, in the non-relativistic limit, are treated to generalize the Pauli equation.
