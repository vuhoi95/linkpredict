Abstract: We introduce an extension of the character expansion method to the case of supergroups. This method allows us to calculate a superversion of the Leutwyler-Smilga integral which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been calculated before. We also use the method to generalize a previously calculated superversion of the Berezin-Karpelevich integral. Our character expansion method should also allow for the calculation of other supergroup integrals.
