Title: Target Space Duality: The Dilaton Field
Authors: Orlando Alvarez and Blazej Ruszczycki
Abstract: Classical target space duality transformations are studied for the non-linear sigma model with a dilaton field. Working within the framework of the Hamiltonian formalism we require the duality transformation to be a property only of the target spaces. We obtain a set of restrictions on the geometrical data.
