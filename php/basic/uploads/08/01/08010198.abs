Title: Gravity dual of conformal matter collisions in 1+1 dimensions
Authors: K. Kajantie and Jorma Louko and T. Tahkokallio
Abstract: We find the three-dimensional gravity dual of a process in which two clouds of (1+1)-dimensional conformal matter moving in opposite directions collide. This gives the most general conformally invariant holographic flow in the 1+1 dimensional boundary theory in terms of two arbitrary functions. With a suitable choice of the arbitrary functions the process can be interpreted as an opaque collision of two extended systems with central, fragmentation and interaction regions. Comparison with classical gluon field calculations relates the size of the system with the saturation scale.
