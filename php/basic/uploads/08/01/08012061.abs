Title: Exact Multi-Matrix Correlators
Authors: Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Storm Collins and Robert de Mello Koch
Abstract: We argue that restricted Schur polynomials provide a useful parameterization of the complete set of gauge invariant variables of multi-matrix models. The two point functions of restricted Schur polynomials are evaluated exactly in the free field theory limit. They have diagonal two point functions.
