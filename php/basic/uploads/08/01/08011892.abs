Title: Generalized Symmetries of Massless Free Fields on Minkowski Space
Authors: Juha Pohjanpelto and Stephen C. Anco
Abstract: A complete and explicit classification of generalized, or local, symmetries of massless free fields of spin $s \geq 1/2$ is carried out. Up to equivalence, these are found to consists of the conformal symmetries and their duals, new chiral symmetries of order $2s$, and their higher-order extensions obtained by Lie differentiation with respect to conformal Killing vectors. In particular, the results yield a complete classification of generalized symmetries of the Dirac-Weyl neutrino equation, Maxwell's equations, and the linearized gravity equations.
