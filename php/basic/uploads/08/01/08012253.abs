Title: Integrability and Generalized Monodromy Matrix
Authors: T. Lhallabi and A. Moujib
Abstract: We construct the Generalized Monodromy matrix $\mathcal{\hat{M}}(\omega)$ of two dimensional string effective action by introducing the T-duality group properties.The integrability conditions with general solutions depending on spectral parameter are given. This construction is investigated for the exactly solvable Wess, Zumino, Novikov and Witten (WZNW) model in pp-wave Limit when B=0.
