Title: Exploring the quantum vacuum with cylinders
Authors: F. C. Lombardo and F. D. Mazzitelli and P. I. Villar
Abstract: We review recent work on the Casimir interaction energy between cylindrical shells. We include proposals for future experiments involving cylinders, such us a null experiment using quasi-concentric cylinders, a cylinder in front a conducting plate, and a cylindrical version of the rack and pinion powered by Casimir lateral force. We also present an exact formula for the theoretical evaluation of the vacuum interaction energy between eccentric cylindrical shells, and describe improved analytical and numerical evaluations for the particular case of concentric cylinders.
