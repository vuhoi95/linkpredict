Title: On Factorization Constraints for Branes in the H3+ Model
Authors: Hendrik Adorf and Michael Flohr
Abstract: We comment on the brane solutions for the boundary H3+ model that have been proposed so far and point out that they should be distinguished according to the patterns regular/irregular and discrete/continuous. In the literature, mostly irregular branes have been studied, while results on the regular ones are rare. For all types of branes, there are questions about how a second factorization constraint in the form of a b^{-2}/2-shift equation can be derived. Here, we assume analyticity of the boundary two point function, which means that the Cardy-Lewellen constraints remain unweakened. This enables us to derive unambiguously the desired b^{-2}/2-shift equations. They serve as important additional consistency conditions. For some regular branes, we also derive 1/2-shift equations that were not known previously. Case by case, we discuss possible solutions to the enlarged system of constraints. We find that the well-known irregular continuous AdS_2 branes are consistent with our new factorization constraint. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a new type of brane: The shift equations in a certain regular discrete case possess a non-trivial solution that we write down explicitly. All other types are found to be inconsistent when using our second constraint. We discuss these results in view of the Hosomichi-Ribault proposal and some of our earlier results on the derivation of b^{-2}/2-shift equations.
