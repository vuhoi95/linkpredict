Title: Aspects of Noncommutative Scalar/Tensor Duality
Authors: K. M. Ajith and E. Harikumar and Victor O. Rivelles and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: We study the noncommutative massless Kalb-Ramond gauge field coupled to a dynamical U(1) gauge field in the adjoint representation together with a compensating vector field. We derive the Seiberg-Witten map and obtain the corresponding mapped action to first order in $\theta$. The (emergent) gravity structure found in other situations is not present here. The off-shell dual scalar theory is derived and it does not coincide with the Seiberg-Witten mapped scalar theory. Dispersion relations are also discussed. The p-form generalization of the Seiberg-Witten map to order $\theta $ is also derived.
