Title: A lattice approach to the conformal $\OSp(2S+2|2S)$ supercoset sigma  model. Part II: The boundary spectrum
Authors: Constantin Candu and Hubert Saleur
Abstract: We consider the partition function of the boundary $OSp(2S+2|2S)$ coset sigma model on an annulus, based on the lattice regularization introduced in the companion paper. Using results for the action of $OSp(2S+2|2S)$ and $B_L(2)$ on the corresponding spin chain, as well as mini-superspace and small $g_\sigma^2$ calculations, we conjecture the full spectrum and set of degeneracies on the entire critical line. Potential relationship with the $OSp(2S+2|2S)$ Gross-Neveu model is also discussed.
