Title: One-Dimensional Bose Gases with N-Body Attractive Interactions
Authors: E. Fersino and G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni
Abstract: We study the ground state properties of a one-dimensional Bose gas with N-body attractive contact interactions. By using the explicit form of the bright soliton solution of a generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we compute the chemical potential and the ground state energy. For N=3, a localized soliton wave-function exists only for a critical value of the interaction strength: in this case the ground state has an infinite degeneracy that can be parameterized by the chemical potential. The stabilization of the bright soliton solution by an external harmonic trap is also discussed, and a comparison with the effect of N-body attractive contact interactions in higher dimensions is presented.
