Title: Induced Gravity in Deconstructed Space at Finite Temperature --  Self-consistent Einstein Universe
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We study self-consistent cosmological solutions for an Einstein Universe in a graph-based induced gravity model. The graph-based field theory has been proposed by the present authors to generalize dimensional deconstruction. In this paper, we consider self-consistent Einstein equations for a ``graph theory space''. Especially, we demonstrate specific results for cycle graphs.
