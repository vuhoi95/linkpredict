Title: Critical Exponents from Field Theory: New Evaluation
Authors: A. A. Pogorelov and I. M. Suslov
Abstract: We present new evaluation of the critical exponents of O(n)- symmetric \phi^4 theory from the field theoretical renormalization group, based on the new algorithm for summing divergent series. The central values practically coincide with those by Le Guillou and Zinn-Justin (1980) but their uncertainty is essentially smaller.
