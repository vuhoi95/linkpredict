Abstract: In this Reply to the preceding Comment of Klimchitskaya and Mostepanenko (cf. also quant-ph/0703214), we summarize and maintain our position that the Drude dispersion relation when inserted in the Lifshitz formula gives a thermodynamically satisfactory description of the Casimir force, also in the limiting case when the relaxation frequency goes to zero (perfect crystals).
