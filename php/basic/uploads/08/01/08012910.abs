Title: Functional renormalization for Bose-Einstein Condensation
Authors: S. Floerchinger and C. Wetterich
Abstract: We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation for interacting bosons at zero and nonzero temperature. Functional renormalization provides us with a consistent method to compute the effect of fluctuations beyond the Bogoliubov approximation. For three dimensional dilute gases, we find an upper bound on the scattering length a which is of the order of the microphysical scale - typically the range of the Van der Waals interaction. In contrast to fermions near the unitary bound, no strong interactions occur for bosons with approximately pointlike interactions, thus explaining the high quantitative reliability of perturbation theory for most quantities. For zero temperature we compute the quantum phase diagram for bosonic quasiparticles with a general dispersion relation, corresponding to an inverse microphysical propagator with terms linear and quadratic in the frequency. We compute the temperature dependence of the condensate and particle density n, and find for the critical temperature T_c a deviation from the free theory, Delta T_c/T_c = 2.1 a n^{1/3}. For the sound velocity at zero temperature we find very good agreement with the Bogoliubov result, such that it may be used to determine the particle density accurately.
