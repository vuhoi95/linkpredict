Title: Free Differential Algebras, Rheonomy, and Pure Spinors
Authors: Pietro Fr√© and Pietro Antonio Grassi
Abstract: We report on progresses on the derivation of pure spinor constraints, BRST algebra and BRST invariant sigma models a la pure spinors from the algebraic structure of the FDA underlying supergravity.
