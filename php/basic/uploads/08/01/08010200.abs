Title: Quantum Tunneling and Back Reaction
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: We give a correction to the tunneling probability by taking into account the back reaction effect to the metric of the black hole spacetime. We then show how this gives rise to the modifications in the semiclassical black hole entropy and Hawking temperature. Finally, we reproduce the familiar logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.
