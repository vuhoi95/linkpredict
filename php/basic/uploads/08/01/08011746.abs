Title: Bosonized Quantum Hamiltonian of the Two-Dimensional Derivative-Coupling  Model
Authors: L. V. Belvedere and A. F. Rodrigues
Abstract: Using the operator formulation we discuss the bosonization of the two-dimensional derivative-coupling model. The fully bosonized quantum Hamiltonian is obtained by computing the composite operators as the leading terms in the Wilson short distance expansion for the operator products at the same point. In addition, the quantum Hamiltonian contains topological terms which give trivial contributions to the equations of motion. Taking into account the quantum corrections to the bosonic equations of motion and to the scale dimension of the Fermi field operator, the operator solution is obtained in terms of a generalized Mandelstam soliton operator with continuous Lorentz spin (generalized statistics).
