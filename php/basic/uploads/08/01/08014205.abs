Abstract: We propose a non-lattice simulation for studying supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics in a non-perturbative manner. In particular, our method enables us to put M theory on a computer based on its matrix formulation proposed by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind. Here we present Monte Carlo results of the same matrix model but in a different parameter region, which corresponds to the 't Hooft large-N limit at finite temperature. In the strong coupling limit the model has a dual description in terms of the N D0-brane solution in 10d type IIA supergravity. Our results provide highly nontrivial evidences for the conjectured duality. In particular, the energy (and hence the entropy) of the non-extremal black hole has been reproduced by solving directly the strongly coupled dynamics of the D0-brane effective theory.
