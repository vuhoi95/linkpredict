Title: Anti-de Sitter Quotients, Bubbles of Nothing, and Black Holes
Authors: Jan E. Aman and Stefan Aminneborg and Ingemar Bengtsson and Narit Pidokrajt
Abstract: In 3+1 dimensions there are anti-de quotients which are black holes with toroidal event horizons. By analytic continuation of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter solution (and appropriate identifications) one finds two one parameter families of spacetimes that contain these quotient black holes. One of these families consists of B-metrics ("bubbles of nothing"), the other of black hole spacetimes. All of them have vanishing conserved charges.
