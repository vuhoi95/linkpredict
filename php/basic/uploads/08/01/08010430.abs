Authors: Constantin Candu and Hubert Saleur
Abstract: We define and study a lattice model which we argue is in the universality class of the $OSp(2S+2|2S)$ supercoset sigma model for a large range of values of the coupling constant $g_\sigma^2$. In this first paper, we analyze in details the symmetries of this lattice model, in particular the decomposition of the space of the quantum spin chain $V^{\otimes L}$ as a bimodule over $OSp(2S+2|2S)$ and its commutant, the Brauer algebra $B_L(2)$. It turns out that $V^{\otimes L}$ is a nonsemisimple module for both $OSp(2S+2|2S)$ and $B_L(2)$. The results are used in the companion paper to elucidate the structure of the (boundary) conformal field theory.
