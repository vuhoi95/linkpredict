Title: E_7(7) on the Light Cone
Authors: Lars Brink and Sung-Soo Kim and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: We use the Cremmer-Julia E_7(7) non-linear symmetry of N=8 Supergravity to derive its order $\kappa^2$ on-shell Hamiltonian in terms of one chiral light-cone superfield. By requiring that E_7(7) commute with the super-Poincare group, we deduce to lowest non-trivial order in $\kappa$, the light cone E_7(7) transformations of all fields of the theory, including the graviton. We then derive the dynamical supersymmetry transformation to order $\kappa^2$, and express the Hamiltonian as a quadratic form in the chiral superfield.
