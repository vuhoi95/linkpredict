Title: Strongly bound mesons at finite temperature and in magnetic fields from  AdS/CFT
Authors: K. D. Jensen and A. Karch and J. Price
Abstract: We study mesons in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental flavors added at large 't Hooft coupling using the gauge/gravity correspondence. High-spin mesons are well described by using semiclassical string configurations. We determine the meson spectrum at finite temperature and in a background magnetic field.
