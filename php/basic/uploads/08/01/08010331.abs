Title: Attractor Solutions in Lorentz Violating Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory
Authors: Arianto and Freddy P. Zen and Triyanta and Bobby E. Gunara
Abstract: We investigate properties of attractors for scalar field in the Lorentz violating scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity. In this framework, both the effective coupling and potential functions determine the stabilities of the fixed points. In the model, we consider the constants of slope of the effective coupling and potential functions which lead to the quadratic effective coupling vector with the (inverse) power-law potential. For the case of purely scalar field, there are only two stable attractor solutions in the inflationary scenario. In the presence of a barotropic fluid, the fluid dominated solution is absent. We find two scaling solutions: the kinetic scaling solution and the scalar field scaling solutions. We show the stable attractors in regions of ($\gamma$, $\xi$) parameter space and in phase plane plot for different qualitative evolutions. From the standard nucleosynthesis, we derive the constraints for the value of the coupling parameter.
