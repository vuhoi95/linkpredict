Title: Quasinormal Modes of Kerr Black Holes in Four and Higher Dimensions
Authors: Hsien-chung Kao and Dan Tomino
Abstract: We analytically calculate to leading order the asymptotic form of quasinormal frequencies of Kerr black holes in four, five and seven dimensions. All the relevant quantities can be explicitly expressed in terms of elliptical integrals. In four dimensions, we confirm the results obtained by Keshest and Hod by comparing the analytic results to the numerical ones.
