Title: Polarization tensor of charged gluons in color magnetic background field  at finite temperature
Authors: M. Bordag and V. Skalozub
Abstract: We calculate the polarization tensor of charged gluons in a Abelian homogeneous magnetic background field at finite temperature in one loop order Lorentz background field gauge in full generality. Thereby we first determine the ten independent tensor structures. For the calculation of the corresponding form factors we use the Schwinger representation and represent form factors as double parametric integrals and a sum resulting from the Matsubara formalism used. The integrands are given explicitly in terms of hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Like in the case of neutral gluons, the polarization tensor is not transversal. Out of the tensor structures, seven are transversal and three are not. The nontransversal part follows explicitly from our calculations.
