Title: On small tension p-branes
Authors: Jonas Bjornsson and Stephen Hwang
Abstract: This paper deals with p-branes with small but non-zero tension. We prove the existence of canonical transformations, within a perturbation theory, that link specific geometries of p-branes to solvable theories, namely string-like and particle-like theories. The specific shapes correspond to stretched configurations. For configurations linked to string-like theories one will upon quantization get a critical dimension of (25+p).
