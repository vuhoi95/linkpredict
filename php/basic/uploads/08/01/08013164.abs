Title: Dark Energy From Fifth Dimension
Authors: H. Alavirad and N. Riazi
Abstract: Observational evidence for the existence of dark energy is strong. Here we suggest a model which is based on a modified gravitational theory in 5D and interpret the 5th dimension as a manifestation of dark energy in the 4D observable universe. We also obtain an equation of state parameter which varies with time. Finally, we match our model with observations by choosing the free parameters of the model.
