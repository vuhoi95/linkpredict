Title: A note on causal hydrodynamics for M-theory branes
Authors: Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: We obtain new transport coefficients of causal hydrodynamics for the M2 and the M5-brane using a Kubo-like formula proposed by Baier, Romatschke, Son, Starinets, and Stephanov (arXiv:0712.2451 [hep-th]). The relaxation times agree with the ones obtained from the "sound mode" in our paper (arXiv:0712.2916 [hep-th]).
