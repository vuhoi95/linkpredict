Title: Creating semiclassical black holes in collider experiments and keeping  them on a string
Authors: G. Dvali and S. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We argue that a simple modification of the TeV scale quantum gravity scenario allows production of semiclassical black holes in particle collisions at the LHC. The key idea is that in models with large extra dimensions the strength of gravity in the bulk can be higher than on the brane where we live. A well-known example of this situation is the case of warped extra dimensions. Even if the energy of the collision is not sufficient to create a black hole on the brane, it may be enough to produce a particle which accelerates into the bulk up to trans-Planckian energy and creates a large black hole there. In a concrete model we consider, the black hole is formed in a collision of the particle with its own image at an orbifold plane. When the particle in question carries some Standard Model gauge charges the created black hole gets attached to our brane by a string of the gauge flux. For a 4-dimensional observer such system looks as a long-lived charged state with the mass continuously decreasing due to Hawking evaporation of the black hole. This provides a distinctive signature of black hole formation in our scenario.
