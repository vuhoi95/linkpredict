Title: Spontaneous symmetry breakdown in fuzzy spheres
Authors: C. R. Das and S. Digal and T. R. Govindarajan
Abstract: We study and analyse the questions regarding breakdown of global symmetry on noncommutative sphere. We demonstrate this by considering a complex scalar field on a fuzzy sphere and isolating Goldstone modes. We discuss the role of nonlocal interactions present in these through geometrical considerations.
