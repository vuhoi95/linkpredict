Title: Casimir repulsion and metamaterials
Authors: I. G. Pirozhenko and A. Lambrecht
Abstract: We analyze the conditions for getting the Casimir repulsion between two nonequal plates. The force between plates with magnetic permeability defined by Drude or Lorentz models is calculated. The short and long distance limits of the force are derived. The Casimir set-up with the hypothetical perfect matching metamaterial is discussed. We put into question the possibility of getting repulsion within the design of metamaterials based on metallic inclusions.
