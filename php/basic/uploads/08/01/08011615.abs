Title: A Lorentz Invariant Pairing Mechanism: Relativistic Cooper Pairs
Authors: A. Bermudez and M. A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: We study a Lorentz invariant pairing mechanism that arises when two relativistic spin-1/2 fermions are subjected to a Dirac string coupling. In the weak coupling regime, we find remarkable analogies between this relativistic bound system and the well known superconducting Cooper pair. As the coupling strength is raised, quenched phonons become unfrozen and dynamically contribute to the gluing mechanism, which translates into novel features of this relativistic superconducting pair.
