Abstract: We continue our study of the low energy implications of $M$ theory vacua on $G_2$ manifolds, undertaken in \cite{Acharya:2007rc,Acharya:2006ia}, where it was shown that the moduli can be stabilized and a TeV scale generated, with the Planck scale as the only dimensionful input. A well-motivated phenomenological model - the $G_2$-MSSM, can be naturally defined within the above framework. In this paper, we study some of the important phenomenological features of the $G_2$-MSSM. In particular, the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and the superpartner spectrum are computed. The $G_2$-MSSM generically gives rise to light gauginos and heavy scalars with wino LSPs when one tunes the cosmological constant. Electroweak symmetry breaking is present but fine-tuned. The $G_2$-MSSM is also naturally consistent with precision gauge coupling unification. The phenomenological consequences for cosmology and collider physics of the $G_2$-MSSM will be reported in more detail soon.
