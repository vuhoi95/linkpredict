Title: Skyrme Model with Different Mass Terms
Authors: Bernard Piette and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We consider a one parameter family of mass terms for the Skyrme model that disfavours shell-like configurations for multi-baryon classical solutions. We argue that a model with such mass terms can provide a better description of nuclei as shell like configurations are now less stable than in the traditional massive Skyrme model
