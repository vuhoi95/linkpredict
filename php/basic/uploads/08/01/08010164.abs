Title: Charged Rotating Kaluza-Klein Black Holes in Five Dimensions
Authors: Toshiharu Nakagawa and Hideki Ishihara and Ken Matsuno and Shinya Tomizawa
Abstract: We construct a new charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole solution in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simon term. The features of the solutions are also investigated. The spacetime is asymptotically locally flat, i.e., it asymptotes to a twisted $\rm S^1$ bundle over the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The solution describe a non-BPS black hole rotating in the direction of the extra dimension. The solutions have the limits to the supersymmetric black hole solutions, a new extreme non-BPS black hole solutions and a new rotating non-BPS black hole solution with a constant twisted $\rm S^1$ fiber.
