Title: Casimir effect in the boundary state formalism
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs
Abstract: Casimir effect in the planar setting is described using the boundary state formalism, for general partially reflecting boundaries. It is expressed in terms of the low-energy degrees of freedom, which provides a large distance expansion valid for general interacting field theories provided there is a non-vanishing mass gap. The expansion is written in terms of the scattering amplitudes, and needs no ultraviolet renormalization. We also discuss the case when the quantum field has a nontrivial vacuum configuration.
