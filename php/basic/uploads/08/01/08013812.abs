Title: Melvin Twists of global AdS_5 \times S_5 and their Non-Commutative Field  Theory Dual
Authors: Danny Dhokarh and Sheikh Shajidul Haque and Akikazu Hashimoto
Abstract: We consider the Melvin Twist of AdS_5 \times S_5 under U(1) \times U(1) isometry of the boundary S_3 of the global AdS_5 geometry and identify its field theory dual. We also study the thermodynamics of the Melvin deformed theory.
