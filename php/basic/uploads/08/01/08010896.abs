Title: Deformation of Curved BPS Domain Walls and Supersymmetric Flows on 2d  KÃ¤hler-Ricci Soliton
Authors: Bobby E. Gunara and Freddy P. Zen
Abstract: We consider some aspects of the curved BPS domain walls and their supersymmetric Lorentz invariant vacua of the four dimensional N=1 supergravity coupled to a chiral multiplet. In particular, the scalar manifold can be viewed as a two dimensional K\"ahler-Ricci soliton generating a one-parameter family of K\"ahler manifolds evolved with respect to a real parameter, $\tau$. This implies that all quantities describing the walls and their vacua indeed evolve with respect to $\tau$. Then, the analysis on the eigenvalues of the first order expansion of BPS equations shows that in general the vacua related to the field theory on a curved background do not always exist. In order to verify their existence in the ultraviolet or infrared regions one has to perform the renormalization group analysis. Finally, we discuss in detail a simple model with a linear superpotential and the K\"ahler-Ricci soliton considered as the Rosenau solution.
