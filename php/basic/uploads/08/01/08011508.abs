Title: STRINGVACUA: A Mathematica Package for Studying Vacuum Configurations in  String Phenomenology
Authors: James Gray and Yang-Hui He and Anton Ilderton and Andr√© Lukas
Abstract: We give a simple tutorial introduction to the Mathematica package STRINGVACUA, which is designed to find vacua of string-derived or inspired four-dimensional N=1 supergravities. The package uses powerful algebro-geometric methods, as implemented in the free computer algebra system Singular, but requires no knowledge of the mathematics upon which it is based. A series of easy-to-use Mathematica modules are provided which can be used both in string theory and in more general applications requiring fast polynomial computations. The use of these modules is illustrated throughout with simple examples.
