Title: Duality transformation of non-Abelian tensor gauge fields
Authors: Sebastian Guttenberg and George Savvidy
Abstract: For non-Abelian tensor gauge fields we have found an alternative form of duality transformation, which has the property that the direct and the inverse transformations coincide. This duality transformation has the desired property that the direct and the inverse transformations map Lagrangian forms into each other.
