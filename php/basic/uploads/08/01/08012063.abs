Title: Anomaly Driven Cosmology: Big Boost Scenario and AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and C. Deffayet and A. Yu. Kamenshchik
Abstract: We consider the cosmological evolution in a recently suggested new model of quantum initial conditions for the Universe. The effective Friedmann equation incorporates the effect of the conformal anomaly of quantum fields and, interestingly, shows that their vacuum Casimir energy is completely screened and does not gravitate. The cosmological evolution also features a new mechanism for a cosmological acceleration stage. This stage is followed by a big boost singularity -- a rapid growth up to infinity of the scale factor acceleration parameter. We also briefly discuss the relation between our model, the AdS/CFT correspondence and RS and DGP braneworlds.
