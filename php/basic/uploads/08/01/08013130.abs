Title: The Decay of Dirac Hair around a Dilaton Black Hole
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: The intermediate and late-time behaviour of a massive Dirac field in the background of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions is investigated. The intermediate asymptotic behaviour of a massive Dirac field depends on the mass parameter as well as the wave number of the mode, while the late time behaviour has a power law decay rate independent of both.
