Title: Dilaton and Second-Rank Tensor Fields as Supersymmetric Compensators
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We formulate a supersymmetric theory in which both a dilaton and a second-rank tensor play roles of compensators. The basic off-shell multiplets are a linear multiplet (B_{\mu\nu}, \chi, \phi) and a vector multiplet (A_\mu, \l; C_{\mu\nu\rho}), where \phi and B_{\m\n} are respectively a dilaton and a second-rank tensor. The third-rank tensor C_{\mu\nu\rho} in the vector multiplet is 'dual' to the conventional D-field with 0 on-shell or 1 off-shell degree of freedom. The dilaton \phi is absorbed into one longitudinal component of A_\mu, making it massive. Initially, B_{\mu\nu} has 1 on-shell or 3 off-shell degrees of freedom, but it is absorbed into the longitudinal components of C_{\mu\nu\rho}. Eventually, C_{\mu\nu\rho} with 0 on-shell or 1 off-shell degree of freedom acquires in total 1 on-shell or 4 off-shell degrees of freedom, turning into a propagating massive field. These basic multiplets are also coupled to chiral multiplets and a supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Some of these results are also reformulated in superspace. The proposed mechanism may well provide a solution to the long-standing puzzle of massless dilatons and second-rank tensors in supersymmetric models inspired by string theory.
