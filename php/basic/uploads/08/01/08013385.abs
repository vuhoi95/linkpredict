Title: Constructing the supersymmetric Standard Model from intersecting  D6-branes on the Z_6' orientifold
Authors: David Bailin and Alex Love
Abstract: Intersecting stacks of supersymmetric fractional branes on the Z_6' orientifold may be used to construct the supersymmetric Standard Model. If $a,b$ are the stacks that generate the SU(3)_{colour} and SU(2)_L gauge particles, then, in order to obtain just the chiral spectrum of the (supersymmetric) Standard Model (with non-zero Yukawa couplings to the Higgs mutiplets),it is necessary that the number of intersections $a \cap b$ of the stacks $a$ and $b$, and the number of intersections $a \cap b'$ of $a$ with the orientifold image $b'$ of $b$ satisfy $(a \cap b,a \cap b')=(2,1)$ or $(1,2)$. It is also necessary that there is no matter in symmetric representations of the gauge group, and not too much matter in antisymmetric representations, on either stack. Fractional branes having all of these properties may be constructed on the Z_6' orientifold. We provide a number of new examples having these properties, some of which may be extended to give the Standard Model spectrum. Specifically, we construct four-stack models with two further stacks, each with just a single brane, which have the matter spectrum of the supersymmetric Standard Model, including a single pair of Higgs doublets, {\em plus} three right-chiral neutrino singlets. Ramond-Ramond tadpole cancellation is achieved by the introduction of background H_3 flux, the 3-form field strength associated with the Kalb-Ramond 2-form field B_2. There remains a single unwanted gauged U(1)_{B-L}.
