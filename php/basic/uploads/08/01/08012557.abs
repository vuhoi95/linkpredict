Title: Non-renormalization for the Liouville wave function
Authors: J. Alexandre and Anna Kostouki and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: Using an exact functional method, within the framework of the gradient expansion for the Liouville effective action, we show that the kinetic term for the Liouville field is not renormalized.
