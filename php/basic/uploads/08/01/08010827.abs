Title: Classical Solutions of Ghost Condensation Models
Authors: Masahiro Maeno and Ichiro Oda
Abstract: Motivated by ideas obtained from both ghost condensation and gravitational Higgs mechanism, we attempt to find classical solutions in the unitary gauge in general ghost condensation models. It is shown that depending on the form of scalar fields in an action, there are three kinds of exact solutions, which are (anti-) de Sitter space-time, polynomially expanding universes and flat Minkowski space-time. We briefly comment on gravitational Higgs mechanism in these models where we have massive gravitons of 5 degrees of freedom and 1 unitary scalar field (Nambu-Goldstone boson) after spontaneous symmetry breakdown of general coordinate reparametrization invariance. The models at hand are free from the problem associated with the non-unitary propagating mode.
