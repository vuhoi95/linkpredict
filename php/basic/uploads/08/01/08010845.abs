Title: Gauge-Fixing and Residual Symmetries in Gauge/Gravity Theories with  Extra Dimensions
Authors: C. S. Lim and Tomoaki Nagasawa and Satoshi Ohya and Kazuki Sakamoto and Makoto Sakamoto
Abstract: We study compactified pure gauge/gravitational theories with gauge-fixing terms and show that these theories possess quantum mechanical SUSY-like symmetries between unphysical degrees of freedom. These residual symmetries are global symmetries and generated by quantum mechanical N=2 supercharges. Also, we establish new one-parameter family of gauge choices for higher-dimensional gravity, and calculate as a check of its validity one graviton exchange amplitude in the lowest tree-level approximation. We confirm that the result is indeed $\xi$-independent and the cancellation of the $\xi$-dependence is ensured by the residual symmetries. We also give a simple interpretation of the vDVZ-discontinuity, which arises in the lowest tree-level approximation, from the supersymmetric point of view.
