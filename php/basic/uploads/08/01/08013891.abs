Title: Implications of multi-Regge limits for the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov conjecture
Authors: Richard C. Brower and Horatiu Nastase and Howard J. Schnitzer and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: Planar ${\cal N} =4$ super Yang-Mills SU(N) theory is expected to exhibit stringy behavior, anticipated by the 't Hooft genus expansion and the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. We examine the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) conjecture for $n$-gluon amplitudes in the context of single-Regge and multi-Regge limits and show that these amplitudes have the expected Regge form in the Euclidean region.
