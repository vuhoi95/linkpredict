Title: Kinematical superalgebras and Lie algebras of order 3
Authors: R. Campoamor-Stursberg and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: We study and classify kinematical algebras which appear in the framework of Lie superalgebras or Lie algebras of order three. All these algebras are related through generalised Inon\"u-Wigner contractions from either the orthosymplectic superalgebra or the de Sitter Lie algebra of order three.
