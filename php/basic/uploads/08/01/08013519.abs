Title: Non-commutative geometry inspired higher-dimensional charged, black  holes
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Anais Smailagic and Piero Nicolini
Abstract: We obtain a new, exact, solution of the Einstein's equation in higher dimensions. The source is given by a static spherically symmetric, Gaussian distribution of mass and charge. De-localization of mass and charge is due to the presence of a "minimal length" in the spacetime fabric, coming from quantum gravitational effects, e.g. string induced non-commutative geometry. The resulting metric describes a regular, i.e. curvature singularity free, charged black hole in higher dimensions. The metric smoothly interpolates between Reissner-Nordstrom geometry at large distance, and deSitter spacetime at short distance. Thermodynamical properties of the black hole are investigated and the form of the Area Law is determined. We show that back reaction effects are negligible even near the temperature maximum for any reasonable number of extra dimensions. We study pair creation and show that the upper bound on the discharge time increases with the number of extra dimensions.
