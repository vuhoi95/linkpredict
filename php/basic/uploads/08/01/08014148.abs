Title: Gravitation: in search of the missing torsion
Authors: R. Aldrovandi and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: A linear Lorentz connection has always two fundamental derived characteristics: curvature and torsion. The latter is assumed to vanish in general relativity. Three gravitational models involving non-vanishing torsion are examined: teleparallel gravity, Einstein-Cartan, and new general relativity. Their dependability is critically examined. Although a final answer can only be given by experience, it is argued that teleparallel gravity provides the most consistent approach.
