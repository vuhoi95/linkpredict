Title: Five-dimensional rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory
Authors: Y. Brihaye and E. Radu
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of five-dimensional rotating black holes with equal magnitude angular momenta in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with negative cosmological constant. These solutions posses a regular horizon of spherical topology and approach asymptotically an Anti-de Sitter spacetime background. We discuss the general properties of these solutions and, using an adapted counterterm prescription, we compute their entropy and conserved charges.
