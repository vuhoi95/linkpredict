Title: Open-Closed String Correspondence in Open String Field Theory
Authors: Marco Baumgartl and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We address the problem of describing different closed string backgrounds in background independent open string field theory: A shift in the closed string background corresponds to a collective excitation of open strings. As an illustration we apply the formalism to the case where the closed string background is a group manifold.
