Abstract: We perform a Monte-Carlo study of the lattice two-dimensional gauged XY-model. Our results confirm the strong-coupling expansion arguments that for sufficiently small values of the spin-spin coupling the ``gauge symmetry breaking" terms decouple and the long-distance physics is that of the unbroken pure gauge theory. We find no evidence for the existence, conjectured earlier, of massless states near a critical value of the spin-spin coupling. We comment on recent remarks in the literature on the use of gauged XY-models in proposed constructions of chiral lattice gauge theories.
