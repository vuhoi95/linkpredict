Title: Metastable gauged O'Raifeartaigh
Authors: Borut Bajc and Alejandra Melfo
Abstract: We study the possibility of obtaining metastable supersymmetry breaking vacua in a perturbative gauge theory without singlet fields, thus allowing for scenarios where a grand unified symmetry and supersymmetry are broken by the same sector. We show some explicit SU(5) examples. The minimal renormalizable example requires the use of two adjoints, but it is shown to inevitably lead to unwanted light states. We suggest various alternatives, and show that the viable possibilities consist of allowing for non-renormalizable operators, of employing four adjoints or of adding at least one field in a different representation.
