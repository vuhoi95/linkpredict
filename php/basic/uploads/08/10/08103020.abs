Title: Correlation functions in conformal Toda field theory II
Authors: V. A. Fateev and A. V. Litvinov
Abstract: This is the second part of the paper 0709.3806v2. Here we show that three-point correlation function with one semi-degenerate field in Toda field theory as well as four-point correlation function with one completely degenerate and one semi-degenerate field can be represented by the finite dimensional integrals.
