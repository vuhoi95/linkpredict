Title: Membranes, Strings and Integrability
Authors: Chethan Krishnan and Carlo Maccaferri
Abstract: In the first half of this note, after briefly motivating and reviewing membrane field theories, we consider their BPS funnel solutions. We discuss some aspects of embedding M-theory fuzzy funnels in these theories. In the second half, we focus on ABJM theory and explain a test of AdS4/CFT3 based on integrability. We discuss a numerical mismatch at one loop in worldsheet perturbation theory and its possible resolutions.
