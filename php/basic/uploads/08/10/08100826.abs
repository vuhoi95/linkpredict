Title: Quantum Law of Motion: Analysis and Extension to Higher Dimensions
Authors: A. Bouda and A. Gharbi
Abstract: In this paper, we review the recently formulated quantum laws of motion and provide new observations. We also extend these laws to higher dimensions. By applying in two dimensions the obtained relations to charge submitted to an electric central potential, we decide between these laws. Furthermore, we extend the selected law to the relativistic case in higher dimensions.
