Title: Non-relativistic Branes
Authors: Luca Mazzucato and Yaron Oz and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We construct gravitational non-relativistic brane solutions of type IIA/IIB string theories and M-theory and their near-horizon geometries. The non-relativistic M2 and M5-brane metrics have Schroedinger symmetries with dynamical exponent z=3/2 and z=3, respectively, whereas the known D3-brane solution has z=2. The non-relativistic D-brane, NS5-brane, F-string and KK monopole metrics have asymptotically space and time translations, space rotations, Galilean symmetries and a particle number symmetry. We construct two different gravitational backgrounds of a non-relativistic D1-D5 system, both having asymptotically Schroedinger symmetry with exponent z=2. We study the properties of the solutions and their phase diagram.
