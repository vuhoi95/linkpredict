Title: Non chiral dynamical flavors and screening on the conifold
Authors: Francesco Bigazzi and Aldo L. Cotrone and Angel Paredes and Alfonso Ramallo
Abstract: We present a new class of string theory solutions which are conjectured to be dual to the N=1 conifold theory by Klebanov and Witten coupled to non chiral massive dynamical flavors. These are introduced, in the Veneziano limit, by means of suitably embedded and smeared D7-branes whose full backreaction on the background is taken into account. The string solutions are used to study chromoelectric charge screening effects due to the dynamical flavors in the non perturbative regime of the dual gauge theories.
