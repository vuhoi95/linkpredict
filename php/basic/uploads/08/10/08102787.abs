Title: Testing Inflation: A Bootstrap Approach
Authors: Latham Boyle and Paul J. Steinhardt
Abstract: We note that the essential idea of inflation, that the universe underwent a brief period of accelerated expansion followed by a long period of decelerated expansion, can be encapsulated in a "closure condition" which relates the amount of accelerated expansion during inflation to the amount of decelerated expansion afterward. We present a protocol for systematically testing the validity of this condition observationally.
