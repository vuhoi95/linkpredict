Authors: Ting-Wai Chiu and Tung-Han Hsieh and Po-Kai Tseng and for the TWQCD Collaboration
Abstract: We measure the topological charge and its fluctuation for the gauge configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations using 2+1 flavors of domain-wall fermions on the 16^3 x 32 lattice (L \simeq 2 fm) with length 16 in the fifth dimension at inverse lattice spacing a^{-1} \simeq 1.62 GeV. From the spectral flow of the Hermitian operator H_w (2 + \gamma_5 H_w)^{-1}, we obtain the topological charge Q_t of each gauge configuration in the three ensembles with light sea quark masses m_q a = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03, and with the strange quark mass fixed at m_s a = 0.04. From our result of Q_t, we compute the topological susceptibilty \chi_t = < Q_t^2 > /volume. In the small m_q regime, our result of \chi_t agrees with the chiral effective theory. Using the formula \chi_t = \Sigma / (m_u^{-1} + m_d^{-1} + m_s^{-1}) by Leutwyler-Smilga, we obtain the chiral condensate \Sigma^MSbar(2 GeV) = [259(6)(9) MeV]^3.
