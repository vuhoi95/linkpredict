Title: Integrable pseudopotentials related to elliptic curves
Authors: Alexander Odesskii and Vladimir Sokolov
Abstract: We construct integrable pseudopotentials with an arbitrary number of fields in terms of elliptic generalization of hypergeometric functions in several variables. These pseudopotentials yield some integrable (2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic type systems. An interesting class of integrable (1+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic type systems is also generated by our pseudopotentials.
