Title: Berry Phase and Supersymmetry
Authors: Julian Sonner and David Tong
Abstract: We study the constraints of supersymmetry on the non-Abelian holonomy given by U=P exp(i\int A), the path-ordered exponential of a connection A. For theories with four supercharges, we show that A satisfies the tt* equations if it is a function of chiral multiplets. In contrast, when A is a function of vector multiplets, it satisfies the Bogomolnyi monopole equations. We describe applications of these results to the Berry connection in supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
