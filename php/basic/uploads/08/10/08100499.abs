Title: Operator Mixing and the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: George Georgiou and Valeria L. Gili and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We provide a direct prescription for computing the mixing among gauge invariant operators in N=4 SYM. Our approach is based on the action of the superalgebra on the states of the theory and thus it can be also applied to resolve the mixing in the dual string description. As an example, we focus on the supermultiplet containing the BMN operators with two impurities. On the field theory side, we derive the leading planar quantum corrections to the naive expression of the highest weight state. Then we use the same prescription in the BMN limit of the AdS5xS5 string theory and derive the form of the 2-impurity highest weight state. The string expression matches nicely the SYM result and provides a prediction for the mixing due to higher order quantum corrections in field theory.
