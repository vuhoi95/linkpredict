Title: A Simple Introduction to Particle Physics
Authors: M. Robinson and K. Bland and G. Cleaver and J. Dittmann
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers in which we present a brief introduction to the relevant mathematical and physical ideas that form the foundation of Particle Physics, including Group Theory, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory and Interactions, Abelian and Non-Abelian Gauge Theory, and the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) Gauge Theory that describes our universe apart from gravity. These notes are not intended to be a comprehensive introduction to any of the ideas contained in them. Among the glaring omissions are CPT theorems, evaluations of Feynman Diagrams, Renormalization, and Anomalies. The topics were chosen according to the authors preferences and agenda. These notes are intended for a student who has completed the standard undergraduate physics and mathematics courses. Furthermore, these notes should not and will not in any way take the place of the related courses, but rather provide a primer for detailed courses in QFT, Gauge Theory, String Theory, etc., which will fill in the many gaps left by this paper.
