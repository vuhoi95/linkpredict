Title: Correlators in Nontrivial Backgrounds
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Norman Ives and Michael Stephanou
Abstract: Operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with an R-charge of O(N^2) are dual to backgrounds which are asymtotically AdS5xS5. In this article we develop efficient techniques that allow the computation of correlation functions in these backgrounds. We find that (i) contractions between fields in the string words and fields in the operator creating the background are the field theory accounting of the new geometry, (ii) correlation functions of probes in these backgrounds are given by the free field theory contractions but with rescaled propagators and (iii) in these backgrounds there are no open string excitations with their special end point interactions; we have only closed string excitations.
