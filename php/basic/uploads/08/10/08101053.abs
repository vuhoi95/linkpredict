Title: String duals of two-dimensional (4,4) supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Daniel Arean and Paolo Merlatti and Carlos Nunez and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study duals to field theories in two dimensions with N=(4,4) SUSY. The string backgrounds reproduce certain non-perturbative aspects of the dual field theory with a large number of colors N_c and a tunable number of flavors N_f. Different aspects of the two-dimensional field theory are discussed, among them the running of gauge couplings, the spectrum of mesons in Higgs and Coulomb branches, entanglement entropy and the non-relativistic version of our string backgrounds.
