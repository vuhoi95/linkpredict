Title: Quarks in Coulomb gauge perturbation theory
Authors: C. Popovici and P. Watson and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: Coulomb gauge quantum chromodynamics within the first order functional formalism is considered. The quark contributions to the Dyson-Schwinger equations are derived and one-loop perturbative results for the two-point functions are presented.
