Title: Chern-Simons foam
Authors: Steven Willison and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory can be defined on a cell complex, such as a network of bubbles, which is not a (Hausdorff) manifold. Requiring gauge invariance determines the action, including interaction terms at the intersections, and imposes a relation between the coupling constants of the CS terms on adjacent cell walls. We also find simple conservation laws for charges at the intersections.
