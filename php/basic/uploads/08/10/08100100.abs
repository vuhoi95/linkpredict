Title: On the large spin limit of twist operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: Francesca Catino and Matteo Beccaria
Abstract: The long range Bethe Ansatz solution of the mixing problem in N=4 SYM allows to compute in a very efficient way multiloop anomalous dimensions of various composite operators. In the case of sl(2) twist operators it is important to obtain closed expressions for the anomalous dimensions in terms of the Lorentz spin. Conjectures are available altough analytical proofs are missing beyond one-loop. In this paper, we will present a method to expand at large spin the solution of the long range Baxter equation in twist 2 and 3. We will also propose sum rules for special singlet states at higher twist.
