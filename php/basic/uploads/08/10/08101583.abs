Title: One-loop effective action in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric massive  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: We consider the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theory of the massive Yang-Mills field formulated in the ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic superspace. The various gauge-invariant forms of writing the mass term in the action (in particular, using the Stueckelberg superfield), which result in dual formulations of the theory, are presented. We develop a gauge-invariant and explicitly supersymmetric scheme of the loop off-shell expansion of the superfield effective action. In the framework of this scheme, we calculate gauge-invariant and explicitly ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric one-loop counterterms including new counterterms depending on the Stueckelberg superfield. Component structure of one of these counterterms is analyzed.
