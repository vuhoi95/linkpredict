Title: Kaehler Metrics and Yukawa Couplings in Magnetized Brane Models
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and A. Liccardo and R. Marotta and F. Pezzella
Abstract: Using the field theoretical approach introduced by Cremades, Ibanez and Marchesano for describing open strings attached to D9 branes having different magnetizations, we give a procedure for determining the Kaehler metrics of those open strings in toroidal compactifications.
