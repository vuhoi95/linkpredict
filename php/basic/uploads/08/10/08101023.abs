Title: Four-point function in Super Liouville Gravity
Authors: A. Belavin and V. Belavin
Abstract: We consider the 2D super Liouville gravity coupled to the minimal superconformal theory. We analyze the physical states in the theory and give the general form of the n-point correlation numbers on the sphere in terms of integrals over the moduli space. The three-point correlation numbers are presented explicitly. For the four-point correlators, we show that the integral over the moduli space reduces to the boundary terms if one of the fields is degenerate. It turns out that special logarithmic fields are relevant for evaluating these boundary terms. We discuss the construction of these fields and study their operator product expansions. This analysis allows evaluating the four-point correlation numbers. The derivation is analogous to the one in the bosonic case and is based on the recently derived higher equations of motion of the super Liouville field theory.
