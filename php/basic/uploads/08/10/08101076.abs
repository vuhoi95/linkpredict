Title: Proof of the Julia-Zee Theorem
Authors: Joel Spruck and Yisong Yang
Abstract: It is a well accepted principle that finite-energy static solutions in the classical relativistic gauge field theory over the $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime must be electrically neutral. We call such a statement the Julia--Zee theorem. In this paper, we present a mathematical proof of this fundamental structural property.
