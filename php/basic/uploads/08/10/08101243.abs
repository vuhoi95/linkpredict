Title: Chern-Simons-Matter Theory and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Daniel Louis Jafferis and Xi Yin
Abstract: In this paper we study supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter (CSM) theories with several Higgs branches. Two such theories at small Chern-Simons level are conjectured to describe the superconformal field theory at the infrared fixed point of N = 4 QED with N_f = 2, 3. In particular, the mirror symmetry which exchanges the Coulomb and Higgs branches of N = 4 QED with N_f = 2 is manifest in the Chern-Simons-matter description. We also study the quantum corrections to the moduli space of a class of N = 2 CSM theories.
