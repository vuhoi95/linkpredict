Abstract: In this paper we are giving a quantitative description of two different configurations for noncontact gears. We consider the solutions from a perturbative calculation for two semitransparent parallel plates and concentric cylinders both with corrugations on the inner surfaces. In the case of corrugated parallel plates we discuss results from first- and second-order perturbation calculation in the corrugation amplitudes and we will concentrate on the first-order perturbation for the case of the corrugated concentric cylinders (the second order calculation is under study), both for the weak and strong couplings. We compare the perturbative results with the results from the PFA and an exact weak coupling calculation.
