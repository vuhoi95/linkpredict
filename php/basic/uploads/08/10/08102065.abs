Title: On Dimensional Degression in AdS(d)
Authors: A. Yu. Artsukevich and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We analyze the pattern of fields in d+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space in terms of those in d dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The procedure, which is neither dimensional reduction nor dimensional compactification, is called dimensional degression. The analysis is performed group-theoretically for all totally symmetric bosonic and fermionic representations of the anti-de Sitter algebra. The field-theoretical analysis is done for a massive scalar field in AdS(d+d$^\prime$) and massless spin one-half, spin one, and spin two fields in AdS(d+1). The mass spectra of the resulting towers of fields in AdS(d) are found. For the scalar field case, the obtained results extend to the shadow sector those obtained by Metsaev in [1] by a different method.
