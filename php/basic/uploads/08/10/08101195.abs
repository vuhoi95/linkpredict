Title: Duality covariant quantum field theory on noncommutative Minkowski space
Authors: Andre Fischer and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We prove that a scalar quantum field theory defined on noncommutative Minkowski spacetime with noncommuting momentum coordinates is covariant with respect to the UV/IR duality which exchanges coordinates and momenta. The proof is based on suitable resonance expansions of charged noncommutative scalar fields in a background electric field, which yields an effective description of the field theory in terms of a coupled complex two-matrix model. The two independent matrix degrees of freedom ensure unitarity and manifest CT-invariance of the field theory. The formalism describes an analytic continuation of the renormalizable Grosse-Wulkenhaar models to Minkowski signature.
