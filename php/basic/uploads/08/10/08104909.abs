Title: Wall crossing in local Calabi Yau manifolds
Authors: Daniel L. Jafferis and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: We study the BPS states of a D6-brane wrapping the conifold and bound to collections of D2 and D0 branes. We find that in addition to the complexified Kahler parameter of the rigid sphere it is necessary to introduce an extra real parameter to describe BPS partition functions and marginal stability walls. The supergravity approach to BPS state-counting gives a simple derivation of results of Szendroi concerning Donaldson-Thomas theory on the noncommutative conifold. This example also illustrates some interesting limitations on the supergravity approach to BPS state-counting and wall-crossing.
