Title: The Classification of Highly Supersymmetric Supergravity Solutions
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos and D. Roest
Abstract: The spinorial geometry method is an effective method for constructing systematic classifications of supersymmetric supergravity solutions. Recent work on analysing highly supersymmetric solutions in type IIB supergravity using this method is reviewed [arXiv:hep-th/0606049, arXiv:0710.1829]. It is shown that all supersymmetric solutions of IIB supergravity with more than 28 Killing spinors are locally maximally supersymmetric.
