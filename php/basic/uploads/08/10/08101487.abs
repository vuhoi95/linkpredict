Title: Gerbal Representations of Double Loop Groups
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Xinwen Zhu
Abstract: A crucial role in representation theory of loop groups of reductive Lie groups and their Lie algebras is played by their non-trivial second cohomology classes which give rise to their central extensions (the affine Kac-Moody groups and Lie algebras). Loop groups embed into the group GL_\infty of continuous automorphisms of C((t)), and these classes come from a second cohomology class of GL_\infty. In a similar way, double loop groups embed into a group of automorphisms of C((t))((s)), denoted by GL_{\infty,\infty}, which has a non-trivial third cohomology. In this paper we explain how to realize a third cohomology class in representation theory of a group: it naturally arises when we consider representations on categories rather than vector spaces. We call them "gerbal representations." We then construct a gerbal representation of GL_{\infty,\infty} (and hence of double loop groups), realizing its non-trivial third cohomology class, on a category of modules over an infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra. This is a two-dimensional analogue of the fermionic Fock representations of the ordinary loop groups.
