Title: Appearance of Gauge Fields and Forces beyond the adiabatic approximation
Authors: Pierre Gosselin and Herve Mohrbach
Abstract: We investigate the origin of quantum geometric phases, gauge fields and forces beyond the adiabatic regime. In particular, we extend the notions of geometric magnetic and electric forces discovered in studies of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to arbitrary quantum systems described by matrix valued quantum Hamiltonians. The results are illustrated by several physical relevant examples.
