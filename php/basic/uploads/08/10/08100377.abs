Title: A Topologically Massive Gauge Theory with 32 Supercharges
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Olaf Hohm
Abstract: We construct a novel topologically massive abelian Chern-Simons gauge theory with 32 global supersymmetries in three spacetime dimensions. In spite of the 32 supercharges, the theory exhibits massive excitations only up to spin 1. The possibility of such a multiplet shortening is due to the presence of non-central R-symmetry generators in the Poincare superalgebra, whose supermultiplets are determined.
