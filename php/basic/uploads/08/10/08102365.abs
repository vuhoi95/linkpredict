Title: Into the bulk: reconstructing spacetime from the c=1 matrix model
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Daoyan Wang
Abstract: We write down exact solutions in the collective field theory of the c=1 matrix model and in dilaton-gravity coupled to a massless scalar. Using the known correspondence between these two theories at the null boundaries of spacetime, we make a connection between scalar fields in these two theories in the bulk of spacetime. In the process, we gain insight into how a theory containing gravity can be equivalent to one without gravity. We analyze a simple time-dependent background as an example.
