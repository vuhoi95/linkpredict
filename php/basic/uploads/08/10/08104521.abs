Title: Gravitational Radiation by Cosmic Strings in a Junction
Authors: Robert Brandenberger and Hassan Firouzjahi and Johanna Karouby and Shahram Khosravi
Abstract: The formalism for computing the gravitational power radiation from excitations on cosmic strings forming a junction is presented and applied to the simple case of co-planar strings at a junction when the excitations are generated along one string leg. The effects of polarization of the excitations and of the back-reaction of the gravitational radiation on the small scale structure of the strings are studied.
