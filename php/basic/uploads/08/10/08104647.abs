Authors: Eric D'Hoker and John Estes and Michael Gutperle and Darya Krym
Abstract: General local half-BPS solutions in M-theory, which have $SO(2,2)\times SO(4)\times SO(4)$ symmetry and are asymptotic to $AdS_{7}\times S^{4}$, were constructed in exact form by the authors in [arXiv:0806.0605]. In the present paper, suitable regularity conditions are imposed on these local solutions, and corresponding globally well-defined solutions are explicitly constructed. The physical properties of these solutions are analyzed, and interpreted in terms of the gravity duals to extended 1+1-dimensional half-BPS defects in the 6-dimensional CFT with maximal supersymmetry.
