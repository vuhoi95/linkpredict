Title: Neutrino mixing and mass hierarchy in Gaussian landscapes
Authors: Lawrence J. Hall and Michael P. Salem and Taizan Watari
Abstract: The flavor structure of the Standard Model may arise from random selection on a landscape. In a class of simple models, called "Gaussian landscapes," Yukawa couplings derive from overlap integrals of Gaussian zero-mode wavefunctions on an extra-dimensional space. Statistics of vacua are generated by scanning the peak positions of these wavefunctions, giving probability distributions for all flavor observables. Gaussian landscapes can account for all of the major features of flavor, including both the small electroweak mixing in the quark sector and the large mixing observed in the lepton sector. We find that large lepton mixing stems directly from lepton doublets having broad wavefunctions on the internal manifold. Assuming the seesaw mechanism, we find the mass hierarchy among neutrinos is sensitive to the number of right-handed neutrinos, and can provide a good fit to neutrino oscillation measurements.
