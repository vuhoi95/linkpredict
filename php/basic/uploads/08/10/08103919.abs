Title: Seeking Sgluons
Authors: Tilman Plehn and Tim M. P. Tait
Abstract: Scalar gluons -- or sgluons -- are color octet scalars without electroweak charges. They occur in supersymmetric models of Dirac gauginos as the scalar partners of the gluino and carry Standard-Model type R charge. This allows them to interact with ordinary matter and to be produced at the LHC, singly as well as in pairs. Sgluons dominantly decay into gluons, top pairs, and a top quark plus a light quark. A pair of sgluons decaying into like-sign tops would provide a striking signature at the LHC. In our discussion of this channel we especially focus on the proper treatment of QCD jets.
