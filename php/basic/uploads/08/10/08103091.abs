Title: Abelian Vortex in Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson Theory
Authors: Jongwook Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: Among newly discovered M2, M5 objects in the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson theory, our interest is about half BPS vortices which are covariantly holomorphic curves in transverse coordinates. We restrict ourselves to the case where the global symmetry is broken to so(2) x so(2)x so(4) for the mass deformed Bagger-Lambert theory. A localized object with finite energy exists in this theory where the mass parameter supports regularity. It is time independent but carries angular momentum coming solely from the gauge potential by which the energy is bounded below.
