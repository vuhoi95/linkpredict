Title: Implementation of the Duality between Wilson loops and Scattering  Amplitudes in QCD
Authors: Yuri Makeenko and Poul Olesen
Abstract: We generalize modern ideas about the duality between Wilson loops and scattering amplitudes in ${\cal N}$=4 SYM to large-N (or quenched) QCD. We show that the area-law behavior of asymptotically large Wilson loops is dual to the Regge-Veneziano behavior of scattering amplitudes at high energies and fixed momentum transfer, when quark mass is small and/or the number of particles is large. We elaborate on this duality for string theory in a flat space, identifying the asymptotes of the disk amplitude and the Wilson loop of large-N QCD.
