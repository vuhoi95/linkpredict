Title: Late Time Decay of the False Vacuum, Measurement, and Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Lawrence M. Krauss and James Dent and Glenn D. Starkman
Abstract: The recent suggestion that late time quantum dynamics may be important for resolving cosmological issues associated with our observed universe requires a consideration of several subtle issues associated with quantum cosmology, as we describe here. The resolution of these issues will be important if we are to be able to properly ascribe probability measures associated with eternal inflation, and a string landscape.
