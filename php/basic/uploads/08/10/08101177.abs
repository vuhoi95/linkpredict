Title: Circular Orbits in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Valeria M. Rosa and Patricio S. Letelier
Abstract: The stability under radial and vertical perturbations of circular orbits associated to particles orbiting a spherically symmetric center of attraction is study in the context of the n-dimensional: Newtonian theory of gravitation, Einstein's general relativity, and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravitation. The presence of a cosmological constant is also considered. We find that this constant as well as the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant are crucial to have stability for $n>4$.
