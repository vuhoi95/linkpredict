Abstract: In this work, we calculate the classical solutions for the electrodynamics stemming from the Lorentz-violating (LV) and CPT-even term of the Standard Model Extension. The solutions for point-like and extended charges are obtained from the wave equations by means of the Green method. A dipolar expansion is written for the field strengths. It is explicitly shown that charge and current generate first order effects for the magnetic and electric fields, respectively. Using the magnetic field generated by a macroscopic 1C charged sphere, we establish a stringent bound for the LV parameter:$\kappa \leq 10^{-16}.$
