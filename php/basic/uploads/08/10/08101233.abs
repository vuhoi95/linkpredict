Title: The mixed black hole partition function for the STU model
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and J. R. David and B. de Wit and S. Mahapatra
Abstract: We evaluate the mixed partition function for dyonic BPS black holes using the recently proposed degeneracy formula for the STU model. The result factorizes into the OSV mixed partition function times a proportionality factor. The latter is in agreement with the measure factor that was recently conjectured for a class of N=2 black holes that contains the STU model.
