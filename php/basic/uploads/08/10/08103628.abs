Title: Integrable models from PT-symmetric deformations
Authors: Paulo E. G. Assis and Andreas Fring
Abstract: We address the question of whether integrable models allow for PT-symmetric deformations which preserve their intgrability. For this purpose we carry out the Painleve test for PT-symmetric deformations of Burgers and the Korteweg-De Vries equation. We find that the former equation allows for infinitely many deformations which pass the Painleve test. For a specific deformation we prove the convergence of the Painleve expansion and thus establish the Painleve property for these models, which are therefore thought to be integrable. The Korteweg-De Vries equation does not allow for deformations which pass the Painleve test in complete generality, but we are able to construct a defective Painleve expansion.
