Title: The canonical transformation and massive CSW vertices for MHV-SQCD
Authors: Tim R. Morris and Zhiguang Xiao
Abstract: The similarity of massive CSW scalar vertices and quark vertices can be understood using a kind of light-cone SUSY transformation presented in this paper. We also show that the canonical transformation generating the MHV-SQCD lagrangian, can be fixed by applying this light-cone SUSY transformation to the canonical transformation for MHV-QCD obtained in paper arxiv:0805.0239. Most of the massive CSW vertices for SQCD can also be pinned down in this way.
