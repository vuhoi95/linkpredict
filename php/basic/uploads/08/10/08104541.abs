Title: Argyres-Seiberg duality and the Higgs branch
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Andrew Neitzke and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We demonstrate the agreement between the Higgs branches of two N=2 theories proposed by Argyres and Seiberg to be S-dual, namely the SU(3) gauge theory with six quarks, and the SU(2) gauge theory with one pair of quarks coupled to the superconformal theory with E_6 flavor symmetry. In mathematical terms, we demonstrate the equivalence between a hyperkaehler quotient of a linear space and another hyperkaehler quotient involving the minimal nilpotent orbit of E_6, modulo the identification of the twistor lines.
