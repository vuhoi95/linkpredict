Title: I-odd sector of the Klebanov-Strassler theory
Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Dmitry Melnikov and Alexander Solovyov
Abstract: The Klebanov-Strassler background is invariant under the Z_2 symmetry I, which acts by exchanging the bi-fundamental fields A and B, accompanied by the charge conjugation. We study the background perturbations in the I-odd sector and find an exhaustive list of bosonic states invariant under the global SU(2)*SU(2) symmetry. In addition to the scalars identified in an earlier publication arXiv:0712.4404 we find 7 families of massive states of spin 1. Together with the spin 0 states they form 3 families of massive vector multiplets and 2 families of massive gravitino multiplets, containing a vector, a pseudovector and fermions of spin 3/2 and 1/2. In the conformal Klebanov-Witten case these I-odd particles belong to the N=1 superconformal Vector Multiplet I and Gravitino Multiplets II and IV. The operators dual to the I-odd singlet sector include those without bi-fundamental fields making an interesting connection with the pure N=1 SYM theory. We calculate the mass spectrum of the corresponding glueballs numerically and discuss possible applications of our results.
