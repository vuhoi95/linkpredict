Title: Supersymmetry and Gravitational Duality
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Fran√ßois Dehouck and Laurent Houart
Abstract: We study how the supersymmetry algebra copes with gravitational duality. As a playground, we consider a charged Taub-NUT solution of D=4, N=2 supergravity. We find explicitly its Killing spinors, and the projection they obey provides evidence that the dual magnetic momenta necessarily have to appear in the supersymmetry algebra. The existence of such a modification is further supported using an approach based on the Nester form. In the process, we find new expressions for the dual magnetic momenta, including the NUT charge. The same expressions are then rederived using gravitational duality.
