Title: Hypergeometric functions, their epsilon expansions and Feynman diagrams
Authors: M. Yu. Kalmykov and Bernd A. Kniehl and B. F. L. Ward and S. A. Yost
Abstract: We review the hypergeometric function approach to Feynman diagrams. Special consideration is given to the construction of the Laurent expansion. As an illustration, we describe a collection of physically important one-loop vertex diagrams for which this approach is useful.
