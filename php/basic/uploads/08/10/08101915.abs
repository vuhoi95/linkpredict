Title: An alternative S-matrix for N=6 Chern-Simons theory ?
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We have recently proposed an S-matrix for the planar limit of the N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory of Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena which leads to the all-loop Bethe ansatz equations conjectured by Gromov and Vieira. An unusual feature of this proposal is that the scattering of A and B particles is reflectionless. We consider here an alternative S-matrix, for which A-B scattering is not reflectionless. We argue that this S-matrix does not lead to the Bethe ansatz equations which are consistent with perturbative computations.
