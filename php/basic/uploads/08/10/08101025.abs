Title: More non-Abelian loop Toda solitons
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: We find new solutions, including soliton-like ones, for a special case of non-Abelian loop Toda equations associated with complex general linear groups. We use the method of rational dressing based on an appropriate block-matrix representation suggested by the Z-gradation under consideration. We present solutions in a form of a direct matrix generalization of the Hirota's soliton solution already well-known for the case of Abelian loop Toda systems.
