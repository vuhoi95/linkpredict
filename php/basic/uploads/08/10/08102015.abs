Title: N = 2 SUSY QED in nonlinear/linear SUSY relation
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show systematically the relation between a N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetric (NLSUSY) model and a N = 2 SUSY QED theory by means of the superfield formulation in two dimensional spacetime without imposing a priori any special gauge conditions for a gauge superfield.
