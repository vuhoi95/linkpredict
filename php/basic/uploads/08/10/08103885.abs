Title: Landau quantization for a neutral particle in presence of topological  defects
Authors: K. Bakke and L. R. Ribeiro and C. Furtado and J. R. Nascimento
Abstract: In this paper we study the Landau levels in the non-relativistic dynamics of a neutral particle which possesses a permanent magnetic dipole moment interacting with an external electric field in the curved spacetime background with the presence or absence of a torsion field. The eigenfunction and eigenvalues of Hamiltonian are obtained. We show that the presence of the topological defect breaks the infinite degeneracy of the Landau levels arising in this system. We also apply a duality transformation to discuss this same quantization for a dynamics of a neutral particle with a permanent electric dipole moment.
