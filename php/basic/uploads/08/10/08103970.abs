Title: Superconductivity from D3/D7: Holographic Pion Superfluid
Authors: Pallab Basu and Jianyang He and Anindya Mukherjee and Hsien-Hang Shieh
Abstract: We show that a D3/D7 system (at zero quark mass limit) at finite isospin chemical potential goes through a superconductor (superfluid) like phase transition. This is similar to a flavored superfluid phase studied in QCD literature, where mesonic operators condensate. We have studied the frequency dependent conductivity of the condensate and found a delta function pole in the zero frequency limit. This is an example of superconductivity in a string theory context. Consequently we have found a superfluid/supercurrent type solution and studied the associated phase diagram. The superconducting transition changes from second order to first order at a critical superfluid velocity. We have studied various properties of the superconducting system like superfluid density, energy gap, second sound etc. We investigate the possibility of the isospin chemical potential modifying the embedding of the flavor branes by checking whether the transverse scalars also condense at low temperature. This however does not seem to be the case.
