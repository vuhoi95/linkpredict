Title: A holomorphic and background independent partition function for matrix  models and topological strings
Authors: Bertrand Eynard and Marcos Marino
Abstract: We study various properties of a nonperturbative partition function which can be associated to any spectral curve. When the spectral curve arises from a matrix model, this nonperturbative partition function is given by a sum of matrix integrals over all possible filling fractions, and includes all the multi-instanton corrections to the perturbative 1/N expansion. We show that the nonperturbative partition function, which is manifestly holomorphic, is also modular and background independent: it transforms as the partition function of a twisted fermion on the spectral curve. Therefore, modularity is restored by nonperturbative corrections. We also show that this nonperturbative partition function obeys the Hirota equation and provides a natural nonperturbative completion for topological string theory on local Calabi-Yau threefolds.
