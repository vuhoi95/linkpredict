Title: Instability of Axions and Photons In The Presence of Cosmic Strings
Authors: Eduardo I. Guendelman and Idan Shilon
Abstract: We report that axions and photons exhibit instability in the presence of cosmic strings that are carrying magnetic flux in their core. The strength of the instability is determined by the symmetry breaking scale of the cosmic string theory. This result would be evident in gamma ray bursts and axions emanating from the cosmic string. These effects will eventually lead to evaporation of the cosmic string.
