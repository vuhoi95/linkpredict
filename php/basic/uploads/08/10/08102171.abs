Title: M2-brane Perspective on N=6 Super Chern-Simons Theory at Level k
Authors: Changrim Ahn and P. Bozhilov
Abstract: Recently, O. Aharony, O. Bergman, D. L. Jafferis and J. Maldacena (ABJM) proposed three-dimensional super Chern-Simons-matter theory, which at level k is supposed to describe the low energy limit of N M2-branes. For large N and k, but fixed 't Hooft coupling \lambda=N/k, it is dual to type IIA string theory on AdS_4 x CP^3. For large N but finite k, it is dual to M theory on AdS_4 x S^7/Z_k. In this paper, relying on the second duality, we find exact giant magnon and single spike solutions of membrane configurations on AdS_4 x S^7/Z_k by reducing the system to the Neumann-Rosochatius integrable model. We derive the dispersion relations and their finite-size corrections with explicit dependence on the level k.
