Title: Fitting the Galaxy Rotation Curves: Strings versus NFW profile
Authors: Yeuk-Kwan E. Cheung and Feng Xu
Abstract: Remarkable fit of galaxy rotation curves is achieved using a simple model from string theory. The rotation curves of the same group of galaxies are also fit using dark matter model with the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile for comparison. String model utilizes three free parameters vs five in the dark matter model. The average chi-squared of the string model fit is 1.649 while that of the dark matter model is 1.513. The generalized NFW profile fits marginally better at a price of two more free parameters.
