Title: Compact dimensions and the Casimir effect: the Proca connection
Authors: Ariel Edery and Valery Marachevsky
Abstract: We study the Casimir effect in the presence of an extra dimension compactified on a circle of radius R ($M^4\times S^1$ spacetime). Our starting point is the Kaluza Klein decomposition of the 5D Maxwell action into a massless sector containing the 4D Maxwell action and an extra massless scalar field and a Proca sector containing 4D gauge fields with masses $m_n=n/R$ where $n$ is a positive integer. An important point is that, in the presence of perfectly conducting parallel plates, the three degrees of freedom do not yield three discrete (non-penetrating) modes but two discrete modes and one continuum (penetrating) mode. The massless sector reproduces Casimir's original result and the Proca sector yields the corrections. The contribution from the Proca continuum mode is obtained within the framework of Lifshitz theory for plane parallel dielectrics whereas the discrete modes are calculated via 5D formulas for the piston geometry. An interesting manifestation of the extra compact dimension is that the Casimir force between perfectly conducting plates depends on the thicknesses of the slabs.
