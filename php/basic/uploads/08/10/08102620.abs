Title: Near the horizon of 5D black rings
Authors: F. Loran and H. Soltanpanahi
Abstract: For the five dimensional N=2 black rings, we study the supersymmetry enhancement and identify the global supergroup of the near horizon geometry. We show that the global part of the supergroup is OSp(4*|2)X U(1) which is similar to the small black string. We show that results obtained by applying the entropy function formalism, the c-extremization approach and the Brown-Henneaux method to the black ring solution are in agreement with the microscopic entropy calculation.
