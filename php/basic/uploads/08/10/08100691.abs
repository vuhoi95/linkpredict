Title: Analytic three-loop Solutions for N=4 SYM Twist Operators
Authors: Anatoly V. Kotikov and Adam Rej and Stefan Zieme
Abstract: We introduce a method to obtain the analytic solution of the higher-order Baxter equation for twist-two and twist-three operators of planar N=4 SYM. Our result proofs the conjectured formula for the three-loop anomalous dimension of twist-two operators. As such we derive the maximally transcendental part of the corresponding three-loop QCD result from the maximal supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimension purely by methods of integrability.
