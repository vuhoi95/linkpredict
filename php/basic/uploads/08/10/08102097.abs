Abstract: We derive the one loop renormalization group equations for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix for the Standard Model, its two Higgs extension and the minimal supersymmetric extension in a novel way. The derived equations depend only on a subset of the model parameters of the renormalization group equations for the quark Yukawa couplings so the CKM matrix evolution cannot fully test the renormalization group evolution of the quark Yukawa couplings. From the derived equations we obtain the invariant of the renormalization group evolution for three models which is the angle $\alpha$ of the unitarity triangle. For the special case of the Standard Model and its extensions with $v_{1}\approx v_{2}$ we demonstrate that also the shape of the unitarity triangle and the Buras-Wolfenstein parameters $\bar{\rho}=(1-{1/2}\lambda^{2})\rho$ and $\bar{\eta}=(1-{1/2}\lambda^{2})\eta$ are conserved. The invariance of the angles of the unitarity triangle means that it is not possible to find a model in which the CKM matrix might have a simple, special form at asymptotic energies.
