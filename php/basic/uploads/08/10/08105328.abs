Title: Minimal Simple de Sitter Solutions
Authors: Sheikh Shajidul Haque and Gary Shiu and Bret Underwood and Thomas Van Riet
Abstract: We show that the minimal set of necessary ingredients to construct explicit, four-dimensional de Sitter solutions from IIA string theory at tree-level are O6-planes, non-zero Romans mass parameter, form fluxes, and negative internal curvature. To illustrate our general results, we construct such minimal simple de Sitter solutions from an orientifold compactification of compact hyperbolic spaces. In this case there are only two moduli and we demonstrate that they are stabilized to a sufficiently weakly coupled and large volume regime. We also discuss generalizations of the scenario to more general metric flux constructions.
