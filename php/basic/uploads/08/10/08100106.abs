Title: Modular differential equations for torus one-point functions
Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel and Samuel Lang
Abstract: It is shown that in a rational conformal field theory every torus one-point function of a given highest weight state satisfies a modular differential equation. We derive and solve these differential equations explicitly for some Virasoro minimal models. In general, however, the resulting amplitudes do not seem to be expressible in terms of standard transcendental functions.
