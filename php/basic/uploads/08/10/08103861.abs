Authors: M. Shifman and M. Unsal
Abstract: We present a nontechnical review of the current understanding of the phenomenon of color confinement. The emphasis is put on recent advances. This is a combined and slightly expanded version of talks delivered at 14th International QCD Conference "QCD 08," 7-12th July 2008, Montpellier, France, the International Conference "Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum," Mainz, Germany, September 1-6, 2008 (Confinement 08), and the International Conference "Approaches to Quantum Chromodynamics," Oberwoelz, Austria, September 7-13, 2008.
