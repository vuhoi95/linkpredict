Title: Near Flat Space limit of strings on AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: M. Kreuzer and R. C. Rashkov and M. Schimpf
Abstract: The non-linear nature of string theory on non-trivial backgrounds related to the AdS/CFT correspondence suggests to look for simplifications. Two such simplifications proved to be useful in studying string theory. These are the pp-wave limit which describes point-like strings and the so called "near flat space" limit which connects two different sectors of string theory -- pp-waves and "giant magnons". Recently another example of AdS/CFT duality emerged - $AdS_4/CFT_3$, which suggests duality between $\mathcal N=6$ CS theory and superstring theory on $AdS_4\times \cp$. In this paper we study the "near flat space" limit of strings on the $AdS_4\times \cp$ background and discuss possible applications of the reduced theory.
