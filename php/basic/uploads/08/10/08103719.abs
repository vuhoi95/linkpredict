Title: Differential operator realizations of superalgebras and free field  representations of corresponding current algebras
Authors: Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang and Samuel Kault
Abstract: Based on the particular orderings introduced for the positive roots of finite dimensional basic Lie superalgebras, we construct the explicit differential operator representations of the $osp(2r|2n)$ and $osp(2r+1|2n)$ superalgebras and the explicit free field realizations of the corresponding current superalgebras $osp(2r|2n)_k$ and $osp(2r+1|2n)_k$ at an arbitrary level $k$. The free field representations of the corresponding energy-momentum tensors and screening currents of the first kind are also presented.
