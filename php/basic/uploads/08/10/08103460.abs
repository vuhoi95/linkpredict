Abstract: In an earlier paper Cooper, Shepard, and Sodano introduced a generalized KdV equation that can exhibit the kinds of compacton solitary waves that were first seen in equations studied by Rosenau and Hyman. This paper considers the PT-symmetric extensions of the equations examined by Cooper, Shepard, and Sodano. From the scaling properties of the PT-symmetric equations a general theorem relating the energy, momentum, and velocity of any solitary-wave solution of the generalized KdV equation is derived, and it is shown that the velocity of the solitons is determined by their amplitude, width, and momentum.
