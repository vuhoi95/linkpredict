Title: $Z_7$ Orbifold Models in M-Theory
Authors: Mohammad K. Ahsan and Tristan Hubsch
Abstract: Among $T^7/\Gamma$ orbifold compactifications of $M$-theory, we examine models containing the particle physics Standard Model in four-dimensional spacetimes, which appear as fixed subspaces of the ten-dimensional spacetimes at each end of the interval, $I^1\simeq S^1/Z_2$, spanning the $11^\text{th}$ dimension. Using the $Z_7$ projection to break the $E_8$ gauge symmetry in each of the four-planes and a limiting relation to corresponding heterotic string compactifications, we discuss the restrictions on the possible resulting gauge field and matter spectra. In particular, some of the states are non-local: they connect two four-dimensional Worlds across the $11^\text{th}$ dimension. We illustrate our programmable calculations of the matter field spectrum, including the anomalous U(1) factor which satisfies a universal Green-Schwarz relation, discuss a Dynkin diagram technique to showcase a model with $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)^5$ gauge symmetry, and discuss generalizations to higher order orbifolds.
