Title: Spiky Strings in AdS(4) X CP**3 with Neveu-Schwarz Flux
Authors: Sachin Jain and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study general rotating string solution in the AdS(4) X CP**3 background with a B_NS holonomy turned on over ${\bf CP}^1$ $\subset $ $ {\bf CP}^3$. We find the giant magnon and single spike solutions for the string moving in this background corresponding to open spin chain. We calculate the corresponding dispersion relation among various conserved charges for both the cases. We further study the finite size effect on both the giant magnon and single spike solutions.
