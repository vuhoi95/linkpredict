Title: Another derivation of the geometrical KPZ relations
Authors: Francois David and Michel Bauer
Abstract: We give a physicist's derivation of the geometrical (in the spirit of Duplantier-Sheffield) KPZ relations, via heat kernel methods. It gives a covariant way to define neighborhoods of fractals in 2d quantum gravity, and shows that these relations are in the realm of conformal field theory.
