Title: Finite-size Effect of the Dyonic Giant Magnons in N=6 super Chern-Simons  Theory
Authors: Changrim Ahn and P. Bozhilov
Abstract: We consider finite-size effects for the dyonic giant magnon of the type IIA string theory on AdS_4 x CP^3 by applying Luscher mu-term formula which is derived from a recently proposed S-matrix for the N=6 super Chern-Simons theory. We compute explicitly the effect for the case of a symmetric configuration where the two external bound states, each of A and B particles, have the same momentum p and spin J_2. We compare this with the classical string theory result which we computed by reducing it to the Neumann-Rosochatius system. The two results match perfectly.
