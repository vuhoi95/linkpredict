Title: QCD Cosmology from the Lattice Equation of State
Authors: Michael McGuigan and Wolfgang SÃ¶ldner
Abstract: We numerically determine the time dependence of the scale factor from the lattice QCD equation of state, which can be used to define a QCD driven cosmology. We compare a lattice approach to QCD cosmology at late times with other models of the low temperature equation of state including the hadronic resonance gas model, Hagedorn model and AdS/CFT.
