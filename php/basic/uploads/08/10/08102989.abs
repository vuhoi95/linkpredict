Title: Confining potential from interacting magnetic and torsion fields
Authors: Patricio Gaete and José A. Helaÿel-Neto
Abstract: Adopting the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, we study the coupling of torsion fields with photons in the presence of an external background electromagnetic. We explicitly show that, in the case of a constant electric field strength expectation value, the static potential remains Coulombic, while in the case of a constant magnetic field strength expectation value a confining potential is obtained. This result displays a marked qualitative departure from the usual coupling of axionlike particles with photons in the presence of an external magnetic field.
