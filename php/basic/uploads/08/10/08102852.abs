Title: Quartet unconstrained formulation for massive higher spin fields
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and A. V. Galajinsky
Abstract: We generalize the unconstrained description of free massless higher spin fields previously developed in [Nucl.Phys. B 779 (2007) 155] to the case of free massive higher spin fields in a flat space of arbitrary dimension. The Lagrangian is given in an easy-to-handle form for an arbitrary value of spin. It is local, free from higher derivative terms, and involves a minimal number of auxiliary fields needed for an unconstrained gauge invariant description of a free massive higher spin field in arbitrary dimension.
