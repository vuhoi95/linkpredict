Title: High-velocity collision of two black holes
Authors: Masaru Shibata and Hirotada Okawa and Tetsuro Yamamoto
Abstract: We study nonaxisymmetric collision of two black holes (BHs) with a high velocity $v=|dx^i/dx^0|=0.6$--$0.9c$ at infinity, where $x^{\mu}$ denotes four-dimensional coordinates. We prepare two boosted BHs for the initial condition which is different from that computed by a simple moving-puncture approach. By extrapolation of the numerical results, we find that the impact parameter has to be smaller that $\approx 2.5GM_0/c^2$ for formation of a BH in the collision for $v \to c$, where $M_0 c^2$ is the initial total ADM mass energy of the system. For the critical value of the impact parameter, 20--30% of mass energy and 60--70% of angular momentum are dissipated by gravitational radiation for $v=0.6$--$0.9c$.
