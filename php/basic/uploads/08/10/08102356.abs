Title: A mechanics for the Ricci flow
Authors: S. Abraham and P. Fernandez de Cordoba and J. M. Isidro and J. L. G. Santander
Abstract: We construct the classical mechanics associated with a conformally flat Riemannian metric on a compact, n-dimensional manifold without boundary. The corresponding gradient Ricci flow equation turns out to equal the time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the mechanics so defined.
