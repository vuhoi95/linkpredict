Title: Instability of fermions with respect to topology fluctuations
Authors: A. A. Kirillov and E. P. Savelova
Abstract: We extend our sum over topologies formula to fermions. We show that fermionic fields display an instability with respect to topology fluctuations. We present some phenomenological arguments for a modification of the action in the case of fermions and discuss possible applications.
