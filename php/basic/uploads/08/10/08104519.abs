Title: Master Space, Hilbert Series and Seiberg Duality
Authors: Davide Forcella and Amihay Hanany and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We analyze the action of Toric (Seiberg) duality on the combined mesonic and baryonic moduli space of quiver gauge theories obtained from D3 branes at Calabi-Yau singularities. We analyze in particular the structure of the master space, the complete moduli space for one brane, for different toric phases of a given singularity. We show that the Hilbert Series for the largest component of the master space of different phases is the same, when refined with all the non anomalous charges. This reflects the fact that the quiver gauge theories associated with different phases are related by Seiberg duality when the number of branes is greater than one.
