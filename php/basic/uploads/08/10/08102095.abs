Title: Twisted Noncommutative Field Theory with the Wick-Voros and Moyal  Products
Authors: Salvatore Galluccio and Fedele Lizzi and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We present a comparison of the noncommutative field theories built using two different star products: Moyal and Wick-Voros (or normally ordered). For the latter we discuss both the classical and the quantum field theory in the quartic potential case, and calculate the Green's functions up to one loop, for the two and four points cases. We compare the two theories in the context of the noncommutative geometry determined by a Drinfeld twist, and the comparison is made at the level of Green's functions and S-matrix. We find that while the Green's functions are different for the two theories, the S-matrix is the same in both cases, and is different from the commutative case.
