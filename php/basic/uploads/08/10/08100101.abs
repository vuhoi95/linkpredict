Title: QCD-like properties for anomalous dimensions in N=4 SYM
Authors: Valentina Forini and Matteo Beccaria
Abstract: In this contribution it is shown how closed formulas for anomalous dimensions of two classes of operators in N=4 SYM can be derived, either by investigating the numerics or on the basis of QCD-inspired assumptions. We discuss the case of twist three "gauge" operators in which a complete proof of reciprocity can be carried out.
