Title: Homotopy, monopoles and 't Hooft tensor in QCD with generic gauge group
Authors: Adriano Di Giacomo and Luca Lepori and Fabrizio Pucci
Abstract: We study monopoles and corresponding 't Hooft tensor in QCD with a generic compact gauge group. This issue is relevant to the understanding of color confinement in terms of dual symmetry.
