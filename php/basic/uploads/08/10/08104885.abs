Title: Symmetry Reduction in Twisted Noncommutative Gravity with Applications  to Cosmology and Black Holes
Authors: Thorsten Ohl and Alexander Schenkel
Abstract: As a preparation for a mathematically consistent study of the physics of symmetric spacetimes in a noncommutative setting, we study symmetry reductions in deformed gravity. We focus on deformations that are given by a twist of a Lie algebra acting on the spacetime manifold. We derive conditions on those twists that allow a given symmetry reduction. A complete classification of admissible deformations is possible in a class of twists generated by commuting vector fields. As examples, we explicitly construct the families of vector fields that generate twists which are compatible with Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies and Schwarzschild black holes, respectively. We find nontrivial isotropic twists of FRW cosmologies and nontrivial twists that are compatible with all classical symmetries of black hole solutions.
