Title: On the short string limit of the folded spinning string in AdS5 x S5
Authors: M. Beccaria and A. Tirziu
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the results of arXiv:0806.4758 to non-zero value J of angular momentum in S^5. We compute the 1-loop correction to the energy of the folded spinning string in AdS_5 x S^5 in the particular limit of slow short string approximation. In this limit the string is moving in a near-flat central region of AdS_5 slowly rotating in both AdS_5 and S^5. The one-loop correction should represent the first subleading correction to strong coupling expansion of the anomalous dimension of short gauge theory operators of the form Tr D^S Z^J in the SL(2) sector.
