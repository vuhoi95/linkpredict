Title: Quantum group connections
Authors: Jerzy Lewandowski and Andrzej Okolow
Abstract: The Ahtekar-Isham C*-algebra known from Loop Quantum Gravity is the algebra of continuous functions on the space of (generalized) connections with a compact structure Lie group. The algebra can be constructed by some inductive techniques from the C*-algebra of continuous functions on the group and a family of graphs embedded in the manifold underlying the connections. We generalize the latter construction replacing the commutative C*-algebra of continuous functions on the group by a non-commutative C*-algebra defining a compact quantum group.
