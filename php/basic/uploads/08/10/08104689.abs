Title: The adjoint potential in the pseudoparticle approach: string breaking  and Casimir scaling
Authors: Christian Szasz and Marc Wagner
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the adjoint static potential in the pseudoparticle approach, which is a model for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. We find agreement with the Casimir scaling hypothesis and there is clear evidence for string breaking. At the same time the potential in the fundamental representation is linear for large separations. Our results are in qualitative agreement with results from lattice computations.
