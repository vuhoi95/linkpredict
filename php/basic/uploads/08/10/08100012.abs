Title: Summing the Instantons in Half-Twisted Linear Sigma Models
Authors: Jock McOrist and Ilarion V. Melnikov
Abstract: We study half-twisted linear sigma models relevant to (0,2) compactifications of the heterotic string. Focusing on theories with a (2,2) locus, we examine the linear model parameter space and the dependence of genus zero half-twisted correlators on these parameters. We show that in a class of theories the correlators and parameters separate into A and B types, present techniques to compute the dependence, and apply these to some examples. These results should bear on the mathematics of (0,2) mirror symmetry and the physics of the moduli space and Yukawa couplings in heterotic compactifications.
