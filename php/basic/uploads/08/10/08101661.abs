Title: Comments on Holographic Fermi Surfaces
Authors: Hsien-Hang Shieh and Greg van Anders
Abstract: Recently, a mechanism for the development of a fermi surface in a holographic model of large N QCD with a baryon chemical potential was proposed. We examine similar constructions to determine when this mechanism persists. We find a class of models in which it does.
