Title: Finite size giant magnons in the SU(2) x SU(2) sector of AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: Tomasz Lukowski and Olof Ohlsson Sax
Abstract: We use the algebraic curve and Luscher's mu-term to calculate the leading order finite size corrections to the dispersion relation of giant magnons in the SU(2) x SU(2) sector of AdS_4 x CP^3. We consider a single magnon as well as one magnon in each SU(2). In addition the algebraic curve computation is generalized to give the leading order correction for an arbitrary multi-magnon state in the SU(2) x SU(2) sector.
