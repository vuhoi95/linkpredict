Title: Possible large-N transitions for complex Wilson loop matrices
Authors: Robert Lohmayer and Herbert Neuberger and Tilo Wettig
Abstract: It is shown that a very simple multiplicative random complex matrix model generalizes the large-N phase structure found in the unitary case: A perturbative regime is joined to a non-perturbative regime at a point where the smoothness of some quantities breaks down. A generic complex Wilson loop matrix in a field theory admitting a 't Hooft planar limit could display a phase transition in that limit as nonlinear effects become dominating over linear ones.
