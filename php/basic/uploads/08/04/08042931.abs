Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Hyerim Noh and Zong-Hong Zhu
Abstract: A new class of static plane symmetric solution of Einstein field equation generated by a perfect fluid source is put forward. A special family of this new solution is investigated in detail. The constraints on the parameters by different energy conditions are studied. The classical stability of this solution is discussed. The junction conditions matching to Minkowski metric and Taub metric are analyzed respectively.
