Title: Once again about quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz algebra: twistings  of q-deformation
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: This paper together with the previous one (arXiv:hep-th/0604146) presents the detailed description of all quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz algebra as Hopf algebra in terms of complex and real generators. We describe here in detail two quantum deformations of the D=4 Lorentz algebra o(3,1) obtained by twisting of the standard q-deformation U_{q}(o(3,1)). For the first twisted q-deformation an Abelian twist depending on Cartan generators of o(3,1) is used. The second example of twisting provides a quantum deformation of Cremmer-Gervais type for the Lorentz algebra. For completeness we describe also twisting of the Lorentz algebra by standard Jordanian twist. By twist quantization techniques we obtain for these deformations new explicit formulae for the deformed coproducts and antipodes of the o(3,1)-generators.
