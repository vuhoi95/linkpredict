Title: Hidden Symmetries of Higher Dimensional Black Holes and Uniqueness of  the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime
Authors: Pavel Krtous and Valeri P. Frolov and David Kubiznak
Abstract: We prove that the most general solution of the Einstein equations with the cosmological constant which admits a principal conformal Killing-Yano tensor is the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric. Even when the Einstein equations are not imposed, any spacetime admitting such hidden symmetry can be written in a canonical form which guarantees the following properties: it is of the Petrov type D, it allows the separation of variables for the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations, the geodesic motion in such a spacetime is completely integrable. These results naturally generalize the results obtained earlier in four dimensions.
