Abstract: We study the possible holographic connection between the Regge limit in QCD and critical gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid in higher dimensions. We begin by analyzing the problem of critical gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid in any number of dimensions and numerically compute the associated Choptuik exponent in d=5, 6 and 7 for a range of values of the speed of sound of the fluid. Using continuous self-similarity as guiding principle, a holographic correspondence between this process and the phenomenon of parton saturation in high-energy scattering in QCD is proposed. This holographic connection relates strong gravitational physics in the bulk with (nonsupersymmetric) QCD at weak coupling in four dimensions.
