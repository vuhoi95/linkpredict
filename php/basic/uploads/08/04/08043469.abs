Title: Boundary Correlators in Supergroup WZNW Models
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We investigate correlation functions for maximally symmetric boundary conditions in the WZNW model on GL(1|1). Special attention is payed to volume filling branes. Generalizing earlier ideas for the bulk sector, we set up a Kac-Wakimoto-like formalism for the boundary model. This first order formalism is then used to calculate bulk-boundary 2-point functions and the boundary 3-point functions of the model. The note ends with a few comments on correlation functions of atypical fields, point-like branes and generalizations to other supergroups.
