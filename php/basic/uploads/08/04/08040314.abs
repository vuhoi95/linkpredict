Title: Towards the Core of the Quantum Monopole
Authors: Anna Campbellova and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We study monopole solutions of the quantum exact low-energy effective N=2 super Yang-Mills theories of Seiberg and Witten. We find a first order differential equation for the spatial dependence of the moduli and show that it can be interpreted as an attractor equation. Numerically integrating this equation, we try to address the question of what happens when one approaches the quantum core of the monopole where the low energy effective theory breaks down or, alternatively, if there are modified monopole solutions that do not have a strongly coupled quantum core so that one may trust the solution not only asymptotically.
