Title: Bloch-Nordsieck Estimates of High-Temperature QED
Authors: H. M. Fried and T. Grandou and Y. -M. Sheu
Abstract: In anticipation of a subsequent application to QCD, we consider the case of QED at high temperature. We introduce a Fradkin representation into the exact, Schwingerian, functional expression of a fermion propagator, as well as a new and relevant version of the Bloch-Nordsieck (BN) model, which extracts the soft contributions of every perturbative graph, in contradistinction to the assumed separation of energy scales of previous semi-perturbative treatments. Our results are applicable to the absorption of a fast particle which enters a heat bath, as well as to the propagation of a symmetric pulse within the thermal medium due to the appearance of an instantaneous, shock-wave-like source acting in the medium. An exponentially-decreasing time dependence of the incident particle's initial momentum combines with a stronger decrease in the particle's energy, estimated by a sum over all Matsubara frequencies, to model an initial "fireball", which subsequently decays in a Gaussian fashion. When extended to QCD, qualitative applications could be made to RHIC scattering, in which a fireball appears, expands and is damped away.
