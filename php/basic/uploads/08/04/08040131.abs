Authors: De-You Chen and Qing-Quan Jiang and Xiao-Tao Zu
Abstract: Hawking radiation from black hole horizon can be viewed as a quantum tunnelling process, and fermions via tunnelling can successfully recover Hawking temperature. In this paper, considering the tunnelling particles with spin 1/2 (namely, Dirac particles), we further improve Kerner and Man's fermion tunnelling method to study Hawking radiation via tunnelling from rotating black holes in de Sitter spaces, specifically including that from Kerr de Sitter black hole and Kerr-Newman de Sitter black hole. As a result, Hawking temperatures at the event horizon (EH) and the cosmological horizon (CH) are well described via Dirac particles tunnelling.
