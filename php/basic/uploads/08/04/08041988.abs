Title: Particle creation in the presence of a warped extra dimension
Authors: Suman Ghosh and Sayan Kar
Abstract: Particle creation in spacetimes with a warped extra dimension is studied. In particular, we investigate the dynamics of a conformally coupled, massless scalar field in a five dimensional warped geometry where the induced metric on the 3--branes is that of a spatially flat cosmological model. We look at situations where the scale of the extra dimension is assumed (i) to be time independent or (ii) to have specific functional forms for time dependence. The warp factor is chosen to be that of the Randall--Sundrum model. With particular choices for the functional form of the scale factor (and also the function characterising the time evolution of the extra dimension) we obtain the ${| \beta_k|}^2$, the particle number and energy densities after solving (wherever possible, analytically but, otherwise, numerically) the conformal scalar field equations. The behaviour of these quantities for the massless and massive Kaluza--Klein modes are examined. Our results show the effect of a warped extra dimension on particle creation and illustrate how the nature of particle production on the brane depends on the nature of warping, type of cosmological evolution as well as the temporal evolution of the extra dimension.
