Title: M-theory, exceptional generalised geometry and superpotentials
Authors: Paulo Pires Pacheco and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We discuss the structure of "exceptional generalised geometry" (EGG), an extension of Hitchin's generalised geometry that provides a unified geometrical description of backgrounds in eleven-dimensional supergravity. On a d-dimensional background, as first described by Hull, the action of the generalised geometrical O(d,d) symmetry group is replaced in EGG by the exceptional U-duality group E_d(d). The metric and form-field degrees of freedom combine into a single geometrical object, so that EGG naturally describes generic backgrounds with flux, and there is an EGG analogue of the Courant bracket which encodes the differential geometry. Our focus is on the case of seven-dimensional backgrounds with N=1 four-dimensional supersymmetry. The corresponding EGG is the generalisation of a G_2-structure manifold. We show it is characterised by an element \phi in a particular orbit of the 912 representation of E_7(7), which defines an SU(7) (subset of E_7(7)) structure. As an application, we derive the generic form of the four-dimensional effective superpotential, and show that it can be written in a universal form, as a homogeneous E_7(7)-invariant functional of \phi.
