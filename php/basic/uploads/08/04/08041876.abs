Title: D-branes and Closed String Field Theory
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Yutaka Baba and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: We construct solitonic states in the OSp invariant string field theory, which are BRST invariant in the leading order of regularization parameter. One can show that these solitonic states describe D-branes and ghost D-branes, by calculating the scattering amplitudes.
