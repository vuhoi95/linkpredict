Title: M5 from M2
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Yutaka Matsuo
Abstract: Recently an action based on Lie 3-algebras was proposed to describe M2-branes. We study the case of infinite dimensional Lie 3-algebras based on the Nambu-Poisson structure of three dimensional manifolds. We show that the model contains self-dual 2-form gauge fields in 6 dimensions, and the result may be interpreted as the M5-brane world-volume action.
