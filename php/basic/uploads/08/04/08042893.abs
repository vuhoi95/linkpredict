Title: Strong coupling for planar ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory: an all-order result
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Paolo Grinza and Marco Rossi
Abstract: We propose a scheme for determining a generalised scaling function, namely the Sudakov factor in a peculiar double scaling limit for high spin and large twist operators belonging to the $sl(2)$ sector of planar ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. In particular, we perform explicitly the all-order computation at strong 't Hooft coupling regarding the first (contribution to the) generalised scaling function. Moreover, we compare our asymptotic results with the numerical solutions finding a very good agreement and evaluate numerically the non-asymptotic contributions. Eventually, we illustrate the agreement and prediction on the string side.
