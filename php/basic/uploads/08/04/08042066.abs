Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum model is studied in 6 dimension with AdS$_4$ or dS$_4$ metric in the physical 4 dimensional space. Two solutions are found, one with induced 5-dimensional gravity terms added to the induced cosmological constant terms. We study the graviton modes in both solutions by transforming the mass eigenvalue equation to a Schrodinger equation with a volcano potential. The spectrum of gravitational excitations depends on the input parameters of the theory, the six dimensional and the effective four-dimensional cosmological constants. The model gives a physically acceptable spectrum if the 4 dimensional cosmological constant is sufficiently small.
