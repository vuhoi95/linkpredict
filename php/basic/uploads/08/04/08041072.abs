Title: Construction of a Wilson action for the Wess-Zumino model
Authors: Hidenori Sonoda and Kayhan Ulker
Abstract: We construct a Wilson action for the Wess-Zumino model by applying the exact renormalization group perturbatively. Using neither superfields nor auxiliary fields, we construct a supersymmetric action only with complex scalar and Majorana spinor fields. We adopt the BRST (antifield) formalism to show the consistency of the construction to all orders in loop expansions. The resulting action has a quadratically divergent scalar mass term which is absent in the superfield formalism.
