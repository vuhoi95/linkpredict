Title: Nilpotent noncommutativity and renormalization
Authors: R. Fresneda and D. M. Gitman and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We analyze renormalizability properties of noncommutative (NC) theories with a bifermionic NC parameter. We introduce a new 4-dimensional scalar field model which is renormalizable at all orders of the loop expansion. We show that this model has an infrared stable fixed point (at the one-loop level). We check that the NC QED (which is one-loop renormalizable with usual NC parameter) remains renormalizable when the NC parameter is bifermionic, at least to the extent of one-loop diagrams with external photon legs. Our general conclusion is that bifermionic noncommutativity improves renormalizablility properties of NC theories.
