Title: The chiral condensate in holographic models of QCD
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and Thomas D. Cohen and Elizabeth S. Werbos
Abstract: Bottom-up holographic models of QCD, inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence, have shown a remarkable degree of phenomenological success. However, they rely on a number of bold assumptions. We investigate the reliability of one of the key assumptions, which involves matching the parameters of these models to QCD at high 4D momentum $q^2$ and renormalization scale $\mu^2$. We show that this leads to phenomenological and theoretical inconsistencies for scale-dependent quantities such as $\bra \bar{q}q\ket$
