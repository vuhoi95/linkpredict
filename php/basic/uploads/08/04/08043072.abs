Title: Generalized kappa-deformed spaces, star-products, and their realizations
Authors: S. Meljanac and S. Kresic-Juric
Abstract: In this work we investigate generalized kappa-deformed spaces. We develop a systematic method for constructing realizations of noncommutative (NC) coordinates as formal power series in the Weyl algebra. All realizations are related by a group of similarity transformations, and to each realization we associate a unique ordering prescription. Generalized derivatives, the Leibniz rule and coproduct, as well as the star-product are found in all realizations. The star-product and Drinfel'd twist operator are given in terms of the coproduct, and the twist operator is derived explicitly in special realizations. The theory is applied to a Nappi-Witten type of NC space.
