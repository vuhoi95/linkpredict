Title: Thermodynamics of noncommutative de Sitter spacetime
Authors: B. Vakili and N. Khosravi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We study the effects of noncommutativity of spacetime geometry on the thermodynamical properties of the de Sitter horizon. We show that noncommutativity results in modifications in temperature, entropy and vacuum energy and that these modifications are of order of the Planck scale, suggesting that the size of the noncommutative parameter should be close to that of the Planck. In an alternative way to deal with noncommutativity, we obtain a quantization rule for the entropy. Since noncommutativity in spacetime geometry modifies the Heisenberg algebra and introduces the general uncertainty principle, we also investigate the above problem in this framework.
