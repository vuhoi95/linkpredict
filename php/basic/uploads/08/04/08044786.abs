Title: Skyrmion Vibration Modes within the Rational Map Ansatz
Authors: W. T. Lin and B. Piette
Abstract: We study the vibration modes of the Skyrme model within the rational map ansatz. We show that the vibrations of the radial profiles and the rational maps are decoupled and we consider explicitly the case B=1, B=2 and B=4. We then compare our results with the vibration modes obtained numerically by Barnes et al. and show that qualitatively the rational map reproduces the vibration modes obtained numerically but that the vibration frequencies of these modes do not match very well.
