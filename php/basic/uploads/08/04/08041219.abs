Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli
Abstract: Using the superspace formulation for the 5D N = 1 Weyl supermultiplet developed in arXiv:0802.3953, we elaborate the concept of conformally flat superspace in five dimensions. For a large family of supersymmetric theories (including sigma-models and Yang-Mills theories) in the conformally flat superspace, we describe an explicit procedure to formulate their dynamics in terms of rigid 4D N = 1 superfields. The case of 5D N = 1 anti-de Sitter superspace is discussed as an example.
