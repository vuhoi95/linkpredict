Title: Hawking radiation and near horizon universality of chiral Virasoro  algebra
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Shailesh Kulkarni
Abstract: We show that the diffeomorphism anomaly together with the trace anomaly reveal a chiral Virasoro algebra near the event horizon of a black hole. This algebra is the same irrespective of whether the anomaly is covariant or consistent, thereby manifesting its universal character and the fact that only the outgoing modes are relevant near the horizon. Our analysis therefore clarifies the role of the trace anomaly in the diffeomorphism anomaly approach \cite{wilczek, isowilczek, shailesh, shailesh2, sunandan, sunandan10, rabin10} to the Hawking radiation.
