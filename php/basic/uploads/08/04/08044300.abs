Title: E8(8) in Light Cone Superspace
Authors: Lars Brink and Sung-Soo Kim and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: We derive the non-linear action of E8(8) on the constrained chiral superfield in the light-cone superspace with eight complex Grassmann variables. We construct (to lowest order in the coupling) the sixteen dynamical supersymmetries which generate a Hamiltonian with E8(8) invariance in three space-time dimensions, and show that it has only interactions with even powers of the coupling constant.
