Title: Sum rules for higher twist sl(2)operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Francesca Catino
Abstract: The spectrum of anomalous dimensions of twist sl(2) operators in N=4 SYM has an intriguing feature in low twist 2 or 3. The anomalous dimension of the lowest state, dual a folded string on AdS_5 X S^5, can be computed by Bethe Ansatz at 3, 4 loops respectively as a simple closed function of the Lorentz spin. This feature is apparently lost at higher twist. We propose sum rules for the excited anomalous dimensions where closed expressions can still be provided, even at higher twist. We present several explicit three loop examples. Many structural regularities can be observed leading to closed expressions which depend parametrically both on the spin and the twist. They allow to compute the subleading term in the logarithmic large spin expansion of the sum rules as a compact simple function of the twist, in analogy with the recent results by Freyhult, Rej and Staudacher in arXiv:0712.2743 [hep-th].
