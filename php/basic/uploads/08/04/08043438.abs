Title: New open string solutions in AdS_5
Authors: R. Ishizeki and M. Kruczenski and A. Tirziu
Abstract: We describe new solutions for open string moving in AdS_5 and ending in the boundary, namely dual to Wilson loops in N=4 SYM theory. First we introduce an ansatz for Euclidean curves whose shape contains an arbitrary function. They are BPS and the dual surfaces can be found exactly. After an inversion they become closed Wilson loops whose expectation value is $W=\exp(-\sqrt{\lambda})$. After that we consider several Wilson loops for N=4 SYM in a pp-wave metric and find the dual surfaces in an AdS_5 pp-wave background. Using the fact that the pp-wave is conformally flat, we apply a conformal transformation to obtain novel surfaces describing strings moving in AdS space in Poincare coordinates and dual to Wilson loops for N=4 SYM in flat space.
