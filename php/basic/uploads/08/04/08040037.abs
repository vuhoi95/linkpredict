Title: Particle Identifications from Symmetries of Braided Ribbon Network  Invariants
Authors: Sundance Bilson-Thompson and Jonathan Hackett and Lou Kauffman and Lee Smolin
Abstract: We develop the idea that the particles of the standard model may arise from excitations of quantum geometry. A previously proposed topological model of preons is developed so that it incorporates an unbounded number of generations. A condition is also found on quantum gravity dynamics necessary for the interactions of the standard model to emerge.
