Title: Mimicking the QCD equation of state with a dual black hole
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Abhinav Nellore
Abstract: We present numerical and analytical studies of the equation of state of translationally invariant black hole solutions to five-dimensional gravity coupled to a single scalar. As an application, we construct a family of black holes that closely mimics the equation of state of quantum chromodynamics at zero chemical potential.
