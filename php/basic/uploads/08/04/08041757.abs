Title: Stable two--brane models with bulk tachyon matter
Authors: A. Das and Sayan Kar and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We explore the possibility of constructing stable, warped two--brane models which solve the hierarchy problem, with a bulk non--canonical scalar field (tachyon matter) as the source term in the action. Among our examples are two models--one with a warp factor (denoted as $e^{-2f(\sigma)}$) which differs from that of the standard Randall--Sundrum by the addition of a quadratic piece in the $f(\sigma)$ and another, where the warping is super-exponential. We investigate the issue of resolution of hierarchy and perform a stability analysis by obtaining the effective inter-brane potentials, in each case. Our analysis reveals that there does exist stable values of the modulus consistent with hierarchy resolution in both the models. Thus, these models, in which the bulk scalar field generates the geometry and also ensures stability, provide viable alternatives to the standard Randall--Sundrum two-brane scenario.
