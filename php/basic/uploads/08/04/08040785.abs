Title: Solutions of the Painleve VI Equation from Reduction of Integrable  Hierarchy in a Grassmannian Approach
Authors: H. Aratyn and J. van de Leur
Abstract: We present an explicit method to perform similarity reduction of a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem for a homogeneous GL (N, C) loop group and use our results to find solutions to the Painleve VI equation for N=3. The tau function of the reduced hierarchy is shown to satisfy the sigma-form of the Painleve VI equation. A class of tau functions of the reduced integrable hierarchy is constructed by means of a Grassmannian formulation. These solutions provide rational solutions of the Painleve VI equation.
