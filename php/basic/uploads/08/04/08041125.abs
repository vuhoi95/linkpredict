Title: N-ification of Forces: A Holographic Perspective on D-brane Model  Building
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We study geometric aspects of extensions of the supersymmetric standard model that exhibit a periodic duality cascade. Via the holographic correspondence, the growth of the gauge group rank towards the UV is interpreted as a gradual decompactification transition. We show that this class of models typically develop a duality wall in the UV, and present an efficient method for estimating the hierarchy between the on-set of the cascade and the formation of the wall. As an illustrative example, we study the model introduced by Cascales, Saad and Uranga in [14], which has an known geometric realization in terms of D-branes on an SPP/Z_3 singularity.
