Title: Quantum enveloping algebras with von Neumann regular Cartan-like  generators and the Pierce decomposition
Authors: Steven Duplij and Sergey Sinel'shchikov
Abstract: Quantum bialgebras derivable from Uq(sl2) which contain idempotents and von Neumann regular Cartan-like generators are introduced and investigated. Various types of antipodes (invertible and von Neumann regular) on these bialgebras are constructed, which leads to a Hopf algebra structure and a von Neumann-Hopf algebra structure, respectively. For them, explicit forms of some particular R-matrices (also, invertible and von Neumann regular) are presented, and the latter respects the Pierce decomposition.
