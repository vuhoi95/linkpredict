Title: Primordial fluctuations and non-Gaussianities in multi-field DBI  inflation
Authors: David Langlois and Sebastien Renaux-Petel and Daniele A. Steer and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We study Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation models with multiple scalar fields. We show that the adiabatic and entropy modes propagate with a common effective sound speed and are thus amplified at the sound horizon crossing. In the small sound speed limit, we find that the amplitude of the entropy modes is much higher than that of the adiabatic modes. We show that this could strongly affect the observable curvature power spectrum as well as the amplitude of non-Gaussianities, although their shape remains as in the single-field DBI case.
