Title: Higher Derivative Correction to the Hawking Flux via Trace Anomaly
Authors: Akihide Shirasaka and Tomoyoshi Hirata
Abstract: In this paper we derive Hawking radiation of black holes with higher derivative corrections by the method of trace anomaly. Firstly we derive Hawking radiation for general spherical black holes. We introduce a modified tortoise coordinate to it and find the analyticity of the coordinate. Secondly we apply its method to a black hole with a higher derivative correction and derive the Hawking radiation of it. We found that as an ordinary case the flux depends only on the surface gravity.
