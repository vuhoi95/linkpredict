Title: Translation-invariant models for non-commutative gauge fields
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Francois Gieres and Erwin Kronberger and Manfred Schweda and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: Motivated by the recent construction of a translation-invariant renormalizable non-commutative model for a scalar field (see arXiv:0802.0791 [math-ph]), we introduce models for non-commutative U(1) gauge fields along the same lines. More precisely, we include some extra terms into the action with the aim of getting rid of the UV/IR mixing.
