Title: Symanzik's Method Applied To The Fractional Quantum Hall Edge States
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Dario Ferraro and Nicola Maggiore and Nicodemo Magnoli and Maura Sassetti
Abstract: In this paper we consider an abelian Chern-Simons theory with plane boundary and we show, following Symankiz's quite general approach, how the known results for edge states in the Laughlin series can be derived in a systematic way by the separability condition. Moreover we show that the conserved boundary currents find a natural and explicit interpretation in terms of the continuity equation and the Tomonaga-Luttinger commutation relation for electronic density is recovered.
