Title: Some spectral equivalences between Schrodinger operators
Authors: C. Dunning and K. E. Hibberd and J. Links
Abstract: Spectral equivalences of the quasi-exactly solvable sectors of two classes of Schrodinger operators are established, using Gaudin-type Bethe ansatz equations. In some instances the results can be extended leading to full isospectrality. In this manner we obtain equivalences between PT-symmetric problems and Hermitian problems. We also find equivalences between some classes of Hermitian operators.
