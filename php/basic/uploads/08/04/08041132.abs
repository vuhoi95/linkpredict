Title: Geometrically Engineerable Chiral Matter in M-Theory
Authors: Jacob L. Bourjaily and Sam Espahbodi
Abstract: We present a classification of the massless chiral matter representations that can arise locally in M-theory on G(2) through geometrically engineered singularities. We will find that several of the more exceptional singularities could have applications for model building.
