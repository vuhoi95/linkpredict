Title: Flavor and CP conserving moduli mediated SUSY breaking in flux  compactification
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Kwang Sik Jeong and Ken-Ichi Okumura
Abstract: In certain class of flux compactification, moduli mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking preserves flavor and CP at leading order in the perturbative expansion controlled by the vacuum expectation value of the messenger modulus. Nevertheless there still might be dangerous flavor or CP violation induced by higher order K\"ahler potential. We examine the constraints on such SUSY breaking scheme imposed by low energy flavor and/or CP violating observables. It is found that all phenomenological constraints can be satisfied even for generic form of higher order K\"ahler potential and sparticle spectra in the sub-TeV range, under plausible assumptions on the size of higher order correction and flavor mixing angles. This implies for instance that mirage mediation scheme of SUSY breaking, which involves such modulus mediation together with an anomaly mediation of comparable size, and also the modulus-dominated mediation realized in flux compactification can be free from the SUSY flavor and CP problems, while giving gaugino and sfermion masses in the sub-TeV range.
