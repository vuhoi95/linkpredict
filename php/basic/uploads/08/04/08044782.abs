Abstract: The conditions for the cancellation of one loop contributions to vacuum energy (both U.V. divergent and finite) coming from the Standard Model (SM) fields are examined. It is proven that this is not possible unless one introduces besides several bosons, at least one massive fermion having mass within specific ranges. On examining one of the simplest SM extensions satisfying the constraints one finds that the mass range of the lightest massive boson is compatible with the present Higgs mass bounds. We do not consider effects associated with condensates or renormalization group running.
