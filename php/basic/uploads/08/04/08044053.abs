Title: Gravity duals for non-relativistic CFTs
Authors: Koushik Balasubramanian and John McGreevy
Abstract: We attempt to generalize the AdS/CFT correspondence to non-relativistic conformal field theories which are invariant under Galilean transformations. Such systems govern ultracold atoms at unitarity, nucleon scattering in some channels, and more generally, a family of universality classes of quantum critical behavior. We construct a family of metrics which realize these symmetries as isometries. They are solutions of gravity with negative cosmological constant coupled to pressureless dust. We discuss realizations of the dust, which include a bulk superconductor. We develop the holographic dictionary and compute some two-point correlators. A strange aspect of the correspondence is that the bulk geometry has two extra noncompact dimensions.
