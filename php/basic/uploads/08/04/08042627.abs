Title: Higher-spin dynamics and Chern-Simons theories
Authors: Johan Engquist and Olaf Hohm
Abstract: We review the construction of consistent higher-spin theories based on Chern-Simons actions. To this end we first introduce the required higher-spin algebras and discuss curvature and torsion tensors in an unconstrained way. Finally we perform a perturbative analysis of the Chern-Simons theory in D=5 for a non-maximally symmetric AdS(4) background and obtain the required four-dimensional Fronsdal equations in the compensator formulation.
