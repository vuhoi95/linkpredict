Title: Symmetry-breaking vacua and baryon condensates in AdS/CFT
Authors: Dario Martelli and James Sparks
Abstract: We study the gravity duals of symmetry-breaking deformations of superconformal field theories, AdS/CFT dual to Type IIB string theory on AdS_5 x Y where Y is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. In these vacua both conformal invariance and baryonic symmetries are spontaneously broken. We present a detailed discussion of the supergravity moduli space, which involves flat form fields on asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau manifolds, and match this to the gauge theory vacuum moduli space. We discuss certain linearised fluctuations of the moduli, identifying the Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneous breaking of non-anomalous baryonic symmetries. The remaining moduli fields are related to spontaneous breaking of anomalous baryonic symmetries. We also elaborate on the proposal that computing condensates of baryon operators is equivalent to computing the partition function of a non-compact Euclidean D3-brane in the background supergravity solution, with fixed boundary conditions at infinity.
