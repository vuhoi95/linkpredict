Title: E2 Instanton Effects and Higgs Physics In Intersecting Brane Models
Authors: Mingxing Luo and Sibo Zheng
Abstract: String instanton effects in Higgs physics are discussed through a type IIA model based on T^{6}/(Z^{2}\times Z^{'2}) orentifold compactifaction. By inclusion of rigid E2-branes, the model exhibits a MSSM-like spectrum, as well as extra mu and quartic Higgs couplings. These extra couplings are induced via E2 instantons non-perturbatively. Setting the string scale at 10^{18} GeV, one gets interesting TeV Higgs physics. In particlular, the tree-level Higgs mass can be uplifted substantially.
