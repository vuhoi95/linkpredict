Title: Analytical Characterization of Oscillon Energy and Lifetime
Authors: Marcelo Gleiser and David Sicilia
Abstract: We develop an analytical procedure to compute all relevant physical properties of scalar field oscillons in models with quartic polynomial potentials: energy, radius, frequency, core-amplitude, and lifetime. We compare our predictions to numerical simulations of models with symmetric and asymmetric double well potentials in three spatial dimensions, obtaining excellent agreement. We also explain why oscillons have not been seen to decay in two spatial dimensions.
