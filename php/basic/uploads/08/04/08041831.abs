Title: Kappa symmetric OSp(2|2) WZNW model
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Yoji Michishita
Abstract: We construct a kappa symmetric WZNW model for the OSp(2|2) supergroup, whose bosonic part is AdS3xS1 space. The field equation gives the chiral current conservation and the right/left factorization is shown after the kappa symmetry is fixed. The right-moving modes contain both bosons and fermions while the left-moving modes contain only bosons.
