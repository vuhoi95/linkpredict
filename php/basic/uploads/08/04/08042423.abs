Title: Quark Soup al dente: Applied Superstring Theory
Authors: R. C. Myers and S. E. Vazquez
Abstract: We discuss the application of the AdS/CFT correspondence to possibly gain new physical insights for the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma. This article provides an informal summary of a talk given by RCM at the 18th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation in July 2007.
