Title: Matrix Theory of Type IIB Plane Wave from Membranes
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Amir Jafari Salim and Filippo Passerini
Abstract: We write down a maximally supersymmetric one parameter deformation of the field theory action of Bagger and Lambert. We show that this theory on RxT^2 is invariant under the superalgebra of the maximally supersymmetric Type IIB plane wave. It is argued that this theory holographically describes the Type IIB plane wave in the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ).
