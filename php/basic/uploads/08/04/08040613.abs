Title: Type IIB Flux Vacua from the String Worldsheet
Authors: William D. Linch III and Jock McOrist and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: We study type IIB string compactifications in the presence of RR and NSNS fluxes using worldsheet techniques. Vertex operators corresponding to internal RR and NSNS fluxes are constructed in the hybrid formalism with manifest target space supersymmetry. In a simple class of examples, we compute various known physical phenomena such as warping and the generation of a superpotential for complex structure moduli. The results are in precise agreement with the supergravity literature.
