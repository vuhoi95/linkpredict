Title: Systematics of linearization of N = 2 nonlinear SUSY in superfield  formulation
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: The relation between a N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetric (SUSY) model and a linear SUSY (free) theory for $N = 2$ vector supermultiplet accompanying the spontaneous SUSY breaking is systematically worked out in two-dimensional superfield formulation.
