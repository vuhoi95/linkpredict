Title: Wigner Oscillators, Twisted Hopf Algebras and Second Quantization
Authors: P. G. Castro and B. Chakraborty and F. Toppan
Abstract: By correctly identifying the role of central extension in the centrally extended Heisenberg algebra h, we show that it is indeed possible to construct a Hopf algebraic structure on the corresponding enveloping algebra U(h) and eventually deform it through Drinfeld twist. This Hopf algebraic structure and its deformed version U^F(h) are shown to be induced from a more fundamental Hopf algebra obtained from the Schroedinger field/oscillator algebra and its deformed version, provided that the fields/oscillators are regarded as odd-elements of the super-algebra osp(1|2n). We also discuss the possible implications in the context of quantum statistics.
