Title: Modular differential equations and null vectors
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Christoph A. Keller
Abstract: We show that every modular differential equation of a rational conformal field theory comes from a null vector in the vacuum Verma module. We also comment on the implications of this result for the consistency of the extremal self-dual conformal field theories at c=24 k.
