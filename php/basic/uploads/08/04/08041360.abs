Title: Brownian Motion in Robertson-Walker Space-Times from electromagnetic  Vacuum Fluctuations
Authors: Carlos H. G. Bessa and Valdir B. Bezerra and L. H. Ford
Abstract: We consider classical particles coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field in the background of a spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe. We find that these particles typically undergo Brownian motion and acquire a non-zero mean squared velocity which depends upon the scale factor of the universe. This Brownian motion can be interpreted as due to non-cancellation of anti-correlated vacuum fluctuations in the time dependent background space-time. We consider several types of coupling to the electromagnetic field, including particles with net electric charge, a magnetic dipole moment, and electric polarizability. We also investigate several different model scale factors.
