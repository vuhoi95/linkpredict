Title: Multiple M2-branes and the Embedding Tensor
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Mees de Roo and Olaf Hohm
Abstract: We show that the Bagger-Lambert theory of multiple M2-branes fits into the general construction of maximally supersymmetric gauge theories using the embedding tensor technique. We apply the embedding tensor technique in order to systematically obtain the consistent gaugings of N=8 superconformal theories in 2+1 dimensions. This leads to the Bagger-Lambert theory, with the embedding tensor playing the role of the four-index antisymmetric tensor defining a ``3-algebra''. We present an alternative formulation of the theory in which the embedding tensor is replaced by a set of unrestricted scalar fields. By taking these scalar fields to be parity-odd, the Chern-Simons term can be made parity-invariant.
