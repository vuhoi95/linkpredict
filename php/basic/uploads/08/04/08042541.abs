Title: Phase space quantization and Loop Quantum Cosmology: A Wigner function  for the Bohr-compactified real line
Authors: Christopher J. Fewster and Hanno Sahlmann
Abstract: We give a definition for the Wigner function for quantum mechanics on the Bohr compactification of the real line and prove a number of simple consequences of this definition. We then discuss how this formalism can be applied to loop quantum cosmology. As an example, we use the Wigner function to give a new quantization of an important building block of the Hamiltonian constraint.
