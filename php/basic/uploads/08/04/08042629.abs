Title: On gauge/string correspondence and mirror symmetry
Authors: Giulio Bonelli and Houman Safaai
Abstract: We consider a mirror dual of the Berkovits-Vafa A-model for the BPS superstring on $AdS_5\times S^5$ in the form of a deformed superconifold. Via geometric transition, the theory has a dual description as the hermitian gaussian one-matrix model. We show that the A-model amplitudes of generic $AdS_2\times S^4$ branes, breaking the superconformal symmetry as $U(2,2|4)\to OSp(4^*|4)$, are evaluated in terms of observables in the matrix model. As such, upon the usual identification $g_{YM}^2=g_s$, these can be expanded as Drukker-Gross circular 1/2-BPS Wilson loops in the perturbative regime of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM.
