Title: Jets in strongly-coupled N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Kristan Jensen and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We study jets of massless particles in N=4 super Yang-Mills using the AdS/CFT correspondence both at zero and finite temperature. We set up an initial state corresponding to a highly energetic quark/anti-quark pair and follow its time evolution into two jets. At finite temperature the jets stop after traveling a finite distance, whereas at zero temperature they travel and spread forever. We map out the corresponding baryon number charge density and identify the generic late time behavior of the jets as well as features that depend crucially on the initial conditions.
