Title: Twisted Poincare Invariance, Noncommutative Gauge Theories and UV-IR  Mixing
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and A. Pinzul and A. R. Queiroz
Abstract: In the absence of gauge fields, quantum field theories on the Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane are invariant under a twisted action of the Poincare group if they are formulated following [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In that formulation, such theories also have no UV-IR mixing [7]. Here we investigate UV-IR mixing in gauge theories with matter following the approach of [3, 4]. We prove that there is UV-IR mixing in the one-loop diagram of the S-matrix involving a coupling between gauge and matter fields on the GM plane, the gauge field being nonabelian. There is no UV-IR mixing if it is abelian.
