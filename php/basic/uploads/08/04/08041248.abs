Title: WEAKLY-coupled IIA Flux Compactifications
Authors: Eran Palti and Gianmassimo Tasinato and John Ward
Abstract: We study compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau manifolds that are mirror to a subset of the type IIB LARGE-volume models. A combination of flux, alpha' corrections and non-perturbative effects stabilises the moduli in a non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum. This vacuum has the feature that the (ten-dimensional) string coupling is exponentially small which can naturally lead to a TeV supersymmetry breaking scale with an intermediate string scale. The AdS vacuum can be uplifted to a dS one through the introduction of D6 branes, and complex-structure modular inflation can be realised.
