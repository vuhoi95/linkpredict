Title: Production of Spin-Two Gauge Bosons
Authors: Spyros Konitopoulos and George Savvidy
Abstract: We considered spin-two gauge boson production in the fermion pair annihilation process and calculated the polarized cross sections for each set of helicity orientations of initial and final particles. The angular dependence of these cross sections is compared with the similar annihilation cross sections in QED with two photons in the final state, with two gluons in QCD and W-pair in Electroweak theory.
