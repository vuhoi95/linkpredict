Title: Tachyon Vacuum Solution in Open String Field Theory with Constant B  Field
Authors: Akira Ishida and Chanju Kim and Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: We show that Schnabl's tachyon vacuum solution is an exact solution of the equation of motion of Witten's open bosonic string field theory in the background of constant antisymmetric two-form field. The action computed at the vacuum solution is given by the Dirac-Born-Infeld factor multiplied to that without the antisymmetric tensor field.
