Title: CMB polarization induced by stochastic magnetic fields
Authors: Massimo Giovannini and Kerstin E. Kunze
Abstract: The complete calculation of the CMB polarization observables (i.e. E- and B-modes) is reported within the conventional $\Lambda$CDM paradigm supplemented by a stochastic magnetic field. Intriguing perspectives for present and forthcoming CMB polarization experiments are outlined.
