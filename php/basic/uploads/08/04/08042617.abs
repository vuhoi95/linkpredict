Title: Type I background fields in terms of type IIB ones
Authors: B. Nikolic and B. Sazdovic
Abstract: We choose such boundary conditions for open IIB superstring theory which preserve N=1 SUSY. The explicite solution of the boundary conditions yields effective theory which is symmetric under world-sheet parity transformation $\Omega:\sigma\to-\sigma$. We recognize effective theory as closed type I superstring theory. Its background fields,beside known $\Omega$ even fields of the initial IIB theory, contain improvements quadratic in $\Omega$ odd ones.
