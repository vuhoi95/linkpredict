Title: Hawking radiation, W-infinity algebra and trace anomalies
Authors: L. Bonora and M. Cvitan
Abstract: We apply the "trace anomaly method" to the calculation of moments of the Hawking radiation of a Schwarzschild black hole. We show that they can be explained as the fluxes of chiral currents forming a W-infinity algebra. Then we construct the covariant version of these currents and verify that up to order 6 they are not affected by any trace anomaly. Using cohomological methods we show that actually, for the fourth order current, no trace anomalies can exist. The results reported here are strictly valid in two dimensions.
