Title: High Temperature Superconductivity and Effective Gravity
Authors: Djordje Minic and Jean J. Heremans
Abstract: We argue that an approach involving effective gravity could play a crucial role in elucidating the properties of the high temperature superconducting materials. In particular we propose that the high critical temperature might be naturally explained in a framework constructed as a direct condensed matter analog of the Randall-Sundrum approach to a geometrization of the hierarchy problem in high-energy physics.
