Title: Critical magnetic field in AdS/CFT superconductor
Authors: Eiji Nakano and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We have studied a holographically dual description of superconductor in (2+1)-dimensions in the presence of applied magnetic field, and observed that there exists a critical value of magnetic field, below which a charged condensate can form via a second order phase transition.
