Title: Holographic Monopole Catalysis of Baryon Decay
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Ki-Myeong Lee and Cheonsoo Park and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study how monopole catalysis of baryon decay is realized in holographic QCD. Physics of monopole catalysis becomes much simpler in holographic description as it occurs due to the violation of the Bianchi identity for the 5D gauge symmetry when magnetic monopole is present. In holographic QCD we find a unified picture of the baryon number violation under magnetic monopole or electroweak sphaleron, giving a new mechanism of baryon number violation. We also embed our set-up in the string theory model by Sakai and Sugimoto.
