Title: Dyonic Instantons in 5-dim Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Theories
Authors: Seok Kim and Ki-Myeong Lee and Sungjay Lee
Abstract: We consider the BPS dyonic instantons in the 5-dim supersymmetric Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theories. Its field theoretic structures and the moduli space dynamics in term of the ADHM data have been explored in detail. We find that the field theoretic Chern-Simons term leads to an effective magnetic field on instanton moduli space.
