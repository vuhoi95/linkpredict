Title: Noncommutative space and the low-energy physics of quasicrystals
Authors: L. Monreal and P. Fernandez de Cordoba and A. Ferrando and J. M. Isidro
Abstract: We prove that the effective low-energy, nonlinear Schroedinger equation for a particle in the presence of a quasiperiodic potential is the potential-free, nonlinear Schroedinger equation on noncommutative space. Thus quasiperiodicity of the potential can be traded for space noncommutativity when describing the envelope wave of the initial quasiperiodic wave.
