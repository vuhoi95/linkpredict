Title: From Rindler space to the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor of a  Casimir apparatus in a weak gravitational field
Authors: Giuseppe Bimonte and Giampiero Esposito and Luigi Rosa
Abstract: This paper studies two perfectly conducting parallel plates in the weak gravitational field on the surface of the Earth. Since the appropriate line element, to first order in the constant gravity acceleration g, is precisely of the Rindler type, we can exploit the formalism for studying Feynman Green functions in Rindler spacetime. Our analysis does not reduce the electromagnetic potential to the transverse part before quantization. It is instead fully covariant and well suited for obtaining all components of the regularized and renormalized energy-momentum tensor to arbitrary order in the gravity acceleration g. The general structure of the calculation is therefore elucidated, and the components of the Maxwell energy-momentum tensor are evaluated up to second order in g, improving a previous analysis by the authors and correcting their old first-order formula for the Casimir energy.
