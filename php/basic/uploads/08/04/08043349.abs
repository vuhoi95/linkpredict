Title: M-theory on pp-waves with a holomorphic superpotential and its membrane  and matrix descriptions
Authors: Jongwook Kim and Nakwoo Kim and Jeong-Hyuck Park and Jan Plefka
Abstract: We study a new class of inhomogeneous pp-wave solutions with 8 unbroken supersymmetries in D=11 supergravity. The 9 dimensional transverse space is Euclidean and split into 3 and 6 dimensional subspaces. The solutions have non-constant gauge flux, which are described in terms of an arbitrary holomorphic function of the complexified 6 dimensional space. The supermembrane and matrix theory descriptions are also provided and we identify the relevant supersymmetry transformation rules. The action also arises through a dimensional reduction of N=1, D=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled to 3 gauge adjoint and chiral multiplets, whose interactions are determined by the holomorphic function of the supergravity solution now constituting the superpotential.
