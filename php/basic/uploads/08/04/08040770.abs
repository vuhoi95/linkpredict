Title: Finite Temperature Behaviour of O'KKLT Model
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Vincenzo Calo
Abstract: We summarize our work on the O'Raifeartaigh uplifted KKLT model at finite temperature. We study the system for parameter values for which the zero temperature potential for the volume modulus has a dS minimum. The temperature-dependent part of the effective potential has a runaway behaviour for one exponent in the superpotential, whereas it can have local minima at finite field vevs for two exponents in the superpotential. However, it turns out that, despite the presence of those minima, the zero temperature dS vacuum is not destabilized by thermal corrections within the whole range of validity of our approximations.
