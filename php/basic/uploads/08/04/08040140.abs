Title: Upper bound on the cutoff in lattice Electroweak theory
Authors: A. I. Veselov and M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: We investigate numerically lattice Weinberg - Salam model without fermions for realistic values of the fine structure constant and the Weinberg angle. We also analyze the data of the previous numerical investigations of lattice Electroweak theory. We have found that moving along the line of constant physics when the lattice spacing $a$ is decreased, one should leave the physical Higgs phase of the theory at a certain value of $a$. Our estimate of the minimal value of the lattice spacing is $a_c = [430\pm 40 {\rm Gev}]^{-1}$.
