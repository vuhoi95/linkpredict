Abstract: We consider classes of translationally invariant black hole solutions whose equations of state closely resemble that of QCD at zero chemical potential. We use these backgrounds to compute the ratio zeta/s of bulk viscosity to entropy density. For a class of black holes that exhibits a first order transition, we observe a sharp rise in zeta/s near T_c. For constructions that exhibit a smooth cross-over, like QCD does, the rise in zeta/s is more modest. We conjecture that divergences in zeta/s for black hole horizons are related to extrema of the entropy density as a function of temperature.
