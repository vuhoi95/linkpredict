Title: Instantons and the 5D U(1) gauge theory with extra adjoint
Authors: Rubik Poghossian and Marine Samsonyan
Abstract: In this paper we compute the partition function of 5D supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory with extra adjoint matter in general $\Omega$-background. It is well known that such partition functions encode very rich topological information. We show in particular that unlike the case with no extra matter, the partition function with extra adjoint at some special values of the parameters directly reproduces the generating function for the Poincare polynomial of the moduli space of instantons. Comparing our results with those recently obtained by Iqbal et. al., who used the refined topological vertex method, we present our comments on apparent discrepancies.
