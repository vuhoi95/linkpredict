Title: Decaying D-branes and Moving Mirrors
Authors: Tomoyoshi Hirata and Shinji Mukohyama and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We present an exact time-dependent solution to the effective D-brane world-volume theory which describes an inhomogeneous decay of a brane-antibrane system. We compute the quantum energy flux induced by the particle creation in this inhomogeneous and time-dependent background. We find that this calculation is essentially equivalent to that of the moving mirror system. In the initial stage, the energy flux turns out to be thermal with the temperature given by the inverse of the distance between the brane and the antibrane. Later it changes its sign and becomes a negative energy flux. Our result may be relevant for the (p)reheating process or/and the evolution of cosmic string network after stringy brane inflation.
