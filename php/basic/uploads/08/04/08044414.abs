Title: Schnabl's Solution and Boundary States in Open String Field Theory
Authors: Teruhiko Kawano and Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We discuss that Schnabl's solution is an off-shell extension of the boundary state describing a D-brane in the closed string sector. It gives the physical meaning of the gauge invariant overlaps for the solution in our previous paper and supports Ellwood's recent proposal in the operator formalism.
