Title: The Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra for open strings attached to giant  gravitons
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Rafael Nepomechie
Abstract: We extend the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra for the superstring sigma model on $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$, which was formulated by Arutyunov, Frolov and Zamaklar, to the case of open strings attached to maximal giant gravitons, which was recently considered by Hofman and Maldacena. We obtain boundary $S$-matrices which satisfy the standard boundary Yang-Baxter equation.
