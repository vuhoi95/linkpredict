Title: Gravity Cutoff in Theories with Large Discrete Symmetries
Authors: Gia Dvali and Michele Redi and Sergey Sibiryakov and Arkady Vainshtein
Abstract: We set an upper bound on the gravitational cutoff in theories with exact quantum numbers of large N periodicity, such as Z_N discrete symmetries. The bound stems from black hole physics. It is similar to the bound appearing in theories with N particle species, though a priori, a large discrete symmetry does not imply a large number of species. Thus, there emerges a potentially wide class of new theories, that address the hierarchy problem by lowering the gravitational cutoff due to existence of large Z_{10^32}-type symmetries.
