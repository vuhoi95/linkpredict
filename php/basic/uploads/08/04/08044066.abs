Authors: Stefan Hohenegger and Christoph A. Keller and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: We discuss the AdS_3/CFT_2 duality of a heterotic three-charge model with (0,4) target space supersymmetry. The worldsheet theory for heterotic strings on the AdS_3 x S^3/Z_N x T^4 near-horizon geometry was constructed by Kutasov, Larsen and Leigh in [hep-th/9812027]. We propose that the dual conformal field theory is given by a two-dimensional (0,4) sigma model arising on the Higgs branch of an orbifolded ADHM model. As a non-trivial consistency check of the correspondence, we find that the left- and right-moving central charges of the infrared conformal field theory agree with those predicted by the worldsheet model. Moreover, using the entropy function formalism, we show that to next-to-leading order the central charge can also be obtained from an alpha'-corrected supergravity theory.
