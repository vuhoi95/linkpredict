Title: Gaugino Condensation with a Doubly Suppressed Gravitino Mass
Authors: Valeri Lowen and Hans Peter Nilles and Andrea Zanzi
Abstract: Supersymmetry breakdown via gaugino condensation in heterotic string theory can lead to models with a doubly suppressed gravitino mass. A TeV scale gravitino can emerge from a condensate as large as the grand unified scale. We analyze the properties of these models and discuss applications for particle physics and cosmology.
