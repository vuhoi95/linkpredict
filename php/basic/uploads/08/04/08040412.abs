Title: Solitons and AdS String Solutions
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin
Abstract: In this contribution we describe some soliton based techniques for generating classical AdS string solutions. The methods introduced are useful for further understanding of rotating AdS configurations with spikes which correspond to higher twist operators in SYM theory. The main identification (accomplished in arXiv:0712.1193) between solitons and string spikes is reviewed and extended. We describe how inverse scattering technique can be applied for reconstructing AdS string configurations from soliton solutions of sinh-Gordon theory (in the example of ${\rm AdS}_3$).
