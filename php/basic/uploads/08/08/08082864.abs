Title: Bound States in Gapped Graphene with Impurities : Effective Low-Energy  Description of Short-Range Interactions
Authors: Kumar S. Gupta and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: We obtain a novel bound state spectrum of the low energy excitations near the Fermi points of graphene in the presence of a charge impurity. The effects of possible short range interactions induced by the impurity are modelled by suitable boundary conditions. The spectrum in the subcritical region of the effective Coulomb coupling is labelled by a parameter which characterizes the boundary conditions and determines the inequivalent quantizations of the system. In the supercritical region we obtain a renormalization group flow for the effective Coulomb coupling.
