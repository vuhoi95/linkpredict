Title: Consistent boundary conditions for cosmological topologically massive  gravity at the chiral point
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Niklas Johansson
Abstract: We show that cosmological topologically massive gravity at the chiral point allows not only Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions as consistent boundary conditions, but slightly more general ones which encompass the logarithmic primary found in 0805.2610 as well as all its descendants.
