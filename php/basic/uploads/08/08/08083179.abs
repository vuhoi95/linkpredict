Title: Possible Detection of Causality Violation in a Non-local Scalar Model
Authors: Asrarul Haque and Satish D. Joglekar
Abstract: We consider the possibility that there may be causality violation detectable at higher energies. We take a scalar nonlocal theory containing a mass scale $\Lambda$ as a model example and make a preliminary study of how the causality violation can be observed. We show how to formulate an observable whose detection would signal causality violation. We study the range of energies (relative to $\Lambda$) and couplings to which the observable can be used.
