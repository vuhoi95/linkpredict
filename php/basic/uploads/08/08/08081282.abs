Title: Superstrings on AdS_4 x CP^3 from Supergravity
Authors: Riccardo D'Auria and Pietro Fre' and Pietro Antonio Grassi and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We derive from a general formulation of pure spinor string theory on type IIA backgrounds the specific form of the action for the AdS_4 x P^3 background. We provide a complete geometrical characterization of the structure of the superfields involved in the action.
