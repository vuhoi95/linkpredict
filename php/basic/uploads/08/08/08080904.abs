Title: Notes on toric Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds and AdS_4/CFT_3
Authors: Dario Martelli and James Sparks
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of two infinite families Y^{p,k} of Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds, that are expected to be AdS_4/CFT_3 dual to families of N=2 superconformal field theories in three dimensions. These manifolds, labelled by two positive integers p and k, are Lens space bundles S^3/Z_p over CP^2 and CP^1 x CP^1, respectively. The corresponding Calabi-Yau cones are toric. We present their toric diagrams and gauged linear sigma model charges in terms of p and k, and find that the Y^{p,k} manifolds interpolate between certain orbifolds of the homogeneous spaces S^7, M^{3,2} and Q^{1,1,1}.
