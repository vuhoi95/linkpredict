Title: Condensate induced transitions between topologically ordered phases
Authors: F. A. Bais and J. K. Slingerland
Abstract: We investigate transitions between topologically ordered phases in two spatial dimensions induced by the condensation of a bosonic quasiparticle. To this end, we formulate an extension of the theory of symmetry breaking phase transitions which applies to phases with topological excitations described by quantum groups or modular tensor categories. This enables us to deal with phases whose quasiparticles have non-integer quantum dimensions and obey braid statistics. Many examples of such phases can be constructed from two-dimensional rational conformal field theories and we find that there is a beautiful connection between quantum group symmetry breaking and certain well-known constructions in conformal field theory, notably the coset construction, the construction of orbifold models and more general conformal extensions. Besides the general framework, many representative examples are worked out in detail.
