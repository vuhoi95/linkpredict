Title: Moduli spaces of Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories and AdS_4/CFT_3
Authors: Dario Martelli and James Sparks
Abstract: We analyse the classical moduli spaces of supersymmetric vacua of 3d N=2 Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories. We show quite generally that the moduli space of the 3d theory always contains a baryonic branch of a parent 4d N=1 quiver gauge theory, where the 4d baryonic branch is determined by the vector of 3d Chern-Simons levels. In particular, starting with a 4d quiver theory dual to a 3-fold singularity, for certain general choices of Chern-Simons levels this branch of the moduli space of the corresponding 3d theory is a 4-fold singularity. Our results lead to a simple general method, using existing 4d techniques, for constructing candidate 3d N=2 superconformal Chern-Simons quivers with AdS_4 gravity duals. As simple, but non-trivial, examples, we identify a family of Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories which are candidate AdS_4/CFT_3 duals to an infinite class of toric Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds with explicit metrics.
