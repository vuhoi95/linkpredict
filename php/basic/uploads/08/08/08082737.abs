Title: On free fermions and plane partitions
Authors: O Foda and M Wheeler and M Zuparic
Abstract: We use free fermion methods to re-derive a result of Okounkov and Reshetikhin relating charged fermions to random plane partitions, and to extend it to relate neutral fermions to strict plane partitions.
