Title: Gravitational catalysis of chiral and color symmetry breaking of quark  matter in hyperbolic space
Authors: D. Ebert and A. V. Tyukov and V. Ch. Zhukovsky
Abstract: We study the dynamical breaking of chiral and color symmetries of dense quark matter in the ultrastatic hyperbolic spacetime $R\otimes H^3$ in the framework of an extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. On the basis of analytical expressions for chiral and color condensates as functions of curvature and temperature, the phenomenon of dimensional reduction and gravitational catalysis of symmetry breaking in strong gravitational field is demonstrated in the regime of weak coupling constants. In the case of strong couplings it is shown that curvature leads to small corrections to the flat-space values of condensate and thus enhances the symmetry breaking effects. Finally, using numerical calculations phase transitions under the influence of chemical potential and negative curvature are considered and the phase portrait of the system is constructed.
