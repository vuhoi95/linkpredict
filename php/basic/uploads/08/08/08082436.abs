Title: Resolving temporal Gribov copies in Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Hugo Reinhardt and Peter Watson
Abstract: The continuum Yang-Mills functional integral within the first order formalism and in Coulomb gauge is studied. In particular, the temporal zero-modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator are explicitly accounted for. It is shown that the treatment of these zero-modes results in the constraint that the total color charge of the system vanishes at all times. Further, it is argued that the functional integral is effectively fully gauge-fixed once Gauss' law has been resolved in Coulomb gauge.
