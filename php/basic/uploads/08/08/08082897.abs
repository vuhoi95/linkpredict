Title: Induced electromagnetic fields in non-linear QED
Authors: C. A. Dominguez and H. Falomir and M. Ipinza and M. Loewe and J. C. Rojas
Abstract: The Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian is used to obtain general expressions for electric and magnetic fields induced by non-linearity, to leading order in the non-linear expansion parameter, and for quasistatic situations. These expressions are then used to compute the induced electromagnetic fields due to a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution on the surface, in the presence of an external constant magnetic field. The induced electric field contains several multipole terms with unusual angular dependences. Most importantly, the leading term of the induced magnetic field is due to an induced magnetic dipole moment.
