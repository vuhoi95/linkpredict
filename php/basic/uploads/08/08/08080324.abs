Title: Thermodynamics on Noncommutative Geometry in Coherent State Formalism
Authors: Wung-Hong Huang and Kuo-Wei Huang
Abstract: The thermodynamics of ideal gas on the noncommutative geometry in the coherent state formalism is investigated. We first evaluate the statistical interparticle potential and see that there are residual "attraction (repulsion) potential" between boson (fermion) in the high temperature limit. The characters could be traced to the fact that, the particle with mass $m$ in noncommutative thermal geometry with noncommutativity $\theta$ and temperature $T$ will correspond to that in the commutative background with temperature $T(1+kTm\theta)^{-1}$. Such a correspondence implies that the ideal gas energy will asymptotically approach to a finite limiting value as that on commutative geometry at $T_\theta= (km\theta)^{-1}$. We also investigate the squeezed coherent states and see that they could have arbitrary mean energy. The thermal properties of those systems are calculated and compared to each other. We find that the heat capacity of the squeezed coherent states of boson and fermion on the noncommutative geometry have different values, contrast to that on the commutative geometry.
