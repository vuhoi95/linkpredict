Title: Fermion Families from Two Layer Warped Extra Dimensions
Authors: Zhi-qiang Guo and Bo-Qiang Ma
Abstract: In extra dimensions, the quark and lepton mass hierarchy can be reproduced from the same order bulk mass parameters, and standard model fermion families can be generated from one generation in the high dimensional space. We try to explain the origin of the same order bulk mass parameters and address the family replication puzzle simultaneously. We show that they correlate with each other. We construct models that families are generated from extra dimensional space, and in the meantime the bulk mass parameters of same order emerge naturally. The interesting point is that the bulk mass parameters, which are in same order, correspond to the eigenvalues of a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation. We also discuss the problem existing in this approach.
