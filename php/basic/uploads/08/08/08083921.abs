Title: On the Microscopic Perspective of Black Branes Thermodynamic Geometry
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Bhupendra Nath Tiwari
Abstract: In this article we study correspondence between the microscopic spectrum and macroscopic properties of a class of extremal and non-extremal black branes and outline an origin of the interactions among various microstates of a given black brane configuration from the perspective of an intrinsic Riemannian geometry arising from the coarse graining entropy over a large number of microstates. We have analyzed the state-space geometry in the case of various extremal and non-extremal black branes arising from the string theories, multi-centered black brane configurations, small black holes with fractional branes, fuzzy rings in the set up of Mathur's fuzzballs and subensemble theory, as well as that the black brane foams from the considerations of bubbling black brane solutions in the M-theory. We have further shown that there exists a clear mechanism on the black brane side that describes the notion of associated interactions in the state-space or vice-versa. We thus find that in all such cases there are no singularities in the state-space manifold of these black brane configurations. This observation is in turn consistent with the existing picture of corresponding microscopic CFT data.
