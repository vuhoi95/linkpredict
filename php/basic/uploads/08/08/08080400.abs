Title: The non-anticommutative supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and R. Purdy
Abstract: We discuss the non-anticommutative (N=1/2) supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model in four dimensions. Firstly we introduce differential operators which implement the non-anticommutative supersymmetry algebra acting on the component fields and action. Then we perform the renormalisation of the model up to two-loop order, including the complete set of terms necessary for renormalisability. We show that (at least up to this order) the results obtained when we eliminate the auxiliary field after renormalisation are equivalent to those obtained when we eliminate the auxiliary fields before quantisation.
