Title: Twisted Covariant Noncommutative Self-dual Gravity
Authors: S. Estrada-Jimenez and H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez
Abstract: A twisted covariant formulation of noncommutative self-dual gravity is presented. The formulation for constructing twisted noncommutative Yang-Mills theories is used. It is shown that the noncommutative torsion is solved at any order of the $\theta$-expansion in terms of the tetrad and some extra fields of the theory. In the process the first order expansion in $\theta$ for the Pleba\'nski action is explicitly obtained.
