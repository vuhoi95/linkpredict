Title: Dual mapping between the antisymmetric tensor matter field and the  Kalb-Ramond field
Authors: L. Gonzaga Filho and M. S. Cunha and R. R. Landim
Abstract: In this work we present a dual mapping between the Kalb-Ramond and antisymmetric tensor matter (ATM) field actions. Our procedure shows that the correlation functions associated with both the Noether current and the topological current are equivalent.
