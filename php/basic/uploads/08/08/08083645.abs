Title: Geometric cross sections of rotating strings and black holes
Authors: Toshihiro Matsuo and Kin-ya Oda
Abstract: We study the production cross section of a highly excited string with fixed angular momentum from an ultra-high energy collision of two light strings. We find that the cross section exhibits geometric behavior in a certain region of angular-momentum/impact-parameter space. This geometric behavior is common to the differential cross sections of a black hole production with fixed angular momentum and thus we see another correspondence between strings and black holes.
