Title: Homotopy, monopoles and 't Hooft tensor for generic gauuge groups
Authors: A. Di Giacomo and L. Lepori and F. Pucci
Abstract: We study monopoles and corresponding 't Hooft tensor in a generic gauge theory. This issue is relevant to the understanding of the color confinement in terms of dual symmetry.
