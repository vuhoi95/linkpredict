Title: On higher order Sugawara operators
Authors: A. V. Chervov and A. I. Molev
Abstract: The higher Sugawara operators acting on the Verma modules over the affine Kac-Moody algebra at the critical level are related to the higher Hamiltonians of the Gaudin model due to work of Feigin, Frenkel and Reshetikhin. An explicit construction of the higher Hamiltonians in the case of gl_n was given recently by Talalaev. We propose a new approach to these results from the viewpoint of the vertex algebra theory by proving directly the formulas for the higher order Sugawara operators. The eigenvalues of the operators in the Wakimoto modules of critical level are also calculated.
