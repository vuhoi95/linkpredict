Title: Toward the AdS/CFT Gravity Dual for High Energy Collisions.  3.Gravitationally Collapsing Shell and Quasiequilibrium
Authors: Shu Lin and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: The equilibration of matter and onset of hydrodynamics can be understood in the AdS/CFT context as a gravitational collapse process, in which "collision debris" create a horizon. In this paper we consider the simplest geometry possible, a flat shell (or membrane) falling in the holographic direction toward the horizon. The metric is a combination of two well known solutions: thermal AdS above the shell and pure AdS below, while motion of the shell is given by the Israel junction condition. Furthermore, when the shell motion can be considered slow, we were able to solve for two-point functions of all boundary stress tensor and found that an observer on the boundary sees a very peculiar $quasiequilibrium$: while the average stress tensor $<T_{\mu\nu>}$ contains the equilibrium plasma energy and pressure at all times, the spectral densities of the correlators(related with occupation probabilities of the modes) reveal additional oscillating terms absent in equilibrium. This is explained by the "echo" phenomenon, a partial return of the field coherence at certain "echo" times.
