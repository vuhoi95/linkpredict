Title: Hamiltonian thermodynamics of charged three-dimensional dilatonic black  holes
Authors: Gonçalo A. S. Dias and José P. S. Lemos
Abstract: The action for a class of three-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories, with an electromagnetic Maxwell field and a cosmological constant, can be recast in a Brans-Dicke-Maxwell type action, with its free $\omega$ parameter. For a negative cosmological constant, these theories have static, electrically charged, and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Those theories with well formulated asymptotics are studied through a Hamiltonian formalism, and their thermodynamical properties are found. The theories studied are general relativity, a dimensionally reduced cylindrical four-dimensional general relativity theory, and a theory representing a class of theories, all with a Maxwell term. The Hamiltonian formalism is setup in three dimensions through foliations on the right region of the Carter-Penrose diagram, with the bifurcation 1-sphere as the left boundary, and anti-de Sitter infinity as the right one. The metric functions on the hypersurfaces and the radial component of the vector potential one-form are the canonical coordinates. The Hamiltonian action is written, the Hamiltonian being a sum of constraints. One finds a new action which yields an unconstrained theory with two pairs of canonical coordinates ${M,P_M; Q,P_Q}$, where $M$ is the mass parameter, which needs renormalization, $P_M$ its conjugate momenta, $Q$ is the charge parameter, and $P_Q$ its conjugate momentum. The resulting Hamiltonian is a sum of boundary terms only. A quantization of the theory is performed. The Schr\"odinger evolution operator is constructed, the trace is taken, and the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble is obtained, the chemical potential being the electric potential. The charged black hole entropies differ, in general, from the usual quarter of the horizon area due to the dilaton.
