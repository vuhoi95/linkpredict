Title: Open-chain transfer matrices for AdS/CFT
Authors: Rajan Murgan and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We extend Sklyanin's construction of commuting open-chain transfer matrices to the SU(2|2) bulk and boundary S-matrices of AdS/CFT. Using the graded version of the S-matrices leads to a transfer matrix of particularly simple form. We also find an SU(1|1) boundary S-matrix which has one free boundary parameter.
