Title: Can local bulk effects explain the galactic dark matter?
Authors: Malihe Heydari-Fard and Hamid R. Sepangi
Abstract: We obtain the virial theorem within the context of a brane-world model without mirror symmetry or any form of junction condition. Taking a constant curvature bulk (neglecting non-local bulk effects), the local bulk effects generate a geometrical mass, contributing to the gravitational energy which may be used to explain the virial mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies. We fix the parameter of this model in agreement with observational data.
