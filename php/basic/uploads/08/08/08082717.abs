Title: A note on the quantum-mechanical Ricci flow
Authors: J. M. Isidro and J. L. G. Santander and P. Fernandez de Cordoba
Abstract: We obtain Schroedinger quantum mechanics from Perelman's functional and from the Ricci flow equations of a conformally flat Riemannian metric on a closed 2-dimensional configuration space. We explore links with the recently discussed "emergent quantum mechanics".
