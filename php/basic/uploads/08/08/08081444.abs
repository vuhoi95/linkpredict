Title: Loewner equations, Hirota equations and reductions of universal Whitham  hierarchy
Authors: Kanehisa Takasaki and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: This paper reconsiders finite variable reductions of the universal Whitham hierarchy of genus zero in the perspective of dispersionless Hirota equations. In the case of one-variable reduction, dispersionless Hirota equations turn out to be a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of reduction. All relevant equations describing the reduction (L\"owner-type equations and diagonal hydrodynamic equations) can be thereby derived and justified in a unified manner. The case of multi-variable reductions is not so straightforward. Nevertheless, the reduction procedure can be formulated in a general form, and justified with the aid of dispersionless Hirota equations. As an application, previous results of Guil, Ma\~{n}as and Mart\'{\i}nez Alonso are reconfirmed in this formulation.
