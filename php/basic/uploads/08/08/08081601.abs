Title: Second order hydrodynamics of a CFT plasma from boost invariant  expansion
Authors: Alex Buchel and Miguel Paulos
Abstract: We compute finite coupling correction to a nonlinear second order hydrodynamic coefficient in the boost invariant expansion of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The result is universal for a large class of strongly coupled four dimensional conformal gauge theories.
