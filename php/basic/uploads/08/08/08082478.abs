Title: On the behavior of bosonic systems in the presence of topology  fluctuations
Authors: A. A. Kirillov and E. P. Savelova
Abstract: The behavior of bosonic systems in the presence of space-time foam is analyzed within the simplistic model of a set of scalar fields on a flat background. We discuss the formula for the path integral which allows to account for the all possible topologies of spacetime. We show that the proper path integral originates from the parastatistics suggested first by H.S. Green and that it defines a cutoff for the field theory.
