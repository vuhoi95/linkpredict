Title: BRST Exact Action For N=1, D=4, Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: A. Aidaoui and M. Tahiri
Abstract: The action for classical and consequently quantum N=1, D=4, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is proven to be written as a BRST exact term. In order to show this, the space of fields in the theory must be enlarged to include an extrafield as a non dynamical auxiliary field.
