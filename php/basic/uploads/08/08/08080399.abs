Title: Shear Viscosity of a Non-Relativistic Conformal Gas in Two Dimensions
Authors: Jiunn-Wei Chen and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: The shear viscosity, eta, of a fermi gas with non-relativistic conformal symmetry in two spatial dimensions is investigated. We find that eta/s, s being the entropy density, diverges as a gas of free particles in this system. It is in contrast to the eta/s=1/(4 pi) found using non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspondence, which requires a strongly interacting CFT. It implies the unitary fermi gas in two spatial dimensions is not likely to have a weakly interacting gravity dual.
