Title: Exploring Pure Spinor String Theory on AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: Giulio Bonelli and Pietro Antonio Grassi and Houman Safaai
Abstract: In this paper we formulate the pure spinor superstring theory on AdS_4 x CP^3. By recasting the pure spinor action as a topological A-model on the fermionic supercoset Osp(6|4)/SO(6)xSp(4) plus a BRST exact term, we prove the exactness of the sigma-model. We then give a gauged linear sigma-model which reduces to the superstring in the limit of large volume and we study its branch geometry in different phases. Moreover, we discuss possible D-brane boundary conditions and the principal chiral model for the fermionic supercoset.
