Title: Warm Inflation and its Microphysical Basis
Authors: Arjun Berera and Ian G. Moss and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: The microscopic quantum field theory origins of warm inflation dynamics are reviewed. The warm inflation scenario is first described along with its results, predictions and comparison with the standard cold inflation scenario. The basics of thermal field theory required in the study of warm inflation are discussed. Quantum field theory real time calculations at finite temperature are then presented and the derivation of dissipation and stochastic fluctuations are shown from a general perspective. Specific results are given of dissipation coefficients for a variety of quantum field theory interaction structures relevant to warm inflation, in a form that can readily be used by model builders. Different particle physics models realising warm inflation are presented along with their observational predictions.
