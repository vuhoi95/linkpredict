Abstract: We describe a method to derive, from first principles, the long-distance asymptotic behavior of correlation functions of integrable models in the framework of the algebraic Bethe ansatz. We apply this approach to the longitudinal spin- spin correlation function of the XXZ Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain (with magnetic field) in the disordered regime as well as to the density-density correlation func- tion of the interacting one-dimensional Bose gas. At leading order, the results confirm the Luttinger liquid and conformal field theory predictions.
