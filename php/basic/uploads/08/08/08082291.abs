Title: p-q-superstrings in Anti-de-Sitter space-time
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Momchil Minkov
Abstract: We study a field theoretical model for p-q-superstrings in a fixed Anti-de-Sitter background. We find that the presence of the negative cosmological constant tends to decrease the core radius of the strings. Moreover, the binding energy decreases with the increase of the absolute value of the cosmological constant. Studying the effect of the p-q-strings on Anti-de-Sitter space, we observe that the presence of the negative cosmological constant tends to decrease the deficit angle as compared to asymptotically flat space-time.
