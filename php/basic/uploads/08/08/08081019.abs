Title: Quantum SUSY Algebra of $Q$-lumps in the Massive Grassmannian Sigma  Model
Authors: Hiroaki Nakajima and Phillial Oh and Sunyoung Shin
Abstract: We compute the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY algebra of the massive Grassmannian sigma model in 2+1 dimensions. We first rederive the action of the model by using the Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction from $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory in 3+1 dimensions. Then, we perform the canonical quantization by using the Dirac method. We find that a particular choice of the operator ordering yields the quantum SUSY algebra of the $Q$-lumps with cental extension.
