Title: Entropy flow of a perfect fluid in (1+1) hydrodynamics
Authors: Guillaume Beuf and Robi Peschanski and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: Using the formalism of the Khalatnikov potential, we derive exact general formulae for the entropy flow dS/dy, where y is the rapidity, as a function of temperature for the (1+1) relativistic hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid. We study in particular flows dominated by a sufficiently long hydrodynamic evolution, and provide an explicit analytical solution for dS/dy. We discuss the theoretical implications of our general formulae and some phenomenological applications for heavy-ion collisions.
