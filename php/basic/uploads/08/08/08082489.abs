Title: On S-Matrix factorization of the Landau-Lifshitz model
Authors: A. Melikyan and A. Pinzul and V. O. Rivelles and G. Weber
Abstract: We consider the three-particle scattering S-matrix for the Landau-Lifshitz model by directly computing the set of the Feynman diagrams up to the second order. We show, following the analogous computations for the non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger model, that the three-particle S-matrix is factorizable in the first non-trivial order.
