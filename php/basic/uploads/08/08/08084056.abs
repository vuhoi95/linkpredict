Title: Black hole entropy for the general area spectrum
Authors: Tomo Tanaka and Takashi Tamaki
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the horizon area is expressed by the general area spectrum in loop quantum gravity and calculate the black hole entropy by counting the degrees of freedom in spin-network states related to its area. Although the general area spectrum has a complex expression, we succeeded in obtaining the result that the black hole entropy is proportional to its area as in previous works where the simplified area formula has been used. This gives new values for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter ($\gamma =0.5802... \mathrm{or} 0.7847...$) which are larger than that of previous works.
