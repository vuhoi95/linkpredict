Title: On the existence of soliton and hairy black hole solutions of su(N)  Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant
Authors: J. E. Baxter and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We study the existence of soliton and black hole solutions of four-dimensional su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant. We prove the existence of non-trivial solutions for any integer N, with N-1 gauge field degrees of freedom. In particular, we prove the existence of solutions in which all the gauge field functions have no zeros. For fixed values of the parameters (at the origin or event horizon, as applicable) defining the soliton or black hole solutions, if the magnitude of the cosmological constant is sufficiently large, then the gauge field functions all have no zeros. These latter solutions are of special interest because at least some of them will be linearly stable.
