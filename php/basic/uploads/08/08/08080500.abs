Title: Superconformal Chern-Simons Theories and the Squashed Seven Sphere
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri and Chang-Soon Park
Abstract: We show that there are two supersymmetric completions of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory of level k with gauge group U(N)xU(N) coupled to four sets of massless scalars and spinors in the bi-fundamental representation, if we require Sp(2) global symmetry with the matter fields in the fundamental representation of SU(4). One is the N=6 superconformal theory recently studied in arXiv:0806.1218 [hep-th] and another is a new theory with N=1 superconformal symmetry. We conjecture that the N=1 theory is dual to M theory on AdS_4 x Squashed S^7/Z_k.
