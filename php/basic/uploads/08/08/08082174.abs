Title: Group Averaging of massless scalar fields in 1+1 de Sitter
Authors: Donald Marolf and Ian A. Morrison
Abstract: Perturbative gravity in global de Sitter space is subject to so-called linearization stability constraints: If they are to couple consistently to the gravitational field, quantum states must be invariant under the de Sitter isometries. While standard Fock spaces contain no de Sitter-invariant states apart from (possibly) the vacuum, a full Hilbert space of de Sitter-invariant quantum states can be constructed via group averaging techiniques. We re-examine the simple toy model of de Sitter group averaging given by the free 1+1 scalar field, expanding on an earlier analysis by Higuchi. Our purpose is twofold: to include the scalar zero-mode, and to explicitly count the number of de Sitter-invariant states as a function of an appropriately defined energy.
