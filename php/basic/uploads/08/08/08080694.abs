Title: Radiation damping, noncommutativity and duality
Authors: E. M. C. Abreu and A. C. R. Mendes and C. Neves and W. Oliveira
Abstract: In this work, our main objective is to construct a N=2 supersymmetric extension of the nonrelativistic $(2+1)$-dimensional model describing the radiation damping on the noncommutative plane with scalar (electric) and vector (magnetic) interactions by the N=2 superfield technique. We also introduce a dual equivalent action to the radiation damping one using the Noether procedure.
