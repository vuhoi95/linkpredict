Title: Spontaneous Breaking of Lorentz-Invariance and Gravitons as Goldstone  Particles
Authors: Z. Berezhiani and O. V. Kancheli
Abstract: We consider some aspects of spontaneous breaking of Lorentz Invariance in field theories, discussing the possibility that the certain tensor operators may condensate in the ground state in which case the tensor Goldstone particles would appear. We analyze their dynamics and discuss to which extent such a theory could imitate the gravity. We are also interested if the universality of coupling of such `gravitons' with other particles can be achieved in the infrared limit. Then we address the more complicated models when such tensor Goldstones coexist with the usual geometrical gravitons. At the end we examine the properties of possible cosmological scenarios in the case of goldstone gravity coexisting with geometrical gravity.
