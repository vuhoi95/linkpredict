Title: Tilings, Chern-Simons Theories and M2 Branes
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: A new infinite class of Chern-Simons theories is presented using brane tilings. The new class reproduces all known cases so far and introduces many new models that are dual to M2 brane theories which probe a toric non-compact CY 4-fold. The master space of the quiver theory is used as a tool to construct the moduli space for this class and the Hilbert Series is computed for a selected set of examples.
