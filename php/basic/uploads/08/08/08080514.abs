Title: A Class of Nonperturbative Configurations in Abelian-Higgs Models:  Complexity from Dynamical Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Marcelo Gleiser and Joel Thorarinson
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of the dynamics of symmetry breaking in both Abelian and non-Abelian $[S U (2)]$ Higgs models in three spatial dimensions. We find a class of time-dependent, long-lived nonperturbative field configurations within the range of parameters corresponding to type-1 superconductors, that is, with vector masses ($m_v$) larger than scalar masses ($m_s$). We argue that these emergent nontopological configurations are related to oscillons found previously in other contexts. For the Abelian-Higgs model, our lattice implementation allows us to map the range of parameter space -- the values of $\beta = (m_s /m_v)^2$ -- where such configurations exist and to follow them for times $t \sim \O(10^5) m^{-1}$. An investigation of their properties for $\hat z$-symmetric models reveals an enormously rich structure of resonances and mode-mode oscillations reminiscent of excited atomic states. For the SU(2) case, we present preliminary results indicating the presence of similar oscillonic configurations.
