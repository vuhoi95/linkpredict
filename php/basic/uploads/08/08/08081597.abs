Title: Vacuum static compactified wormholes in eight-dimensional Lovelock  theory
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Alex Giacomini
Abstract: In this paper new exact solutions in eight dimensional Lovelock theory will be presented. These solutions are vacuum static wormhole, black hole and generalized Bertotti-Robinson space-times with nontrivial torsion. All the solutions have a cross product structure of the type $M_{5}\times \Sigma_{3} $ where $M_{5}$ is a five dimensional manifold and $\Sigma_{3}$ a compact constant curvature manifold. The wormhole is the first example of a smooth vacuum static Lovelock wormhole which is neither Chern-Simons nor Born-Infeld. It will be also discussed how the presence of torsion affects the "navigableness" of the wormhole for scalar and spinning particles. It will be shown that the wormhole with torsion may act as "geometrical filter": a very large torsion may "increase the traversability" for scalars while acting as a "polarizator" on spinning particles. This may have interesting phenomenological consequences.
