Abstract: In previous works, we have constructed a refined version of the Gribov-Zwanziger action in 4 dimensions, by taking into account a novel dynamical effect. In this paper, we explore the 3-dimensional case. Analogously as in 4 dimensions, we obtain a ghost propagator behaving like $1/p^2$ in the infrared, while the gluon propagator reaches a finite nonvanishing value at zero momentum. Simultaneously, a clear violation of positivity by the gluon propagator is also found. This behaviour of the propagators turns out be in agreement with the recent numerical simulations.
