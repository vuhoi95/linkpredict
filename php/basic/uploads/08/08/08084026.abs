Title: Flavor structure with multi moduli in 5D SUGRA
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We investigate 5-dimensional supergravity on S^1/Z_2 with a physical Z_2-odd vector multiplet, which yields an additional modulus other than the radion. We find additional terms in the 4-dimensional effective theory that are peculiar to the multi moduli case. Such terms can make the soft masses are non-tachyonic and almost flavor-universal at tree-level, in contrast to the single modulus case. This provides a new possibility to solve the SUSY flavor problem.
