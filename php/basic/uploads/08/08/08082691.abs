Title: Fuzzy Ring from M2-brane Giant Torus
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We construct spinning dual M2 giant gravitons in AdS_4 x S^7, which generically become 1/16 BPS states, and show that their world-volumes become torii. By taking an orbifold, we obtain spinning dielectric D2-brane configurations in AdS_4 x CP^3 dual to specific BPS operators in ABJM theory. This reveals a novel mechanism how to give an angular momentum to a dielectric D2-brane. We also find that when its angular momentum in the AdS_4 becomes large, it approaches to a ring-like object. Our result might suggest an existence of supersymmetric black rings in the AdS_4 background. We will also discuss dual giant gravitons in AdS_4 x CP^3.
