Title: T-duality for open strings in the presence of backgrounds and  noncommutativity
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Nelson R. F. Braga and Rafael D'Andrea
Abstract: We investigate the effect of T-duality on noncommutativity. Starting with open strings ending on a D2-brane wrapped on a $T^2$ torus in the presence of a Kalb Ramond field, we consider Buscher transformations on the coordinates and background. We find that the dual system is commutative. We also study alternative transformations that can preserve noncommutativity.
