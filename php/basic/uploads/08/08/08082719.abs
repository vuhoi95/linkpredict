Title: Junctions of anyonic Luttinger wires
Authors: Brando Bellazzini and Pasquale Calabrese and Mihail Mintchev
Abstract: We present an extended study of anyonic Luttinger liquids wires jointing at a single point. The model on the full line is solved with bosonization and the junction of an arbitrary number of wires is treated imposing boundary conditions that preserve exact solvability in the bosonic language. This allows to reach, in the low momentum regime, some of the critical fixed points found with the electronic boundary conditions. The stability of all the fixed points is discussed.
