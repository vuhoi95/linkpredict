Title: Comments on claimed risk from metastable black holes
Authors: Steven B. Giddings and Michelangelo L. Mangano
Abstract: In a recent note, arXiv:0808.1415, it was argued that a hypothetical metastable black hole scenario could pose collider risk not excluded by our previous study. We comment on inconsistency of this proposed scenario.
