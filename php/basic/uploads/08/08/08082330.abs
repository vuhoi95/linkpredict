Title: Noncommutative BTZ Black Hole in Polar Coordinates
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Daeho Lee and Youngone Lee
Abstract: Based on the equivalence between the three dimensional gravity and the Chern-Simons theory, we obtain a noncommutative BTZ black hole solution as a solution of $U(1,1)\times U(1,1)$ noncommutative Chern-Simons theory using the Seiberg-Witten map. The Seiberg-Witten map is carried out in a noncommutative polar coordinates whose commutation relation is equivalent to the usual canonical commutation relation in the rectangular coordinates up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$. The solution exhibits a characteristic of noncommutative polar coordinates in such a way that the apparent horizon and the Killing horizon coincide only in the non-rotating limit showing the effect of noncommutativity between the radial and angular coordinates.
