Title: Nonabelian Generalized Gauge Multiplets
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Itai Ryb and Rikard von Unge and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We give the nonabelian extension of the newly discovered N = (2, 2) two-dimensional vector multiplets. These can be used to gauge symmetries of sigma models on generalized Kahler geometries. Starting from the transformation rule for the nonabelian case we find covariant derivatives and gauge covariant field-strengths and write their actions in N = (2, 2) and N = (1, 1) superspace.
