Title: Higher order Josephson effects
Authors: Roman V. Buniy and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: Gaussian linking of superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions with enclosed magnetic fields give rise to interference shifts in the phase that modulates the current carried through the loop, proportional to the magnitude of the enclosed flux. We generalize these results to higher order linking of a superconducting loop with several magnetic solenoids, and show there may be interference shifts proportional to the product of two or more fluxes.
