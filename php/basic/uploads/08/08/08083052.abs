Title: Kinks in a non-linear massive sigma model
Authors: A. Alonso-Izquierdo and M. A. Gonzalez Leon and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: We describe the kink solitary waves of a massive non-linear sigma model with an ${\mathbb S}^2$ sphere as the target manifold. Our solutions form a moduli space of non-relativistic solitary waves in the long wavelength limit of ferromagnetic linear spin chains.
