Title: The Chiral Magnetic Effect
Authors: Kenji Fukushima and Dmitri E. Kharzeev and Harmen J. Warringa
Abstract: Topological charge changing transitions can induce chirality in the quark-gluon plasma by the axial anomaly. We study the equilibrium response of the quark-gluon plasma in such a situation to an external magnetic field. To mimic the effect of the topological charge changing transitions we will introduce a chiral chemical potential. We will show that an electromagnetic current is generated along the magnetic field. This is the Chiral Magnetic Effect. We compute the magnitude of this current as a function of magnetic field, chirality, temperature, and baryon chemical potential.
