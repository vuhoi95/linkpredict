Title: Recursion Relations from Space-time Supersymmetry
Authors: Anirban Basu and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We describe a method for obtaining relations between higher derivative interactions in supersymmetric effective actions. The method extends to all orders in the momentum expansion. As an application, we consider the string coupling dependence of the \hat{G}^{2k} \lambda^{16} interaction in type IIB string theory. Using supersymmetry, we show that each of these interactions satisfies a Poisson equation on the moduli space with sources determined by lower momentum interactions. We argue that these protected couplings are only renormalized by a finite number of string loops together with non-perturbative terms. Finally, we explore some consequences of the Poisson equation for low values of k.
