Title: Quiver Chern-Simons theories and crystals
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Keisuke Kimura
Abstract: We consider N=2 quiver Chern-Simons theories described by brane tilings, whose moduli spaces are toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Simple prescriptions to obtain toric data of the moduli space and a corresponding brane crystal from a brane tiling are proposed.
