Title: Hydrodynamics of N=6 Superconformal Chern-Simons Theories at Strong  Coupling
Authors: Mohammad R. Garousi and Ahmad Ghodsi
Abstract: Using the duality conjecture between N=6 supersymmetric U(N)_k \times U(N)_{-k} Chern-Simons theory and M-theory on AdS_4 \times S^7/Z_{k}, we calculate the corrections to the shear viscosity of the field theory at temperature T. At strong 't Hooft coupling and at small k level, we have considered one-loop correction to the M-theory effective action. At large k level, we have considered the alpha' correction to the type IIA effective action. In both cases the correction to the ratio of shear viscosity to the entropy density is positive.
