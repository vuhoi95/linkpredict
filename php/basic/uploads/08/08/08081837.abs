Title: Universal holographic hydrodynamics at finite coupling
Authors: Alex Buchel and Robert C. Myers and Miguel F. Paulos and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: We consider thermal plasmas in a large class of superconformal gauge theories described by a holographic dual geometry of the form $AdS_5\times M_5$. In particular, we demonstrate that all of the thermodynamic properties and hydrodynamic transport parameters for a large class of superconformal gauge theories exhibit a certain universality to leading order in the inverse 't Hooft coupling and $1/N_c$. In particular, we show that independent of the compactification geometry, the leading corrections are derived from the same five-dimensional effective supergravity action supplemented by a term quartic in the five-dimensional Weyl tensor.
