Title: Differential structure on the $Îº$-Minkowski spacetime from twist
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Youngone Lee and Chaiho Rim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We study four dimensional $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime constructed by the twist deformation of $U(igl(4,R))$. We demonstrate that the differential structure of such twist-deformed $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime is closed in four dimensions contrary to the construction of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} bicovariant calculus which needs an extra fifth dimension. Our construction holds in arbitrary dimensional spacetimes.
