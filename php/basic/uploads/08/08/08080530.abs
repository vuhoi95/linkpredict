Title: Matrix Models for the Black Hole Information Paradox
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Takuya Okuda and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We study various matrix models with a charge-charge interaction as toy models of the gauge dual of the AdS black hole. These models show a continuous spectrum and power-law decay of correlators at late time and infinite N, implying information loss in this limit. At finite N, the spectrum is discrete and correlators have recurrences, so there is no information loss. We study these models by a variety of techniques, such as Feynman graph expansion, loop equations, and sum over Young tableaux, and we obtain explicitly the leading 1/N^2 corrections for the spectrum and correlators. These techniques are suggestive of possible dual bulk descriptions. At fixed order in 1/N^2 the spectrum remains continuous and no recurrence occurs, so information loss persists. However, the interchange of the long-time and large-N limits is subtle and requires further study.
