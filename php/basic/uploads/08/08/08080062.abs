Title: Casimir Pistons for Massive Scalar Fields
Authors: Xiang-hua Zhai and Yan-yan Zhang and Xin-zhou Li
Abstract: The Casimir force on two-dimensional pistons for massive scalar fields with both Dirichlet and hybrid boundary conditions is computed. The physical result is obtained by making use of generalized $\zeta$-function regularization technique. The influence of the mass and the position of the piston in the force is studied graphically. The Casimir force for massive scalar field is compared to that for massless scalar field.
