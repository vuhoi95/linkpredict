Title: Semi-classical central charge in topologically massive gravity
Authors: Geoffrey Compère and Stéphane Detournay
Abstract: It is shown that the warped black holes geometries discussed recently in 0807.3040 admit an algebra of asymptotic symmetries isomorphic to the semi-direct product of a Virasoro algebra and an algebra of currents. The realization of this asymptotic symmetry by canonical charges allows one to find the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. The right-moving central charge $c_R = \frac{(5\hat{\nu}^2+3)l}{G\hat{\nu} (\hat{\nu}^2+3)}$ is obtained when the Virasoro generators are normalized in order to have a positive zero mode spectrum for the warped black holes. The current algebra is also shown to be centrally-extended.
