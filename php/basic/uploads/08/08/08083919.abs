Title: Integrable models: from dynamical solutions to string theory
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and Antonio Lima Santos
Abstract: We review the status of integrable models from the point of view of their dynamics and integrability conditions. Some integrable models are discussed in detail. We comment on the use it is made of them in string theory. We also discuss the Bethe Ansatz solution of the SO(6) symmetric Hamiltonian with SO(6) boundary. This work is especially prepared for the seventieth anniversaries of Andr\'{e} Swieca (in memoriam) and Roland K\"{o}berle.
