Title: Topological Summation of Observables Measured with Dynamical Overlap  Fermions
Authors: Wolfgang Bietenholz and Ivan Hip
Abstract: HMC histories for light dynamical overlap fermions tend to stay in a fixed topological sector for many trajectories, so that the different sectors are not sampled properly. Therefore the suitable summation of observables, which have been measured in separate sectors, is a major challenge. We explore several techniques for this issue, based on data for the chiral condensate and the (analogue of the) pion mass in the 2-flavour Schwinger model with dynamical overlap-hypercube fermions.
