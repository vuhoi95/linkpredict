Title: ZZ boundary states and fragmented AdS2 spaces
Authors: Simone Giombi and Xi Yin
Abstract: In this paper we show that Liouville gravity on the strip with Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (ZZ) boundary conditions has a semi-classical interpretation in terms of fragmented AdS2 spacetime geometries. Further, we study the three-point functions of the ZZ boundary states, and show that they are dominated by multi-AdS2 instantons in the classical limit.
