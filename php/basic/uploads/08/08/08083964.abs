Title: A Cubical Set Approach to 2-Bundles with Connection and Wilson Surfaces
Authors: Joao Faria Martins and Roger Picken
Abstract: In the context of non-abelian gerbes we define a cubical version of categorical group 2-bundles with connection over a smooth manifold. We define their two-dimensional parallel transport, study its properties, and define non-abelian Wilson surface functionals.
