Title: On Yang-Mills Theories with Chiral Matter at Strong Coupling
Authors: M. Shifman and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: Strong coupling dynamics of Yang--Mills theories with chiral fermion content remained largely elusive despite much effort over the years. In this work, we propose a dynamical framework in which we can address non-perturbative properties of chiral, non-supersymmetric gauge theories, in particular, chiral quiver theories on $S_1 \times R_3 $. Double-trace deformations are used to stabilize the center-symmetric vacuum. This allows one to smoothly connect small-$r(S_1)$ to large-$r(S_1)$ physics ($R_4$ is the limiting case) where the double-trace deformations are switched off. In particular, occurrence of the mass gap in the gauge sector and linear confinement due to bions are analytically demonstrated. We find the pattern of the chiral symmetry realization which depends on the structure of the ring operators, a novel class of topological excitations. The deformed chiral theory, unlike the undeformed one, satisfies volume independence down to arbitrarily small volumes (a working Eguchi--Kawai reduction) in the large $N$ limit. This equivalence, may open new perspectives on strong coupling chiral gauge theories on $R_4$.
