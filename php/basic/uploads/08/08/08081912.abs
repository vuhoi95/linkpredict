Title: Supersymmetric Gödel and warped black holes in string theory
Authors: Geoffrey Compère and Stéphane Detournay and Mauricio Romo
Abstract: It is observed that three-dimensional G\"odel black holes can be promoted to exact string theory backgrounds through an orbifold of an hyperbolic asymmetric marginal deformation of the SL(2,R) WZW model. Tachyons are found in the spectrum of long strings. Uplifting these solutions in type IIB supergravity, extremal black holes are shown to preserve one supersymmetry in accordance with the BTZ limit. We also make connections with some recently discussed warped black hole solutions of topologically massive gravity, showing that they actually correspond to quotients of spacelike squashed AdS_3.
