Title: Quantum Tunneling and Trace Anomaly
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: We compute the corrections, using the tunneling formalisim based on a quantum WKB approach, to the Hawking temperature and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Schwarzschild black hole. The results are related to the trace anomaly and are shown to be equivalent to findings inferred from Hawking's original calculation based on path integrals using zeta function regularization. Finally, exploiting the corrected temperature and periodicity arguments we also find the modification to the original Schwarzschild metric which captures the effect of quantum corrections.
