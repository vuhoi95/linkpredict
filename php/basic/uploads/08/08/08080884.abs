Title: The Nekrasov Conjecture for Toric Surfaces
Authors: Elizabeth Gasparim and Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu
Abstract: The Nekrasov conjecture predicts a relation between the partition function for N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the Seiberg-Witten prepotential. For instantons on R^4, the conjecture was proved, independently and using different methods, by Nekrasov-Okounkov, Nakajima-Yoshioka, and Braverman-Etingof. We prove a generalized version of the conjecture for instantons on noncompact toric surfaces.
