Title: Backreacted T-folds and non-geometric regions in configuration space
Authors: Waldemar Schulgin and Jan Troost
Abstract: We provide the backreaction of the T-fold doubly T-dual to a background with NSNS three-form flux on a three-torus. We extend the backreacted T-fold to include cases with a flux localized in one out of three directions. We analyze the resulting monodromy domain walls and vortices. In these backgrounds, we give an analysis of the action of T-duality on observables like charges and Wilson surfaces. We analyze arguments for the existence of regions in the configuration space of second quantized string theory that cannot be reduced to geometry. Finally, by allowing for space-dependent moduli, we find a supergravity solution which is a T-fold with hyperbolic monodromies.
