Title: Tensor gauge field localization in branes
Authors: M. O. Tahim and W. T. Cruz and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: In this work we study localization of a Kalb-Ramond tensorial gauge field on a membrane described by real scalar fields. The membrane is embedded in an AdS-type five dimensional bulk space, which mimic a Randall-Sundrum scenario. First, we consider a membrane described by only a single real scalar field. In that scenarios we find that there is no localized tensorial zero mode. When we take into account branes described by two real scalar fields with internal structures, we obtain again a non-localized zero mode for a Kalb-Ramond tensorial gauge field. After modifying our model of one single scalar field by coupling the dilaton to the Kalb-Ramond field, we find that this result is changed. Furthermore, we analyze Kaluza-Klein massive modes and resonance structures.
