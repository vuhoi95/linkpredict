Title: Dynamical SUSY and R-symmetry breaking in SQCD with massive and massless  flavors
Authors: Amit Giveon and Andrey Katz and Zohar Komargodski and David Shih
Abstract: We show that supersymmetry and R-symmetry can be dynamically broken in a long-lived metastable vacuum of SQCD with massive and massless flavors. The vacuum results from a competition of a (leading) two-loop effect and small "Planck" suppressed higher-dimension operators. This mechanism provides a particularly simple realization of dynamical SUSY and R-symmetry breaking, and as such it is a good starting point for building phenomenologically viable models of gauge mediation. We take a preliminary step in this direction by constructing a complete model of minimal gauge mediation. Here we find that the parameters of the model are surprisingly constrained by the hidden sector. Similar mechanisms for creating long-lived states operate in a large class of models.
