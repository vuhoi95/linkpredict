Title: Laws of Black Hole Mechanics from Holst Action
Authors: Ayan Chatterjee and Amit Ghosh
Abstract: The formulation of Weak Isolated Horizons (WIH) based on the Isolated Horizon formulation of black hole horizons is reconsidered. The first part of the paper deals with the derivation of laws of mechanics of a WIH. While the zeroth law follows from the WIH boundary conditions, first law depends on the action chosen. We construct the covariant phase space for a spacetime having an WIH as inner boundary for the Holst action. This requires the introduction of new potential functions so that the symplectic structure is foliation independent. We show that a precise cancellation among various terms leads to the usual first law for WIH. Subsequently, we show from the same covariant phase space that for spherical horizons, the topological theory on the inner boundary is a U(1) Chern-Simons theory.
