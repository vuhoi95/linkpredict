Title: A finite electroweak model without a Higgs particle
Authors: J. W. Moffat and V. T. Toth
Abstract: An electroweak model in which the masses of the W and Z bosons and the fermions are generated by quantum loop graphs through a symmetry breaking is investigated. The model is based on a regularized quantum field theory in which the quantum loop graphs are finite to all orders of perturbation theory and the massless theory is gauge invariant, Poincare invariant, and unitary. The breaking of the electroweak symmetry SU_L(2) X U_Y(1) is achieved without a Higgs particle. A fundamental energy scale \Lambda_W (not to be confused with a naive cutoff) enters the theory through the regularization of the Feynman loop diagrams. The finite regularized theory with \Lambda_W allows for a fitting of low energy electroweak data. \Lambda_W ~ 542 GeV is determined at the Z pole by fitting it to the Z mass m_Z, and anchoring the value of \sin^2\theta_w to its experimental value at the Z pole yields a prediction for the W mass m_W that is accurate to about 0.5% without radiative corrections. The scattering amplitudes for W_LW_L -> W_LW_L and e+e- -> W_L^+W_L^- processes do not violate unitarity at high energies due to the suppression of the amplitudes by the running of the coupling constants at vertices. There is no Higgs hierarchy fine-tuning problem in the model. The unitary tree level amplitudes for W_LW_L -> W_LW_L scattering and e+e- -> W_L^+W_L^- annihilation, predicted by the finite electroweak model are compared with the amplitudes obtained from the standard model with Higgs exchange. These predicted amplitudes can be used to distinguish at the LHC between the standard electroweak model and the Higgsless model.
