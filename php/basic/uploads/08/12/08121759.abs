Title: Hawking Radiation via Gravitational Anomalies in Non-spherical  Topologies
Authors: Eleftherios Papantonopoulos and Petros Skamagoulis
Abstract: We study the method of calculating the Hawking radiation via gravitational anomalies in gravitational backgrounds of constant negative curvature. We apply the method to topological black holes and also to topological black holes conformally coupled to a scalar field.
