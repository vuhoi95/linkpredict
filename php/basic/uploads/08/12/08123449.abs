Title: Large N QCD in two dimensions with a baryonic chemical potential
Authors: Richard Galvez and Ari Hietanen and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We consider large N gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice in the presence of a baryonic chemical potential. We work with one copy of naive fermion and argue that reduction holds even in the presence of a chemical potential. Analytical arguments supported by numerical studies show that there is no phase transition as a function of the baryonic chemical potential.
