Title: A geometric-probabilistic method for counting low-lying states in the  Bousso-Polchinski Landscape
Authors: Cesar Asensio and Antonio Segui
Abstract: We propose an accurate method for counting states of close to zero and positive cosmological constant in the Bousso-Polchinski Landscape. This method is based on simple geometrical considerations on the high-dimensional lattice of quantized fluxes and on a probabilistic model (the "random hyperplane" model) that provides a distribution of the values of the cosmological constant. Justification of the assumptions made in this model are given by means of numerical experiments.
