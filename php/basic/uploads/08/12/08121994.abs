Title: The running of coupling constants and unitarity in a finite electroweak  model
Authors: J. W. Moffat and V. T. Toth
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Finite Electroweak (FEW) Theory first proposed in 1991. The theory predicts a running of the electroweak coupling constants and a suppression of tree level amplitudes, ensuring unitarity without a Higgs particle. We demonstrate this explicitly by calculating W_L^+W_L^- -> W_L^+W_L^- and e+e- -> W_L^+W_L^- in both the electroweak Standard Model and the FEW model.
