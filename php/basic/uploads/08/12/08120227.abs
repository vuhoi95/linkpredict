Title: A comment on $p$-branes of ($p+3$)$\rm{d}$ string theory
Authors: Eun Kyung Park and Pyung Seong Kwon
Abstract: We argue that in ($p+3$)d string theory the existence of NS-NS type $p$-brane with negative tension is essential to obtain background geometry $R_2$ or $R_2 / Z_n$ on the transverse dimensions, and the usual codimension-2 brane solutions with these background geometries already contain the negative tension NS-brane implicity in their ansatz. Such an argument leads us, in the context of brane world scenarios, to a conjecture that true background $p$-brane immanent in our spacetime may perhaps be NS-NS type brane, rather than D-brane.
