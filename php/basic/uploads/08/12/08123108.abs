Title: Differential equations from null vectors of the Ramond algebra
Authors: P Giokas and G M T Watts
Abstract: We consider chiral blocks of four Ramond fields of the N=1 super Virasoro algebra where one of the fields is in the (1,2) representation. We show how the null vector in the (1,2) representation determines the chiral blocks as series expansions. We then turn to the Ising model to find an algebraic method to determine differential equations for the blocks of four spin fields. Extending these ideas to the super Virasoro case, we find a first order differential equation for blocks of four Ramond fields. We are able to find exact solutions in many cases. We compare our blocks with results known from other methods.
