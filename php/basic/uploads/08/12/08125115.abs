Title: Novel Mechanisms for repulsive Casimir forces
Authors: Oded Kenneth and Israel Klich
Abstract: We present two novel models for repulsive Casimir interaction between positive perturbations. One example relies on non locality of the dielectric response and one relies on interference between (attractive) modes. Such examples are impossible to achieve in 1d massless theories, as they are prohibited by a generalization of the result of Lambrecht, Jaekel and Reynaud [Phys.Lett. A 225 (1997)] to non local dielectrics and to negative perturbations
