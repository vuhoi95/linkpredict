Title: The structure of n-point functions of chiral primary operators in N=4  super Yang-Mills at one-loop
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Jan Plefka
Abstract: We develop a compact representation of the one-loop n-point functions of all chiral primary operators in planar SU(N), N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in terms of tree-level disk correlation functions and the scalar one-loop box integral. As a check, known results for all four-point functions and for n-point extremal and near-extremal correlators are rederived. The result is then used to evaluate explicitly a selection of five and six-point functions. Our findings suggest that a general one-loop five-point function may be represented through the minimal four-point and five-point functions of weight two operators.
