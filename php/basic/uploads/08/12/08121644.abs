Title: Evolution of Massive Scalar Fields in the Spacetime of a Tense Brane  Black Hole
Authors: Marek Rogatko and Agnieszka Szyp lowska
Abstract: In the spacetime of a $d$-dimensional static tense brane black hole we elaborate the mechanism by which massive scalar fields decay. The metric of a six-dimensional black hole pierced by a topological defect is especially interesting. It corresponds to a black hole residing on a tensional 3-brane embedded in a six-dimensional spacetime, and this solution has gained importance due to the planned accelerator experiments. It happened that the intermediate asymptotic behaviour of the fields in question was determined by an oscillatory inverse power-law. We confirm our investigations by numerical calculations for five- and six-dimensional cases. It turned out that the greater the brane tension is, the faster massive scalar fields decay in the considered spacetimes.
