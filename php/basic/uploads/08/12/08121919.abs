Title: Computation of the radiation amplitude of oscillons
Authors: Gyula Fodor and Péter Forgács and Zalán Horváth and Márk Mezei
Abstract: The radiation loss of small amplitude oscillons (very long-living, spatially localized, time dependent solutions) in one dimensional scalar field theories is computed in the small-amplitude expansion analytically using matched asymptotic series expansions and Borel summation. The amplitude of the radiation is beyond all orders in perturbation theory and the method used has been developed by Segur and Kruskal in Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 747 (1987). Our results are in good agreement with those of long time numerical simulations of oscillons.
