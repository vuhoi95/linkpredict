Title: Generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds and the chiral de Rham complex
Authors: Reimundo Heluani and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We show that the chiral de Rham complex of a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold carries N=2 supersymmetry. We discuss the corresponding topological twist for this N=2 algebra. We interpret this as an algebroid version of the super-Sugawara or Kac-Todorov construction.
