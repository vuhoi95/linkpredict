Title: Walking Dynamics from String Duals
Authors: Carlos Nunez and Ioannis Papadimitriou and Maurizio Piai
Abstract: Within the context of a String Theory dual to N=1 gauge theories with gauge group SU(Nc) and large Nc, we identify a class of solutions of the background equations for which a suitably defined dual of the gauge coupling exhibits the features of a walking theory. We find evidence for three distinct, dynamically generated scales, characterizing walking, symmetry breaking and confinement, and we put them in correspondence with field theory by an analysis of the operators driving the flow.
