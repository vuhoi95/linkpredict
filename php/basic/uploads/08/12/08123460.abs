Title: String coupling and interactions in type IIB matrix model
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Satoshi Nagaoka
Abstract: We investigate the interactions of closed strings in IIB matrix model. The basic interaction of the closed superstring is realized by the recombination of two intersecting strings. Such interaction is investigated in IIB matrix model via two dimensional noncommutative gauge theory in the IR limit. By estimating the probability of the recombination, we identify the string coupling g_s in IIB matrix model. We confirm that our identification is consistent with matrix string theory.
