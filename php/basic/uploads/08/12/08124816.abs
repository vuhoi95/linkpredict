Title: Screening Length of Rotating Heavy Meson from AdS/CFT
Authors: J. Sadeghi and S. Heshmatian
Abstract: In this paper we consider a quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) pair which can be interpreted as a meson in ${\mathcal{N}}$=4 SYM thermal plasma. We assume that the string moves at speed $v$ and rotates around its center of mass simultaneously. By using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we obtain the momentum densities of the rotating string and determine its motion for small angular velocities. Then in general case, we calculate the screening length of $q\bar{q}$ pair numerically and show that its velocity dependance is in consistent with the well known formula $L_s T\sim (1-v^{2})^{1/4}$ in the literature.
