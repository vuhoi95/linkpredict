Title: Renormalization-group symmetries for solutions of nonlinear boundary  value problems
Authors: V. F. Kovalev and D. V. Shirkov
Abstract: Approximately 10 years ago, the method of renormalization-group symmetries entered the field of boundary value problems of classical mathematical physics, stemming from the concepts of functional self-similarity and of the Bogoliubov renormalization group treated as a Lie group of continuous transformations. Overwhelmingly dominating practical quantum field theory calculations, the renormalization-group method formed the basis for the discovery of the asymptotic freedom of strong nuclear interactions and underlies the Grand Unification scenario. This paper describes the logical framework of a new algorithm based on the modern theory of transformation groups and presents the most interesting results of application of the method to differential and/or integral equation problems and to problems that involve linear functionals of solutions. Examples from nonlinear optics, kinetic theory, and plasma dynamics are given, where new analytical solutions obtained with this algorithm have allowed describing the singularity structure for self-focusing of a laser beam in a nonlinear medium, studying generation of harmonics in weakly inhomogeneous plasma, and investigating the energy spectra of accelerated ions in expanding plasma bunches.
