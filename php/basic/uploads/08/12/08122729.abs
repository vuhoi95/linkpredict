Title: The effective action in Einstein-Maxwell theory
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Jose Manuel Davila and Christian Schubert
Abstract: Considerable work has been done on the one-loop effective action in combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, particularly as a tool for determining the properties of light propagation in curved space. After a short review of previous work, I present some recent results obtained using the worldline formalism. In particular, I will discuss various ways of generalizing the QED Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian to the Einstein-Maxwell case.
