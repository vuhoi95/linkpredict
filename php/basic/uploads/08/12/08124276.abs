Title: Supersymmetric Calogero models by gauging
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Evgeny Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: New superconformal extensions of d=1 Calogero-type systems are obtained by gauging the U(n) isometry of matrix superfield models. We consider the cases of N=1, N=2 and N=4 one-dimensional supersymmetries. The bosonic core of the N=1 and N=2 models is the standard conformal A_{n-1} Calogero system, whereas the N=4 model is an extension of the U(2)-spin Calogero system.
