Title: Slavnov-Taylor identities in Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory
Authors: P. Watson and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: The Slavnov-Taylor identities of Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory are derived from the (standard, second order) functional formalism. It is shown how these identities form closed sets from which one can in principle fully determine the Green's functions involving the temporal component of the gauge field without approximation, given appropriate input.
