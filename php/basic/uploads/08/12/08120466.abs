Title: Time parameters and Lorentz transformations of relativistic stochastic  processes
Authors: Jörn Dunkel and Peter Hänggi and Stefan Weber
Abstract: Rules for the transformation of time parameters in relativistic Langevin equations are derived and discussed. In particular, it is shown that, if a coordinate-time parameterized process approaches the relativistic Juttner-Maxwell distribution, the associated proper-time parameterized process converges to a modified momentum distribution, differing by a factor proportional to the inverse energy.
