Title: Lovelock black holes with a nonlinear Maxwell field
Authors: Hideki Maeda and Mokhtar Hassaine and Cristian Martinez
Abstract: We derive electrically charged black hole solutions of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet equations with a nonlinear electrodynamics source in $n (\ge 5)$ dimensions. The spacetimes are given as a warped product $M^2 \times K^{n-2}$, where $K^{n-2}$ is a $(n-2)$-dimensional constant curvature space. We establish a generalized Birkhoff's theorem by showing that it is the unique electrically charged solution with this isometry and for which the orbit of the warp factor on $K^{n-2}$ is non-null. An extension of the analysis for full Lovelock gravity is also achieved with a particular attention to the Chern-Simons case.
