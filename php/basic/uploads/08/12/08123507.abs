Title: Coordinate Dependence of Chern-Simons Theory on Noncommutative AdS3
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Daeho Lee and Youngone Lee
Abstract: We investigate the coordinate dependence of noncommutative theory by studying the solutions of noncommutative $U(1,1)\times U(1,1)$ Chern-Simons theory on $AdS_3$ in the polar and rectangular coordinates. We assume that only the space coordinates are noncommuting. The two coordinate systems are equivalent only up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$. We investigate the effect of this non-exact equivalence between the two coordinate systems in two cases, a conical solution and a BTZ black hole solution, using the Seiberg-Witten map. In each case, the noncommutative solutions in the two coordinate systems obtained from the corresponding same commutative solution turn out to be different even in the first order in $\theta$.
