Title: Unfolding Mixed-Symmetry Fields in AdS and the BMV Conjecture: I.  General Formalism
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Carlo Iazeolla and Per Sundell
Abstract: We present some generalities of unfolded on-shell dynamics that are useful in analysing the BMV conjecture for mixed-symmetry fields in constantly curved backgrounds. In particular we classify the Lorentz-covariant Harish-Chandra modules generated from primary Weyl tensors of arbitrary mass and shape, and in backgrounds with general values of the cosmological constant. We also discuss the unfolded notion of local degrees of freedom in theories with and without gravity and with and without massive deformation parameters, using the language of Weyl zero-form modules and their duals.
