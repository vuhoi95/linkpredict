Title: Infrared Behavior of Three-Point Functions in Landau Gauge Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: Reinhard Alkofer and Markus Q. Huber and Kai Schwenzer
Abstract: Analytic solutions for the three-gluon and ghost-gluon vertices in Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory at low momenta are presented in terms of hypergeometric series. They do not only show the expected scaling behavior but also additional kinematic divergences when only one momentum goes to zero. These singularities, which have also been proposed previously, induce a strong dependence on the kinematics in many dressing functions. The results are generalized to two and three dimensions and a range of values for the ghost propagator's infrared exponent kappa.
