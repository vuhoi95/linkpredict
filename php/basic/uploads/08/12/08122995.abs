Title: Note on cosmology of dimensionally reduced gravitational Chern-Simons
Authors: Wontae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We present cosmological solutions from the dimensionally reduced Chern-Simons term and obtain the smooth transition solution from the decelerated phase (AdS) to the accelerated phase (dS).
