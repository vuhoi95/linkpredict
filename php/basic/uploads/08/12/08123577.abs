Title: Supersymmetric partners for the associated Lame potentials
Authors: David J Fernandez C and Asish Ganguly
Abstract: The general solution of the stationary Schrodinger equation for the associated Lame potentials with an arbitrary real energy is found. The supersymmetric partners are generated by employing seeds solutions for factorization energies inside the gaps.
