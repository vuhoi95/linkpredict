Title: Conformal Orthosymplectic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: J. Burkart and A. Waldron
Abstract: We present the most general curvature obstruction to the deformed parabolic orthosymplectic symmetry subalgebra of the supersymmetric quantum mechanical models recently developed to describe Lichnerowicz wave operators acting on arbitrary tensors and spinors. For geometries possessing a hypersurface-orthogonal homothetic conformal Killing vector we show that the parabolic subalgebra is enhanced to a (curvature-obstructed) orthosymplectic algebra. The new symmetries correspond to time-dependent conformal symmetries of the underlying particle model. We also comment on generalizations germane to three dimensions and new Chern--Simons-like particle models.
