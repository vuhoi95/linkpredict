Title: M-brane singularity formation
Authors: Jens Eggers and Jens Hoppe
Abstract: We derive self-similar string solutions in a graph representation, near the point of singularity formation, which can be shown to extend to point-like singularities on M-branes, as well as to the radially symmetric case.
