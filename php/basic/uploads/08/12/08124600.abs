Title: $R$-symmetric Gauge Mediation With Fayet-Iliopoulos Term
Authors: Mingxing Luo and Sibo Zheng
Abstract: We have studied $R$-symmetrc gauge mediation models with Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. We give a concrete example of hidden sector with an $U(1)_H$ gauge theory and a Fayet-Iliopoulos term, which can induce distinctive soft terms in the visible sector, and help solving fine tuning problems in models of $R$-symmetric gauge mediation.
