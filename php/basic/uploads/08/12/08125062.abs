Title: N=4 superconformal n-particle mechanics via superspace
Authors: Sergey Krivonos and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Kirill Polovnikov
Abstract: We revisit the (untwisted) superfield approach to one-dimensional multi-particle systems with N=4 superconformal invariance. The requirement of a standard (flat) bosonic kinetic energy implies the existence of inertial (super-)coordinates, which is nontrivial beyond three particles. We formulate the corresponding integrability conditions, whose solution directly yields the superpotential, the two prepotentials and the bosonic potential. The structure equations for the two prepotentials, including the WDVV equation, follow automatically. The general solution for translation-invariant three-particle models is presented and illustrated with examples. For the four-particle case, we take advantage of known WDVV solutions to construct a D_3 and a B_3 model, thus overcoming a previously-found barrier regarding the bosonic potential. The general solution and classification remain a challenge.
