Title: Realistic Type IIB Supersymmetric Minkowski Flux Models without the  Freed-Witten Anomaly
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and Tianjun Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We show that there exist supersymmetric Minkowski vacua on Type IIB toroidal orientifold with general flux compactifications where the RR tadpole cancellation conditions can be relaxed and the Freed-Witten anomaly can be cancelled elegantly. We present a realistic Pati-Salam like flux model without the Freed-Witten anomaly. At the string scale, we can break the gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry, achieve the gauge coupling unification naturally, and decouple all the extra chiral exotic particles. Thus, we have the supersymmetric SMs with/without SM singlet(s) below the string scale. Also, we can explain the SM fermion masses and mixings. In addition, the unified gauge coupling and the real parts of the dilaton and K\"ahler moduli are functions of the four-dimensional dilaton. The complex structure moduli and one linear combination of the imaginary parts of the K\"ahler moduli can be determined as functions of the fluxes and the dilaton.
