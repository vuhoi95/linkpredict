Title: Oscillator model on Lie-algebraically deformed nonrelativistic  space-time
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Cezary J. Walczyk
Abstract: The classical and quantum oscillator model on Lie-algebraically deformed nonrelativistic space-time is introduced and analyzed. The corresponding equations of motions are studied using mostly numerical methods. The time-dependent energy spectrum is presented as well.
