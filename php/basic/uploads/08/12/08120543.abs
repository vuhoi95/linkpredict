Title: Supersymmetry breaking and gauge mediation in models with a generic  superpotential
Authors: Ryuichiro Kitano and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We present a general scheme for finding or creating a metastable vacuum in supersymmetric theories. By using the formalism, we show that there is a parameter region where a metastable vacuum exists in the Wess-Zumino model coupled to messenger fields. This model serves as a perturbative renormalizable model of direct gauge mediation.
