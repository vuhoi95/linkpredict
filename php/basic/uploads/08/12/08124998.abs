Title: Faddeev-Senjanovic Quantization of SU(n) N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Field  System with Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Topological Term and Its Fractional Spin
Authors: Yong-Chang Huang and Qiu-Hong Huo
Abstract: Using Faddeev-Senjanovic path integral quantization for constrained Hamilton system, we quantize SU(n) N=2 supersymmetric gauge field system with non-abelian Chern-Simons topological term in 2+1 dimensions, and use consistency of a gauge condition naturally to deduce another gauge condition. Further, we get the generating functional of Green function in phase space, deduce the angular momentum based on the global canonical Noether theorem at quantum level, obtain the fractional spin of this supersymmetric system, and show that the total angular momentum has the orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum of the non-abelian gauge field. Finally, we find out the anomalous fractional spin and discover that the fractional spin has the contributions of both the group superscript components and the A_0^s (x) charge.
