Title: Membrane scattering from Bagger-Lambert theory
Authors: Takayuki Hirayama and Dan Tomino
Abstract: In this note, we discuss membrane scattering from the three dimensional N=8 superconformal theory with SO(8) global symmetry constructed by Bagger-Lambert and Gustavsson. We discuss whether the one loop effective potential consistently reproduces the Newton potential of membranes moving in an eleven dimensional orbifold space.
