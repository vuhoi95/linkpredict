Title: Three generation magnetized orbifold models
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Kang-Sin Choi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We study three generation models in the four-dimensional spacetime, which can be derived from the ten-dimensional N=1 super Yang-Mills theory on the orbifold background with a non-vanishing magnetic flux. We classify the flavor structures and show possible patterns of Yukawa matrices. Some examples of numerical studies are also shown.
