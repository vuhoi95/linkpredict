Abstract: Within the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge the ghost and gluon propagators are determined from a variational solution of the Yang-Mills Schroedinger equation showing both gluon and heavy quark confinement. The continuum results are in good agreement with lattice data. The ghost form factor is identified as the dielectric function of the Yang--Mills vacuum and the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario is shown to imply the dual Meissner effect. The topological susceptibility is calculated.
