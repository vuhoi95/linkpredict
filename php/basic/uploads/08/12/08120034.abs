Title: Inertia and gravitation in teleparallel gravity
Authors: R. Aldrovandi and Tiago Gribl Lucas and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: Using the fact that teleparallel gravity allows a separation between gravitation and inertia, explicit expressions for the gravitational and the inertial energy-momentum densities are obtained. It is shown that, like all other fields of nature, gravitation alone has a tensorial energy-momentum density which in a general frame is conserved in the covariant sense. Together with the inertial energy-momentum density, they form a pseudotensor which is conserved in the ordinary sense. An analysis of the role played by the gravitational and the inertial densities in the computation of the total energy and momentum of gravity is presented.
