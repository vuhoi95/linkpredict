Title: Tests of Universality in AdS/QCD
Authors: Joshua Erlich and Christopher Westenberger
Abstract: Estimates of the light hadron masses, decay constants and couplings in AdS/QCD models are generally more accurate than should have been expected. Certain predictions based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, such as the ratio of the equilibrium viscosity to entropy density, are universal and therefore provide firm experimental tests of these models. Other observables, while not completely universal, may be relatively insensitive to model details. We calculate the dependence of a number of low-energy hadronic observables on details of the hard-wall AdS/QCD model. In particular, we vary the infrared boundary conditions, the 5D gauge coupling, and the mass of the field responsible for chiral symmetry breaking, while holding fixed a small number of observables. We also find a generalized Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation which helps to justify the identification of model parameters with the product of physical quark mass and chiral condensate as per the AdS/CFT correspondence.
