Title: Neutrino electromagnetic properties
Authors: Carlo Giunti and Alexander Studenikin
Abstract: The main goal of the paper is to give a short review on neutrino electromagnetic properties. In the introductory part of the paper a summary on what we really know about neutrinos is given: we discuss the basics of neutrino mass and mixing as well as the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations. This is important for the following discussion on neutrino electromagnetic properties that starts with a derivation of the neutrino electromagnetic vertex function in the most general form, that follows from the requirement of Lorentz invariance, for both the Dirac and Majorana cases. Then, the problem of the neutrino form factors definition and calculation within gauge models is considered. In particular, we discuss the neutrino electric charge form factor and charge radius, dipole magnetic and electric and anapole form factors. Available experimental constraints on neutrino electromagnetic properties are also discussed, and the recently obtained experimental limits on neutrino magnetic moments are reviewed. The most important neutrino electromagnetic processes involving a direct neutrino coupling with photons (such as neutrino radiative decay, neutrino Cherenkov radiation, spin light of neutrino and plasmon decay into neutrino-antineutrino pair in media) and neutrino resonant spin-flavor precession in a magnetic field are discussed at the end of the paper.
