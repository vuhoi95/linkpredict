Title: On quantum integrability of the Landau-Lifshitz model
Authors: A. Melikyan and A. Pinzul
Abstract: We investigate the quantum integrability of the Landau-Lifshitz model and solve the long-standing problem of finding the local quantum Hamiltonian for the arbitrary n-particle sector. The particular difficulty of the LL model quantization, which arises due to the ill-defined operator product, is dealt with by simultaneously regularizing the operator product, and constructing the self-adjoint extensions of a very particular structure. The diagonalizibility difficulties of the Hamiltonian of the LL model, due to the highly singular nature of the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian, are also resolved in our method for the arbitrary n-particle sector. We explicitly demonstrate the consistency of our construction with the quantum inverse scattering method due to Sklyanin, and give a prescription to systematically construct the general solution, which explains and generalizes the puzzling results of Sklyanin for the particular two-particle sector case. Moreover, we demonstrate the S-matrix factorization and show that it is a consequence of the discontinuity conditions on the functions involved in the construction of the self-adjoint extensions.
