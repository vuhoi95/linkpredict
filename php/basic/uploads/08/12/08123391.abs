Title: Double-Scaling Limit of Heterotic Bundles and Dynamical Deformation in  CFT
Authors: Luca Carlevaro and Dan Israel and Marios Petropoulos
Abstract: We consider heterotic string theory on Eguchi-Hanson space, as a local model of a resolved A_1 singularity in a six-dimensional flux compactification, with an Abelian gauge bundle turned on and non-zero torsion. We show that in a suitable double scaling limit, that isolates the physics near the non-vanishing two-cycle, a worldsheet conformal field theory description can be found. It contains a heterotic coset whose target space is conformal to Eguchi-Hanson. Starting from the blow-down limit of the singularity, it can be viewed as a dynamical deformation of the near-horizon fivebrane background. We analyze in detail the spectrum of the theory in particular examples, as well as the important role of worldsheet non-perturbative effects.
