Title: Separability of Gravitational Perturbation in Generalized Kerr-NUT-de  Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Takeshi Oota and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: Generalized Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetime is the most general spacetime which admits a rank-2 closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor. It contains the higher-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter black holes with partially equal angular momenta. We study the separability of gravitational perturbations in the generalized Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetime. We show that a certain type of tensor perturbations admits the separation of variables. The linearized perturbation equations for the Einstein condition are transformed into the ordinary differential equations of Fuchs type.
