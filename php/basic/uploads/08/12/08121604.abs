Title: Dilaton as the Higgs boson
Authors: Robert Foot and Archil Kobakhidze and Kristian L. McDonald
Abstract: We propose a model where the role of the electroweak Higgs field is played by the dilaton. The model contains terms which explicitly violate gauge invariance, however it is shown that this violation is fictitious, so that the model is a consistent low energy effective theory. In the simplest version of the idea the resulting low energy effective theory is the same as the top mode standard model.
