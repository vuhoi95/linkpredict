Title: Interacting SUSY-singlet matter in non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Yu Nakayama and Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We construct an example of supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theory with a matter field transforming as a singlet representation of the supersymmetry algebra, where the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom do not match. This is obtained as a non-relativistic limit of the N=2 Chern-Simons-matter theory in 1+2 dimensions, where the particle and anti-particle coexist. We also study the index to investigate the mimatch of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.
