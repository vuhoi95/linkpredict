Title: Triangular quasi-Hopf algebra structures on certain non-semisimple  quantum groups
Authors: C. A. S. Young and R. Zegers
Abstract: One way to obtain Quantized Universal Enveloping Algebras (QUEAs) of non-semisimple Lie algebras is by contracting QUEAs of semisimple Lie algebras. We prove that every contracted QUEA in a certain class is a cochain twist of the corresponding undeformed universal envelope. Consequently, these contracted QUEAs possess a triangular quasi-Hopf algebra structure. As examples, we consider kappa-Poincare in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions.
