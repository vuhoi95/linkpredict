Title: On the Einstein Relation in holographic systems at finite baryon density
Authors: Javier Mas and Jonathan P. Shock and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We study the conductivity, susceptibility and diffusion of a strongly coupled quark gluon plasma from the holographic perspective. We calculate general expressions for these quantities in the presence of finite baryon density and show that in this context, for the D3/D7 intersection the Einstein relation holds, providing another non-trivial check of the holographic correspondence at finite temperature.
