Title: Black holes in asymptotically Lifshitz spacetime
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Larus Thorlacius
Abstract: A model of 3+1 dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant coupled to abelian gauge fields has been proposed as a gravity dual for Lifshitz like critical phenomena in 2+1 dimensions. The finite temperature behavior is described by black holes that are asymptotic to the Lifshitz fixed point geometry. There is a one-parameter family of charged black holes, where the magnitude of the charge is uniquely determined by the black hole area. These black holes are thermodynamically stable and become extremal in the limit of vanishing size. The theory also has a discrete spectrum of localized objects described by non-singular spacetime geometries. The finite temperature behavior of Wilson loops is reminiscent of strongly coupled gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions, including screening at large distances.
