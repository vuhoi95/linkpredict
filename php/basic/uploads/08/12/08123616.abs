Title: Nonlocal Gluon Condensate from the Dyson--Schwinger Equations
Authors: A. V. Zayakin and J. Rafelski
Abstract: We establish a novel method of obtaining the gauge-invariant bilocal condensate of gluon fields from the solutions of the Dyson--Schwinger equations (DSE) which works in the infrared and ultraviolet limits. We present explicit results for SU(3) case in four dimensions, and compare to other related analytical and lattice results.
