Title: On Born-Infeld Gravity in Weitzenbock spacetime
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Franco Fiorini
Abstract: Using the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity formulated in Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime, we thoroughly explore a kind of Born-Infeld regular gravity leading to second order field equations for the vielbein components. We explicitly solve the equations of motion for two examples: the extended BTZ black hole, which results to exist even if the cosmological constant is positive, and a cosmological model with matter, where the scale factor results to be well behaved, giving so a singularity-free solution.
