Title: Free particle on noncommutative plane -- a coherent state path integral  approach
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Frederik G Scholtz
Abstract: We formulate the coherent state path integral on a two dimensional noncommutative plane using the fact that noncommuative quantum mechanics can be viewed as a quantum system on the Hilbert space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on noncommutative configuration space. The propagation kernel for the free particle shows ultra-violet cutoff which agrees with the earlier investigations made in the literature but the approach differs substantially from the earlier studies.
