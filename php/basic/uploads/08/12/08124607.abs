Title: Stability Conditions For a Noncommutative Scalar Field Coupled to  Gravity
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Carlos A. D. Zarro
Abstract: We consider a noncommutative scalar field with a covariantly constant noncommutative parameter in a curved space-time background. For a potential as a noncommutative polynomial it is shown that the stability conditions are unaffected by the noncommutativity, a result that is valid irrespective whether space-time has horizons or not.
