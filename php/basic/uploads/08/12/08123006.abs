Abstract: Relations between the tunneling rate and the unified first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of the FRW universe are investigated. The tunneling rate arises as a consequence of the unified first law of thermodynamics in such a dynamical system. The analysis shows obviously how the tunneling is intimately connected with the unified first law of thermodynamics through the principle of conservation of energy.
