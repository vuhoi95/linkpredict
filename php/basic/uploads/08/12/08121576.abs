Title: Uniqueness of near-horizon geometries of rotating extremal AdS(4) black  holes
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: We consider stationary extremal black hole solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in four dimensions. We determine all non-static axisymmetric near-horizon geometries (with non-toroidal horizon topology) and all static near-horizon geometries for black holes of this kind. This allows us to deduce that the most general near-horizon geometry of an asymptotically globally AdS(4) rotating extremal black hole, is the near-horizon limit of extremal Kerr-Newman-AdS(4). We also identify the subset of near-horizon geometries which are supersymmetric. Finally, we show which physical quantities of extremal black holes may be computed from the near-horizon limit alone, and point out a simple formula for the entropy of the known supersymmetric AdS(4) black hole. Analogous results are presented in the case of vanishing cosmological constant.
