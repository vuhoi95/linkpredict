Title: Production of charged spin-two gauge bosons in gluon-gluon scattering
Authors: Spyros Konitopoulos and George Savvidy
Abstract: We consider the production of charged spin-two gauge bosons in the gluon-gluon scattering and calculate polarized cross sections for each set of helicity orientations of initial and final particles. The angular dependence of this cross section is compared with the gluon-gluon scattering cross section in QCD .
