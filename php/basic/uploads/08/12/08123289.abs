Title: Supersymmetry breaking in noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: J Ben Geloun and F G Scholtz
Abstract: Supersymmetric quantum mechanics is formulated on a two dimensional noncommutative plane and applied to the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator. We find that the ordinary commutative supersymmetry is partially broken and only half of the number of supercharges are conserved. It is argued that this breaking is closely related to the breaking of time reversal symmetry arising from noncommutativity.
