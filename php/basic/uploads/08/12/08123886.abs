Title: On Slow-roll Moduli Inflation in Massive IIA Supergravity with Metric  Fluxes
Authors: Raphael Flauger and Sonia Paban and Daniel Robbins and Timm Wrase
Abstract: We derive several no-go theorems in the context of massive type IIA string theory compactified to four dimensions in a way that, in the absence of fluxes, preserves N=1 supersymmetry. Our derivation is based on the dilaton, Kaehler and complex structure moduli dependence of the potential of the four-dimensional effective field theory, that is generated by the presence of D6-branes, O6-planes, RR-fluxes, NSNS 3-form flux, and geometric fluxes. To demonstrate the usefulness of our theorems, we apply them to the most commonly studied class of toroidal orientifolds. We show that for all but two of the models in this class the slow-roll parameter \epsilon is bounded from below by numbers of order unity as long as the fluxes satisfy the Bianchi identities, ruling out slow-roll inflation and even the existence of de Sitter extrema in these models. For the two cases that avoid the no-go theorems, we provide some details of our numerical studies, demonstrating that small \epsilon can indeed be achieved. We stress that there seems to be an \eta-problem, however, suggesting that none of the models in this class are viable from a cosmological point of view at least at large volume, small string coupling, and leading order in the \alpha'-expansion.
