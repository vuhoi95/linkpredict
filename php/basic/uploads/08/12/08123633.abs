Title: Two Loop R-Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We analyze two loop quantum corrections for pseudomoduli in O'Raifeartaigh like models. We argue that R-symmetry can be spontaneously broken at two loop in non supersymmetric vacua. We provide a basic example with this property. We discuss on phenomenological applications.
