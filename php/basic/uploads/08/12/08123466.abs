Title: Three types of statistics and the entropy bounds
Authors: Yong Xiao and Yi-Xin Chen
Abstract: We investigated the entropy bounds of the three types of statistics: para-Bose, para-Fermi and infinite statistics. We showed that the entropy bounds of the conventional Bose, Fermi statistics and their generalizations to parastatistics obey the $A^{3/4}$ law, while the entropy bound of infinite statistics obeys the area law. This suggests a close relationship between infinite statistics and quantum gravity.
