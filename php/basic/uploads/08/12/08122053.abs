Title: Horizon formation and far-from-equilibrium isotropization in  supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the creation and evolution of anisotropic, homogeneous strongly coupled $\mathcal N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. In the dual gravitational description, this corresponds to horizon formation in a geometry driven to be anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions.
