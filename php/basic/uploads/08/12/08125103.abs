Title: Curvature-corrected dilatonic black holes and black hole -- string  transition
Authors: Dmitri V. Gal'tsov and Evgeny A. Davydov
Abstract: We investigate extremal charged black hole solutions in the four-dimensional string frame Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the Maxwell field and the dilaton. Without curvature corrections, the extremal electrically charged dilatonic black holes have singular horizon and zero Bekenstein entropy. When the Gauss-Bonnet term is switched on, the horizon radius expands to a finite value provided curvature corrections are strong enough. Below a certain threshold value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling the extremal black hole solutions cease to exist. Since decreasing Gauss-Bonnet coupling corresponds to decreasing string coupling $g_s$, the situation can tentatively be interpreted as classical indication on the black hole -- string transition. Previously the extremal dilaton black holes were studied in the Einstein-frame version of the Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Here we work in the string frame version of this theory with the S-duality symmetric dilaton function as required by the heterotic string theory.
