Abstract: Linearized equations of motion for gravitational and scalar fields are found and solved in a stabilized brane world model in five-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory. The physical degrees of freedom are isolated, the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein excitations is found and the coupling constants of these excitations to matter on the negative tension brane are calculated.
