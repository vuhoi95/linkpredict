Title: Manifest spin 2 duality with electric and magnetic sources
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Cedric Troessaert
Abstract: We extend the formulation of spin 2 fields on Minkowski space which makes the action manifestly invariant under duality rotations to the case of interactions with external electric and magnetic sources by adding suitable potentials for the longitudinal and trace parts. In this framework, the string singularity of the linearized Taub-NUT solution is resolved into a Coulomb-like solution. Suitable surface charges to measure energy-momentum and angular momentum of both electric and magnetic type are constructed.
