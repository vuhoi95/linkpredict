Title: First-quantized N=4 Yang-Mills
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Yu-tin Huang and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We present simple first-class-constraint actions and BRST operators for the 4D N=4 superparticle. Each generation of ghosts has 2 super-indices, like the coordinates. The constraints that define projective superspace close in a super Yang-Mills background due to the presence of a (non-central) U(1) generator in the algebra.
