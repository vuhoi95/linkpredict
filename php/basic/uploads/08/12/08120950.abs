Abstract: We find the dual equivalent (gauge invariant) version of the Maxwell theory in D=4 with a Proca-like mass term by using the symplectic embedding method. The dual theory obtained (Maxwell-Podolsky) includes a higher-order derivative term and preserve the gauge symmetry. We also furnish an investigation of the pole structure of the vector propagator by the residue matrix which considers the eventual existence of the negative-norm of the theory.
