Title: Gravitational corrections to the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Jose Manuel Davila and Christian Schubert
Abstract: We use the worldline formalism for calculating the one-loop effective action for the Einstein-Maxwell background induced by charged scalars or spinors, in the limit of low energy and weak gravitational field but treating the electromagnetic field nonperturbatively. The effective action is obtained in a form which generalizes the standard proper-time representation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. We compare with previous work and discuss possible applications.
