Abstract: In a 4D four-fermion model we study the dynamical restoration of Lorentz and CPT symmetries at finite temperature. We evaluate the gap equation both at zero and at finite temperature and observe that, depending on the parameters of the theory, there is a critical temperature at which the Lorentz and CPT symmetries are restored.
