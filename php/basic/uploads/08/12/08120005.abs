Title: Stationary Measure in the Multiverse
Authors: Andrei Linde and Vitaly Vanchurin and Sergei Winitzki
Abstract: We study the recently proposed "stationary measure" in the context of the string landscape scenario. We show that it suffers neither from the "Boltzmann brain" problem nor from the "youngness" paradox that makes some other measures predict a high CMB temperature at present. We also demonstrate a satisfactory performance of this measure in predicting the results of local experiments, such as proton decay.
