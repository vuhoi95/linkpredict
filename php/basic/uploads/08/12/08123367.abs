Title: Scattering in Mass-Deformed N>=4 Chern-Simons Models
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal and Niklas Beisert and Tristan McLoughlin
Abstract: We investigate the scattering matrix in mass-deformed N>=4 Chern-Simons models including as special cases the BLG and ABJM theories of multiple M2 branes. Curiously the structure of this scattering matrix in three spacetime dimensions is equivalent to (a) the two-dimensional worldsheet matrix found in the context of AdS/CFT integrability and (b) the R-matrix of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. The underlying reason is that all three models are based on an extension of the psu(2|2) superalgebra which constrains the matrix completely. We also compute scattering amplitudes in one-loop field theory and find perfect agreement with scattering unitarity.
