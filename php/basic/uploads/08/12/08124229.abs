Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Wilson loops in the four-dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. In the gauge theory side, it is known that the expectation value of the Wilson loops of circular shape with winding number k is calculable by using a Gaussian matrix model. On the other hand, in the gravity side, it has been conjectured that the expectation value of the Wilson loop is given by the classical value of the action for a probe D3-brane with k electric fluxes. Given such correspondence, we pursue the interpretation of the matrix model eigenvalue density, or more precisely the resolvent, from the viewpoint of the probe D3-brane in the gravity side. We see that in the gravity side, the position of an eigenvalue appears as an integrated flux on the D3-brane. In the course of our analysis, we also clarify the boundary condition on the D3-brane in terms of the Wilson loop.
