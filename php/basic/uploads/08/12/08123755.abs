Title: Modification of Heisenberg uncertainty relations in non-commutative  Snyder space-time geometry
Authors: Marco Valerio Battisti and Stjepan Meljanac
Abstract: We show that the Euclidean Snyder non-commutative space implies infinitely many different physical predictions. The distinct frameworks are specified by generalized uncertainty relations underlying deformed Heisenberg algebras. Considering the one-dimensional case in the minisuperspace arena, the bouncing Universe dynamics of loop quantum cosmology can be recovered.
