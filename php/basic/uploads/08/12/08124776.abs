Title: Form factors of descendant operators: Free field construction and  reflection relations
Authors: Boris Feigin and Michael Lashkevich
Abstract: The free field representation for form factors in the sinh-Gordon model and the sine-Gordon model in the breather sector is modified to describe the form factors of descendant operators, which are obtained from the exponential ones, $\e^{\i\alpha\phi}$, by means of the action of the Heisenberg algebra associated to the field $\phi(x)$. As a check of the validity of the construction we count the numbers of operators defined by the form factors at each level in each chiral sector. Another check is related to the so called reflection relations, which identify in the breather sector the descendants of the exponential fields $\e^{\i\alpha\phi}$ and $\e^{\i(2\alpha_0-\alpha)\phi}$ for generic values of $\alpha$. We prove the operators defined by the obtained families of form factors to satisfy such reflection relations. A generalization of the construction for form factors to the kink sector is also proposed.
