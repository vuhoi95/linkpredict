Title: More about the new non-selfdual axially symmetric SU(2) calorons
Authors: Ya. M. Shnir and E. -M. Ilgenfritz
Abstract: We describe the recently found non-selfdual axially symmetric caloron solutions of SU(2) gluodynamics with trivial holonomy. We present the local Polyakov loop together with the action and topological charge density. Different from the well-known KvBLL calorons, the calorons considered here are composed out of pseudoparticle constituents carrying integer topological charge. The loci of Polyakov loop L = -1 correspond to the loci of Higgs field zeroes for corresponding solutions of the Yang-Mills Higgs system. For certain parameters pointlike monopole pairs turn into rings.
