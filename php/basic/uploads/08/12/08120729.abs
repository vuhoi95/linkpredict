Title: The 1+1 Dimensional Abelian Higgs Model Revisited: Non-perturbative  Dynamics in the Physical Sector
Authors: Laure Gouba and Jan Govaerts
Abstract: In this paper the two dimensional Abelian Higgs model is revisited. We show that in the physical sector, this model describes the coupling of the electric field to the radial part, in field space, of the complex scalar field.
