Title: Canonical formalism of the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation
Authors: V. O. Soloviev and M. V. Tchichikina
Abstract: The Hamiltonian of the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation (RTG) with nonzero graviton mass is derived. Scalar field is taken as a matter source. The second class constraints are excluded and Dirac brackets are obtained. There are no first class constraints in the theory. The Poincare group generators are found by specifying the family of hypersurfaces and the Poincare algebra is realized in Dirac brackets. This is in accordance with the statement that there are 10 conservation laws in the RTG.
