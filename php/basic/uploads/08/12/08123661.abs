Title: Minimal gauged U(1)_{B-L} model with spontaneous R-parity violation
Authors: Vernon Barger and Pavel Fileviez Perez and Sogee Spinner
Abstract: We study the minimal gauged U(1)_{B-L} supersymmetric model and show that it provides an attractive theory for spontaneous R-parity violation. Both U(1)_{B-L} and R-parity are broken by the vacuum expectation value of the right-handed sneutrino (proportional to the soft SUSY masses), thereby linking the B-L and soft SUSY scales. In this context we find a consistent mechanism for generating neutrino masses and a realistic mass spectrum, all without extending the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetry standard model. We discuss the most relevant collider signals and the connection between the Z' gauge boson and R-parity violation.
