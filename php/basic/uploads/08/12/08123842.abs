Title: Coulomb gauge ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential
Authors: M. Quandt and G. Burgio and S. Chimchinda and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: The ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential are evaluated in Coulomb gauge on the lattice, using an improved gauge fixing scheme which includes the residual symmetry. This setting has been shown to be essential in order to explain the scaling violations in the instantaneous gluon propagator. We find that both the ghost propagator and the Coulomb potential are insensitive to the Gribov problem or the details of the residual gauge fixing, even if the Coulomb potential is evaluated from the A0--propagator instead of the Coulomb kernel. In particular, no signs of scaling violations could be found in either quantity, at least to well below the numerical accuracy where these violations were visible for the gluon propagator. The Coulomb potential from the A0-propagator is shown to be in qualitative agreement with the (formally equivalent) expression evaluated from the Coulomb kernel.
