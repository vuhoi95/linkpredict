Title: Classical electron model with non static conformal symmetry
Authors: I. Radinschi and F. Rahaman and M. Kalam and K. Chakraborty
Abstract: Lorentz proposed a classical model of electron in which electron was assumed to have only 'electromagnetic mass'. We modeled electron as charged anisotropic perfect fluid sphere admitting non static conformal symmetry. It is noticed that the pressure and density fail to be regular at the origin but effective gravitational mass is regular everywhere and vanishes at the limit r->0 i.e. it does not have to tolerate the problem of singularity. Further, we have matched interior metric with exterior (Reissner-Nordstr\"om) metric and determine the values of the parameters k and r_0 (occurring in the solutions) in functions of mass, charge and radius of the spherically symmetric charged objects i.e. electron.
