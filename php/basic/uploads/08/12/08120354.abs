Title: Odderon in Gauge/String Duality
Authors: Richard C. Brower and Marko DjuriÄ‡ and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: At high energies, elastic hadronic cross sections, such as $pp, \overline p p, \pi^{\pm} p$, are dominated by vacuum exchange, which in leading order of the $1/N_c$ expansion has been identified as the BFKL Pomeron or its strong AdS dual the closed string Reggeized graviton \cite{Brower:2006ea}. However the difference of particle anti-particle cross sections are given by a so-called Odderon, carrying C = -1 vacuum quantum numbers identified in weak coupling with odd numbers of exchanged gluons. Here we show that in the dual description the Odderon is the Reggeized Kalb-Ramond field ($B_{\mu\nu}$) in the Neveu-Schwartz sector of closed string theory. To first order in strong coupling, the high energy contribution of Odderon is evaluated for ${\cal N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills by a generalization of the gravity dual analysis for Pomeron in Ref. \cite{Brower:2006ea}. The consequence of confinement on the Odderon are estimated in the confining QCD-like $AdS^5$ hardwall model of Polchinski and Strassler \cite{Polchinski:2001tt}.
