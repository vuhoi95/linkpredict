Title: Chiral black hole in three-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons
Authors: Wontae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: A chiral black hole can be defined from the three-dimensional pure gravitational Chern-Simons action as an independent gravitational theory. The third order derivative of the Cotton tensor gives a dimensional constant which plays a role of the cosmological constant. The handedness of angular momentum depends on the signature of the Chern-Simons coefficient. Even in the massless black hole which corresponds to the static black hole, it has a nonvanishing angular momentum. We also study statistical entropy and thermodynamic stability.
