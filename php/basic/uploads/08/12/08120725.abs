Title: Classes of f-Deformed Landau Operators: Nonlinear Noncommutative  Coordinates from Algebraic Representations
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Jan Govaerts and M. N. Hounkonnou
Abstract: We consider, in a superspace, new operator dependent noncommutative (NC) geometries of the nonlinear quantum Hall limit related to classes of f-deformed Landau operators in the spherical harmonic well. Different NC coordinate algebras are determined using unitary representation spaces of Fock-Heisenberg tensored algebras and of the Schwinger-Fock realisation of the su(1,1) Lie algebra. A reduced model allowing an underlying N=2 superalgebra is also discussed.
