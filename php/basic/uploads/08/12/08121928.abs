Title: Quantum quenches from integrability: the fermionic pairing model
Authors: Alexandre Faribault and Pasquale Calabrese and Jean-Sebastien Caux
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of extended quantum systems after the trigger of a sudden, global perturbation (quench) represents a daunting challenge, especially in the presence of interactions. The main difficulties stem from both the vanishing time scale of the quench event, which can thus create arbitrarily high energy modes, and its non-local nature, which curtails the utility of local excitation bases. We here show that nonperturbative methods based on integrability can prove sufficiently powerful to completely characterize quantum quenches: we illustrate this using a model of fermions with pairing interactions (Richardson's model). The effects of simple (and multiple) quenches on the dynamics of various important observables are discussed. Many of the features we find are expected to be universal to all kinds of quench situations in atomic physics and condensed matter.
