Title: Moduli Webs and Superpotentials for Five-Branes
Authors: Marco Baumgartl and Simon Wood
Abstract: We investigate the one-parameter Calabi-Yau models and identify families of D5-branes which are associated to lines embedded in these manifolds. The moduli spaces are given by sets of Riemann curves, which form a web whose intersection points are described by permutation branes. We arrive at a geometric interpretation for bulk-boundary correlators as holomorphic differentials on the moduli space and use this to compute effective open-closed superpotentials to all orders in the open string couplings. The fixed points of D5-brane moduli under bulk deformations are determined.
