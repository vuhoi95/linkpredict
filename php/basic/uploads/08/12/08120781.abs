Title: Comments on Bounds on Central Charges in N=1 Superconformal Theories
Authors: Andrei Parnachev and Shlomo S. Razamat
Abstract: The ratio of central charges in four-dimensional CFTs has been suggested by Hofman and Maldacena to lie within an interval whose boundaries are fixed by the number of supersymmetries. We compute this ratio for a set of interacting N=1 superconformal field theories which arise as RG fixed points of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with adjoint and fundamental matter. We do not find violations of the proposed bounds, which appear to be saturated by free field theories.
