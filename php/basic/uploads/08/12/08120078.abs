Title: Plane Gravitational Radiation from Neutrinos Source with Kalb-Ramond  Coupling
Authors: C. N. Ferreira and J. A. Helayel-Neto and N. A. Tomimura
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model based on a non-minimal coupling of neutrinos to a Kalb-Ramond field. The latter is taken as a possible source for gravitational radiation. As an immediate illustration of this system, we have studied the case where gravitational (plane) wave solutions behave as damped harmonic oscillators.
