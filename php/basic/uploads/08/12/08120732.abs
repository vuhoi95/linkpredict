Title: The 1+1 Dimensional Abelian Higgs Model Revisited: Physical Sector and  Solitons
Authors: Laure Gouba and Jan Govaerts and M. Norbert Hounkonnou
Abstract: In this paper the two dimensional abelian Higgs model is revisited. We show that in the physical sector, the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations include solitons.
