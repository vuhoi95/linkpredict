Title: No metastable de Sitter vacua in N=2 supergravity with only  hypermultiplets
Authors: Marta Gomez-Reino and Jan Louis and Claudio A. Scrucca
Abstract: We study the stability of vacua with spontaneously broken supersymmetry in N=2 supergravity theories with only hypermultiplets. Focusing on the projection of the scalar mass matrix along the sGoldstino directions, we are able to derive a universal upper bound on the lowest mass eigenvalue. This bound only depends on the gravitino mass and the cosmological constant, but not on the details of the quaternionic manifold spanned by the scalar fields. Comparing with the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound shows that metastability requires the cosmological constant to be smaller than a certain negative critical value. Therefore, only AdS vacua with a sufficiently negative cosmological constant can be stable, while Minkowski and dS vacua necessarily have a tachyonic direction.
