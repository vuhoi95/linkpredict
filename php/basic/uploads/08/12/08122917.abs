Title: Gravity Waves from Tachyonic Preheating after Hybrid Inflation
Authors: Jean Francois Dufaux and Gary N. Felder and Lev Kofman and Olga Navros
Abstract: We study the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced from preheating in hybrid inflation models. We investigate different dynamical regimes of preheating in these models and we compute the resulting gravity wave spectra using analytical estimates and numerical simulations. We discuss the dependence of the gravity wave frequencies and amplitudes on the various potential parameters. We find that large regions of the parameter space leads to gravity waves that may be observable in upcoming interferometric experiments, including Advanced LIGO, but this generally requires very small coupling constants.
