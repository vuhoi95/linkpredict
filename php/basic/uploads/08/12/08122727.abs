Title: Unbounded Multi-Magnon and Spike
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We generalize the one magnon solution in R X S^2 to unbounded M magnon and find the corresponding solitonic string configuration in the string sigma model. This configuration gives rise to the expected dispersion relation obtained from the spin chain model in the large 't Hooft coupling limit. After considering (M,M) multi-magnon or spike on R X S^2 X S^2 as a subspace of AdS(5)XS^5 or AdS(4)XCP^3, we investigate the dispersion relation and the finite size effect for (M,M) multi-magnon or spike.
