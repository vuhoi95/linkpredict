Authors: Jong-Hyun Baek and Seungjoon Hyun and Wooje Jang and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We study the membrane scattering in the three-dimensional N=6 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory recently constructed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena and conjectured to be dual to M-theory on $AdS_4 \times S^7/Z_k$. We compute the one-loop effective action up to the $v^4$ terms in the derivative expansion and find exact agreement with the results from the supergravity computations. In particular, our results imply that the $v^2$ term is not renormalized and tree-level exact.
