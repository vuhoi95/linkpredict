Title: D-dimensional Randall-Sundrum models from Brans-Dicke theory and  Kaluza-Klein modes
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Cristine N. Ferreira
Abstract: We investigate the spectroscopy of scalar and vector Kaluza-Klein modes that arise in a deformed Randall-Sundrum model that is constructed from Brans-Dicke theory. The non-minimal coupling in the Brans Dicke theory translates into a deformation of the Randall-Sundrum geometry that depends on the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. We find that the $\omega$ parameter has a non-trivial effect in the spectroscopy of scalar and vector Kaluza-Klein modes. Our results suggest the interpretation of $\omega$ as a fine-tuning parameter.
