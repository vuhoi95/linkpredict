Title: 1/N Effects in Non-Relativistic Gauge-Gravity Duality
Authors: Allan Adams and Alexander Maloney and Aninda Sinha and Samuel E. Vazquez
Abstract: We argue that higher-curvature terms in the gravitational Lagrangian lead, via non-relativistic gauge-gravity duality, to finite renormalization of the dynamical exponent of the dual conformal field theory. Our argument includes a proof of the non-renormalization of the Schrodinger and Lifshitz metrics beyond rescalings of their parameters, directly generalizing the AdS case. We use this effect to construct string-theory duals of non-relativistic critical systems with non-integer dynamical exponents, then use these duals to predict the viscosity/entropy ratios of these systems. The predicted values weakly violate the KSS bound.
