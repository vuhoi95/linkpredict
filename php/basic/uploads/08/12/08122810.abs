Title: Consistent gravitational anomalies for chiral bosons
Authors: Stefano Giaccari and Pietro Menotti
Abstract: Exact consistent gravitational anomalies for chiral bosons in two dimensions are treated both with the Schwinger-DeWitt regularization and independently through a cohomological procedure. The diffeomorphism transformations are described by a single ghost which allows to climb the cohomological chain in a unique way.
