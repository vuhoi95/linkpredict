Abstract: In this work, we focus on some properties of the parity-even sector of the CPT-even electrodynamics of the standard model extension. We analyze how the six non-birefringent terms belonging to this sector modify the static and stationary classical solutions of the usual Maxwell theory. We observe that the parity-even terms do not couple the electric and magnetic sectors (at least in the stationary regime). The Green's method is used to obtain solutions for the field strengths E and B at first order in the Lorentz- covariance-violating parameters. Explicit solutions are attained for point-like and spatially extended sources, for which a dipolar expansion is achieved. Finally, it is presented an Earth-based experiment that can lead (in principle) to an upper bound on the anisotropic coefficients as stringent as $(\widetilde{\kappa}_{e-}) ^{ij}<2.9\times10^{-20}.$
