Title: A note on the quartic effective action of type IIB superstring
Authors: Giuseppe Policastro and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We recast the result of our recent computation of the quartic action of ten-dimensional IIB supergravity in a manifestly SL(2,R)-covariant form. This affords us a critical assessment of an earlier conjecture in the literature.
