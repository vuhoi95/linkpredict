Title: Spiky Strings and Spin Chains
Authors: Nick Dorey and Manuel Losi
Abstract: We determine spectral curves for the known spiky string solutions in AdS space in the limit of large angular momentum. We also construct generic multi-spike solutions in this limit and compute the corresponding spectral data. The resulting spectral curves precisely match those of the classical spin chain describing the dual operators in one-loop gauge theory. Our results confirm the map between string theory and gauge theory degrees of freedom proposed in arXiv:0805.4387 [hep-th].
