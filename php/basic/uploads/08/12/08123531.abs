Title: New AdS non Abelian black holes with superconducting horizons
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of higher dimensional asymptotically AdS non Abelian black holes with a Ricci flat event horizon and analyze their basic properties. Unlike higher dimensional black holes with a curved horizon, of the usual Einstein-Yang-Mills system, these solutions have finite mass-energy. Below some non-zero critical temperature, they are thermodynamically preferred over the Abelian configurations.
