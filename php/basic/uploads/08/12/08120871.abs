Title: The Principle of Relativity, Kinematics and Algebraic Relations
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Chao-Guang Huang and Hong-Tu Wu and Bin Zhou
Abstract: Based on the principle of relativity and the postulate on universal invariant constants (c,l), all possible kinematics can be set up with sub-symmetries of the Umov-Weyl-Fock transformations for the inertial motions. Further, in the combinatory approach, all these symmetries are intrinsically related to each other, e.g. to the very important dS kinematics for the cosmic scale physics.
