Title: Noncommutative Quantum Cosmology
Authors: C. Bastos and O. Bertolami and N. Dias and J. Prata
Abstract: One presents a phase-space noncommutative extension of Quantum Cosmology in the context of a Kantowski-Sachs (KS) minisuperspace model. We obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation for the noncommutative system through the ADM formalism and a suitable Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting WDW equation explicitly depends on the phase-space noncommutative parameters, $\theta$ and $\eta$. Numerical solutions of the noncommutative WDW equation are found and, interestingly, also bounds on the values of the noncommutative parameters. Moreover, we conclude that the noncommutativity in the momenta sector leads to a damped wave function implying that this type of noncommutativity can be relevant for a selection of possible initial states for the universe.
