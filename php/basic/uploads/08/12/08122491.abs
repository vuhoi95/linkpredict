Title: Monochromatic plane-fronted waves in conformal gravity are pure gauge
Authors: Luca Fabbri and M. B. Paranjape
Abstract: We consider plane-fronted, monochromatic gravitational waves on a Minkowski background, in a conformally invariant theory of general relativity. By this we mean waves of the form: $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+\epsilon_{\mu\nu}F(k\cdotx)$, where $\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$ is a constant polarization tensor, and $k_\mu$ is a lightlike vector. We also assume the coordinate gauge condition $|g|-1/4\partial_\tau(|g|1/4g^{\sigma\tau})=0$ which is the conformal analog of the harmonic gauge condition $g^{\mu\nu}\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^\sigma=-|g|-1/2\partial_\tau(|g|1/2g^{\sigma\tau})=0, where $\det[g_{\mu\nu}]\equivg$. Requiring additionally the conformal gauge condition $g=-1$ surprisingly implies that the waves are both transverse and traceless. Although the ansatz for the metric is eminently reasonable when considering perturbative gravitational waves, we show that the metric is reducible to the metric of Minkowski space-time via a sequence of coordinate transformations which respect the gauge conditions, without any perturbative approximation that \in{\mu}{\nu} be small. This implies that we have, in fact, exact plane-wave solutions; however, they are simply coordinate/conformal artifacts. As a consequence, they carry no energy. Our result does not imply that conformal gravity does not have gravitational wave phenomena. A different, more generalized ansatz for the deviation, taking into account the fourth-order nature of the field equation, which has the form $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+B_{\mu\nu}(n\cdotx)G(k\cdotx)$, indeed yields waves which carry energy and momentum [P.D. Mannheim, Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 43, 703 (2010)]. It is just surprising that transverse, traceless, plane-fronted gravitational waves, those that would be used in any standard, perturbative, quantum analysis of the theory, simply do not exist.
