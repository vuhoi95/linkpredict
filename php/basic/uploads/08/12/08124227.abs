Title: Quantum-gravitational corrections to the hydrogen atom and harmonic  oscillator
Authors: Michael Maziashvili and Zurab Silagadze
Abstract: It is shown that the rate of corrections to the hydrogen atom and harmonic oscillator due to profound quantum-gravitational effect of space-time dimension running/reduction coincides well with those obtained by means of the minimum-length deformed quantum mechanics. The rate of corrections are pretty much the same within the accuracy by which we can judge the quantum-gravitational corrections at all. Such a convergence of results makes the concept of space-time dimension running more appreciable. As a remarkable distinction, the energy shift due to dimension reduction has the opposite sign as compared with the correction obtained by means of the minimum-length modified quantum mechanics. Thereby, the sign of total quantum-gravitational correction remains obscure.
