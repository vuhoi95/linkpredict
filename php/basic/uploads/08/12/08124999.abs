Title: Towards noncommutative supersymmetric quantum cosmology
Authors: W. Guzm√°n and M. Sabido and J. Socorro
Abstract: Using the factorization approach of quantum mechanics, we obtain a family of iso-spectral scalar potentials for noncommutative quantum cosmology. The family we build is based on a scattering Wheeler-DeWitt solution for the potential $V(\phi)=V_0e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We analyze the effects of noncommutativity on the iso-potentials and the possible relationship between noncommutativity and dark energy.
