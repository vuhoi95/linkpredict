Title: Slavnov-Taylor Identities in Coulomb Gauge Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peter Watson and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: Two aspects of the color charge in Coulomb gauge continuum Yang-Mills theory are discussed. The first aspect is the existence of a conserved and vanishing total charge exhibited within the first order functional formalism. The second aspect is the closure of the set of Slavnov-Taylor identities in the second order functional formalism, such that the exact solution for temporal Green's functions is in principle possible and thereby preserving the color charge.
