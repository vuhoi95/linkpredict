Title: Kerr/CFT correspondence and five-dimensional BMPV black holes
Authors: Hiroshi Isono and Ta-Sheng Tai and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We apply a recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence to extremal supersymmetric five-dimensional charged spinning black holes, constructed by Breckenridge, Myers, Peet and Vafa. By computing the central charge of the dual CFT and Frolov-Thorne temperature, Cardy's formula succeeds in reproducing Bekenstein-Hawking area law.
