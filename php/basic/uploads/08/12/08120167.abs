Title: A scaling law for the cosmological constant from a stochastic model for  cosmic structures
Authors: S. Capozziello and S. Funkhouser
Abstract: A set of scaling laws, based on the stochastic motions of the granular components of astronomical systems, is applied to a cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant. It follows that the mass of the dominant particle in the observable universe must be proportional to the sixth root of the cosmological constant and of the order of the nucleon mass, which is consistent with the Zeldovich scaling law. The approach is a natural way to solve the cosmic coincidence problem. On the other hand, the observed value of the cosmological constant emerges as the result of a scaling law induced by the stochastic mechanism which gives rise to the gravitationally bound systems.
