Title: Jet Quenching in Heavy Ion Collisions from AdS/CFT
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Carlos A. Salgado
Abstract: The phenomenon of jet supression observed in highly energetic heavy ion collisions is discussed. The focus is devoted to the stunning applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe these real time processes, hard to be illuminated by other means. In particular, the introduction of as many flavors as colors into the quark-gluon plasma is scrutinized.
