Title: Defects and Dressed Boundaries in Complex Sine-Gordon Theory
Authors: Peter Bowcock and James Umpleby
Abstract: In this paper we constructed integrable defects in complex sine-Gordon theory. Soliton and particle interactions with the defect are analysed. Defects are used to dress Dirichlet boundaries to create a wider class of integrable boundary conditions to ones previously studied. Properties of these new boundaries including soliton and particle reflections with the boundaries are presented.
