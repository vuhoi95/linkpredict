Title: Quantum Hall Effect in AdS/CFT
Authors: Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Per Kraus
Abstract: Drawing on the connection with superconductivity, we give a simple AdS realization of the quantum Hall effect. The theory includes a statistical gauge field with a Chern-Simons term, in analogy with effective field theory models of the QHE.
