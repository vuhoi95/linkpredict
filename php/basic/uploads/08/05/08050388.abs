Title: Classical Worldsheets for String Scattering on Flat and AdS Spacetime
Authors: Charles M. Sommerfield and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: We present a study of the worldsheets that describe the classical limit of various string scattering processes. Our main focus is on string scattering in AdS spacetime because of its relation via the AdS/CFT correspondence to gluon scattering in {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. But we also consider analogous processes in flat Minkowski spacetime which we compare to the AdS case. In addition to scattering of string by string we also find and study worldsheets describing the scattering of a string by external sources.
