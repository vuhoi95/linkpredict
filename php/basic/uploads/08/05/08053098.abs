Title: Bethe--Salpeter wave functions in integrable models
Authors: Sinya Aoki and Janos Balog and Peter Weisz
Abstract: We investigate some properties of Bethe--Salpeter wave functions in integrable models. In particular we illustrate the application of the operator product expansion in determining the short distance behavior. The energy dependence of the potentials obtained from such wave functions is studied, and further we discuss the (limited) phenomenological significance of zero--energy potentials.
