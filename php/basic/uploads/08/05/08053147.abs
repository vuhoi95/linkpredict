Title: Light front QED$_{1+1}$ at finite temperature
Authors: S. Strauss and M. Beyer
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamic properties of quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED$_{1+1}$) utilizing light front dynamics. Therefore we derive the partition function of the canonical ensemble in discrete light cone quantization, and calculate the thermodynamical potential. This central quantity is evaluated for different system sizes and coupling strengths. We investigate the continuum limit and the thermodynamical limit and present basic thermodynamical quantities such as pressure, energy, and entropy, as a function of temperature for the interacting system. The results are compared to the ideal bosonic and fermionic cases.
