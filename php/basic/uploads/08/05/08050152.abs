Title: Sum rules and dualities for generalized parton distributions: is there a  holographic principle?
Authors: Kresimir Kumericki and Dieter Mueller and Kornelija Passek-Kumericki
Abstract: To leading order approximation, the physical content of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) that is accessible in deep virtual electroproduction of photons or mesons is contained in their value on the cross-over trajectory. This trajectory separates the t-channel and s-channel dominated GPD regions. The underlying Lorentz covariance implies correspondence between these two regions through their relation to GPDs on the cross-over trajectory. This point of view leads to a family of GPD sum rules which are a quark analogue of finite energy sum rules and it guides us to a new phenomenological GPD concept. As an example, we discuss the constraints from the JLab/Hall A data on the dominant u-quark GPD H. The question arises whether GPDs are governed by some kind of holographic principle.
