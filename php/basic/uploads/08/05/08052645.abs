Title: The Space-Cone Gauge, Lorentz Invariance and On-Shell Recursion for  One-Loop Yang-Mills amplitudes
Authors: Diana Vaman and York-Peng Yao
Abstract: Recursion relations are succinctly obtained for $(++... +)$ and $(-++... +)$ amplitudes in the context of the space-cone gauge in QCD. We rely on the helicity symmetry of the problems to dictate our choices of reference twistors and the momentum shifts to complexify the amplitudes. Of great importance is the power of gauge Lorentz invariance, which is enough to determine the soft factors in the latter cases.
