Title: Non-critical string pentagon equations and their solutions
Authors: P. Furlan and V. B. Petkova and M. Stanishkov
Abstract: We derive pentagon type relations for the 3-point boundary tachyon correlation functions in the non-critical open string theory with generic c_{matter} < 1 and study their solutions in the case of FZZ branes. A new general formula for the Liouville 3-point factor is derived.
