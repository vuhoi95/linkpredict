Title: On The Uniqueness of Minimal Coupling in Higher-Spin Gauge Theory
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Serge Leclercq and Per Sundell
Abstract: We address the uniqueness of the minimal couplings between higher-spin fields and gravity. These couplings are cubic vertices built from gauge non-invariant connections that induce non-abelian deformations of the gauge algebra. We show that Fradkin-Vasiliev's cubic 2-s-s vertex, which contains up to 2s-2 derivatives dressed by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, has a limit where: {(i)} $\Lambda\to 0$; {(ii)} the spin-2 Weyl tensor scales {\emph{non-uniformly}} with s; and {(iii)} all lower-derivative couplings are scaled away. For s=3 the limit yields the unique non-abelian spin 2-3-3 vertex found recently by two of the authors, thereby proving the \emph{uniqueness} of the corresponding FV vertex. We extend the analysis to s=4 and a class of spin 1-s-s vertices. The non-universality of the flat limit high-lightens not only the problematic aspects of higher-spin interactions with $\Lambda=0$ but also the strongly coupled nature of the derivative expansion of the fully nonlinear higher-spin field equations with $\L\neq 0$, wherein the standard minimal couplings mediated via the Lorentz connection are \emph{subleading} at energy scales $\sqrt{|\Lambda|}<< E<< M_{\rm p}$. Finally, combining our results with those obtained by Metsaev, we give the complete list of \emph{all} the manifestly covariant cubic couplings of the form 1-s-s and 2-s-s, in Minkowski background.
