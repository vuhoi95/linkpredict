Title: Hot QCD equations of state and RHIC
Authors: Vinod Chandra and Ravindra Kumar and V. Ravishankar
Abstract: We show how hot QCD equations of states can be adapted to make definite predictions for quark-gluon plasma at RHIC. We consider equations of state up to $O(g^5)$ and $O[g^6(ln(1/g)+\delta)]$. Our method involves the extraction of equilibrium distribution functions for gluons and quarks from these equations of state by capturing the the interaction effects entirely in the effective chemical potentials. We further utilize these distribution functions to study the screening length in hot QCD and dissociation phenomenon of heavy quarkonia states by combining this understanding with the semi-classical transport theory.
