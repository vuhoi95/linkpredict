Title: Real Mirror Symmetry for One-parameter Hypersurfaces
Authors: Daniel Krefl and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: We study open string mirror symmetry for one-parameter Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective space. We identify mirror pairs of D-brane configurations, derive the corresponding inhomogeneous Picard-Fuchs equations, and solve for the domainwall tensions as analytic functions over moduli space. Our calculations exemplify several features that had not been seen in previous work on the quintic or local Calabi-Yau manifolds. We comment on the calculation of loop amplitudes.
