Title: 3-dimensional holographic trace anomaly from AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Chong Oh Lee and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We explicitly obtain energy-momentum tensor at the asymptotic 3-dimensional region of Schwarzschild AdS$_4$ and Taub-NUT-(A)dS$_4$ using the so-called `counter-term subtraction method' in Fefferman-Graham coordinate. The energy momentum tensor is presented in a closed form for the AdS$_4$ and for the special case of Taub-NUT-dS and in an asymptotic series for other cases. The result suggests that in light of AdS/CFT correspondence, the 3-dimensional trace anomaly can be expressed in terms of the 3-dimensional volume and Ricci scalar.
