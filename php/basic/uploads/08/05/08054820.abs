Title: Viscosity and thermodynamic properties of QGP in relativistic heavy ion  collisions
Authors: Vinod Chandra and V. Ravishankar
Abstract: We study the viscosity and thermodynamic properties of QGP at RHIC by employing the recently extracted equilibrium distribution functions from two hot QCD equations of state of $O(g^5)$ and $O(g^6\ln(1/g))$ respectively. After obtaining the temperature dependence of energy density, and entropy density, we focus our attention on the determination of shear viscosity for a rapidly expanding interacting plasma, as a function of temperature. We find that interactions significantly decrease the shear viscosity. They decrease the viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/{\mathcal S}$ as well.
