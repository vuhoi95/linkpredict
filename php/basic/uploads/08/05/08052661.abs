Title: Super Schrodinger algebra in AdS/CFT
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss (extended) super Schrodinger algebras obtained as subalgebras of the superconformal algebra psu(2,2|4). The Schrodinger algebra with two spatial dimensions can be embedded into so(4,2). In the superconformal case the embedded algebra may be enhanced to the so-called super Schrodinger algebra. In fact, we find an extended super Schrodinger subalgebra of psu(2,2|4). It contains 24 supercharges (i.e., 3/4 of the original supersymmetries) and the generators of so(6), as well as the generators of the original Schrodinger algebra. In particular, the 24 supercharges come from 16 rigid supersymmetries and half of 16 superconformal ones. Moreover, this superalgebra contains a smaller super Schrodinger subalgebra, which is a supersymmetric extension of the original Schrodinger algebra and so(6) by eight supercharges (half of 16 rigid supersymmetries). It is still a subalgebra even if there are no so(6) generators. We also discuss super Schrodinger subalgebras of the superconformal algebras, osp(8|4) and osp(8^*|4).
