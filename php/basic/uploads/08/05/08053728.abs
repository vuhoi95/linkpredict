Title: Counting Gauge Invariant Operators in SQCD with Classical Gauge Groups
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Noppadol Mekareeya
Abstract: We use the plethystic programme and the Molien-Weyl fomula to compute generating functions, or Hilbert Series, which count gauge invariant operators in SQCD with the SO and Sp gauge groups. The character expansion technique indicates how the global symmetries are encoded in the generating functions. We obtain the full character expansion for each theory with arbitrary numbers of colours and flavours. We study the orientifold action on SQCD with the SU gauge group and examine how it gives rise to SQCD with the SO and Sp gauge groups. We establish that the classical moduli space of SQCD is not only irreducible, but is also an affine Calabi-Yau cone over a weighted projective variety.
