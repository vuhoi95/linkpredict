Title: A Numerical Study of Gluon Scattering Amplitudes in N=4 Super Yang-Mills  Theory at Strong Coupling
Authors: Suguru Dobashi and Katsushi Ito and Koh Iwasaki
Abstract: We study gluon scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling via the AdS/CFT correspondence. We solve numerically the discretized Euler-Lagrange equations on the square worldsheet for the minimal surface with light-like boundaries in AdS spacetime. We evaluate the area of the surface for the 4, 6 and 8-point amplitudes using worldsheet and radial cut-off regularizations. Their infrared singularities in the cut-off regularization are found to agree with the analytical results near the cusp less than 5% at 520x520 lattice points.
