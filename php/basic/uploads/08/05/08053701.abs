Title: One-Loop Riemann Surfaces in Schnabl Gauge
Authors: Michael Kiermaier and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: Due to a peculiar behavior at the open string midpoint, loop diagrams in Schnabl gauge were expected to fail to produce the relevant closed string moduli. We find that closed string moduli are generated because the Riemann surfaces are built with slanted wedges: semi-infinite strips whose edges have parameterizations related by scaling. We examine in detail one-loop string diagrams and find that the closed string modulus is always produced. Moreover, the conformal maps simplify so greatly that both closed and open moduli become simple calculable functions of the Schwinger parameters, a simplification that occurs neither in Siegel gauge nor in light-cone gauge.
