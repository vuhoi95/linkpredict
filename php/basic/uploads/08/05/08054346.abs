Title: On AdS/QCD correspondence and the partonic picture of deep inelastic  scattering
Authors: B. Pire and C. Roiesnel and L. Szymanowski and S. Wallon
Abstract: We critically examine the question of scaling of the Deep Inelastic Scattering process in the medium Bjorken x region on a scalar boson in the framework of the AdS/QCD correspondence. To get the right polarization structure of the forward electroproduction amplitude, we show that one needs to add (at least) the scalar to scalar and scalar to vector hadronic amplitudes. This illustrates how the partonic picture may emerge from a simple scenario based on the AdS/QCD correspondence, provided one allows the conformal dimension of the hadronic field to equal 1 and use the concept of "hadron - parton duality" .
