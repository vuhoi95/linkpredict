Title: A Lagrangean formalism for Hermitean matrix models
Authors: R. Flume and J. Grossehelweg and A. Klitz
Abstract: Eynard's formulation of Hermitean 1-matrix models in terms of intrinsic quantities of an associated hyperelliptic Riemann surface is rephrased as a Lagrangean field theory of a scalar particle propagating on the hyperelliptic surface with multiple self-interactions and particle-source interactions. Both types of interaction take place at the branch points of the hyperelliptic surface.
