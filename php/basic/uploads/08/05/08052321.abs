Title: Exact Effective action for (1+1)-dimensional fermions in an Abelian  background at finite temperature and chemical potential
Authors: Soraya G. Maciel and Silvana Perez
Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of a nonzero chemical potential in the effective action for massless fermions in (1+1) dimensions in an abelian gauge field background at finite temperature. We calculate the n-point function and show that the structure of the amplitudes corresponds to a generalization of the structure noted earlier in a calculation without a chemical potential (the associated integrals carry the dependence on the chemical potential). Our calculation shows that the chiral anomaly is unaffected by the presence of a chemical potential at finite temperature. However, unlike the earlier calculation (in the absence of a chemical potential) odd point functions do not vanish. We trace this to the fact that in the presence of a chemical potential the generalized charge conjugation symmetry of the theory allows for such amplitudes. In fact, we find that all the even point functions are even functions of the chemical potential while the odd point functions are odd functions of it which is consistent with this generalized charge conjugation symmetry. We show that the origin of the structure of the amplitudes is best seen from a formulation of the theory in terms of left and right handed spinors. The calculations are also much simpler in this formulation and it clarifies many other aspects of the theory.
