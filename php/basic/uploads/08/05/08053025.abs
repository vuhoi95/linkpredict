Title: Exact Multi-Restricted Schur Polynomial Correlators
Authors: Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Robert de Mello Koch and Michael Stephanou
Abstract: We derive a product rule satisfied by restricted Schur polynomials. We focus mostly on the case that the restricted Schur polynomial is built using two matrices, although our analysis easily extends to more than two matrices. This product rule allows us to compute exact multi-point correlation functions of restricted Schur polynomials, in the free field theory limit. As an example of the use of our formulas, we compute two point functions of certain single trace operators built using two matrices and three point functions of certain restricted Schur polynomials, exactly, in the free field theory limit. Our results suggest that gravitons become strongly coupled at sufficiently high energy, while the restricted Schur polynomials for totally antisymmetric representations remain weakly interacting at these energies. This is in perfect accord with the half-BPS (single matrix) results of hep-th/0512312. Finally, by studying the interaction of two restricted Schur polynomials we suggest a physical interpretation for the labels of the restricted Schur polynomial: the composite operator $\chi_{R,(r_n,r_m)}(Z,X)$ is constructed from the half BPS ``partons'' $\chi_{r_n}(Z)$ and $\chi_{r_m}(X)$.
