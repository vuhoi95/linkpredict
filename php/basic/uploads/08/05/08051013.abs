Title: Towards Open String Mirror Symmetry for One-Parameter Calabi-Yau  Hypersurfaces
Authors: Johanna Knapp and Emanuel Scheidegger
Abstract: This work is concerned with branes and differential equations for one-parameter Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. For a certain class of B-branes we derive the inhomogeneous Picard--Fuchs equations satisfied by the brane superpotential. In this way we arrive at a prediction for the real BPS invariants for holomorphic maps of worldsheets with low Euler characteristics, ending on the mirror A-branes.
