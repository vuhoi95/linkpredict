Authors: M. A. Anacleto and C. Furtado and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper, we use gauge embedding procedure and master action approach to establish the equivalence between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models with Lorentz symmetry breaking. As a result, new kinds of Lorentz-breaking terms arise.
