Title: Chiral condensate in nuclear matter with vacuum corrections
Authors: Wei-Zhou Jiang and Bao-An Li
Abstract: Within the relativistic Hartree approach using a Lagrangian with density-dependent parameters respecting the chiral limit, it is found that the vacuum corrections from the nucleon Dirac sea soften the equation of state and favor the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities.
