Title: Anomaly Conditions for Non-Abelian Finite Family Symmetries
Authors: Christoph Luhn and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: Assuming that finite family symmetries are gauged, we derive discrete anomaly conditions for various non-Abelian groups. We thus provide new constraints for flavor model building, in which discrete non-Abelian symmetries are employed to explain the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern in the lepton sector.
