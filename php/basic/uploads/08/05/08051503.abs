Title: Constraining vectors and axial-vectors in walking technicolour by a  holographic principle
Authors: Dennis D. Dietrich and Chris Kouvaris
Abstract: We use a holographic principle to study the low-energy spectrum of walking technicolour models. In particular, we predict the masses of the axial vectors as well as the decay constants of vectors and axial vectors as functions of the mass of the techni-rho. Given that there are very few nonperturbative techniques to study strongly coupled theories, using holography might provide us with insight into how to constrain the parameters of the low-energy effective action of walking technicolour models. We also compare our results with findings from other setups.
