Title: Analytic Scattering Amplitudes for QCD
Authors: Diana Vaman and York-Peng Yao
Abstract: By analytically continuing QCD scattering amplitudes through specific complexified momenta, one can study and learn about the nature and the consequences of factorization and unitarity. In some cases, when coupled with the largest time equation and gauge invariance requirement, this approach leads to recursion relations, which greatly simplify the construction of multi-gluon scattering amplitudes. The setting for this discussion is in the space-cone gauge.
