Title: A new source for a braneworld cosmological constant from a modified  gravity model in the bulk
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Carla Carvalho and Joao Laia
Abstract: We show that a four-dimensional equation of state for a cosmological constant term arises from a perfect fluid in the bulk in the context of a gravity model where the scalar curvature is non-minimally coupled to the perfect fluid Lagrangian density. The four-dimensional theory is fully determined from the induced equations on the brane, subject to the boundary conditions derived across the brane.
