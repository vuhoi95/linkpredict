Title: The thermal phase transition in a QCD-like holographic model
Authors: Nick Evans and Ed Threlfall
Abstract: We investigate the high temperature phase of a dilaton flow deformation of the AdS/CFT Correspondence. We argue that these geometries should be interpreted as the N=4 gauge theory perturbed by a SO(6) invariant scalar mass and that the high-temperature phase is just the well-known AdS-Schwarzschild solution. We compute, within supergravity, the resulting Hawking-Page phase transition which in this model can be interpreted as a deconfining transition in which the vev for the operator Tr F^2 dissolves. In the presence of quarks the model also displays a simultaneous chiral symmetry restoring transition with the Goldstone mode and other quark bound states dissolving into the thermal bath.
