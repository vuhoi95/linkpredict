Authors: Kyosuke Hotta and Yoshifumi Hyakutake and Takahiro Kubota and Hiroaki Tanida
Abstract: We analyze the symmetry realized asymptotically on the two dimensional boundary of AdS_3 geometry in topologically massive gravity, which consists of the gravitational Chern-Simons term as well as the usual Einstein-Hilbert and negative cosmological constant terms. Our analysis is based on the conventional canonical method and proceeds along the line completely parallel to the original Brown and Henneaux's. In spite of the presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term, it is confirmed by the canonical method that the boundary theory actually has the conformal symmetry satisfying the left and right moving Virasoro algebras. The central charges of the Virasoro algebras are computed explicitly and are shown to be left-right asymmetric due to the gravitational Chern-Simons term. It is also argued that the Cardy's formula for the BTZ black hole entropy capturing all higher derivative corrections agrees with the extended version of the Wald's entropy formula. The M5-brane system is illustrated as an application of the present calculation.
