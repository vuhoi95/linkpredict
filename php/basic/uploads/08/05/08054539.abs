Title: Non-Abelian Strings in Hot or Dense QCD
Authors: Eiji Nakano and Muneto Nitta and Taeko Matsuura
Abstract: Different types of non-Abelian vortex-strings appear in dense or hot QCD, both of which possess non-Abelian internal orientation zero modes. We calculate the interaction between them and find the universal repulsion for dense QCD (color superconductivity) and the dependence on the orientations for hot QCD (chirally broken phase). This is a review article based on our papers arXiv:0708.4092 and arXiv:0708.4096.
