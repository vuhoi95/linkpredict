Title: Membranes on Calibrations
Authors: Chethan Krishnan and Carlo Maccaferri
Abstract: M2-branes can blow up into BPS funnels that end on calibrated intersections of M5-branes. In this quick note, we make the observation that the constraints required for the consistency of these solutions are automatic in Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory, thanks to the fundamental identity and the supersymmetry of the calibration. We use this to explain how the previous ad hoc fuzzy funnel constructions emerge in this picture, and make some comments about the role of the 3-algebra trace form in the derivation.
