Title: Towards a New Proof of Anderson Localization
Authors: Robert Brandenberger and Walter Craig
Abstract: The wave function of a non-relativistic particle in a periodic potential admits oscillatory solutions, the Bloch waves. In the presence of a random noise contribution to the potential the wave function is localized. We outline a new proof of this Anderson localization phenomenon in one spatial dimension, extending the classical result to the case of a periodic background potential. The proof makes use of techniques previously developed to study the effects of noise on reheating in inflationary cosmology, employing methods of random matrix theory.
