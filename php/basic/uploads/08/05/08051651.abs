Title: Quantum Mechanics of Proca Fields
Authors: Farhad Zamani and Ali Mostafazadeh
Abstract: We construct the most general physically admissible positive-definite inner product on the space of Proca fields. Up to a trivial scaling this defines a five-parameter family of Lorentz invariant inner products that we use to construct a genuine Hilbert space for the quantum mechanics of Proca fields. If we identify the generator of time-translations with the Hamiltonian, we obtain a unitary quantum system that describes first-quantized Proca fields and does not involve the conventional restriction to the positive-frequency fields. We provide a rather comprehensive analysis of this system. In particular, we examine the conserved current density responsible for the conservation of the probabilities, explore the global gauge symmetry underlying the conservation of the probabilities, obtain a probability current density, construct position, momentum, helicity, spin, and angular momentum operators, and determine the localized Proca fields. We also compute the generalized parity ($\cP$), generalized time-reversal ($\cT$), and generalized charge or chirality ($\cC$) operators for this system and offer a physical interpretation for its $\cP\cT$-, $\cC$-, and $\cC\cP\cT$-symmetries.
