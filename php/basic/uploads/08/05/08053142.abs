Title: q-deformed su(2|2) boundary S-matrices via the ZF algebra
Authors: Rajan Murgan and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: Beisert and Koroteev have recently found a bulk S-matrix corresponding to a q-deformation of the centrally-extended su(2|2) algebra of AdS/CFT. We formulate the associated Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra, using which we derive factorizable boundary S-matrices that generalize those of Hofman and Maldacena.
