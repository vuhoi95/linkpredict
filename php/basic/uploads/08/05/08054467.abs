Title: Path and Path Deviation equations of Fractal Space-Times: A Brief  Introduction
Authors: M. E. Kahil and T. Harko
Abstract: The idea that the quantum space-time of microphysics may be fractal everywhere was intensively investigated recently, and several authors have presented the geodesic equations of different fractal space - times. In the present work we obtain the geodesic and the geodesic deviation equations in fractal space-times by using the Bazanski method. We also extend this approach to obtain the equations of motion for spinning and spinning charged particles in the above-mentioned spaces, in a similar way to their counterparts in Riemannian geometry.
