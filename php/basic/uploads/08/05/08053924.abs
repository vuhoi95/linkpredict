Title: Generating technique for $U(1)^3 5D$ supergravity
Authors: Dmitri V. Gal'tsov and Nikolai G. Scherbluk
Abstract: We develop generating technique for solutions of $U(1)^3 5D$ supergravity via dimensional reduction to three dimensions. This theory, which recently attracted attention in connection with black rings, can be viewed as consistent truncation of the $T^6$ compactification of the eleven-dimensional supergravity. Its further reduction to three dimensions accompanied by dualisation of the vector fields leads to 3D gravity coupled sigma model on the homogeneous space $SO(4,4)/SO(4)\times SO(4)$ or $SO(4,4)/SO(2,2)\times SO(2,2)$ depending on the signature of the three-space. We construct a $8\times 8$ matrix representation of these cosets in terms of lower-dimensional blocks. Using it we express solution generating transformations in terms of the potentials and identify those preserving asymptotic conditions relevant to black holes and black rings. As an application, we derive the doubly rotating black hole solution with three independent charges. A suitable contraction of the above cosets is used to construct a new representation of the coset $G_{2(2)}/(SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R))$ relevant for minimal five-dimensional supergravity.
