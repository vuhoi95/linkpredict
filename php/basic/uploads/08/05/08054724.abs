Abstract: The construction of a generic representation of $g\ell(n+1)$ or of the trigonomentric deformation of its enveloping algebra known as algebraic induction is conveniently formulated in term of Lax matrices. The Lax matrix of the constructed representation factorises into parts determined by the Lax matrix of a generic representation of the algebra with reduced rank and others appearing in the factorised expression of the Lax matrix of the special Jordan-Schwinger representation.
