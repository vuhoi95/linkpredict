Title: Covariant versions of Margolus-Levitin Theorem
Authors: Qiaojun Cao and Yi-Xin Chen and Jian-Long Li
Abstract: The Margolus-Levitin Theorem is a limitation on the minimal evolving time of a quantum system from its initial state to its orthogonal state. It also supplies a bound on the maximal operations or events can occur within a volume of spacetime. We compare Margolus-Levitin Theorem with other form of limitation on minimal evolving time, and present covariant versions of Margolus-Levitin Theorem in special and general relativity respectively. The relation among entropy bound, maximum information flow and computational limit are discussed, by applying the covariant versions of Margolus-Levitin Theorem.
