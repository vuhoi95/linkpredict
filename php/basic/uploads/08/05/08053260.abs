Title: Open Perturbatively Long-Range Integrable gl(N) Spin Chains
Authors: N. Beisert and F. Loebbert
Abstract: We construct the most general perturbatively long-range integrable spin chain with spins transforming in the fundamental representation of gl(N) and open boundary conditions. In addition to the previously determined bulk moduli we find a new set of parameters determining the reflection phase shift. We also consider finite-size contributions and comment on their determination.
