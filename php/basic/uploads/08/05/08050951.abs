Title: Generalized zeta functions, shape invariance and one-loop corrections to  quantum Kink masses
Authors: S. Rafiei and S. Jalalzadeh and K. Ghafoori Tabrizi
Abstract: We present a method to calculate the One-loop mass correction to Kinks mass in a (1+1)-dimensional field theoretical model in which the fluctuation potential $V^{\prime\prime}(\phi_c)$ has shape invariance property. We use the generalized zeta function regularization method to implement our setup for describing quantum kink states.
