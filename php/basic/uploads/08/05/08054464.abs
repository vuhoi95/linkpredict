Abstract: We find a class of asymptotically flat slowly rotating charged black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with arbitrary dilaton coupling constant in higher dimensions. Our solution is the correct one generalizing the four-dimensional case of Horne and Horowitz \cite{Hor1}. In the absence of a dilaton field, our solution reduces to the higher dimensional slowly rotating Kerr-Newman black hole solution. The angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of these rotating dilaton black holes are computed. It is shown that the dilaton field modifies the gyromagnetic ratio of the black holes.
