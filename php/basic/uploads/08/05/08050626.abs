Abstract: Working with well known models in $(2+1)D$ we discuss the physics behind the deformation of the canonical structure of these theories. A new deformation is constructed linking the massless scalar field theory with the self-dual theory. This is the exact dual of the known deformation connecting the Maxwell theory with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Duality is used to establish a web of relations between the mentioned theories and a physical picture of the deformation procedure is suggested.
