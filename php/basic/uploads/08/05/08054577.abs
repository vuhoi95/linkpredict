Title: CSW rules for massive matter legs and glue loops
Authors: Rutger Boels and Christian Schwinn
Abstract: Cachazo-Svrcek-Witten-type Feynman rules for massive matter scalar legs and pure glue loops are presented, obtained by deriving them directly from the space-time action. We comment on the derivation and some sample applications, in particular to calculating one loop effects in pure Yang-Mills theory. Furthermore, we derive CSW rules for effective Higgs-gluon couplings studied in the literature. In addition, it is shown how twistor techniques for deriving canonical field transformations explored for massless scalars extend to massless fermions.
