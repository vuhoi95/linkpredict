Title: Two-Point Functions of Chiral Fields at One Loop in Type II
Authors: K. Benakli and M. D. Goodsell
Abstract: We compute the two-point functions for chiral matter states in toroidal intersecting D6-brane models. In particular, we provide the techniques to calculate Moebius strip diagrams including the worldsheet instanton contribution.
