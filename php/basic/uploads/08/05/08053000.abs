Title: Neutrino Masses, Leptogenesis, and Unification in the Absence of Low  Energy Supersymmetry
Authors: Willy Fischler and Raphael Flauger
Abstract: We explore generating the dimension five operator leading to neutrino masses by integrating out heavy SU(2)_L triplet fermions. We exhibit a model that has a neutrino mass matrix consistent with observations. In addition, the model is capable of producing the observed baryon asymmetry, and unification can be achieved without dangerous proton decay. Supersymmetry can be broken at the fundamental scale with no supersymmetric signal at low energies.
