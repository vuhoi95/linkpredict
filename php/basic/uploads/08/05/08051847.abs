Title: Coherent state quantization of angle, time, and more irregular functions  and distributions
Authors: Biswajit Chakraborty and Jean Pierre Gazeau and Ahmed Youssef
Abstract: The domain of application of quantization methods is traditionally restricted to smooth classical observables. We show that the coherent states or "anti-Wick" quantization enables us to construct fairly reasonable quantum versions of irregular observables living on the classical phase space, such as the angle function, the time function of a free particle and even a large set of distributions comprising the tempered distributions.
