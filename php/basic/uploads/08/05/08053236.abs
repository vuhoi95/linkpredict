Authors: Imtak Jeon and Jongwook Kim and Nakwoo Kim and Sang-Woo Kim and Jeong-Hyuck Park
Abstract: We classify, in a group theoretical manner, the BPS configurations in the multiple M2-brane theory recently proposed by Bagger and Lambert. We present three types of BPS equations preserving various fractions of supersymmetries: in the first type we have constant fields and the interactions are purely algebraic in nature; in the second type the equations are invariant under spatial rotation SO(2), and the fields can be time-dependent; in the third class the equations are invariant under boost SO(1,1) and provide the eleven-dimensional generalizations of the Nahm equations. The BPS equations for different number of supersymmetries exhibit the division algebra structures: octonion, quarternion or complex.
