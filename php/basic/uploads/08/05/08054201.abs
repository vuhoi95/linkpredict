Title: Bulk viscosity and spectral functions in QCD
Authors: Guy D. Moore and Omid Saremi
Abstract: We examine the behavior of the spectral function for the trace of the stress tensor in QCD in the two regimes where it is possible to make analytical progress; weak coupling, and close to a second order QCD phase transition. We determine the behavior of the bulk viscosity in each regime. We discuss the problem of analytic continuation of the (lattice) Euclidean correlation function to determine the spectral function. In each case the spectral function has a narrow peak at small frequency; its shape would be challenging to extract accurately from lattice data with error bars.
