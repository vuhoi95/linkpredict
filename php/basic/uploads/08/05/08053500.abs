Title: Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory: A Confrontation of Symmetries
Authors: M. Chaichian and K. Nishijima and T. Salminen and A. Tureanu
Abstract: The concept of a noncommutative field is formulated based on the interplay between twisted Poincar\'e symmetry and residual symmetry of the Lorentz group. Various general dynamical results supporting this construction, such as the light-wedge causality condition and the integrability condition for Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, are presented. Based on this analysis, the claim of the identity between commutative QFT and noncommutative QFT with twisted Poincar\'e symmetry is refuted.
