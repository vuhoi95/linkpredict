Authors: Cenalo Vaz and Rakesh Tibrewala and T. P. Singh
Abstract: In a previous paper we studied the collapse of a spherically symmetric dust distribution (marginally bound LTB) in d-dimensional AdS spacetime and obtained the condition for the formation of trapped surfaces. Here we extend the analysis by giving the canonical theory for the same and subsequently quantize the system by solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We show that for the case of small dust perturbations around a black hole the wave functionals so obtained describe an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole in equilibrium with a thermal bath at Hawking temperature and show the non-trivial dependence of this temperature on the number of spacetime dimensions and the cosmological constant.
