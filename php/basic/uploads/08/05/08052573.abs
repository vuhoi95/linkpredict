Title: Extended Symmetries in Supergravity: the Semi-simple Case
Authors: Axel Kleinschmidt and Diederik Roest
Abstract: The bosonic sector of various supergravity theories reduces to a homogeneous space G/H in three dimensions. The corresponding algebras g are simple for (half-)maximal supergravity, but can be semi-simple for other theories. We extend the existing literature on the Kac-Moody extensions of simple Lie algebras to the semi-simple case. Furthermore, we argue that for N=2 supergravity the simple algebras have to be augmented with an su(2) factor.
