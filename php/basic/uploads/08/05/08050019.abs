Title: Radius Destabilization in Five Dimensional Orbifolds Due to an Enhanced  Casimir Effect
Authors: Richard K. Obousy and Gerald Cleaver
Abstract: One of the challenges in connecting higher dimensional theories to cosmology is stabilization of the moduli fields. We investigate the role of a Lorentz violating vector field in the context of stabilization. Specifically, we compute the one loop Casimir energy in Randall-Sundrum 5-dimensional (non-supersymmetric) S^1/ Z_2 orbifolds resulting from the interaction of a real scalar field with periodic boundary conditions with a Lorentz violating vector field. We find that the result is an enhanced attractive Casimir force. Hence, for stability, positive contributions to the Casimir force from branes and additional fields would be required to counter the destabilizing, attractive effect of Lorentz violating fields.
