Title: On Wess-Zumino gauge
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: In the relation between the linear (L) supersymmetry (SUSY) representation and the nonlinear (NL) SUSY representation we discuss the role of the Wess-Zumino gauge. We show in two dimensional spacetime that a spontaneously broken LSUSY theory with mass and Yukawa interaction terms for a minimal off-shell vector supermultiplet is obtained from a general superfield without imposing any special gauge conditions in N = 2 NL/L SUSY relation.
