Title: Noncommutative Deformation of Instantons
Authors: Yoshiaki Maeda and Akifumi Sako
Abstract: We construct instanton solutions on noncommutative Euclidean 4-space which are deformations of instanton solutions on commutative Euclidean 4-space. We show that the instanton numbers of these noncommutative instanton solutions coincide with the commutative solutions and conjecture that the instanton number in R^4 is preserved for general noncommutative deformations. We also study noncommutative deformation of instanton solutions on a T^4 with twisted boundary conditions.
