Title: Pseudogap and time reversal breaking in a holographic superconductor
Authors: Matthew M. Roberts and Sean A. Hartnoll
Abstract: Classical SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 3+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space is known to provide a holographic dual to a 2+1 system that undergoes a superconducting phase transition. We study the electrical conductivity and spectral density of an isotropic superconducting phase. We show that the theory exhibits a pseudogap at low temperatures and a nonzero Hall conductivity. The Hall conductivity is possible because of spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry.
