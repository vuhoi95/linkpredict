Title: The running of the coupling in SU(N) pure gauge theories
Authors: Biagio Lucini and Gregory Moraitis
Abstract: The running of the coupling is studied in SU(4) gauge theory using the Schr\"odinger functional technique. Up to energies of the order of the square root of the string tension $\sigma$, the running is found to agree with the two-loop perturbative formula. Relating the perturbative to the non-perturbative regime of the running and converting to the $\msbar$ scheme allows one to extract the ratio $\Lambda_{\msbar}/\sqrt{\sigma}$. The result is then used in combination with similar calculations present in the literature for SU(2) and SU(3) to extract $\Lambda_{\msbar}/\sqrt{\sigma}$ in the large $N$ limit. Our results for $N=3,4$ agree with a recent study of the same quantity performed using the Parisi mean field scheme as an intermediate scheme, while $\Lambda_{\msbar}/\sqrt{\sigma}$ in SU(2) turns out to differ by 2.5%. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed.
