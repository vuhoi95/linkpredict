Title: Chiral Algebras of (0,2) Sigma Models: Beyond Perturbation Theory - II
Authors: Meng-Chwan Tan and Junya Yagi
Abstract: We extend our analysis in [arXiv:0801.4782] and show that the chiral algebras of (0,2) sigma models are totally trivialized by worldsheet instantons for all complete flag manifolds of compact semisimple Lie groups. Consequently, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. Our results verify Stolz's idea that there are no harmonic spinors on the loop spaces of these flag manifolds. Moreover, they also imply that the kernels of certain twisted Dirac operators on these spaces will be empty under a "quantum" deformation of their geometries.
