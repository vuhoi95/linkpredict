Title: D-brane States and Annulus Amplitudes in OSp Invariant Closed String  Field Theory
Authors: Yutaka Baba and Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: In the OSp invariant closed string field theory, we construct the states corresponding to parallel D-branes that are located at different points in the space-time. Using these states, we evaluate annulus amplitudes. We show that the results coincide with those of first quantized string theory.
