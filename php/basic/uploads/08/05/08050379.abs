Title: Non-Involutive Constrained Systems and Hamilton-Jacobi Formalism
Authors: M. C. Bertin and B. M. Pimentel and C. E. Valc√°rcel
Abstract: In this work we discuss the natural appearance of the Generalized Brackets in systems with non-involutive (equivalent to second class) constraints in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We show how a consistent geometric interpretation of the integrability conditions leads to the reduction of degrees of freedom of these systems and, as consequence, naturally defines a dynamics in a reduced phase space.
