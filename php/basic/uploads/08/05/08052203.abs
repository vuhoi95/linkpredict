Title: Hopf Algebra Symmetry and String Theory
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Masashi Mori and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We investigate the Hopf algebra structure in string worldsheet theory and give a unified formulation of the quantization of string and the space-time symmetry. We reformulate the path integral quantization of string as a Drinfeld twist at the worldsheet level. The coboundary relation shows that the Drinfeld twist defines a module algebra which is equivalent to operators with normal ordering. Upon applying the twist, the space-time diffeomorphism is deformed into a twisted Hopf algebra, while the Poincar\'e symmetry is unchanged. This suggests a characterization of the symmetry: unbroken symmetries are twist invariant Hopf subalgebras, while broken symmetries are realized as twisted ones. We provide arguments that relate this twisted Hopf algebra to symmetries in path integral quantization.
