Abstract: We consider the inequivalent quantizations of a $N$-body rational Calogero model with a Coulomb type interaction. It is shown that for certain range of the coupling constants, this system admits a one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions. We analyze both the bound and scattering state sectors and find novel solutions of this model. We also find the ladder operators for this system, with which the previously known solutions can be constructed.
