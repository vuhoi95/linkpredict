Title: Nonperturbative contributions to the QCD pressure
Authors: Klaus Lichtenegger and Daniel Zwanziger
Abstract: We summarize the most important arguments why a perturbative description of finite-temperature QCD is unlikely to be possible and review various well-established approaches to deal with this problem. Then, using a recently proposed method, we investigate nonperturbative contributions to the QCD pressure and other observables (like energy, anomaly and bulk viscosity) obtained by imposing a functional cutoff at the Gribov horizon. Finally, we discuss how such contributions fit into the picture of consecutive effective theories, as proposed by Braaten and Nieto, and give an outline of the next steps necessary to improve this type of calculation.
