Title: Vanishing beta function for Grosse-Wulkenhaar model in a magnetic field
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Razvan Gurau and Vincent Rivasseau
Abstract: We prove that the beta function of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model including a magnetic field vanishes at all order of perturbations. We compute the renormalization group flow of the relevant dynamic parameters and find a non-Gaussian infrared fixed point. Some consequences of these results are discussed.
