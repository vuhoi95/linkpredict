Title: The B-model on the A-model NS5-brane
Authors: Viktor Bengtsson and Martin Cederwall
Abstract: We formulate the dynamics for the NS5-brane of the A-model, via the 'maximal form' method, which couples all background fields to the world-volume. This procedure provides the extra one- and five-forms fields of the extended Hitchin model. The generalised B-model emerges as the world-volume theory of this brane. The starting point of the construction is an embedding of the brane in a superspace geometry with 16 fermionic directions. The correspondence with Hitchin's formulation in terms of pure spinors is explained.
