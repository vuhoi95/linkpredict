Title: The integrable O(6) model and the correspondence: checks and predictions
Authors: Francesco Buccheri and Davide Fioravanti
Abstract: We exactly compute the energy density of the integrable O(n) non-linear sigma model as a convergent series. This series is specifically analysed for the very important O(6) symmetry, since it was suggested to result as a peculiar limit of the AdS string theory by Alday and Maldacena [1]. In this respect, the O(6) model gives also refined confirmations and predictions once compared with the SYM Bethe Ansatz [2,3].
