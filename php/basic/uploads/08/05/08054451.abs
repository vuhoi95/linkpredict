Title: Charge multiplets and masses for E(11)
Authors: P. P. Cook and P. West
Abstract: The particle, string and membrane charge multiplets are derived in detail from the decomposition of the l1 (charge) representation of E(11) in three, four, five, six, seven and eight spacetime dimensions. A tension formula relating weights of the l1 (charge) representation of E(11) to the fundamental objects of M-theory and string theory is presented. The reliability of the formula is tested by reproducing the tensions of the content of the charge multiplets. The formula reproduces the masses for the pp-wave, M2, M5 and the KK-monopole from the low level content of the l1 representation of E(11). Furthermore the tensions of all the Dp-branes of IIA and IIB theories are found in the relevant decomposition of the l1 representation, with the string coupling constant and $\alpha'$ appearing with the expected powers. The formula leads to a classification of all the exotic, KK-brane charges of M-theory.
