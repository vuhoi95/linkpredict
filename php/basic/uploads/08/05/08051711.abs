Title: Structure of the Vacuum in Deformed Supersymmetric Chiral Models
Authors: P. Fernandez and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum structure of N=1/2 chiral supersymmetric theories in deformed superspace. In particular we study O'Raifeartaigh models with C-deformed superpotentials and canonical and non-canonical deformed Kahler potentials. We find conditions under which the vacuum configurations are affected by the deformations.
