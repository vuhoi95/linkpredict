Title: Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology with Induced Gravity and Non-Minimally Coupled  Scalar Field on the Brane
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Behnaz Fazlpour
Abstract: We construct a cosmological model with non-minimally coupled scalar field on the brane, where Gauss-Bonnet and Induced Gravity effects are taken into account. This model has 5D character at both high and low energy limits but reduces to 4D gravity in intermediate scales. While induced gravity is a manifestation of the IR limit of the model, Gauss-Bonnet term and non-minimal coupling of scalar field and induced gravity are essentially related to UV limit of the scenario. We study cosmological implications of this scenario focusing on the late-time behavior of the solutions. In this setup, non-minimal coupling plays the role of an additional fine-tuning parameter that controls the initial density of predicted finite density big bang. Also, non-minimal coupling has important implication on the bouncing nature of the solutions.
