Title: E-Courant algebroids
Authors: Zhuo Chen and Zhangju Liu and Yunhe Sheng
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $E$-Courant algebroids, where $E$ is a vector bundle. It is a kind of generalized Courant algebroid and contains Courant algebroids, Courant-Jacobi algebroids and omni-Lie algebroids as its special cases. We explore novel phenomena exhibited by $E$-Courant algebroids and provide many examples. We study the automorphism groups of omni-Lie algebroids and classify the isomorphism classes of exact $E$-Courant algebroids. In addition, we introduce the concepts of $E$-Lie bialgebroids and Manin triples.
