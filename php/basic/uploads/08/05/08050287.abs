Title: Low-lying quasinormal modes of topological AdS black holes and  hydrodynamics
Authors: James Alsup and George Siopsis
Abstract: We analytically calculate the low-lying gravitational quasinormal modes of a topological AdS black hole of arbitrary dimension. We show that they are in agreement with corresponding results from the hydrodynamics of the gauge theory plasma on the boundary, as required by the AdS/CFT correspondence. For some of these modes, we obtain a lifetime which is comparable to or longer than the longest lifetime of perturbations of spherical black holes. Thus, these modes are expected to play an important role in the late time behavior of the gauge theory plasma.
