Title: Generalized Kerr-NUT-de Sitter metrics in all dimensions
Authors: Tsuyoshi Houri and Takeshi Oota and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We classify all spacetimes with a closed rank-2 conformal Killing-Yano tensor. They give a generalization of Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetimes. The Einstein condition is explicitly solved and written as an indefinite integral. It is characterized by a polynomial in the integrand. We briefly discuss the smoothness conditions of the Einstein metrics over compact Riemannian manifolds.
