Title: Standard Model and SU(5) GUT with Local Scale Invariance and the Weylon
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: Weyl's scale invariance is introduced as an additional local symmetry in the standard model of electroweak interactions. An inevitable consequence is the introduction of general relativity coupled to scalar fields a la Dirac and an additional vector particle we call the Weylon. Once Weyl's scale invariance is broken, the phenomenon (a) generates Newton's gravitational constant G_N and (b) triggers the conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism that results in masses for all the fermions and bosons. The scale at which Weyl's scale symmetry breaks is of order Planck mass. If right-handed neutrinos are also introduced, their absence at present energy scales is attributed to their mass which is tied to the scale where scale invariance breaks. Some implications of these ideas are noted in grand unification based on the gauge symmetry SU(5).
