Title: Supersymmetry and Superstring Phenomenology
Authors: Mary K. Gaillard and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We briefly cover the early history of supersymmetry, describe the relation of SUSY quantum field theories to superstring theories and explain why they are considered a likely tool to describe the phenomenology of high energy particle theory beyond the Standard Model.
