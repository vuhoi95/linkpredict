Title: Dilatation operator and Cayley graphs
Authors: M. Bonini and G. M. Cicuta and E. Onofri
Abstract: We use the algebraic definition of the Dilatation operator provided by Minahan, Zarembo, Beisert, Kristijansen, Staudacher, proper for single trace products of scalar fields, at leading order in the large-N 't Hooft limit to develop a new approach to the evaluation of the spectrum of the Dilatation operator. We discover a vast number of exact sequences of eigenstates.
