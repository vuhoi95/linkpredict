Title: High spin baryon in hot strongly coupled plasma
Authors: Miao Li and Yang Zhou and Shi Pu
Abstract: We consider a strings-junction holographic model of probe baryon in the finite-temperature supersymmetric Yang-Mills dual of the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. In particular, we investigate the screening length for high spin baryon composed of rotating N_c heavy quarks. To rotate quarks by finite force, we put hard infrared cutoff in the bulk and give quarks finite mass. We find that N_c microscopic strings are embedded reasonably in the bulk geometry when they have finite angular velocity \omega, similar to the meson case. By defining the screening length as the critical separation of quarks, we compute the \omega dependence of the baryon screening length numerically and obtain a reasonable result which shows that baryons with high spin dissociate more easily. Finally, we discuss the relation between J and E^2 for baryons.
