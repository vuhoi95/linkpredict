Title: Is Physics Asking for a New Kinematics?
Authors: R. Aldrovandi and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: It is discussed whether some of the consistency problems of present-day physics could be solved by replacing special relativity, whose underlying kinematics is ruled by the Poincare' group, by de Sitter relativity, with underlying kinematics ruled by the de Sitter group. In contrast to ordinary special relativity, which seems to fail at the Planck scale, this new relativity is "universal" in the sense that it holds at all energy scales.
