Title: Subtleties in the quasi-classical calculation of Hawking radiation
Authors: Emil T. Akhmedov and Terry Pilling and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: he quasi-classical method of deriving Hawking radiation is investigated. In order to recover the original Hawking temperature one must take into account a previously ignored contribution coming from the temporal part of the action. This contribution plus a contribution coming from the spatial part of the action gives the correct temperature.
