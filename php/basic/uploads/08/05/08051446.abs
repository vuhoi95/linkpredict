Title: Magnetic and Electric Dipole Constraints on Extra Dimensions and  Magnetic Fluxes
Authors: Aaron J. Roy and Myron Bander
Abstract: The propagation of charged particles and gauge fields in a compact extra dimension contributes to $g-2$ of the charged particles. In addition, a magnetic flux threading this extra dimension generates an electric dipole moment for these particles. We present constraints on the compactification size and on the possible magnetic flux imposed by the comparison of data and theory of the magnetic moment of the muon and from limits on the electric dipole moments of the muon, neutron and electron.
