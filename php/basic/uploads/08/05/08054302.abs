Title: A comment on black hole state counting in loop quantum gravity
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: There are two ways of counting microscopic states of black holes in loop quantum gravity, one counting all allowed spin network labels $j,m$ and the other involving only the labels $m$. Counting states with $|m|=j$, as done in a recent Letter, does not follow either.
