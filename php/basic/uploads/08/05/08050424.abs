Title: Decoherence and entropy of primordial fluctuations II. The entropy  budget
Authors: David Campo and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: We calculate the entropy of adiabatic perturbations associated with a truncation of the hierarchy of Green functions at the first non trivial level, i.e. in a self-consistent Gaussian approximation. We give the equation governing the entropy growth and discuss its phenomenology. It is parameterized by two model-dependent kernels. We then examine two particular inflationary models, one with isocurvature perturbations, the other with corrections due to loops of matter fields. In the first model the entropy grows rapidely, while in the second the state remains pure (at one loop).
