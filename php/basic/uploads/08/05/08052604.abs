Title: ABCD Matrices as Similarity Transformations of Wigner Matrices and  Periodic Systems in Optics
Authors: S. Baskal and Y. S. Kim
Abstract: The beam transfer matrix, often called the $ABCD$ matrix, is a two-by-two matrix with unit determinant, and with three independent parameters. It is noted that this matrix cannot always be diagonalized. It can however be brought by rotation to a matrix with equal diagonal elements. This equi-diagonal matrix can then be squeeze-transformed to a rotation, to a squeeze, or to one of the two shear matrices. It is noted that these one-parameter matrices constitute the basic elements of the Wigner's little group for space-time symmetries of elementary particles. Thus every $ABCD$ matrix can be written as a similarity transformation of one of the Wigner matrices, while the transformation matrix is a rotation preceded by a squeeze. This mathematical property enables us to compute scattering processes in periodic systems. Laser cavities and multilayer optics are discussed in detail. For both cases, it is shown possible to write the one-cycle transfer matrix as a similarity transformation of one of the Wigner matrices. It is thus possible to calculate the $ABCD$ matrix for an arbitrary number of cycles.
