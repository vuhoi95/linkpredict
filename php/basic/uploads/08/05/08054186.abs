Title: Reconciling Grand Unification with Strings by Anisotropic  Compactifications
Authors: Ben Dundee and Stuart Raby and Akin Wingerter
Abstract: We analyze gauge coupling unification in the context of heterotic strings on anisotropic orbifolds. This construction is very much analogous to effective 5 dimensional orbifold GUT field theories. Our analysis assumes three fundamental scales, the string scale, $\mstring$, a compactification scale, $\mc$, and a mass scale for some of the vector-like exotics, $\mex$; the other exotics are assumed to get mass at $\mstring$. In the particular models analyzed, we show that gauge coupling unification is not possible with $\mex = \mc$ and in fact we require $\mex \ll \mc \sim 3 \times 10^{16}$ GeV. We find that about 10% of the parameter space has a proton lifetime (from dimension 6 gauge exchange) $10^{33} {\rm yr} \lesssim\tau(p\to \pi^0e^+) \lesssim 10^{36} {\rm yr}$. The other 80% of the parameter space gives proton lifetimes below Super-K bounds. The next generation of proton decay experiments should be sensitive to the remaining parameter space.
