Title: MHV One-Loop Amplitudes in Yang-Mills from Generalised Unitarity
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Massimiliano Vincon
Abstract: In this letter, we exploit generalised unitarity in order to calculate the cut-constructible part of one-loop amplitudes in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In particular, we rederive the n-gluon MHV amplitudes for both the adjacent and non-adjacent gluon helicity configurations from 3- and 4-particle cuts alone.
