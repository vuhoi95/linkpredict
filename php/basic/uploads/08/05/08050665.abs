Title: Decay of Dirac Massive Hair in the Background of Spherical Black Hole
Authors: Rafa≈Ç Moderski and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: The intermediate and late-time behaviour of massive Dirac hair in the static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime was studied. It was revealed that the intermediate asymptotic pattern of decay of massive Dirac spinor hair is dependent on the mass of the field under consideration as well as the multiple number of the wave mode. The long-lived oscillatory tail observed at timelike infinity in the considered background decays slowly as t^{-5/6}.
