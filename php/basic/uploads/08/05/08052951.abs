Title: A unique non-Landau/Fermi liquid in 2d for high Tc superconductivity
Authors: Eliot Kapit and Andr√© LeClair
Abstract: It is shown that the main features of the phase diagram for high Tc superconductivity can be calculated as a function of doping in a simple, essentially unique non-Landau/Fermi liquid with quartic interactions. The phase diagram depends on a single parameter 0<gamma<1 determined by the strength of the interaction at short distances. A new d-wave gap equation has solutions that fall under a superconducting dome, which terminates at the renormalization group fixed point. Optimal doping is estimated to occur just below 3/2 \pi^2. The overall scale for Tc is set by the recently measured universal nodal Fermi velocity and lattice spacing, and is estimated to be 120K < Tc < 160K for LaSrCuO.
