Title: On the general action of boundary (super)string field theory
Authors: Akira Ishida and Shunsuke Teraguchi
Abstract: We reconstruct boundary superstring field theory via boundary states. After a minor modification of the fermionic two-form, all the equations needed for Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation are simply represented by closed string oscillators and the proof of gauge invariance is drastically simplified. The general form of the action of boundary superstring field theory is also obtained without any assumption and found to take exactly the same form as the bosonic one. As a special case of this action, we revisit the conjecture that the action is simply given by the disk partition function when matter and ghosts are completely decoupled.
