Title: The Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Kang Li and Sayipjamal Dulat
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in non-commutative quantum mechanics (NCQM) is studied. First, by introducing a shift for the magnetic vector potential we give the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equations in the presence of a magnetic field on NC space and NC phase space, respectively. Then by solving the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equations, we obtain the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase on NC space and NC phase space, respectively.
