Title: UV-IR Mixing in Non-Commutative Plane
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and A. Pinzul and B. Qureshi
Abstract: Poincar\'e-invariant quantum field theories can be formulated on non-commutative planes if the coproduct on the Poincar\'e group is suitably deformed \cite{Dimitrijevic:2004rf, Chaichian:2004za}.(See also especially Oeckl \cite{Oeckl:1999jun},\cite{Oeckl:2000mar} and Grosse et al.\cite{Grosse:2001mar}) As shown in \cite{Balachandran:2005eb}, this important result of these authors implies modification of free field commutation and anti-commutation relations and striking phenomenological consequences such as violations of Pauli principle \cite{Balachandran:2005eb,Bal3}. In this paper we prove that with these modifications, UV-IR mixing disappears to all orders in perturbation theory from the $S$-Matrix. This result is in agreement with the previous results of Oeckl \cite{Oeckl:2000mar}.
