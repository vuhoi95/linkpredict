Title: T-duality for non-free circle actions
Authors: Ulrich Bunke and Thomas Schick
Abstract: We study the topology of T-duality for pairs of U(1)-bundles and three-dimensional integral cohomology classes over orbispaces. In particular, our results apply to U(1)-spaces with finite isotropy. We generalize the theory developed in our previous paper math.GT/0405132 from spaces to orbispaces.
