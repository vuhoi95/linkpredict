Title: Dual PT-Symmetric Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Carl M. Bender and H. F. Jones and R. J. Rivers
Abstract: Some quantum field theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are investigated. It is shown that for the case of a free fermion field theory with a $\gamma_5$ mass term the Hamiltonian is $\cal PT$-symmetric. Depending on the mass parameter this symmetry may be either broken or unbroken. When the $\cal PT$ symmetry is unbroken, the spectrum of the quantum field theory is real. For the $\cal PT$-symmetric version of the massive Thirring model in two-dimensional space-time, which is dual to the $\cal PT$-symmetric scalar Sine-Gordon model, an exact construction of the $\cal C$ operator is given. It is shown that the $\cal PT$-symmetric massive Thirring and Sine-Gordon models are equivalent to the conventional Hermitian massive Thirring and Sine-Gordon models with appropriately shifted masses.
