Title: A systematic search for anomaly-free supergravities in six dimensions
Authors: Spyros D. Avramis and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for anomaly-free six-dimensional N=1 chiral supergravity theories. Under a certain set of restrictions on the allowed gauge groups and the representations of the hypermultiplets, we enumerate all possible Poincare and gauged supergravities with one tensor multiplet satisfying the 6D anomaly cancellation criteria.
