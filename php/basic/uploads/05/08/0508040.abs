Title: Bound states of the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of short-range  potentials
Authors: Victor M. Villalba and Clara Rojas
Abstract: We solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a spatially one-dimensional cusp potential. The bound state solutions are derived and the antiparticle bound state is discussed.
