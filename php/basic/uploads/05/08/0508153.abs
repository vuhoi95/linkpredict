Title: Morse Theory in Field Theory
Authors: P. Koroteev and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: In recent years it has become apparent that topological field theories (TFTs) are likely to be the best candidates for the truly fundamental physical theory. Supersymmetry, for instance, can be motivated and expressed in terms of TFTs. Here we build a simple example of TFT using Morse theory and Massey product. Action (invariant under supersymmetric transformations) is constructed and relations for correlators in this theory are obtained. While constructing this theory a theorem about the connection between Euler characteristic of a manifold and the sum of indices of critical points is proved for arbitrary dimension of the target space.
