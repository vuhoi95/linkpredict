Title: Fluctuating Fuzzy Funnels
Authors: Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Robert de Mello Koch
Abstract: It is well known that a D-string ending on a D3, D5 or D7 brane is described in terms of a non-commutative fuzzy funnel geometry. In this article, we give a numerical study of the fluctuations about this leading geometry. This allows us to investigate issues related to the stability and moduli space of these solutions. We comment on the comparison to the linearized fluctuations in supergravity.
