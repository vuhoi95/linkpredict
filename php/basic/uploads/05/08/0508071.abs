Title: D-branes in overcritical electric fields
Authors: Harald Dorn and Mario Salizzoni and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We collect some arguments for treating a D-brane with overcritical electric field as a well-posed initial condition for a D-brane decay. Within the field theoretical toy model of Minahan and Zwiebach we give an estimate for the condensates of the related infinite tower of tachyonic excitations.
