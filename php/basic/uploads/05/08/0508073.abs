Title: Pseudo-Hermiticity and some consequences of a generalized quantum  condition
Authors: B. Bagchi and C. Quesne and R. Roychoudhury
Abstract: We exploit the hidden symmetry structure of a recently proposed non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and of its Hermitian equivalent one. This sheds new light on the pseudo-Hermitian character of the former and allows access to a generalized quantum condition. Special cases lead to hyperbolic and Morse-like potentials in the framework of a coordinate-dependent mass model.
