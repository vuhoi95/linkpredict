Title: de-Sitter vacua via consistent D-terms
Authors: Giovanni Villadoro and Fabio Zwirner
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for producing locally stable de-Sitter or Minkowski vacua, with spontaneously broken N=1 supersymmetry and no massless scalars, applicable to superstring and M-theory compactifications with fluxes. We illustrate the mechanism with a simple N=1 supergravity model that provides parametric control on the sign and the size of the vacuum energy. The crucial ingredient is a gauged U(1) that involves both an axionic shift and an R-symmetry, and severely constrains the F- and D-term contributions to the potential.
