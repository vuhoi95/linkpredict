Title: New Multiply Nutty Spacetimes
Authors: Robert B. Mann and Cristian Stelea
Abstract: We construct new solutions of the vacuum Einstein field equations with multiple NUT parameters, with and without cosmological constant. These solutions describe spacetimes with non-trivial topology that are asymptotically dS, AdS or flat. We also find the the multiple nut parameter extension of the inhomogeneous Einstein metrics on complex line bundles found recently by Lu, Page and Pope. We also provide a more general form of the Eguchi-Hanson solitons found by Clarkson and Mann. We discuss the global structure of such solutions and possible applications in string theory.
