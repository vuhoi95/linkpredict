Title: A new form of self-duality equations with topological term
Authors: Yong-Qiang Wang and Yu-Xiao Liu and Yi-Shi Duan
Abstract: Based on the U(1) gauge potential decomposition theory and $\phi$-mapping theory, the topological inner structure of the self-duality (Bogomol'nyi-type) equations are studied. The special form of the gauge potential decomposition is obtained directly from the first of the self-duality equations. Using this decomposition, the topological inner structure of the Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) vortex is discussed. Furthermore, we obtain a rigorous self-dual equation with topological term for the first time, in which the topological term has been ignored by other physicists.
