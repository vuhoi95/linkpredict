Abstract: The algebraic approach is employed to formulate N=2 supersymmetry transformations in the context of integrable systems based on loop superalgebras $\hat{\rm sl}(p+1,p), p \ge 1$ with homogeneous gradation. We work with extended integrable hierarchies, which contain supersymmetric AKNS and Lund-Regge sectors. We derive the one-soliton solution for $p=1$ which solves positive and negative evolution equations of the N=2 supersymmetric model.
