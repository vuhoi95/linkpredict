Title: Emergence of Time from Dimensional Reduction in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: By considering a new form of dimensional reduction for noncommutative field theory, we show that the signature of spacetime may be changed. In particular, it is demonstrated that a temporal dimension can emerge from a purely Euclidean geometry. We suggest that this mechanism may hint at the origin of time in the fundamental theory of quantum gravity.
