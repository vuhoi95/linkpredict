Authors: F. A. Barone and L. M. De Moraes and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: In this work we calculate the functional generator of the Green's functions of the Kalb-Ramond field in 3+1 dimensions. We also calculate the functional generator, and corresponding Casimir energy, of the same field when it is submitted to boundary conditions on two parallel planes. The boundary conditions we consider can be interpreted as a kind of conducting planes for the field in compearing with the Maxwell case. We compare our result with the standard ones for the scalar and Maxwell fields.
