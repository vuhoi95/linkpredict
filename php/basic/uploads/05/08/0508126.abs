Title: Gauge theories as a geometrical issue of a Kaluza-Klein framework
Authors: F. Cianfrani and A. Marrocco and G. Montani
Abstract: We present a geometrical unification theory in a Kaluza-Klein approach that achieve the geometrization of a generic gauge theory bosonic component. We show how it is possible to derive the gauge charge conservation from the invariance of the model under extra-dimensional translations and to geometrize gauge connections for spinors, thus we can introduce the matter just by free spinorial fields. Then, we present the applications to i)a pentadimensional manifold $V^{4}\otimes S^{1}$, so reproducing the original Kaluza-Klein theory, unless some extensions related to the rule of the scalar field contained in the metric and the introduction of matter by spinors with a phase dependence from the fifth coordinate, ii)a seven-dimensional manifold $V^{4}\otimes S^{1}\otimes S^{2}$, in which we geometrize the electro-weak model by introducing two spinors for any leptonic family and quark generation and a scalar field with two components with opposite hypercharge, responsible of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
