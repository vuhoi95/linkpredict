Title: Dynamical Radion Superfield in Five-dimensional Action
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We clarify the radion superfield dependence of 5D N=1 superspace action. The radion is treated as a dynamical field and appears in the action with the correct mode function. Our derivation is systematic and based on the superconformal formulation of 5D supergravity. We can read off the couplings of the dynamical radion superfield to the matter superfields from our result. The correct radion mass can be obtained by calculating the radion potential from our superspace action.
