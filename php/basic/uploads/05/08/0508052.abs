Title: Non(anti)commutative N=2 Supersymmetric U(N) Gauge Theory and Deformed  Instanton Equations
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: We study deformed supersymmetry in N=2 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory in non(anti)commutative N=1 superspace. Using the component formalism, we construct deformed N=(1,1/2) supersymmetry explicitly. Based on the deformed supersymmetry, we discuss the C-dependence of the correlators. We also study the C-deformation of the instanton equation for the gauge group U(2).
