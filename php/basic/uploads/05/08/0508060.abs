Title: Commutator Anomaly in Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Sayipjamal Dulat and Kang Li
Abstract: In this letter, firstly, the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation on noncommutative phase space is given by using a generalized Bopp's shift. Then the anomaly term of commutator of arbitrary physical observable operators on noncommutative phase space is obtained. Finally, the basic uncertainty relations for space-space and space-momentum as well as momentum-momentum operators in noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM), and uncertainty relation for arbitrary physical observable operators in NCQM are discussed.
