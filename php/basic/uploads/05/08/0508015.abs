Title: Nonmeromorphic operator product expansion and C_2-cofiniteness for a  family of W-algebras
Authors: Nils Carqueville and Michael Flohr
Abstract: We prove the existence and associativity of the nonmeromorphic operator product expansion for an infinite family of vertex operator algebras, the triplet W-algebras, using results from P(z)-tensor product theory. While doing this, we also show that all these vertex operator algebras are C_2-cofinite.
