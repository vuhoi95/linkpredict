Title: String Loop Corrections to Kahler Potentials in Orientifolds
Authors: Marcus Berg and Michael Haack and Boris Kors
Abstract: We determine one-loop string corrections to Kahler potentials in type IIB orientifold compactifications with either N=1 or N=2 supersymmetry, including D-brane moduli, by evaluating string scattering amplitudes.
