Title: On supersymmetries in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
Authors: J. Beckers and N. Debergh and A. G. Nikitin
Abstract: One-dimensional nonrelativistic systems are studied when time-independent potential interactions are involved. Their supersymmetries are determined and their closed subsets generating kinematical invariance Lie superalgebras are pointed out. The study of even supersymmetries is particularly enlightened through the already known symmetries of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation. Three tables collect the even, odd, and total supersymmetries as well as the invariance (super)algebras.
