Title: Bouncing Universes in String-inspired Gravity
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Anupam Mazumdar and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We consider the effects on cosmology of higher-derivative modifications of (effective) gravity that make it asymptotically free without introducing ghosts. The weakening of gravity at short distances allows pressure to prevent the singularity, producing a solution with contraction preceding expansion.
