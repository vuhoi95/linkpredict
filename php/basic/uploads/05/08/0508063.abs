Title: The nature of manifolds of periodic points for higher dimensional  integrable maps
Authors: Satoru Saito and Noriko Saitoh
Abstract: By studying periodic points for rational maps on $\bm{C}^d$ with $p$ invariants, we show that they form an invariant variety of dimension $p$ if the periodicity conditions are `fully correlated', and a set of isolated points if the conditions are `uncorrelated'. We present many examples of the invariant varieties in the case of integrable maps. Moreover we prove that an invariant variety and a set of isolated points do not exist in one map simultaneously.
