Title: Local geometric Langlands correspondence and affine Kac-Moody algebras
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Dennis Gaitsgory
Abstract: By a local geometric Langlands correspondence for a complex reductive group G we understand a construction which assigns to a local system on the punctured disc for the Langlands dual group of G, a category equipped with an action of the formal loop group G((t)). We propose a conjectural description of these categories as categories of representations of the corresponding affine Kac-Moody algebra of critical level, and, in some cases, as categories of D-modules on the ind-schemes G((t))/K. We describe in detail these categories and interrelations between them and provide supporting evidence for our conjectures. In particular, we prove that a certain quotient category of representations of critical level is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves on a thickening of the scheme of nilpotent opers associated to the Langlands dual group.
