Title: Unitary Matrix Model of a Chiral [SU(N)]^K Gauge Theory
Authors: Edoardo Di Napoli and Vadim S. Kaplunovsky
Abstract: We build a matrix model of a chiral [SU(N)]^K gauge theory (5D SQCD deconstructed down to 4D) using random unitary matrices to model chiral bifundamental fields (N,N-bar) (without (N-bar,N)). We verify the duality by matching the loop equation of the matrix model to the anomaly equations of the gauge theory. Then we evaluate the matrix model's free energy and use it to derive the effective superpotential for the gaugino condensates.
