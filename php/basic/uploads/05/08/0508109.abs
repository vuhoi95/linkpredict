Title: Soliton Solutions to the Einstein Equations in Five Dimensions
Authors: R. Clarkson and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We present a new class of solutions in odd dimensions to Einstein's equations containing either a positive or negative cosmological constant. These solutions resemble the even-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson--(anti)-de Sitter ((A)dS) metrics, with the added feature of having Lorentzian signatures. They provide an affirmative answer to the open question as to whether or not there exist solutions with negative cosmological constant that asymptotically approach AdS$_{5}/\Gamma$, but have less energy than AdS$_{5}/\Gamma$. We present evidence that these solutions are the lowest-energy states within their asymptotic class.
