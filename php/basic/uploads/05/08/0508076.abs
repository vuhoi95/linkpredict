Title: Zero-point length, extra-dimensions and string T-duality
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Michele Fontanini
Abstract: In this paper, we are going to put in a single consistent framework apparently unrelated pieces of information, i.e. zero-point length, extra-dimensions, string T-duality. More in details we are going to introduce a modified Kaluza-Klein theory interpolating between (high-energy) string theory and (low-energy) quantum field theory. In our model zero-point length is a four dimensional ``virtual memory'' of compact extra-dimensions length scale. Such a scale turns out to be determined by T-duality inherited from the underlying fundamental string theory. From a low energy perspective short distance infinities are cut off by a minimal length which is proportional to the square root of the string slope, i.e. \sqrt{\alpha^\prime}. Thus, we provide a ``bridge'' between the ultra-relativistic string domain and the low energy arena of point-particle quantum field theory.
