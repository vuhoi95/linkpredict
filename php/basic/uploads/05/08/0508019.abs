Title: Heteroclinic orbit and tracking attractor in cosmological model with a  double exponential potential
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Yi-bin Zhao and Chang-bo Sun
Abstract: In this paper, the dynamical heteroclinic orbit and attractor have been employed to make the late-time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition and thus alleviates the fine tuning problem in cosmological dynamical system of barotropic fluid and quintessence with a double exponential potential. The late-time asymptotic behavior of the double exponential model does not always correspond to the single case. The heteroclinic orbits are the non-stationary solutions and in general they will interpolate between the critical points. Although they can not be shown analytically, yet a numerical calculation can reveal most of their properties. Varied heteroclinic orbits and attractors including tracking attractor and de Sitter attractor have been found.
