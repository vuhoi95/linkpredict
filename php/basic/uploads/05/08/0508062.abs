Title: Oscillator potential for the four-dimensional Hall effect
Authors: Levon Mardoyan and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We suggest the exactly solvable model of oscillator on the four-dimensional sphere interacting with the SU(2) Yang monopole. We show, that the properties of the model essentially depend on the monopole charge.
