Title: Modified Gauss-Bonnet theory as gravitational alternative for dark  energy
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We suggest the modified gravity where some arbitrary function of Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term is added to Einstein action as gravitational dark energy. It is shown that such theory may pass solar system tests. It is demonstrated that modified GB gravity may describe the most interesting features of late-time cosmology: the transition from deceleration to acceleration, crossing the phantom divide, current acceleration with effective (cosmological constant, quintessence or phantom) equation of state of the universe.
