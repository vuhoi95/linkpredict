Title: Semiclassical (QFT) and Quantum (String) Rotating Black Holes and their  Evaporation: New Results
Authors: A. Bouchareb and M. Ramon Medrano and N. G. Sanchez
Abstract: Combination of both quantum field theory (QFT) and string theory in curved backgrounds in a consistent framework, the string analogue model, allows us to provide a full picture of the Kerr-Newman black hole and its evaporation going beyond the current picture. We compute the quantum emission cross section of strings by a Kerr-Newmann black hole (KNbh). It shows the black hole emission at the Hawking temperature T_{sem} in the early evaporation and the new string emission featuring a Hagedorn transition into a string state of temperature T_ s at the last stages. New bounds on the angular momentum J and charge Q emerge in the quantum string regime. The last state of evaporation of a semiclassical KNbh is a string state of temperature T_s, mass M_s, J = 0 = Q, decaying as a quantum string into all kinds of particles.(There is naturally, no loss of information, (no paradox at all)). We compute the microscopic string entropy S_s(m, j) of mass m and spin mode j. (Besides the usual transition at T_s), we find for high j, (extremal string states) a new phase transition at a temperature T_{sj} higher than T_s. We find a new formula for the Kerr black hole entropy S_{sem}, as a function of the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy . For high angular momentum, (extremal J = GM^2/c), a gravitational phase transition operates and the whole entropy S_{sem} is drastically different from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This new extremal black hole transition occurs at a temperature T_{sem J} higher than the Hawking temperature T_{sem}.
