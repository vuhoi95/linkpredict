Title: Feynman-Jackson integrals
Authors: Rafael Diaz and Eddy Pariguan
Abstract: We introduce perturbative Feynman integrals in the context of q-calculus generalizing the Gaussian q-integrals introduced by Diaz and Teruel. We provide analytic as well as combinatorial interpretations for the Feynman-Jackson integrals.
