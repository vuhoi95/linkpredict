Title: Higher Charges in Dynamical Spin Chains for SYM Theory
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal and Gabriele Ferretti
Abstract: We construct, to the first two non-trivial orders, the next conserved charge in the su(2|3) sector of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory. This represents a test of integrability in a sector where the interactions change the number of sites of the chain. The expression for the charge is completely determined by the algebra and can be written in a diagrammatic form in terms of the interactions already present in the Hamiltonian. It appears likely that this diagrammatic expression remains valid in the full theory and can be generalized to higher loops and higher charges thus helping in establishing complete integrability for these dynamical chains.
