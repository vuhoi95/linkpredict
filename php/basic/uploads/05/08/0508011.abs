Title: Generalized integrability conditions and target space geometry
Authors: C. Adam and J. Sanchez-Guillen
Abstract: In some higher dimensional nonlinear field theories integrable subsectors with infinitely many conservation laws have been identified by imposing additional integrability conditions. Originally, the complex eikonal equation was chosen as integrability condition, but recently further generalizations have been proposed. Here we show how these new integrability conditions may be derived from the geometry of the target space and, more precisely, from the Noether currents related to a certain class of target space transformations.
