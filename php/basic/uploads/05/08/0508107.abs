Title: Predictions for orientifold field theories from type 0' string theory
Authors: Adi Armoni and Emiliano Imeroni
Abstract: Two predictions about finite-N non-supersymmetric "orientifold field theories" are made by using the dual type 0' string theory on C^3 / Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold singularity. First, the mass ratio between the lowest pseudoscalar and scalar color-singlets is estimated to be equal to the ratio between the axial anomaly and the scale anomaly at strong coupling, M_- / M_+ ~ C_- / C_+. Second, the ratio between the domain wall tension and the value of the quark condensate is computed.
