Title: Nongeometric Flux Compactifications
Authors: Jessie Shelton and Washington Taylor and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We investigate a simple class of type II string compactifications which incorporate nongeometric "fluxes" in addition to "geometric flux" and the usual H-field and R-R fluxes. These compactifications are nongeometric analogues of the twisted torus. We develop T-duality rules for NS-NS geometric and nongeometric fluxes, which we use to construct a superpotential for the dimensionally reduced four-dimensional theory. The resulting structure is invariant under T-duality, so that the distribution of vacua in the IIA and IIB theories is identical when nongeometric fluxes are included. This gives a concrete framework in which to investigate the possibility that generic string compactifications may be nongeometric in any duality frame. The framework developed in this paper also provides some concrete hints for how mirror symmetry can be generalized to compactifications with arbitrary H-flux, whose mirrors are generically nongeometric.
