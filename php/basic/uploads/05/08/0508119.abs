Title: T-Duality and the Spectrum of Gravitational Waves
Authors: Paul Robert Chouha and Robert H. Brandenberger
Abstract: In the inflationary universe scenario, the physical wavelength of cosmological fluctuation modes which are currently probed in observations was shorter than the Hubble radius, and in fact shorter than the Planck and string lengths, at the beginning of the period of inflation. Thus, during the early stages of evolution, the fluctuations are subject to Planck scale physics. In the context of an inflationary cosmological background, we examine the signatures of a specific modified dispersion relation motivated by the T-duality symmetry of string theory on the power spectrum of gravitational waves. The modified dispersion relation is extracted from the asymptotic limit of the string center of mass propagator.
