Abstract: In this note, we establish the formulation of 6D, N=1 hypermultiplets in terms of 4D chiral-nonminimal (CNM) scalar multiplets. The coupling of these to 6D, N=1 Yang-Mills multiplets is described. A 6D, N=1 projective superspace formulation is given in which the above multiplets naturally emerge. The covariant superspace quantization of these multiplets is studied in details.
