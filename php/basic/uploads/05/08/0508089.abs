Title: Building the Standard Model on a D3-brane
Authors: Herman Verlinde and Martijn Wijnholt
Abstract: We motivate and apply a bottom-up approach to string phenomenology, which aims to construct the Standard Model as a decoupled world-volume theory on a D3-brane. As a concrete proposal for such a construction, we consider a single probe D3-brane on a partial resolution of a del Pezzo 8 singularity. The resulting world-volume theory reproduces the field content and interactions of the MSSM, however with a somewhat extended Higgs sector. An attractive feature of our approach is that the gauge and Yukawa couplings are dual to non-dynamical closed string modes, and are therefore tunable parameters.
