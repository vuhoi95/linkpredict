Title: The cosmological constant problem in codimension-two brane models
Authors: Jan-Markus Schwindt and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a dynamical solution to the cosmological constant problem in the contaxt of six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. A definite answer requires an understanding of the full bulk cosmology in the early universe, in which the bulk has time-dependent size and shape. We comment on the special properties of codimension two as compared to higher codimensions.
