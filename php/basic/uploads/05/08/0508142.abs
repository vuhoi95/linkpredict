Title: Ambiguity of black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Hidefumi Nomura
Abstract: We reexmine some proposals of black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity (LQG) and consider a new possible choice of the Immirzi parameter which has not been pointed out so far. We also discuss that a new idea is inevitable if we regard the relation between the area spectrum in LQG and that in the quasinormal mode analysis seriously.
