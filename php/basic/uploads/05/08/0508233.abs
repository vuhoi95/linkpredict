Title: Regular and chaotic interactions of two BPS dyons at low energy
Authors: Ricardo Fariello and Hilmar Forkel and Gastao Krein
Abstract: We identify and analyze quasiperiodic and chaotic motion patterns in the time evolution of a classical, non-Abelian Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) dyon pair at low energies. This system is amenable to the geodesic approximation which restricts the underlying SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs dynamics to an eight-dimensional phase space. We numerically calculate a representative set of long-time solutions to the corresponding Hamilton equations and analyze quasiperiodic and chaotic phase space regions by means of Poincare surfaces of section, high-resolution power spectra and Lyapunov exponents. Our results provide clear evidence for both quasiperiodic and chaotic behavior and characterize it quantitatively. Indications for intermittency are also discussed.
