Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections in two-dimensional CP^{N-1} supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model on noncommutative superspace. We show that this model is renormalizable, the N=2 SUSY sector is not affected by the C-deformation and that the non(anti)commutativity parameter C receives infinite renormalization at one-loop order. And it is the renormalizability of the model at one-loop order.
