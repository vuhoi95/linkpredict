Title: Three Kinds of Special Relativity via Inverse Wick Rotation
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Chao-Guang Huang and Zhan Xu and Bin Zhou
Abstract: Since the special relativity can be viewed as the physics in an inverse Wick rotation of 4-d Euclid space, which is at almost equal footing with the 4-d Riemann/Lobachevski space, there should be important physics in the inverse Wick rotation of 4-d Riemann/Lobachevski space. Thus, there are three kinds of special relativity in de Sitter/Minkowski/anti-de Sitter space at almost equal footing, respectively. There is an instanton tunnelling scenario in the Riemann-de Sitter case that may explain why $\La$ be positive and link with the multiverse.
