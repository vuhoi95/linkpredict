Title: No hair conjecture, nonabelian hierarchies and anti-de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We consider globally regular and black holes solutions for the Einstein-Yang-Mills system with negative cosmological constant in $d-$spacetime dimensions. We find that the ADM mass of the spherically symmetric solutions generically diverges for $d>4$. Solutions with finite mass are found by considering corrections to the YM Lagrangean consisting in higher therm of the Yang--Mills hierarchy. Such systems can occur in the low energy effective action of string theory. A discussion of the main properties of the solutions and the differences with respect to the four dimensional case is presented. The mass of these configurations is computed by using a counterterm method.
