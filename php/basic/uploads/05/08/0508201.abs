Title: Short distance non-perturbative effects of large distance modified  gravity
Authors: Gregory Gabadadze and Alberto Iglesias
Abstract: In a model of large distance modified gravity we compare the nonperturbative Schwarzschild solution of hep-th/0407049 to approximate solutions obtained previously. In the regions where there is a good qualitative agreement between the two, the nonperturbative solution yields effects that could have observational significance. These effects reduce, by a factor of a few, the predictions for the additional precession of the orbits in the Solar system, still rendering them in an observationally interesting range. The very same effects lead to a mild anomalous scaling of the additional scale-invariant precession rate found by Lue and Starkman.
