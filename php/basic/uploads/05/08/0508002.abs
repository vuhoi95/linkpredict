Title: Comments about quantum symmetries of SU(3) graphs
Authors: R. Coquereaux and D. Hammaoui and G. Schieber and E. H. Tahri
Abstract: For the SU(3) system of graphs generalizing the ADE Dynkin digrams in the classification of modular invariant partition functions in CFT, we present a general collection of algebraic objects and relations that describe fusion properties and quantum symmetries associated with the corresponding Ocneanu quantum groupo\"{i}ds. We also summarize the properties of the individual members of this system.
