Title: D-branes in a Big Bang/Big Crunch Universe: Misner Space
Authors: Yasuaki Hikida and Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study D-branes in a two-dimensional Lorentzian orbifold R^{1,1}/\Gamma with a discrete boost \Gamma. This space is known as Misner or Milne space, and includes big crunch/big bang singularity. In this space, there are D0-branes in spiral orbits and D1-branes with or without flux on them. In particular, we observe imaginary parts of partition functions, and interpret them as the rates of open string pair creation for D0-branes and emission of winding closed strings for D1-branes. These phenomena occur due to the time-dependence of the background. Open string 2 -> 2 scattering amplitude on a D1-brane is also computed and found to be less singular than closed string case.
