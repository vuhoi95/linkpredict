Title: Real and p-Adic Aspects of Quantization of Tachyons
Authors: Goran S. Djordjevic and Ljubisa Nesic
Abstract: A simplified model of tachyon matter in classical and quantum mechanics is constructed. p-Adic path integral quantization of the model is considered. Recent results in using p-adic analysis, as well as perspectives of an adelic generalization, in the investigation of tachyons are briefly discussed. In particular, the perturbative approach in path integral quantization is proposed.
