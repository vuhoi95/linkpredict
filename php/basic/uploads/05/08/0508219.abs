Title: Magnetofluid Unification in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian
Authors: A. Fajarudin and A. Sulaiman and T. P. Djun and L. T. Handoko
Abstract: The Yang-Mills magnetofluid unification is constructed using lagrangian approach by imposing certain gauge symmetry to the matter inside the fluid. The model provides a general description for relativistic fluid interacting with Abelian or non-Abelian gauge field. The differences with the hybrid magnetofluid model are discussed, and few physical consequences of this formalism are worked out.
