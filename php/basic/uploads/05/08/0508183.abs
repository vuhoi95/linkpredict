Authors: Ashok Das and A. Melikyan and Matsuo Sato
Abstract: We continue the program initiated in hep-th/0411200 and calculate the algebra of the flat currents for the string on AdS_5 x S^5 background in the light-cone gauge with kappa-symmetry fixed. We find that the algebra has a closed form and that the non-ultralocal terms come with a weight factor e^{\phi} that depends on the radial AdS_5 coordinate. Based on results in two-dimensional sigma models coupled to gravity via the dilaton field, this suggests that the algebra of transition matrices in the present case is likely to be unambigous.
