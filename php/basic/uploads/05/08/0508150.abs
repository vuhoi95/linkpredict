Title: Charged black holes in generalized dilaton-axion gravity
Authors: Sourav Sur and Saurya Das and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We study generic Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond-dilaton actions, and derive conditions under which they give rise to static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions. We obtain new asymptotically flat and non-flat black hole solutions which are in general electrically and magnetically charged. They have positive definite and finite quasi-local masses. Existing non-rotating black hole solutions (including those appearing in low energy string theory) are recovered in special limits.
