Title: Obstructions on the horizon geometry from string theory corrections to  Einstein gravity
Authors: Gustavo Dotti and Reinaldo J. Gleiser
Abstract: Higher dimensional Einstein gravity in vacuum admits static black hole solutions with an Einstein manifold of non constant curvature as a horizon. This gives a much richer family of static black holes than in four dimensional GR. However, as we show in this paper, the Gauss-Bonnet string theory correction to Einstein gravity poses severe limitations on the geometry of a horizon Einstein manifold. The additional stringy constraints rule out most of the known examples of exotic black holes with a horizon of non constant curvature.
