Title: N=4 supersymmetric Eguchi-Hanson sigma model in d=1
Authors: C. Burdik and S. Krivonos and A. Shcherbakov
Abstract: We show that it is possible to construct a supersymmetric mechanics with four supercharges possessing not conformally flat target space. A general idea of constructing such models is presented. A particular case with Eguchi--Hanson target space is investigated in details: we present the standard and quotient approaches to get the Eguchi--Hanson model, demonstrate their equivalence, give a full set of nonlinear constraints, study their properties and give an explicit expression for the target space metric.
