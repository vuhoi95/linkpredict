Title: Bianchi-I classical and quantum spinor cosmology with signature change
Authors: B. Vakili and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We study the classical and quantum evolution of a universe in which the matter source is a massive Dirac spinor field and the universe is described by a Bianchi type I metric. We focus attention on those classical solutions that admit a degenerate metric in which the scale factors have smooth behavior in transition from a Euclidean to a Lorentzian domain and show that this transition happens when the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, is negative. The resulting quantum cosmology and the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation are also studied and closed form expressions for the wave functions of the universe is presented. We have shown that there is a close relationship between the quantum states and signature changing classical solutions, suggesting a mechanism for creation of a Lorentzian universe from a Euclidean region by a continuous change of signature. The quantum solutions also represent a quantization rule for the mass of the spinor field.
