Title: Systematic Speedup of Path Integrals of a Generic $N$-fold Discretized  Theory
Authors: Aleksandar Bogojevic and Antun Balaz and Aleksandar Belic
Abstract: We present and discuss a detailed derivation of a new analytical method that systematically improves the convergence of path integrals of a generic $N$-fold discretized theory. We develop an explicit procedure for calculating a set of effective actions $S^{(p)}$, for $p=1,2,3,...$ which have the property that they lead to the same continuum amplitudes as the starting action, but that converge to that continuum limit ever faster. Discretized amplitudes calculated using the $p$ level effective action differ from the continuum limit by a term of order $1/N^p$. We obtain explicit expressions for the effective actions for levels $p\le 9$. We end by analyzing the speedup of Monte Carlo simulations of two different models: an anharmonic oscillator with quartic coupling and a particle in a modified P\"oschl-Teller potential.
