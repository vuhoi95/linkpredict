Title: Higgsing and Superpotential Deformations of ADE Superconformal Theories
Authors: Takuya Okuda and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We study large classes of renormalization group flows, driven by scalar expectation values or mesonic superpotential terms, away from the conformal fixed points of the 4d supersymmetric gauge theories with $ADE$-type superpotentials. The $a$-maximization procedure allows us to compute the $R$ charges and to check the $a$-theorem conjecture. For a theory obtained by Higgsing the $D_{k+2}$ theory, we use the magnetic dual description proposed by Brodie to determine the parameter region where the resulting theory is at a non-trivial conformal fixed point.
