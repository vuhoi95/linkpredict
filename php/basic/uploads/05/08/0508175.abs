Title: Evolution of a Self-interacting Scalar Field in the spacetime of a  Higher Dimensional Black Hole
Authors: Rafal Moderski and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: In the spacetime of n-dimensional static charged black hole we examine the mechanism by which the self-interacting scalar hair decay. It is turned out that the intermediate asymptotic behaviour of the self-interacting scalar field is determined by an oscilatory inverse power law. We confirm our results by numerical calculations.
