Title: BRST extension of the Faddeev model
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: The Faddeev model is a second class constrained system. Here we construct its nilpotent BRST operator and derive the ensuing manifestly BRST invariant Lagrangian. Our construction employs the structure of Stuckelberg fields in a nontrivial fashion.
