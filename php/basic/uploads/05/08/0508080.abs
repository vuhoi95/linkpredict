Title: Open String Moduli in KKLT Compactifications
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Yaron E. Antebi and Micha Berkooz
Abstract: In the Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) de-Sitter construction one introduces an anti-D3-brane that breaks the supersymmetry and leads to a positive cosmological constant. In this paper we investigate the open string moduli associated with this anti-D3-brane, corresponding to its position on the 3-sphere at the tip of the deformed conifold. We show that in the KKLT construction these moduli are very light, and we suggest a possible way to give these moduli a large mass by putting orientifold planes in the KKLT "throat".
