Abstract: We investigate what becomes of the translational zero-mode of a five-dimensional domain wall in the presence of gravity, studying the scalar perturbations of a thick gravitating domain wall with AdS asymptotics and a well-defined zero-gravity limit. Our analysis reveals the presence of a wide resonance which can be seen as a remnant of the translational zero-mode present in the domain wall in the absence of gravity and which ensures a continuous change of the physical quantities (such as e.g. static potential between sources) when the Planck mass is sent to infinity. Provided that the thickness of the wall is much smaller than the AdS radius of the space-time, the parameters of this resonance do not depend on details of the domain wall's structure, but solely on the geometry of the space-time.
