Title: Remark on Immirzi Parameter, Torsion, and Discrete Symmetries
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and A. A. Pomeransky
Abstract: We point out that the new interaction of spinning particles with the torsion tensor, discussed recently, is odd under charge conjugation and time reversal. This explains rather unexpected symmetry properties of the induced effective 4-fermion interaction.
