Title: Glueball mass spectra for supergravity duals of noncommutative gauge  theories
Authors: Tadahito Nakajima and Kenji Suzuki and Hidenori Takahashi
Abstract: We derive the glueball masses in noncommutative super Yang--Mills theories in four dimensions via the dual supergravity description. The spectrum of glueball masses is discrete due to the noncommutativity and the glueball masses are proportional to the noncommutativity parameter with dimension of length. The mass spectrum in the WKB approximation closely agrees with the mass spectrum in finite temperature Yang--Mills theory.
