Title: $Î¸-$ Parameter in 2 Color QCD at Finite Baryon and Isospin Density
Authors: Max A. Metlitski and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We use 2-color QCD as a model to study the effects of simultaneous presence of the so-called $\theta$ parameter, chemical potentials for baryon number, $\mu_B$ and for isospin charge, $\mu_I$. We pay special attention to $\theta$, $\mu_B$, $\mu_I$ dependence of different vacuum condensates, including chiral and diquark condensates, as well as the gluon condensate, $<G^2>$, and the topological susceptibility. We find that two phase transitions of the second order will occur when $\theta$ relaxes from $\theta=2\pi$ to $\theta=0$, if $\mu$ is of order of the pion mass. We demonstrate that the transition to the superfluid phase at $\theta = \pi$ occurs at a much lower chemical potential than at $\theta = 0$. We also show that the strong $\theta$ dependence present near $\theta = \pi$ in vacuum (Dashen's phenomenon), becomes smoothed out in the superfluid phase. Finally, we comment on the relevance of this study for the real world with N_c=3.
