Title: Born reciprocity and the granularity of space-time
Authors: P D Jarvis and S O Morgan
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Robertson inequality for relativistic position and momentum operators X^\mu, P_\nu, \mu, \nu = 0,1,2,3, is interpreted in terms of Born reciprocity and `non-commutative' relativistic phase space geometry. For states which saturate the Schr\"odinger-Robertson inequality, a typology of semiclassical limits is pointed out, characterised by the orbit structure within its unitary irreducible representations, of the full invariance group of Born reciprocity, the so-called `quaplectic' group U(3,1)xH(3,1) (the semi-direct product of the unitary relativistic dyamical symmetry U(3,1) with the Weyl-Heisenberg group H(3,1)). The example of the `scalar' case, namely the relativistic oscillator, and associated multimode squeezed states, is treated in detail. In this case,it is suggested that the semiclassical limit corresponds to the separate emergence of space-time and matter, in the form of the stress-energy tensor, and the quadrupole tensor, which are in general reciprocally equivalent.
