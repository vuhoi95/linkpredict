Title: Exactly solvable model of the 2D electrical double layer
Authors: L. Samaj and Z. Bajnok
Abstract: We consider equilibrium statistical mechanics of a simplified model for the ideal conductor electrode in an interface contact with a classical semi-infinite electrolyte, modeled by the two-dimensional Coulomb gas of pointlike $\pm$ unit charges in the stability-against-collapse regime of reduced inverse temperatures $0\le \beta<2$. If there is a potential difference between the bulk interior of the electrolyte and the grounded interface, the electrolyte region close to the interface (known as the electrical double layer) carries some nonzero surface charge density. The model is mappable onto an integrable semi-infinite sine-Gordon theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The exact form-factor and boundary state information gained from the mapping provide asymptotic forms of the charge and number density profiles of electrolyte particles at large distances from the interface. The result for the asymptotic behavior of the induced electric potential, related to the charge density via the Poisson equation, confirms the validity of the concept of renormalized charge and the corresponding saturation hypothesis. It is documented on the non-perturbative result for the asymptotic density profile at a strictly nonzero $\beta$ that the Debye-H\"uckel $\beta\to 0$ limit is a delicate issue.
