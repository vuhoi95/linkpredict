Title: Quantum Liouville theory on the pseudosphere with heavy charges
Authors: Pietro Menotti and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We develop a perturbative expansion of quantum Liouville theory on the pseudosphere around the background generated by heavy charges. Explicit results are presented for the one and two point functions corresponding to the summation of infinite classes of standard perturbative graphs. The results are compared to the one point function and to a special case of the two point function derived by Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov in the bootstrap approach, finding complete agreement. A partial summation of the conformal block is also obtained.
