Title: Holographic Gravitational Anomalies
Authors: Per Kraus and Finn Larsen
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence one encounters theories that are not invariant under diffeomorphisms. In the boundary theory this is a gravitational anomaly, and can arise in 4k+2 dimensions. In the bulk, there can be gravitational Chern-Simons terms which vary by a total derivative. We work out the holographic stress tensor for such theories, and demonstrate agreement between the bulk and boundary. Anomalies lead to novel effects, such as a nonzero angular momentum for global AdS(3). In string theory such Chern-Simons terms are known with exact coefficients. The resulting anomalies, combined with symmetries, imply corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes that agree exactly with the microscopic counting.
