Authors: Yong-Qiang Wang and Tie-Yan Si and Yu-Xiao Liu and Yi-Shi Duan
Abstract: We study fermionic zero modes in the background of self-dual vortex on a two-dimensional non-compact extra space in 5+1 dimensions. In the Abelian Higgs model, we present an unified description of the topological and non-topological self-dual vortex on the extra two dimensions. Based on it, we study localization of bulk fermions on a brane with inclusion of Yang-Mills and gravity backgrounds in six dimensions. Through two simple cases, it is shown that the vortex background contributes a phase shift to the fermionic zero mode, this phase is actually origin from the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
