Title: On deformation theory of quantum vertex algebras
Authors: Harald Grosse and Karl-Georg Schlesinger
Abstract: We study an algebraic deformation problem which captures the data of the general deformation problem for a quantum vertex algebra. We derive a system of coupled equations which is the counterpart of the Maurer-Cartan equation on the usual Hochschild complex of an assocative algebra. We show that this system of equations results from an action principle. This might be the starting point for a perturbative treatment of the deformation problem of quantum vertex algebras. Our action generalizes the action of the Kodaira-Spencer theory of gravity and might therefore also be of relevance for applications in string theory.
