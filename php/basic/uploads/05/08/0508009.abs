Title: Schroedinger upper bounds to semirelativistic eigenvalues
Authors: Richard L. Hall and Wolfgang Lucha
Abstract: Problems posed by semirelativistic Hamiltonians of the form H = sqrt{m^2+p^2} + V(r) are studied. It is shown that energy upper bounds can be constructed in terms of certain related Schroedinger operators; these bounds include free parameters which can be chosen optimally.
