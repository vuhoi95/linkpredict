Title: Self-Dual Fields Harbored by a Kerr-Taub-bolt Instanton
Authors: A. N. Aliev and Cihan Saçlioğlu
Abstract: We present a new exact solution for self-dual Abelian gauge fields living on the space of the Kerr-Taub-bolt instanton, which is a generalized example of asymptotically flat instantons with non-self-dual curvature, by constructing the corresponding square integrable harmonic form on this space.
