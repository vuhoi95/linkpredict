Title: Gravitational Radius Stabilization in Supersymmetric Warped  Compactification
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: We examine the possibility of the extra dimensional radius stabilization with only the gravity multiplet in the bulk and some couplings at orbifold fixed points in a supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum model. Unfortunately, we find that the radius cannot be stabilized in all the cases we consider. Depending on parameters in the model, the fifth dimension collapses or its radius goes to infinity. While the former case is theoretically disastrous, the latter implies that the so-called ``RS II'' model is automatically realized in our setup. Although the radius is not stabilized, there is nothing wrong with the resultant RS II model, because it is not only phenomenologically viable but also free from the gauge hierarchy problem thanks to its supersymmetric extension.
