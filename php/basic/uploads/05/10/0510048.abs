Abstract: We investigate non-extremal D-instantons in an asymptotically $ AdS_5 \times S^5$ background and the role they play in the $ AdS_5 / CFT_4$ correspondence. We find that the holographic dual operators of non-extremal D-instanton configurations do not correspond to self-dual Yang-Mills instantons, and we compute explicitly the deviation from self-duality. Furthermore, a class of non-extremal D-instantons yield Euclidean axionic wormhole solutions with two asymptotic boundaries. After Wick rotating, this provides a playground for investigating holography in the presence of cosmological singularities in a closed universe.
