Title: Non-Abelian Brane Worlds: The Heterotic String Story
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Gabriele Honecker and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We discuss chiral supersymmetric compactifications of the SO(32) heterotic string on Calabi-Yau manifolds equipped with direct sums of stable bundles with structure group U(n). In addition we allow for non-perturbative heterotic five-branes. These models are S-dual to Type I compactifications with D9- and D5-branes, which by themselves are mirror symmetric to general intersecting D6-brane models. For the construction of concrete examples we consider elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with SU(n) bundles given by the spectral cover construction. The U(n) bundles are obtained via twisting by line bundles. We present a four-generation Pati-Salam and a three-generation Standard-like model.
