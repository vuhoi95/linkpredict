Title: The b-Field in Pure Spinor Quantization of Superstrings
Authors: Ichiro Oda and Mario Tonin
Abstract: In the framework of the pure spinor approach of superstring theories, we describe the Y-formalism and use it to compute the picture raised b-field. At the end we discuss briefly the new, non-minimal formalism of Berkovits and the related non-minimal b-field.
