Title: Coherent States with SU(2) and SU(3) Charges
Authors: Manu Mathur and Samir K. Paul
Abstract: We define coherent states carrying SU(2) charges by exploiting Schwinger boson representation of SU(2) Lie algebra. These coherent states satisfy continuity property and provide resolution of identity on $S^{3}$. We further generalize these techniques to construct the corresponding SU(3) charge coherent states. The SU(N) extension is discussed.
