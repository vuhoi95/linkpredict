Title: Effective N=1 description of 5D conformal supergravity
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We construct an effective N=1 superfield description of five-dimensional conformal supergravity. By the use of this description, we reinterpret some physical systems such as Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking from the conformal supergravity viewpoint. We also show how to introduce a radion fluctuation mode in this framework.
