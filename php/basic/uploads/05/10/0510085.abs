Title: A three-parametric deformation of GL(1/1)
Authors: Nguyen Anh Ky and Nguyen Thi Hong Van
Abstract: A three-parametric $R$-matrix satisfying a graded Yang-Baxter equation is introduced.This $R$-matrix allows us to construct new quantum supergroups which are deformations of the supergroup $GL(1/1)$ and the universal enveloping algebra $U[gl(1/1)]$.
