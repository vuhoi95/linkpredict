Title: Geometry of Higher-Dimensional Black Hole Thermodynamics
Authors: Jan E. Aman and Narit Pidokrajt
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamic curvatures of the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in spacetime dimensions higher than four. These black holes possess thermodynamic geometries similar to those in four dimensional spacetime. The thermodynamic geometries are the Ruppeiner geometry and the conformally related Weinhold geometry. The Ruppeiner geometry for $d=5$ Kerr black hole is curved and divergent in the extremal limit. For $d \geq 6$ Kerr black hole there is no extremality but the Ruppeiner curvature diverges where one suspects that the black hole becomes unstable. The Weinhold geometry of the Kerr black hole in arbitrary dimension is a flat geometry. For RN black hole the Ruppeiner geometry is flat in all spacetime dimensions, whereas its Weinhold geometry is curved. In $d \geq 5$ the Kerr black hole can possess more than one angular momentum. Finally we discuss the Ruppeiner geometry for the Kerr black hole in $d=5$ with double angular momenta.
