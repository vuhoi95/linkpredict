Title: Gauss-Bonnet Brane Cosmology with Radion Stabilization
Authors: G. L. Alberghi and A. Tronconi
Abstract: We study cosmology in a five-dimensional brane-world with a stabilizing effective potential for the radion and matter localized on the two branes. We consider the corrections induced by the Gauss-Bonnet contribution to the total action performing and expansion around the two possible static solutions up to second order in the ratio between brane matter energy density and brane tensions. The Friedmann and acceleration equations on the visible brane are obtained and discussed.
