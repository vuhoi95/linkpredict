Title: Non-Abelian Brane Worlds: The Open String Story
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Gabriele Honecker and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We extend the string model building rules for the construction of chiral supersymmetric Type I compactifications on smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds. These models contain stacks of D9-branes endowed with general stable U(n) bundles on their world-volume and D5-branes wrapping holomorphic curves on the Calabi-Yau.
