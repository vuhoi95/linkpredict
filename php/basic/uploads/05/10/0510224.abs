Title: Analytical Tachyonic Lump Solutions in Open Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We construct a classical solution in the GSO(-) sector in the framework of a Wess-Zumino-Witten-like open superstring field theory on a non-BPS D-brane. We use an su(2) supercurrent, which is obtained by compactifying a direction to a circle with the critical radius, in order to get analytical tachyonic lump solutions to the equation of motion. By investigating the action expanded around a solution we find that it represents a deformation from a non-BPS D-brane to a D-brane-anti-D-brane system at the critical value of a parameter which is contained in classical solutions. Although such a process was discussed in terms of boundary conformal field theory before, our study is based on open superstring field theory including interaction terms.
