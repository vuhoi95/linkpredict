Title: Radiation reaction on charged particles in three-dimensional motion in  classical and quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Atsushi Higuchi and Giles D. R. Martin
Abstract: We extend our previous work (see arXiv:quant-ph/0501026), which compared the predictions of quantum electrodynamics concerning radiation reaction with those of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac theory for a charged particle in linear motion. Specifically, we calculate the predictions for the change in position of a charged scalar particle, moving in three-dimensional space, due to the effect of radiation reaction in the one-photon-emission process in quantum electrodynamics. The scalar particle is assumed to be accelerated for a finite period of time by a three-dimensional electromagnetic potential dependent only on one of the spacetime coordinates. We perform this calculation in the $\hbar\to 0$ limit and show that the change in position agrees with that obtained in classical electrodynamics with the Lorentz-Dirac force treated as a perturbation. We also show for a time-dependent but space-independent electromagnetic potential that the forward-scattering amplitude at order $e^2$ does not contribute to the position change in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit after the mass renormalization is taken into account.
