Title: On the effective string spectrum of the tridimensional Z(2) gauge model
Authors: Michele Caselle and Martin Hasenbusch and Marco Panero
Abstract: We study the Z(2) lattice gauge theory in three dimensions, and present high precision estimates for the first few energy levels of the string spectrum. These results are obtained from new numerical data for the two-point Polyakov loop correlation function, which is measured in the 3d Ising spin system using duality. This allows us to perform a stringent comparison with the predictions of effective string models. We find a remarkable agreement between the numerical estimates and the Nambu-Goto predictions for the energy gaps at intermediate and large distances. The precision of our data allows to distinguish clearly between the predictions of the full Nambu-Goto action and the simple free string model up to an interquark distance $r \approx 10/\sqrt{\sigma}$. At the same time, our results also confirm the breakdown of the effective picture at short distances, supporting the hypothesis that terms which are not taken into account in the usual Nambu-Goto string formulation yield a non-trivial shift to the energy levels. Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical implications of these results.
