Title: Distribution of Flux Vacua around Singular Points in Calabi-Yau Moduli  Space
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We study the distribution of type IIB flux vacua in the moduli space near various singular loci, e.g. conifolds, ADE singularities on P1, Argyres-Douglas point etc, using the Ashok- Douglas density det(R + omega). We find that the vacuum density is integrable around each of them, irrespective of the type of the singularities. We study in detail an explicit example of an Argyres-Douglas point embedded in a compact Calabi-Yau manifold.
