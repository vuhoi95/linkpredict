Title: Explicit solutions of the classical Calogero & Sutherland systems for  any root system
Authors: R. Sasaki and K. Takasaki
Abstract: Explicit solutions of the classical Calogero (rational with/without harmonic confining potential) and Sutherland (trigonometric potential) systems is obtained by diagonalisation of certain matrices of simple time evolution. The method works for Calogero & Sutherland systems based on any root system. It generalises the well-known results by Olshanetsky and Perelomov for the A type root systems. Explicit solutions of the (rational and trigonometric) higher Hamiltonian flows of the integrable hierarchy can be readily obtained in a similar way for those based on the classical root systems.
