Abstract: We study a non-anticommutative chiral non-singlet deformation of the N=(1,1) abelian gauge multiplet in Euclidean harmonic superspace with a product ansatz for the deformation matrix, C^{(\alpha\beta)}_{(ik)} = c^{(\alpha\beta)}b_{(ik)}. This allows us to obtain in closed form the gauge transformations and the unbroken N=(1,0) supersymmetry transformations preserving the Wess-Zumino gauge, as well as the bosonic sector of the N=(1,0) invariant action. As in the case of a singlet deformation, the bosonic action can be cast in a form where it differs from the free action merely by a scalar factor. The latter is now given by \cosh^2 (2\bar\phi\sqrt{c^2 b^2}}), with \bar\phi being one of two scalar fields of the N=(1,1) vector multiplet. We compare our results with previous studies of non-singlet deformations, including the degenerate case b^2=0 which preserves the N=(1,1/2) fraction of N=(1,1) supersymmetry.
