Title: Conformal properties of hypermultiplet actions in six dimensions
Authors: E. A. Ivanov and A. V. Smilga
Abstract: We consider scale-invariant interactions of 6D N=1 hypermultiplets with the gauge multiplet. If the canonical dimension of the matter scalar field is assumed to be 1, scale-invariant lagrangians involve higher derivatives in the action. Though scale-invariant, all such lagrangians are not invariant with respect to special conformal transformations and their superpartners. If the scalar canonical dimension is assumed to be 2, conformal invariance holds at the classical, but not at the quantum level.
