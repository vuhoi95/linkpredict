Title: The Minimal Model for Dark Matter and Unification
Authors: Rakhi Mahbubani and Leonardo Senatore
Abstract: Gauge coupling unification and the success of TeV-scale weakly interacting dark matter are usually taken as evidence of low energy supersymmetry (SUSY). However, if we assume that the tuning of the higgs can be explained in some unnatural way, from environmental considerations for example, SUSY is no longer a necessary component of any Beyond the Standard Model theory. In this paper we study the minimal model with a dark matter candidate and gauge coupling unification. This consists of the SM plus fermions with the quantum numbers of SUSY higgsinos, and a singlet. It predicts thermal dark matter with a mass that can range from 100 GeV to around 2 TeV and generically gives rise to an electric dipole moment that is just beyond current experimental limits, with a large portion of its allowed parameter space accessible to next generation EDM and direct detection experiments. We study precision unification in this model by embedding it in a 5-D orbifold GUT where certain large threshold corrections are calculable, achieving gauge coupling and b-tau unification, and predicting a rate of proton decay just beyond current limits.
