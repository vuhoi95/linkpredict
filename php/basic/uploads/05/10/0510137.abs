Title: Coset Symmetries in Dimensionally Reduced Heterotic Supergravity
Authors: D. B. Westra and W. Chemissany
Abstract: We investigate the coset structures which appear in the dimensional reduction of supergravity theories. Especially we investigate how to recognize the global symmetry groups if the coset is non-split. As an example we apply our analysis to the theories emanating from the dimensional reduction of Heterotic supergravity.
