Title: Extension of Monster Moonshine to c=24k Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Marcin Jankiewicz and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: We present a family of conformal field theories (or candidates for CFTs) that is build on extremal partition functions. Spectra of these theories can be decomposed into the irreducible representations of the Fischer-Griess Monster sporadic group. Interesting periodicities in the coefficients of extremal partition functions are observed and interpreted as a possible extension of Monster moonshine to c=24k holomorphic field theories.
