Title: The General Warped Solution with Conical Branes in Six-dimensional  Supergravity
Authors: Hyun Min Lee and Christoph Ludeling
Abstract: We present the general regular warped solution with 4D Minkowski spacetime in six-dimensional gauged supergravity. In this framework, we can easily embed multiple conical branes into the warped geometry by choosing an undetermined holomorphic function. As an example, for the holomorphic function with many zeroes, we find warped solutions with multi-branes and discuss the generalized flux quantization in this case.
