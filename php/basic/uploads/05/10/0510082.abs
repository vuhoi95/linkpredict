Title: A Note on Fourier-Laplace Transform and Analytic Wave front Set in  Theory of Tempered Ultrahyperfunctions
Authors: Daniel H. T. Franco and Luiz H. Renoldi
Abstract: In this paper we study the Fourier-Laplace transform of tempered ultrahyperfunctions introduced by Sebasti\~ao e Silva and Hasumi. We establish a generalization of Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem for this setting. This theorem is interesting in connection with the microlocal analysis. For this reason, the paper also contains a description of the singularity structure of tempered ultrahyperfunctions in terms of the concept of analytic wave front set.
