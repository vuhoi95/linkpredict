Authors: F. Fucito and J. F. Morales and R. Poghossian and A. Tanzini
Abstract: In this paper we compute gaugino and scalar condensates in N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with and without massive adjoint matter, using localization formulae over the multi--instanton moduli space. Furthermore we compute the chiral ring relations among the correlators of the $N=1^*$ theory and check this result against the multi-instanton computation finding agreement.
