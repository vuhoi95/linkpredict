Title: Perturbed Logarithmic CFT and Integrable Models
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour and S. Rouhani
Abstract: Perturbation of logarithmic conformal field theories is investigated using Zamolodchikov's method. We derive conditions for the perturbing operator, such that the perturbed model be integrable. We also consider an example where integrable models arise out of perturbation of known logarithmic conformal field theories.
