Title: Generalised geometries, constrained critical points and Ramond-Ramond  fields
Authors: Claus Jeschek and Frederik Witt
Abstract: In the context of generalised geometry we investigate reductions to $SU(m)\times SU(m)$ together with an integrability condition which in dimension 6 describes the geometry of type II supergravity compactifications.
