Title: Moduli Spaces for D-branes at the Tip of a Cone
Authors: Aaron Bergman and Nicholas J. Proudfoot
Abstract: For physicists: We show that the quiver gauge theory derived from a Calabi-Yau cone via an exceptional collection of line bundles on the base has the original cone as a component of its classical moduli space. For mathematicians: We use data from the derived category of sheaves on a Fano surface to construct a quiver, and show that its moduli space of representations has a component which is isomorphic to the anticanonical cone over the surface.
