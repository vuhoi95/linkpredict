Title: Recursion relations, Helicity Amplitudes and Dimensional Regularization
Authors: Callum Quigley and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: Using the method of on-shell recursion relations we compute tree level amplitudes including D-dimensional scalars and fermions. These tree level amplitudes are needed for calculations of one-loop amplitudes in QCD involving external quarks and gluons.
