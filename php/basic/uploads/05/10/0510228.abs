Title: Non-transversality of the gluon polarization tensor in a chromomagnetic  background
Authors: M. Bordag and J. Grebenyuk and V. Skalozub
Abstract: We investigate the question about the transversality of the gluon polarization tensor in a homogeneous chromomagnetic background field. We re-derive the non transversality known from a pure one loop calculation using the Slavnov-Taylor identities. In addition we generalize the procedure to arbitrary gauge fixing parameter $\xi$ and calculate the $\xi$-dependent part of the polarization tensor.
