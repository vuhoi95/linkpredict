Title: An alternative model for the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator
Authors: D. A. Kulikov and R. S. Tutik and A. P. Yaroshenko
Abstract: A new oscillator model with different form of the non-minimal substitution within the framework of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation is offered. The model possesses exact solutions and a discrete spectrum of high degeneracy. The distinctive property of the proposed model is the lack of the spin-orbit interaction, being typical for other relativistic models with the non-minimal substitution, and the different value of the zero-point energy in comparison with that for the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator described in the literature.
