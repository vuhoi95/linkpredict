Title: From Yang-Mills Lagrangian to MHV Diagrams
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Rosly
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of a recently suggested MHV-formalism to the standard Yang-Mills theory. This is achieved by a formally non-local change of variables. In this note we present the explicit formulas while the detailed proofs are postponed to a future publication.
