Title: On the Problem of Extended Special Relativity Creation
Authors: V. V. Korukhov and O. V. Sharypov
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to the creation of a variant of Extended Special Relativity that takes into consideration the existence of limiting relativistically invariant quantities (Planck parameters). It shows the possibility of excluding unphysical predictions of relativity theories thanks to the use of the concept of the maximum velocity of the observed motion of objects. It proposes a model of a vacuum-like medium with a kinematical property of relativistically invariant rest. The Planck quantities are considered as fundamental physical constants related to the structure of this medium.
