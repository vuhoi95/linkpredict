Title: Stable Monopole-Antimonopole String Background in SU(2) QCD
Authors: Y. M. Cho and D. G. Pak
Abstract: Motivated by the instability of the Savvidy-Nielsen-Olesen vacuum we make a systematic search for a stable magnetic background in pure SU(2) QCD. It is shown that a pair of axially symmetric monopole and antimonopole strings is stable, provided that the distance between the two strings is less than a critical value. The existence of a stable monopole-antimonopole string background strongly supports that a magnetic condensation of monopole-antimonopole pairs can generate a dynamical symmetry breaking, and thus the magnetic confinement of color in QCD.
