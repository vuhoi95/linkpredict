Title: On the Weil-Petersson volume and the first Chern Class of the moduli  space of Calabi-Yau manifolds
Authors: Zhiqin Lu and Xiaofeng Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we proved that the Weil-Petersson volume of Calabi-Yau moduli is a rational number. We also proved that the integrations of the invariants of the Ricci curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric with respect to the Weil-Petersson volume form are all rational numbers.
