Title: Quark gap equation within the analytic approach to QCD
Authors: A. C. Aguilar and A. V. Nesterenko and J. Papavassiliou
Abstract: The compatibility between the QCD analytic invariant charge and chiral symmetry breaking is examined in detail. The coupling in question incorporates asymptotic freedom and infrared enhancement into a single expression, and contains only one adjustable parameter with dimension of mass. When inserted into the standard form of the quark gap-equation it gives rise to solutions displaying singular confining behavior at the origin. By relating these solutions to the pion decay constant, a rough estimate of about 880 MeV is obtained for the aforementioned mass-scale.
