Title: Features of deSitter Vacua in M-Theory
Authors: Jonathan P. Hsu and Renata Kallosh and Navin Sivanandam
Abstract: We compute the masses of all moduli in the unstable deSitter vacua arising in the toy model of cosmological M-theory flux compactifications on the G2 holonomy manifolds of [1]. The slow-roll parameters in the tachyonic directions are shown to be too large to be useful for conventional models of inflation. However, it appears that we can find fast roll regimes which could, under certain conditions, account for the current dark energy driven accelerated expansion of the universe.
