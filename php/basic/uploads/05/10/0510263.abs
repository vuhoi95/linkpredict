Authors: H. Kaneko and Y. Kitazawa and D. Tomino
Abstract: A group of fuzzy spacetime with SU(3) isometry is studied at the two loop level in IIB matrix model. It consists of spacetime from 4 to 6 dimensions, namely from CP2 to SU(3)/U(1)x U(1). The effective action scales in a universal manner in the large N limit as N and N^{4/3} on 4 and 6 dimensional manifolds respectively. The 4 dimensional spacetime CP2 possesses the smallest effective action in this class.
