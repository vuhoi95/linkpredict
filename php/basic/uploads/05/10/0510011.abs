Title: On Motives Associated to Graph Polynomials
Authors: Spencer Bloch and Hélène Esnault and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: The appearance of multiple zeta values in anomalous dimensions and $\beta$-functions of renormalizable quantum field theories has given evidence towards a motivic interpretation of these renormalization group functions. In this paper we start to hunt the motive, restricting our attention to a subclass of graphs in four dimensional scalar field theory which give scheme independent contributions to the above functions.
