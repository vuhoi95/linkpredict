Title: The Bethe Ansatz for Z_S Orbifolds of N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: N. Beisert and R. Roiban
Abstract: Worldsheet techniques can be used to argue for the integrability of string theory on AdS_5xS^5/Z_S, which is dual to the strongly coupled Z_S-orbifold of N=4 SYM. We analyze the integrability of these field theories in the perturbative regime and construct the relevant Bethe equations.
