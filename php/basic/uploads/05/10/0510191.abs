Title: Multihadron production features in different reactions
Authors: Edward K. G. Sarkisyan and Alexander S. Sakharov
Abstract: We consider multihadron production processes in different types of collisions in the framework of the picture based on dissipating energy of participants and their types. In particular, the similarities of such bulk observables like the charged particle mean multiplicity and the pseudorapidity density at midrapidity measured in nucleus-nucleus, (anti)proton-proton and electron-positron interactions are analysed. Within the description proposed a good agreement with the measurements in a wide range of nuclear collision energies from AGS to RHIC is obtained. The predictions up to the LHC energies are made and compared to experimental extrapolations.
