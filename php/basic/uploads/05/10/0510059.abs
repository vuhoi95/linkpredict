Title: Noncommutative Geometry and Gravity
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Marija Dimitrijevic and Frank Meyer and Julius Wess
Abstract: We study a deformation of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold. The deformation is based on a general twist. This leads to a differential geometry on a noncommutative algebra of functions whose product is a star-product. The class of noncommutative spaces studied is very rich. Non-anticommutative superspaces are also briefly considered. The differential geometry developed is covariant under deformed diffeomorphisms and it is coordinate independent. The main target of this work is the construction of Einstein's equations for gravity on noncommutative manifolds.
