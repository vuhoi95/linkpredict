Title: Exact form factors in integrable quantum field theories: the scaling  Z(N)-Ising model
Authors: H. Babujian and A. Foerster and M. Karowski
Abstract: A general form factor formula for the scaling Z(N)-Ising model is constructed. Exact expressions for matrix elements are obtained for several local operators. In addition, the commutation rules for order, disorder parameters and para-Fermi fields are derived. Because of the unusual statistics of the fields, the quantum field theory seems to be not related to any classical Lagrangian or field equation.
