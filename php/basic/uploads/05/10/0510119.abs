Title: Extension of geodesic algebras to continuous genus
Authors: L. Chekhov and J. E. Nelson and T. Regge
Abstract: Using the Penner--Fock parameterization for Teichmuller spaces of Riemann surfaces with holes, we construct the string-like free-field representation of the Poisson and quantum algebras of geodesic functions in the continuous-genus limit. The mapping class group acts naturally in the obtained representation.
