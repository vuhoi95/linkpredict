Abstract: We consider a relativistic particle model in an enlarged relativistic phase space M^{18} = (X_\mu, P_\mu, \eta_\alpha, \oeta_\dalpha, \sigma_\alpha, \osigma_\dalpha, e, \phi), which is derived from the free two-twistor dynamics. The spin sector variables (\eta_\alpha, \oeta_\dalpha, \sigma_\alpha,\ osigma_\dalpha) satisfy two second class constraints and account for the relativistic spin structure, and the pair (e,\phi) describes the electric charge sector. After introducing the Liouville one-form on M^{18}, derived by a non-linear transformation of the canonical Liouville one-form on the two-twistor space, we analyze the dynamics described by the first and second class constraints. We use a composite orthogonal basis in four-momentum space to obtain the scalars defining the invariant spin projections. The first-quantized theory provides a consistent set of wave equations, determining the mass, spin, invariant spin projection and electric charge of the relativistic particle. The wavefunction provides a generating functional for free, massive higher spin fields.
