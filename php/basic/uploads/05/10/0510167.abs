Title: The Adjoint Vacuum Sector of Massless QCD2
Authors: A. Abrashkin and Y. Frishman and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: We consider a "one current" state, obtained by appication of a color current on the "adjoint" vacuum, in $QCD_2$, with quarks in fundamental representation. The quarks are taken to be massless. The theory on the light-front can be "currentized", namely formulated in terms of currents only. The adjoint vacuum is obtained by applying a current derivative, at zero momentum, on the singlet vacuum. In general the "one current" states are not eigenstates of $M^2=2P^+P^-$, except in the large $N_f$ limit. Problems with infra-red regularizations are pointed out. Connection to fermionic structure is made.
