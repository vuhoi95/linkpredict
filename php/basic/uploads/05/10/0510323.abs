Title: Asymptotic expansions of Feynman diagrams and the Mellin-Barnes  representation
Authors: Samuel Friot and David Greynat
Abstract: In this talk, we describe part of our recent work \cite{FGdeR05} (see also \cite{F05,G05}) that gives new results in the context of asymptotic expansions of Feynman diagrams using the Mellin-Barnes representation.
