Title: Super-acceleration as Signature of Dark Sector Interaction
Authors: Subinoy Das and Pier Stefano Corasaniti and Justin Khoury
Abstract: We show that an interaction between dark matter and dark energy generically results in an effective dark energy equation of state of w<-1. This arises because the interaction alters the redshift-dependence of the matter density. An observer who fits the data treating the dark matter as non-interacting will infer an effective dark energy fluid with w<-1. We argue that the model is consistent with all current observations, the tightest constraint coming from estimates of the matter density at different redshifts. Comparing the luminosity and angular-diameter distance relations with LambdaCDM and phantom models, we find that the three models are degenerate within current uncertainties but likely distinguishable by the next generation of dark energy experiments.
