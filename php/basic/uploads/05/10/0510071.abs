Title: Lagrangian formulation of classical fields within Riemann-Liouville  fractional derivatives
Authors: D. Baleanu and S. Muslih
Abstract: The classical fields with fractional derivatives are investigated by using the fractional Lagrangian formulation.The fractional Euler-Lagrange equations were obtained and two examples were studied.
