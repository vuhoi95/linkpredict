Authors: Valery Pokrovsky and Alexander Belavin and Alexei Zamolodchikov and Yukitaka Ishimoto
Abstract: An International Workshop dedicated to the anniversary of the Polyakov's String (of course today there is no need to remind the meaning and the role of this theory) was held in Chernogolovka in June 2005. Apart from the 25-th anniversary of the first appearance of the Polyakov's String theory, this conference, to our mind, might be also thought of as a 35 years from the discovery of the Conformal Invariance, 30 years of the Monopole and the Instantons and, finally, as the 20-th anniversary of the CFT. A case of mysterious coincidence, this year is also a jubilee of Sasha himself, whose contribution to the Theoretical Physics of 20-th century is far from being exhausted by the achievements listed above.
