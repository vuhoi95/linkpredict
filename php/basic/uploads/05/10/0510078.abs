Title: Baxterized Solutions of Reflection Equation and Integrable Chain Models
Authors: A. P. Isaev and O. V. Ogievetsky
Abstract: Non-polynomial Baxterized solutions of reflection equations associated with affine Hecke and affine Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras are found. Relations to integrable spin chain models with nontrivial boundary conditions are discussed.
