Title: De-Sitter and double asymmetric brane worlds
Authors: Rommel Guerrero and R. Omar Rodriguez and Rafael Torrealba
Abstract: Asymmetric brane worlds with dS expansion and static double kink topology are obtained from a recently proposed method and their properties are analyzed. These domain walls interpolate between two spacetimes with different cosmological constants. In the dynamic case, the vacua correspond to dS and AdS geometry, unlike the static case where they correspond to AdS background. We show that is possible to confine gravity on such branes. In particular, the double brane world host two different walls, so that the gravity is localized on one of them.
