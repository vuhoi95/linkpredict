Title: Lie Particle And Its Batalin-Tyutin Extension
Authors: Subir Ghosh and Probir Pal
Abstract: In this Letter we have proposed a point particle model that generates a noncommutative three-space, with the coordinate brackets being Lie algebraic in nature, in particular isomorphic to the angular momentum algebra. The work is in the spirit of our earlier works in this connection, {\it {i.e.}} PLB 618 (2005)243 and PLB 623 (2005)251, where the $\kappa $-Minkowski form of noncomutative spacetime was considered. This non-linear and operatorial nature of the configuration space coordinate algebra can pose problems regarding its quantization. This prompts us to embed the model in the Batalin-Tyutin extended space where the equivalent model comprises of phase space variables satisfying a canonical algebra. We also compare our present model with the point particle model, previously proposed by us, in the context of $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime.
