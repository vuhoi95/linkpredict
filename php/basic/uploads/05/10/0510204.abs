Title: Is it SUSY?
Authors: AseshKrishna Datta and Gordon L. Kane and Manuel Toharia
Abstract: If a signal for physics beyond the Standard Model is observed at the Tevatron collider or LHC, we will be eager to interpret it. Because only certain observables can be studied at a hadron collider, it will be difficult or impossible to measure masses and spins that could easily establish what physics was being seen. Nevertheless, different underlying physics implies different signatures. We examine the main signatures for supersymmetry, with some emphasis on recognizing supersymmetry in parts of parameter space where generic signatures are reduced or absent. We also consider how to distinguish supersymmetry from alternatives that most closely resemble it, such as Universal Extra Dimensions (UED). Using the robust connection between spins and production cross section, we think it will not be difficult to distinguish UED from supersymmetry. We expect that by considering patterns of signatures it is very likely that it will not be difficult to find a compelling interpretation of any signal of new physics.
