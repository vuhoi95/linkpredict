Title: Improved WKB analysis of Slow-Roll Inflation
Authors: R. Casadio and F. Finelli and M. Luzzi and G. Venturi
Abstract: We extend the WKB method for the computation of cosmological perturbations during inflation beyond leading order and provide the power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations to second order in the slow-roll parameters. Our method does not require that the slow-roll parameters be constant. Although leading and next-to-leading results in the slow-roll parameters depend on the approximation technique used in the computation, we find that the inflationary theoretical predictions obtained may reach the accuracy required by planned observations. In two technical appendices, we compare our techniques and results with previous findings.
