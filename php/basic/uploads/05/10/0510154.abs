Title: On Twist Quantizations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare Algebras
Authors: A. Borowiec and J. Lukierski and V. N. Tolstoy
Abstract: We use the decomposition of o(3,1)=sl(2;C)_1\oplus sl(2;C)_2 in order to describe nonstandard quantum deformation of o(3,1) linked with Jordanian deformation of sl(2;C}. Using twist quantization technique we obtain the deformed coproducts and antipodes which can be expressed in terms of real physical Lorentz generators. We describe the extension of the considered deformation of D=4 Lorentz algebra to the twist deformation of D=4 Poincare algebra with dimensionless deformation parameter.
