Title: Radiative Effects in the Standard Model Extension
Authors: V. Ch. Zhukovsky and A. E. Lobanov and E. M. Murchikova
Abstract: The possibility of radiative effects induced by the Lorentz and CPT non-invariant interaction term for fermions in the Standard Model Extension is investigated. In particular, electron-positron photo-production and photon emission by electrons and positrons are studied. The rates of these processes are calculated in the Furry picture. It is demonstrated that the rates obtained in the framework of the model adopted strongly depend on the polarization states of the particles involved. As a result, ultra-relativistic particles produced should occupy states with a preferred spin orientation, i.e., photons have the sign of polarization opposite to the sign of the effective potential, while charged particle are preferably in the state with the helicity coinciding with the sign of the effective potential. This leads to evident spatial asymmetries which may have certain consequences observable at high energy accelerators, and in astrophysical and cosmological studies.
