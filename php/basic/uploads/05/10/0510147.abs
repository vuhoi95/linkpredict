Title: Dyon Spectrum in CHL Models
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: We propose a formula for the degeneracy of quarter BPS dyons in a class of CHL models. The formula uses a modular form of a subgroup of the genus two modular group Sp(2,Z). Our proposal is S-duality invariant and reproduces correctly the entropy of a dyonic black hole to first non-leading order for large values of the charges.
