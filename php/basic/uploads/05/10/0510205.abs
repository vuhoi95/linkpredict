Title: On Superstring Disk Amplitudes in a Rolling Tachyon Background
Authors: Niko Jokela and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Jaydeep Majumder
Abstract: We study the tree level scattering or emission of n closed superstrings from a decaying non-BPS brane in Type II superstring theory. We attempt to calculate generic n-point superstring disk amplitudes in the rolling tachyon background. We show that these can be written as infinite power series of Toeplitz determinants, related to expectation values of a periodic function in Circular Unitary Ensembles. Further analytical progress is possible in the special case of bulk-boundary disk amplitudes. These are interpreted as probability amplitudes for emission of a closed string with initial conditions perturbed by the addition of an open string vertex operator. This calculation has been performed previously in bosonic string theory, here we extend the analysis for superstrings. We obtain a result for the average energy of closed superstrings produced in the perturbed background.
