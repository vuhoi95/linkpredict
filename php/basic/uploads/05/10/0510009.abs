Title: Graviton emission from a higher-dimensional black hole
Authors: A. S. Cornell and Wade Naylor and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We discuss the graviton absorption probability (greybody factor) and the cross-section of a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole (BH). We are motivated by the suggestion that a great many BHs may be produced at the LHC and bearing this fact in mind, for simplicity, we shall investigate the intermediate energy regime for a static Schwarzschild BH. That is, for $(2M)^{1/(n-1)}\omega\sim 1$, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole and $\omega$ is the energy of the emitted gravitons in $(2+n)$-dimensions. To find easily tractable solutions we work in the limit $l \gg 1$, where $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number of the graviton.
