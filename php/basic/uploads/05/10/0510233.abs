Title: Non trivial generalizations of the Schwinger pair production result II
Authors: Herbert M. Fried and Yves Gabellini
Abstract: It is suggested that Schwinger's (1951) vacuum persistence probability against pair production by an intense but constant electric field is a very good approximation to the corresponding quantity if the field does not vary appreciably over distances less than m/e/E/5 pages
