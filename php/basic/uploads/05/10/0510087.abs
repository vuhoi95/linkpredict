Title: Non-Supersymmetric Deformations of Non-Critical Superstrings
Authors: Nissan Itzhaki and David Kutasov and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We study certain supersymmetry breaking deformations of linear dilaton backgrounds in different dimensions. In some cases, the deformed theory has bulk closed strings tachyons. In other cases there are no bulk tachyons, but there are localized tachyons. The real time condensation of these localized tachyons is described by an exactly solvable worldsheet CFT. We also find some stable, non-supersymmetric backgrounds.
