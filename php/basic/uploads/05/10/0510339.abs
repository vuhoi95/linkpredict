Title: 'Electron' and 'photon' emerging from supersymmetric neutral particles:  A possible realization in ultracold Bose-Fermi atom mixture
Authors: Yue Yu and S. T. Chui
Abstract: We show that the 'electron' and 'photon' can emerge from a supersymmetric Hubbard model which is a non-relativistic theory of the neutral particles. The Higgs boson and 'photon' may not appear in the same phase of the phase diagram. In a Mott insulator phase of the boson, the 'electron' and 'photon' are stablized by an induced Coulomb interaction between 'electrons'. This emergent mechanism may be 'realized' in an ultracold Bose-Fermi atom mixture except the long range Coulomb interaction is repalced by a nearest neighbor one. We suggest to create 'external electric field' so that the 'electron' excitation can be observed by measuring the linear density-density response of the 'electron' gas to the 'external field' in the time flying experiment of the mixture. The Fermi surface of the 'electron' gas may also be expected to be observed in the time flying.
