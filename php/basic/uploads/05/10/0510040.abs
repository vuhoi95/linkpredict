Title: Introductory Lectures on Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: In these lectures we present a few topics in Quantum Field Theory in detail. Some of them are conceptual and some more practical. They have been selected because they appear frequently in current applications to Particle Physics and String Theory.
