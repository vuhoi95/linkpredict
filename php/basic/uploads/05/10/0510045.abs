Title: Vacuum Polarization Effects in the Lorentz and PCT Violating  Electrodynamics
Authors: G. Bonneau and L. C. Costa and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: In this work we report new results concerning the question of dynamical mass generation in the Lorentz and PCT violating quantum electrodynamics. A one loop calculation for the vacuum polarization tensor is presented. The electron propagator, "dressed" by a Lorentz breaking extra term in the fermion Lagrangian density, is approximated by its first order: this scheme is shown to break gauge invariance. Then we rather consider a full calculation to second order in the Lorentz breaking parameter: we recover gauge invariance and use the Schwinger-Dyson equation to discuss the full photon propagator. This allows a discussion on a possible photon mass shift as well as measurable, observable physical consequences, such as the Lamb-shift.
