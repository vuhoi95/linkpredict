Title: The Blackbody Radiation in D-Dimensional Universes
Authors: Tatiana R. Cardoso and Antonio S. de Castro
Abstract: The blackbody radiation is analyzed in universes with $D$ spatial dimensions. With the classical electrodynamics suited to the universe in focus and recurring to the hyperspherical coordinates, it is shown that the spectral energy density as well as the total energy density are sensible to the dimensionality of the universe. Wien's displacement law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are properly generalized.
