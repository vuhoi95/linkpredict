Title: BRST superspace and auxiliary fields for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: A. Aidaoui and A. Meziane and M. Tahiri
Abstract: We use a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) superspace approach to formulate off-shell nilpotent BRST and anti-BRST transformations in four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The method is based on the possibility of introducing auxiliary fields through the supersymmetric transformations of the superpartener of the gauge potential associated to a supersymmetric Yang-Mills connection. These fields are required to achieve the off-shell nilpotency of the BRST and anti-BRST operators. We also show how this off-shell structure is used to build the BRST and anti-BRST invariant gauge-fixing quantum action.
