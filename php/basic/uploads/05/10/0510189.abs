Title: Integrable Spin Chains on the Conformal Moose
Authors: Darius Sadri and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We consider N=1, D=4 superconformal U(N)^{pq} Yang-Mills theories dual to AdS_5xS^5/Z_pxZ_q orbifolds. We construct the dilatation operator of this superconformal gauge theory at one-loop planar level. We demonstrate that a specific sector of this dilatation operator can be thought of as the transfer matrix for a two-dimensional statistical mechanical system, related to an integrable SU(3) anti-ferromagnetic spin chain system, which in turn is equivalent to a 2+1-dimensional string theory where the spatial slices are discretized on a triangular lattice. This is an extension of the SO(6) spin chain picture of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. We comment on the integrability of this N=1 gauge theory and hence the corresponding three-dimensional statistical mechanical system, its connection to three-dimensional lattice gauge theories, extensions to six-dimensional string theories, AdS/CFT type dualities and finally their construction via orbifolds and brane-box models. In the process we discover a new class of almost-BPS BMN type operators with large engineering dimensions but controllably small anomalous corrections.
