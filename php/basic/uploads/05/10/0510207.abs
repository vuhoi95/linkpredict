Title: Reconsidering extra time-like dimensions
Authors: Recai Erdem and Cem S. Un
Abstract: In this study we reconsider the phenomenological problems related to tachyonic modes in the context of extra time-like dimensions. First we reconsider a lower bound on the size of extra time-like dimensions. Next we discuss the issues of spontaneous decay of stable fermions through tachyonic decays and disappearance of fermions due to tachyonic contributions to their self-energies. We find that the tachyonic modes due to extra time-like dimensions are less problematic than the tachyonic modes in the usual 4-dimensional setting because the most troublesome Feynman diagrams are forbidden once the conservation of momentum in the extra time-like dimensions is imposed.
