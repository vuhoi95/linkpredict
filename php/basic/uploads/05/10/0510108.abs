Title: Lorentz symmetry breaking in the noncommutative Wess-Zumino model: One  loop corrections
Authors: A. F. Ferrari and H. O. Girotti and M. Gomes
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the issue of Lorentz symmetry breaking in quantum field theories formulated in a non-commutative space-time. We show that, unlike in some recente analysis of quantum gravity effects, supersymmetry does not protect the theory from the large Lorentz violating effects arising from the loop corrections. We take advantage of the non-commutative Wess-Zumino model to illustrate this point.
