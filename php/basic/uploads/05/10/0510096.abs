Title: On the dynamical symmetric algebra of ageing: Lie structure,  representations and Appell systems
Authors: Malte Henkel and Rene Schott and Stoimen Stoimenov and Jeremie Unterberger
Abstract: The study of ageing phenomena leads to the investigation of a maximal parabolic subalgebra of conf_3 which we call alt. We investigate its Lie structure, prove some results concerning its representations and characterize the related Appell systems.
