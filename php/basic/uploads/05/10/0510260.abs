Title: On Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein-Hilbert action in two  dimensions
Authors: N. Kiriushcheva and S. V. Kuzmin
Abstract: It is shown that the well-known triviality of the Einstein field equations in two dimensions is not a sufficient condition for the Einstein-Hilbert action to be a total divergence, if the general covariance is to be preserved, that is, a coordinate system is not fixed. Consequently, a Hamiltonian formulation is possible without any modification of the two dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action. We find the resulting constraints and the corresponding gauge transfromations of the metric tensor.
