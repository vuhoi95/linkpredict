Title: Double protection of the Higgs potential
Authors: Zurab Berezhiani and Piotr H. Chankowski and Adam Falkowski and Stefan Pokorski
Abstract: A mechanism of double protection of the Higgs potential, by supersymmetry and by a global symmetry, is investigated in a class of supersymmetric models with the SU(3)xSU(3)xU(1) gauge symmetry. In such models the electroweak symmetry can be broken with no fine-tuning at all.
