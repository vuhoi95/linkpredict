Title: Non-crystallographic reduction of generalized Calogero-Moser models
Authors: Andreas Fring and Christian Korff
Abstract: We apply a recently introduced reduction procedure based on the embedding of non-crystallographic Coxeter groups into crystallographic ones to Calogero-Moser systems. For rational potentials the familiar generalized Calogero Hamiltonian is recovered. For the Hamiltonians of trigonometric, hyperbolic and elliptic type, we obtain novel integrable dynamical systems with a second potential term which is rescaled by the golden ratio. We explicitly show for the simplest of these non-crystallographic models how the corresponding classical equations of motion can be derived from a Lie algebraic Lax pair based on the larger, crystallographic Coxeter group.
