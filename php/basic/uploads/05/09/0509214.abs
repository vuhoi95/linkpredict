Title: Smooth geometries with four charges in four dimensions
Authors: Ashish Saxena and Geoff Potvin and Stefano Giusto and Amanda W. Peet
Abstract: A class of axially symmetric, rotating four-dimensional geometries carrying D1, D5, KK monopole and momentum charges is constructed. The geometries are found to be free of horizons and singulaties, and are candidates to be the gravity duals of microstates of the (0,4) CFT. These geometries are constructed by performing singularity analysis on a suitably chosen class of solutions of six-dimensional minimal supergravity written over a Gibbons-Hawking base metric. The properties of the solutions raise some interesting questions regarding the CFT.
