Title: Three Dimensional N=2 Supersymmetry on the Lattice
Authors: Joshua W. Elliott and Guy D. Moore
Abstract: We show how 3-dimensional, N=2 supersymmetric theories, including super QCD with matter fields, can be put on the lattice with existing techniques, in a way which will recover supersymmetry in the small lattice spacing limit. Residual supersymmetry breaking effects are suppressed in the small lattice spacing limit by at least one power of the lattice spacing a.
