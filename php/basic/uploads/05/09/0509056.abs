Title: Solitons and soliton-antisoliton pairs of a Goldstone model in 3+1  dimensions
Authors: Vanush Paturyan and Eugen Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We study finite energy static solutions to a global symmetry breaking model in 3+1 dimensions described by an isovector scalar field. The basic features of two different types of configurations are discussed, one of them corresponding to axially symmetric multisolitons with topological charge $n$, and the other one to unstable soliton-antisoliton pairs with zero topological charge.
