Title: Gauge theories and non-commutative geometry
Authors: E. G. Floratos and J. Iliopoulos
Abstract: It is shown that a $d$-dimensional classical SU(N) Yang-Mills theory can be formulated in a $d+2$-dimensional space, with the extra two dimensions forming a surface with non-commutative geometry. In this paper we present an explicit proof for the case of the torus and the sphere.
