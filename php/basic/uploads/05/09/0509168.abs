Title: D4-D0 Branes on the Quintic
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Monica Guica and Lisa Huang and Aaron Simons and Andrew Strominger and Xi Yin
Abstract: It is proposed that the quantum mechanics of N D4-branes and M D0-branes on the quintic is described by the dimensional reduction of a certain U(N)xU(M) quiver gauge theory, whose superpotential encodes the defining quintic polynomial. It is shown that the moduli space on the Higgs branch exactly reproduces the moduli space of degree N hypersurfaces in the quintic endowed with the appropriate line bundle, and that the cohomology growth reproduces the D4-D0 black hole entropy.
