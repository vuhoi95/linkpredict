Title: Varying Alpha Monopoles
Authors: J. Menezes and P. P. Avelino and C. Santos
Abstract: We study static magnetic monopoles in the context of varying alpha theories and show that there is a group of models for which the t'Hooft-Polyakov solution is still valid. Nevertheless, in general static magnetic monopole solutions in varying alpha theories depart from the classical t'Hooft-Polyakov solution with the electromagnetic energy concentrated inside the core seeding spatial variations of the fine structure constant. We show that Equivalence Principle constraints impose tight limits on the allowed variations of alpha induced by magnetic monopoles which confirms the difficulty to generate significant large-scale spatial variation of the fine structure constant found in previous works. This is true even in the most favorable case where magnetic monopoles are the source for these variations.
