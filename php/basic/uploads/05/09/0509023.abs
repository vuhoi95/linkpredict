Title: Brane Intersections in the Presence of a Worldvolume Electric Field
Authors: Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Jamila Douari
Abstract: The study of brane intersections has provided important insights into a possible non-commutative structure of spacetime geometry. In this paper we focus on the D1$\bot$D3 system. We compare the D1 and D3 descriptions of the interesection and search for non-static solutions of the D3$\bot$D1 funnel equations in the presence of a worldvolume electric field. We find that the D1 and D3 descriptions do not agree. We find time dependent solutions that are a natural generalization of those found without the electric field.
