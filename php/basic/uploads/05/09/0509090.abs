Title: Classical Gravitation as free Membrane Dynamics
Authors: Miguel D. Bustamante and Fabrice Debbasch and Marc-Etienne Brachet
Abstract: The formulation of General Relativity in which the 4-dimensional space-time is embedded in a flat host space of higher dimension is reconsidered. New classes of embeddings (modeled after Nash's classical free embeddings) are introduced. They present the important advantage of being deformable and therefore physically realistic. Explicit examples of embeddings whose deformations DO describe gravitational waves around their respective backgrounds are given for several space-times, including the Schwarzschild black hole. New variational principles which give back Einstein's General Relativity are proposed. In this framework, the 4-D space-time is a membrane moving in a flat host space.
