Title: Spontaneous Isotropy Breaking: A Mechanism for CMB Multipole Alignments
Authors: Christopher Gordon and Wayne Hu and Dragan Huterer and Tom Crawford
Abstract: We introduce a class of models in which statistical isotropy is broken spontaneously in the CMB by a non-linear response to long-wavelength fluctuations in a mediating field. These fluctuations appear as a gradient locally and pick out a single preferred direction. The non-linear response imprints this direction in a range of multipole moments. We consider two manifestations of isotropy breaking: additive contributions and multiplicative modulation of the intrinsic anisotropy. Since WMAP exhibits an alignment of power deficits, an additive contribution is less likely to produce the observed alignments than the usual isotropic fluctuations, a fact which we illustrate with an explicit cosmological model of long-wavelength quintessence fluctuations. This problem applies to other models involving foregrounds or background anisotropy that seek to restore power to the CMB. Additive models that account directly for the observed power exacerbate the low power of the intrinsic fluctuations. Multiplicative models can overcome these difficulties. We construct a proof of principle model that significantly improves the likelihood and generates stronger alignments than WMAP in 30-45% of realizations.
