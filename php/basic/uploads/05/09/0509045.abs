Title: A Bethe Ansatz Study of Free Energy and Excitation Spectrum for Even  Spin Fateev Zamolodchikov Model
Authors: Subhankar Ray and J. Shamanna
Abstract: A Bethe Ansatz study of a self dual Z_N spin model is undertaken for even spin system. One has to solve a coupled system of Bethe Ansatz Equations (BAE) involving zeroes of two families of transfer matrices. A numerical study on finite size lattices is done for identification of elementary excitations over the Ferromagnetic and Antiferromagnetic ground states. The free energies for both Ferromagnetic and Antiferromagnetic ground states and dispersion relation for elementary excitations are found.
