Title: String Theory in Beta Deformed Spacetimes
Authors: Marcus Spradlin and Tadashi Takayanagi and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: Fluxbrane-like backgrounds obtained from flat space by a sequence of T-dualities and shifts of polar coordinates (beta deformations) provide an interesting class of exactly solvable string theories. We compute the one-loop partition function for various such deformed spaces and study their spectrum of D-branes. For rational values of the B-field these models are equivalent to Z_N \times Z_N orbifolds with discrete torsion. We also obtain an interesting new class of time-dependent backgrounds which resemble localized closed string tachyon condensation.
