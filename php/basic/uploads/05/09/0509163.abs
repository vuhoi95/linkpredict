Title: Do we Observe Quantum Gravity Effects at Galactic Scales?
Authors: M. Reuter and H. Weyer
Abstract: The nonperturbative renormalization group flow of Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is reviewed. It is argued that there could be strong renormalization effects at large distances, in particular a scale dependent Newton constant, which mimic the presence of dark matter at galactic and cosmological scales.
