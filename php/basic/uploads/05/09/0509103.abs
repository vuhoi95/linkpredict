Title: Secondary Fields in D>2 Conformal Theories
Authors: V. N. Zaikin and M. Ya. Palchik
Abstract: We consider the secondary fields in $D$-dimensional space, $D\ge3$, generated by the non-abelian current and energy-momentum tensor. These fields appear in the operator product expansions $j^{a}_\mu(x)\phi(0)$ and $T_{\mu\nu}(x)\phi(0)$. The secondary fields underlie the construction proposed herein (see [1,2] for more details) and aimed at the derivation of exact solutions of conformal models in $D\ge3$. In the case of D=2 this construction leads to the known [5] exactly solvable models based on the infinite-dimensional conformal symmetry. It is shown that for $D\ge3$ the existence of the secondary fields is governed by the existence of anomalous operator contributions (the scalar fields $R_j$ and $R_T$ of dimensions $d_j = d_T = D-2$) into the operator product expansions $j^{a}_\mu j^{b}_\nu$ and $T_{\mu\nu} T_{\rho\sigma}$. The coupling constant between the field $R_j$ and the fundamental field is found. The fields $R_j$ and $R_T$ are shown to beget two infinite sets of secondary tensor fields of canonical dimensions $D-2+s$, where $s$ is the tensor rank. The current and the energy-momentum tensor belong to those families, their Green functions being expressed through the Green functions of the fields $R_j$ and $R_T$ correspondingly. We demonstrate that the Ward identities give rise to the closed set of equations for the Green functions of the fields $R_j$ and $R_T$.
