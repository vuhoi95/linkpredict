Abstract: In the first part of this paper we study two $Z_2$ symmetries of the LLM metric, both of which exchange black and white regions. One of them which can be interpreted as the particle-hole symmetry is the symmetry of the whole supergravity solution while the second one is just the symmetry of the metric and changes the sign of the fivefrom flux. In the second part of the paper we use closed string probes and their semi-classical analysis to compare the two 1/2 BPS deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$, the smooth LLM geometry which contains localized giant gravitons and the superstar case which is a solution with naked singularity corresponding to smeared giants. We discuss the realization of the $Z_2$ symmetry in the semi-classical closed string probes point of view.
