Title: A Matrix Model for the Null-Brane
Authors: Daniel Robbins and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: The null-brane background is a simple smooth 1/2 BPS solution of string theory. By tuning a parameter, this background develops a big crunch/big bang type singularity. We construct the DLCQ description of this space-time in terms of a Yang-Mills theory on a time-dependent space-time. Our dual Matrix description provides a non-perturbative framework in which the fate of both (null) time, and the string S-matrix can be studied.
