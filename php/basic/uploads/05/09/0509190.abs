Title: SO(10)-GUT Coherent Baryogenesis
Authors: Bjorn Garbrecht and Tomislav Prokopec and Michael G. Schmidt
Abstract: A model for GUT baryogenesis, coherent baryogenesis within the framework of supersymmetric SO(10), is considered. In particular, we discuss the Barr-Raby model, where at the end of hybrid infl ation charge asymmetries can be created through the time-dependent higgsino-gaugino mixing mass matrix. These asymmetries are processed to Standard Model matter through decays via nonrenormalizable (B-L)-violating operators. We find that a baryon asymmetry in accordance with observation can be generated. An appendix is devoted to provide useful formulas and concrete examples for calculations within SO(10).
