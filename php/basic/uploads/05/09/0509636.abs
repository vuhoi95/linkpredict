Title: Fermat Principle for spinning light
Authors: C. Duval and Z. Horvathy and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: Mimicking the description of spinning particles in General Relativity, the Fermat Principle is extended to spinning photons. Linearization of the resulting Papapetrou-Souriau type equations yields the semiclassical model used recently to derive the ``Optical Hall Effect'' (alias the ``Optical Magnus Effect'') for polarized light.
