Title: On Quantum Corrections to Spinning Strings and Bethe Equations
Authors: N. Beisert and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: Recently, it was demonstrated that one-loop energy shifts of spinning superstrings on AdS5xS5 agree with certain Bethe equations for quantum strings at small effective coupling. However, the string result required artificial regularization by zeta-function. Here we show that this matching is indeed correct up to fourth order in effective coupling; beyond, we find new contributions at odd powers. We show that these are reproduced by quantum corrections within the Bethe ansatz. They might also identify the "three-loop discrepancy" between string and gauge theory as an order-of-limits effect.
