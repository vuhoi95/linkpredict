Abstract: Supersymmetric U(Nc) gauge theory with Nf massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation admits various BPS solitons like domain walls and their webs. In the first part we show as a review of the previous paper hep-th/0412024 that domain walls are realized as kinky fractional D3-branes interpolating between separated D7-branes. In the second part we discuss brane configurations for domain wall webs. This is a contribution to the conference based on the talk given by MN.
