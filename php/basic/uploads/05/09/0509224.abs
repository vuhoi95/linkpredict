Title: Finiteness of volume of moduli spaces
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Zhiqin Lu
Abstract: We give a ``physics proof'' of a conjecture made by the first author at Strings 2005, that the moduli spaces of certain conformal field theories are finite volume in the Zamolodchikov metric, using an RG flow argument.
