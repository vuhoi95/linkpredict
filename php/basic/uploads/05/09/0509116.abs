Title: Why pair production cures covariance in the light-front?
Authors: J. H. O. Sales and A. T. Suzuki
Abstract: We show that the light-front vaccum is not trivial, and the Fock space for positive energy quanta solutions is not complete. As an example of this non triviality we have calculated the electromagnetic current for scalar bosons in the background field method were the covariance is restored through considering the complete Fock space of solutions. We also show thus that the method of "dislocating the integration pole" is nothing more than a particular case of this, so that such an "ad hoc" prescription can be dispensed altogether if we deal with the whole Fock space. In this work we construct the electromagnetic current operator for a system composed of two free bosons. The technique employed to deduce these operators is through the definition of global propagators in the light front when a background electromagnetic field acts on one of the particles.
