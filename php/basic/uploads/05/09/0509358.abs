Title: All-Multiplicity One-Loop Corrections to MHV Amplitudes in QCD
Authors: Darren Forde and David A. Kosower
Abstract: We compute the complete one-loop corrections to the simplest class of QCD gluon amplitudes, those with two color-adjacent opposite-helicity external particles. We present results for an arbitrary number of external legs. The computation uses the recently-developed on-shell recursion relations for the rational parts, along with older unitarity-based results for the cut-containing terms.
