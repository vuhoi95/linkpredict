Title: Post-inflationary behavior of adiabatic perturbations and  tensor-to-scalar ratio
Authors: Andrei Linde and Viatcheslav Mukhanov and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We explain why it is so difficult and perhaps even impossible to increase the cosmological tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio during the post-inflationary evolution of the universe. Nevertheless, contrary to some recent claims, tensor perturbations can be relatively large in the simplest inflationary models which do not violate any rules of modern quantum field theory.
