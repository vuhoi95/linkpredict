Title: Duality in Left-Right Symmetric Seesaw Mechanism
Authors: E. Kh. Akhmedov and M. Frigerio
Abstract: We consider type I+II seesaw mechanism, where the exchanges of both right-handed neutrinos and isotriplet Higgs bosons contribute to the neutrino mass. Working in the left-right symmetric framework and assuming the mass matrix of light neutrinos $m_\nu$ and the Dirac-type Yukawa couplings to be known, we find the triplet Yukawa coupling matrix $f$, which carries the information about the masses and mixing of the right-handed neutrinos. We show that in this case there exists a duality: for any solution $f$, there is a dual solution $\hat{f}=m_\nu/v_L-f$, where $v_L$ is the VEV of the triplet Higgs. Thus, unlike in pure type I (II) seesaw, there is no unique allowed structure for the matrix $f$. For $n$ lepton generations the number of solutions is $2^n$. We develop an exact analytic method of solving the seesaw non-linear matrix equation for $f$.
