Title: Quasilocal Formalism and Black Ring Thermodynamics
Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Eugen Radu
Abstract: The thermodynamical properties of a dipole black ring are derived using the quasilocal formalism. We find that the dipole charge appears in the first law in the same manner as a global charge. Using the Gibbs-Duhem relation, we also provide a non-trivial check of the entropy/area relationship for the dipole ring. A preliminary study of the thermodynamic stability indicates that the neutral ring is unstable to angular fluctuations.
