Title: Asymptotic Properties of Path Integral Ideals
Authors: Aleksandar Bogojevic and Antun Balaz and Aleksandar Belic
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a new quantity, the path integral ideal, governing the flow of generic discrete theories to the continuum limit and greatly increasing their convergence. The said flow is classified according to the degree of divergence of the potential at spatial infinity. Studying the asymptotic behavior of path integral ideals we isolate the dominant terms in the effective potential that determine the behavior of a generic theory for large discrete time steps.
