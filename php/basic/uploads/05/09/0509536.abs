Title: Galilean invariance and homogeneous anisotropic randomly stirred flows
Authors: Arjun Berera and David Hochberg
Abstract: The Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities for incompressible flow implied by Galilean invariance are derived for the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation (NSE), in which both the mean and fluctuating velocity components are explicitly present. The consequences of Galilean invariance for the vertex renormalization are drawn from this identity.
