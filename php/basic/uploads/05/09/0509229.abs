Abstract: We extend our models for conformal sequestering of dynamical supersymmetry breaking with decoupling vector-like matter in several different ways. These extensions enable us to simplify concrete model building, in particular, rendering large gauge group and ad hoc global symmetry for sequestering unnecessary. Conformal sequestering appears highly natural in such circumstances.
