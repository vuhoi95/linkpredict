Title: From confining fields back to power corrections
Authors: V. I. Zakharov and MPI-Munich
Abstract: We overview the issue of the power corrections to the parton model, mostly within the context of QCD sum rules. There are a few sources of the power corrections responsible for various qualitative effects. The basic idea that the power corrections are related to confining fields seems to be realized in case of $1/Q^2$ corrections which are dual to high orders of perturbation theory. The evidence comes from lattice studies of the confinement which allowed to identify the confining field configurations as monopoles and vortices. We comment also on the role of the condensate of dimension two, $<(A_{\mu}^a)^2>_{min}$.
