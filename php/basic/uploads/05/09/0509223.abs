Title: Multi-Parton Amplitudes in Gauge Theories
Authors: Michelangelo L. Mangano and Stephen J. Parke
Abstract: In this report we review recent developments in perturbation theory methods for gauge theories. We present techniques and results that are useful in the calculation of cross sections for processes with many final state partons which have applications in the study of multi-jet phenomena in high-energy Colliders.
