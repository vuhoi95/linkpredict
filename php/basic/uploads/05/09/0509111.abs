Title: The Fate of Massive Closed Strings
Authors: Bin Chen and Miao Li and Jian-huang She
Abstract: We calculate the semi-inclusive decay rate of an average string state with toroidal compactification in the the superstring theory. We also apply this calculation to a brane-inflation model in a warped geometry and find that the decay rate is greatly suppressed if the final strings are both massive and enhanced for massless radiation.
