Title: Quasinormal modes for nonextreme Dp-branes and thermalizations of  super-Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Kengo Maeda and Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: The nonextreme Dp-brane solutions in type II supergravity(in the near-horizon limit) are expected to be dual to (p+1)-dimensional noncompact supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories at finite temperature. We study the translationally invariant perturbations along the branes in those backgrounds and calculate quasinormal frequencies numerically. These frequencies should determine the thermalization time scales in the dual Yang-Mills theories.
