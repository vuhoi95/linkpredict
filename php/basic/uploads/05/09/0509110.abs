Title: Does the cosmological constant imply the existence of a minimum mass?
Authors: C. G. Boehmer and T. Harko
Abstract: We show that in the framework of the classical general relativity the presence of a positive cosmological constant implies the existence of a minimal mass and of a minimal density in nature. These results rigorously follow from the generalized Buchdahl inequality in the presence of a cosmological constant.
