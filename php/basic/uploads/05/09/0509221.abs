Title: The Conformal Limit of the 0A Matrix Model and String Theory on AdS(2)
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Assaf Patir
Abstract: We analyze the conformal limit of the matrix model describing flux backgrounds of two dimensional type 0A string theory. This limit is believed to be dual to an AdS(2) background of type 0A string theory. We show that the spectrum of this limit is identical to that of a free fermion on AdS(2), suggesting that there are no closed string excitations in this background.
