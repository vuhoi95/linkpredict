Title: Matrix model eigenvalue integrals and twist fields in the su(2)-WZW  model
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Albrecht O. Klemm and Ingo Runkel
Abstract: We propose a formula for the eigenvalue integral of the hermitian one matrix model with infinite well potential in terms of dressed twist fields of the su(2) level one WZW model. The expression holds for arbitrary matrix size n, and provides a suggestive interpretation for the monodromy properties of the matrix model correlators at finite n, as well as in the 1/n-expansion.
