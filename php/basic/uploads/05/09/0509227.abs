Title: Generalized commutation relations and Non linear momenta theories, a  close relationship
Authors: Hector Calisto and Carlos Leiva
Abstract: A revision of generalized commutation relations is performed, besides a description of Non linear momenta realization included in some DSR theories. It is shown that these propositions are closely related, specially we focus on Magueijo Smolin momenta and Kempf et al. and L.N. Chang generalized commutators. Due to this, a new algebra arises with its own features that is also analyzed.
