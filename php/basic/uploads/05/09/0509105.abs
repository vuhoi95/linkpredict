Title: String cosmology from a novel renormalization perspective
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We study small perturbations around the exactly marginal time-dependent string configuration of [1], and demonstrate the lack of the appropriate linearization. This implies that this configuration is an isolated fixed point of the $\alpha^{'}$ flow in the pertinent space of theories.
