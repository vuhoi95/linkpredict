Title: Neutral Larkin--Ovchinnikov--Fulde--Ferrell state and chromomagnetic  instability in two-flavor dense QCD
Authors: E. V. Gorbar and Michio Hashimoto and V. A. Miransky
Abstract: In two-flavor dense quark matter, we describe the dynamics in the single plane wave Larkin--Ovchinnikov--Fulde--Ferrell (LOFF) state satisfying the color and electric neutrality conditions. We find that because the neutral LOFF state itself suffers from a chromomagnetic instability in the whole region where it coexists with the (gapped/gapless) two-flavor superconducting (2SC/g2SC) phases, it cannot cure this instability in those phases. This is unlike the recently revealed gluonic phase which seems to be able to resolve this problem.
