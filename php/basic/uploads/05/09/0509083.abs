Title: Post-Newtonian parameters and constraints on Einstein-aether theory
Authors: Brendan Z. Foster and Ted Jacobson
Abstract: We analyze the observational and theoretical constraints on ``Einstein-aether theory", a generally covariant theory of gravity coupled to a dynamical, unit, timelike vector field that breaks local Lorentz symmetry. The results of a computation of the remaining post-Newtonian parameters are reported. These are combined with other results to determine the joint post-Newtonian, vacuum-Cerenkov, nucleosynthesis, stability, and positive-energy constraints. All of these constraints are satisfied by parameters in a large two-dimensional region in the four-dimensional parameter space defining the theory.
