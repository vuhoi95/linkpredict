Title: Microscopic Theory of Skyrmions in Quantum Hall Ferromagnets
Authors: G. Tsitsishvili and Z. F. Ezawa
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of skyrmions in the monolayer quantum Hall ferromagnet. It is a peculiar feature of the system that the number density and the spin density are entangled intrinsically as dictated by the W$%_{\infty}$ algebra. The skyrmion and antiskyrmion states are constructed as W$_{\infty }$-rotated states of the hole-excited and electron-excited states, respectively. They are spin textures accompanied with density modulation that decreases the Coulomb energy. We calculate their excitation energy as a function of the Zeeman gap and compared the result with experimental data.
