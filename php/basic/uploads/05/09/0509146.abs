Title: The Scaling of QED in a Non-Commutative Space-Time
Authors: J. Volkholz and W. Bietenholz and J. Nishimura and Y. Susaki
Abstract: We present results of numerical simulations for pure U(1) gauge theory in a non-commutative space. The theory is mapped onto a dimensionally reduced matrix model, which renders its numerical treatment feasible. New data on large lattices reveal the scaling of Wilson loops and their correlation functions in the simultaneous limit to the continuum and to infinite volume, at fixed non-commutativity. In this on-going project we are particularly interested in the IR behaviour, the ``photo-ball'' spectrum and in the photon dispersion relation.
