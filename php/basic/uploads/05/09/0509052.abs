Title: Scherk-Schwarz reduction of M-theory on G2-manifolds with fluxes
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Nikolaos Prezas
Abstract: We analyse the 4-dimensional effective supergravity theories obtained from the Scherk--Schwarz reduction of M-theory on twisted 7-tori in the presence of 4-form fluxes. We implement the appropriate orbifold projection that preserves a G2-structure on the internal 7-manifold and truncates the effective field theory to an N=1, D=4 supergravity. We provide a detailed account of the effective supergravity with explicit expressions for the Kaehler potential and the superpotential in terms of the fluxes and of the geometrical data of the internal manifold. Subsequently, we explore the landscape of vacua of M-theory compactifications on twisted tori, where we emphasize the role of geometric fluxes and discuss the validity of the bottom-up approach. Finally, by reducing along isometries of the internal 7-manifold, we obtain superpotentials for the corresponding type IIA backgrounds.
