Title: Geometrical Spinoptics and the Optical Hall Effect
Authors: Christian Duval and Zalan Horvath and Peter Horvathy
Abstract: Geometrical optics is extended so as to provide a model for spinning light rays via the coadjoint orbits of the Euclidean group characterized by color and spin. This leads to a theory of ``geometrical spinoptics'' in refractive media. Symplectic scattering yields generalized Snell-Descartes laws that include the recently discovered optical Hall effect.
