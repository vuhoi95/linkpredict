Abstract: A version of the cosmological perturbation theory in general relativity (GR) is developed, where the cosmological scale factor is identified with spatial averaging of the metric determinant logarithm and the cosmic evolution acquires the pattern of a superfluid motion: the absence of "friction-type" interaction, the London-type wave function, and the Bogoliubov condensation of quantum universes. This identification keeps the number of variables of GR and leads to a new type of potential perturbations. A set of arguments is given in favor of that this "superfluid" version of GR is in agreement with the observational data.
