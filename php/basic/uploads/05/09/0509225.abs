Title: Dark energy and decompactification in string gas cosmology
Authors: Francesc Ferrer and Syksy Rasanen
Abstract: We study the stability of extra dimensions in string gas cosmology at late times. Vacuum energy and, interestingly, baryons lead to decompactification after they become dynamically important. The string gas can stabilise the effect of baryons, but not that of vacuum energy. However, we find that the interplay of baryons and strings can lead to acceleration in the visible dimensions, without the need for vacuum energy.
