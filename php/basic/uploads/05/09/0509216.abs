Title: On the Quantum Mechanics for One Photon
Authors: Yapeng Hu and Weigang Qiu and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: This paper revisits the quantum mechanics for one photon from the modern viewpoint and by the geometrical method. Especially, besides the ordinary (rectangular) momentum representation, we provide an explicit derivation for the other two important representations, called the cylindrically symmetrical representation and the spherically symmetrical representation, respectively. These other two representations are relevant to some current photon experiments in quantum optics. In addition, the latter is useful for us to extract the information on the quantized black holes. The framework and approach presented here are also applicable to other particles with arbitrary mass and spin, such as the particle with spin 1/2.
