Title: Lower-dimensional pure-spinor superstrings
Authors: P. A. Grassi and N. Wyllard
Abstract: We study to what extent it is possible to generalise Berkovits' pure-spinor construction in d=10 to lower dimensions. Using a suitable definition of a ``pure'' spinor in d=4,6, we propose models analogous to the d=10 pure-spinor superstring in these dimensions. Similar models in d=2,3 are also briefly discussed.
