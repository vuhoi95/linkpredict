Title: Hidden Modulus in the Extended Veneziano-Yankielowicz Theory
Authors: Roberto Auzzi and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: The issue of domain walls in the recently extended Veneziano-Yankielowicz theory is investigated and we show that they have an interesting substructure. We also demonstrate the presence of a noncompact modulus. The associated family of degenerate solutions is physically due to the presence of a valley of vacua in the enlarged space of fields. This is a feature of the extended Veneziano-Yankielowicz theory. Unfortunately the above properties do not match the ones expected for the domain walls of N=1 super Yang-Mills.
