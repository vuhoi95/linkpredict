Title: The quantum Neumann model: refined semiclassical results
Authors: Marc Bellon and Michel Talon
Abstract: We extend the semiclassical study of the Neumann model down to the deep quantum regime. A detailed study of connection formulae at the turning points allows to get good matching with the exact results for the whole range of parameters.
