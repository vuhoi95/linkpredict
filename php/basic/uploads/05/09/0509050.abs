Title: Gravitational Correction to Running of Gauge Couplings
Authors: Sean P. Robinson and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of graviton exchange to the running of gauge couplings at lowest non-trivial order in perturbation theory. Including this contribution in a theory that features coupling constant unification does not upset this unification, but rather shifts the unification scale. When extrapolated formally, the gravitational correction renders all gauge couplings asymptotically free.
