Title: Coherent States for 3d Deformed Special Relativity: semi-classical  points in a quantum flat spacetime
Authors: E. R. Livine and D. Oriti
Abstract: We analyse the quantum geometry of 3-dimensional deformed special relativity (DSR) and the notion of spacetime points in such a context, identified with coherent states that minimize the uncertainty relations among spacetime coordinates operators. We construct this system of coherent states in both the Riemannian and Lorentzian case, and study their properties and their geometric interpretation.
