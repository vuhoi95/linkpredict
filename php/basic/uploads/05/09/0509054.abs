Title: Gribov horizon under the (lattice) microscope
Authors: Jeff Greensite and Stefan Olejnik and Daniel Zwanziger
Abstract: The infinite color-Coulomb energy of color-charged states is related to enhanced density of near-zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator in Coulomb gauge. We confirm the enhancement in numerical simulations and show that it is tied to the presence of percolating center vortex configurations.
