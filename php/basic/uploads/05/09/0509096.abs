Title: Spinorial Field and Lyra Geometry
Authors: R. Casana and C. A. M. de Melo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: The Dirac field is studied in a Lyra space-time background by means of the classical Schwinger Variational Principle. We obtain the equations of motion, establish the conservation laws, and get a scale relation relating the energy-momentum and spin tensors. Such scale relation is an intrinsic property for matter fields in Lyra background.
