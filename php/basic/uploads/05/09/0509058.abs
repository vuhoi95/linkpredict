Title: Generalizations of Lunin-Maldacena transformation on the $AdS sub 5 x S  sup 5$ background
Authors: R. C. Rashkov and K. S. Viswanathan and Yi Yang
Abstract: In this paper we consider a simple generalization of the method of Lunin and Maldacena for generating new string backgrounds based on TsT-transformations. We study multi-shift $Ts... sT$ transformations applied to backgrounds with at least two U(1) isometries. We prove that the string currents in any two backgrounds related by Ts...sT-transformations are equal. Applying this procedure to the $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$, we find a new background and study some properties of the semiclassical strings.
