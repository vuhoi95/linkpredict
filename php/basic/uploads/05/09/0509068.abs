Title: Spontaneous Lorentz Violation and Nonpolynomial Interactions
Authors: B. Altschul and Alan Kostelecky
Abstract: Gauge-noninvariant vector field theories with superficially nonrenormalizable nonpolynomial interactions are studied. We show that nontrivial relevant and stable theories have spontaneous Lorentz violation, and we present a large class of asymptotically free theories. The Nambu-Goldstone modes of these theories can be identified with the photon, with potential experimental implications.
