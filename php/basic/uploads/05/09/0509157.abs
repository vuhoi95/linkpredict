Title: Twenty-five Questions for String Theorists
Authors: Pierre Binetruy and G. L. Kane and Joseph Lykken and Brent D. Nelson
Abstract: In an effort to promote communication between the formal and phenomenological branches of the high-energy theory community, we provide a description of some important issues in supersymmetric and string phenomenology. We describe each within the context of string constructions, illustrating them with specific examples where applicable. Each topic culminates in a set of questions that we believe are amenable to direct consideration by string theorists, and whose answers we think could help connect string theory and phenomenology.
