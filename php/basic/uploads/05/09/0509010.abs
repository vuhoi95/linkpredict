Authors: Arindam Chakraborty and Subhankar Ray and J. Shamanna
Abstract: The U(1) Calogero Sutherland Model with anti-periodic boundary condition is studied. The Hamiltonian is reduced to a convenient form by similarity transformation. The matrix representation of the Hamiltonian acting on a partially ordered state space is obtained in an upper triangular form. Consequently the diagonal elements become the energy eigenvalues. The eigenstates are constructed using Young diagram and represented in terms of Jack symmetric polynomials. The eigenstates so obtained are orthonormalized.
