Title: Ricci-flat supertwistor spaces
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We show that supertwistor spaces constructed as a Kahler quotient of a hyperkahler cone (HKC) with equal numbers of bosonic and fermionic coordinates are Ricci-flat, and hence, Calabi-Yau. We study deformations of the supertwistor space induced from deformations of the HKC. We also discuss general infinitesimal deformations that preserve Ricci-flatness.
