Title: Cavity-QED tests of representations of canonical commutation relations  employed in field quantization
Authors: Marek Czachor and Marcin Wilczewski
Abstract: Various aspects of dissipative and nondissipative decoherence of Rabi oscillations are discussed in the context of field quantization in alternative representations of CCR. Theory is confronted with experiment, and a possibility of more conclusive tests is analyzed.
