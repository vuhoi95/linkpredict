Abstract: The type of the vacuum is studied numerically in the maximally Abelian (MA) gauge and in the Landau (LA) gauge of SU(2) gluodynamics. The type of the vacuum is determined by a ratio between the dual coherence and the dual penetration lengths. The dual penetration length is determined from correlations between Wilson loops and electric fields in both gauges. The dual coherence length is found from correlations between Wilson loops and dimension-2 operators both in the MA and the LA gauges. This determination of the coherence length is supported by theoretical and numerical observation that the dimension-2 gluon operators in the studied gauges have a strong correlation with the monopole current determined in the MA gauge. We find numerically that the dual penetration lengths and the dual coherence lengths in the LA and the MA gauges are almost the same. Therefore we conclude, that in both gauges the type of the vacuum in the confinement phase is near to the border between the type 1 and the type 2 dual superconductors.
