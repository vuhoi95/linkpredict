Title: Higher Spin Particles with Bosonic Counterpart of Supersymmetry
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We propose the relativistic point particle models invariant under the bosonic counterpart of SUSY. The particles move along the world lines in four dimensional Minkowski space extended by $N$ commuting Weyl spinors. The models provide after first quantization the non--Grassmann counterpart of chiral superfields, satisfying Klein--Gordon equation. Free higher spin fields obtained by expansions of such chiral superfields satisfy the N=2 Bargman--Wigner equations in massive case and Fierz--Pauli equations in massless case.
