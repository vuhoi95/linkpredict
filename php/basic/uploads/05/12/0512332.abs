Abstract: We study the evolution of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, induced by non-linear density perturbations in the context of the simplest class of quintessence models with a non-minimal coupling to the electromagnetic field, in which the two available free functions (potential and gauge kinetic function) are Taylor-expanded up to linear order. We show that the results obtained using the spherical infall model for an infinite wavelength inhomogeneity are inconsistent with the results of a local linearized gravity study and we argue in favour of the second approach. We also discuss recent claims that the value of $\alpha$ inside virialised regions could be significantly different from the background one on the basis of these findings.
