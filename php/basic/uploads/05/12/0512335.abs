Title: A One Loop Problem of the Matrix Big Bang Model
Authors: Miao Li and Wei Song
Abstract: We compute the one-loop effective action of two D0-branes in the matrix model for a cosmological background, and find vanishing static potential. However, there is a non-vanishing $v^2$ term not predicted in a supergravity calculation. This term is complex and signals an instability of the two D0-brane system, it may also indicate that the matrix model is incorrect.
