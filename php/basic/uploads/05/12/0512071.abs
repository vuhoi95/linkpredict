Title: Propagators for Noncommutative Field Theories
Authors: R. Gurau and V. Rivasseau and F. Vignes-Tourneret
Abstract: In this paper we provide exact expressions for propagators of noncommutative Bosonic or Fermionic field theories after adding terms of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar type in order to ensure Langmann-Szabo covariance. We emphasize the new Fermionic case and we give in particular all necessary bounds for the multiscale analysis and renormalization of the noncommutative Gross-Neveu model.
