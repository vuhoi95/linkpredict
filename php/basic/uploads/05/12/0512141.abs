Title: Regulating Eternal Inflation
Authors: T. Banks and M. Johnson
Abstract: We present an interpretation of the physics of space-times undergoing eternal inflation by repeated nucleation of bubbles. In many cases the physics can be interpreted in terms of the quantum mechanics of a system with a finite number of states. If this interpretation is correct, the conventional picture of these space-times is misleading.
