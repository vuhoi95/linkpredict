Title: A Gravitational Effective Action on a Finite Triangulation
Authors: Albert Ko and Martin Rocek
Abstract: We construct a function of the edge-lengths of a triangulated surface whose variation under a rescaling of all the edges that meet at a vertex is the defect angle at that vertex. We interpret this function as a gravitational effective action on the triangulation, and the variation as a trace anomaly.
