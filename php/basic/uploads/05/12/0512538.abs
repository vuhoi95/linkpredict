Title: Induced Chern-Simons term of a paired electron state in the quantum Hall  system
Authors: T. Aoyama and N. Maeda
Abstract: The induced Chern-Simons term for a paired electron state is calculated in the quantum Hall system by using a field theory on the von Neumann lattice. The coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, which is the Hall conductance, has not only the usual term proportional to a filling factor due to P (parity) & T (time reversal) symmetry breaking but also correction terms due to P & T & U(1) symmetry breaking. The correction term essentially comes from the Nambu-Goldstone mode and depends on an infrared limit. It is shown that the correction term is related to a topological number of a gap function in the momentum space.
