Title: Relaxing to a three dimensional brane junction
Authors: D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and L. Losano
Abstract: We suggest a mechanism which leads to 3+1 space-time dimensions. The Universe assumed to have nine spatial dimensions is regarded as a special nonlinear oscillatory system -- a kind of Einstein solid. There are p-brane solutions which manifest as phase oscillations separating different phase states. The presence of interactions allows for bifurcations of higher dimensional spaces to lower dimensional ones in the form of brane junctions. We argue this is a natural way to select lower dimensions.
