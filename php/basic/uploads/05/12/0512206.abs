Title: Hypermultiplets and Topological Strings
Authors: Martin Rocek and Cumrun Vafa and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: The c-map relates classical hypermultiplet moduli spaces in compactifications of type II strings on a Calabi-Yau threefold to vector multiplet moduli spaces via a further compactification on a circle. We give an off-shell description of the c-map in N=2 superspace. The superspace Lagrangian for the hypermultiplets is a single function directly related to the prepotential of special geometry, and can therefore be computed using topological string theory. Similarly, a class of higher derivative terms for hypermultiplets can be computed from the higher genus topological string amplitudes. Our results provide a framework for studying quantum corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space, as well as for understanding the black hole wave-function as a function of the hypermultiplet moduli.
