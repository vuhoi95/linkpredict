Title: Liouville and Toda dyonic branes: regularity and BPS limit
Authors: Dmitri V. Gal'tsov and Dmitri G. Orlov
Abstract: We reconsider dyonic p-brane solutions derivable from Liouville and Toda integrable systems and investigate their geometric structure. It is shown that the non-BPS non-black dyonic branes are not regular on the horizon.
