Title: Thin-shell wormholes in Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Marc Thibeault and Claudio Simeone and Ernesto F. Eiroa
Abstract: We study five dimensional thin-shell wormholes in Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Gauss-Bonnet term. The linearized stability under radial perturbations and the amount of exotic matter are analyzed as a function of the parameters of the model. We find that the inclusion of the quadratic correction substantially widens the range of possible stable configurations, and besides it allows for a reduction of the exotic matter required to construct the wormholes.
