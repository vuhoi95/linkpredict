Title: Higher Curvature Quantum Gravity and Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: Durmus A. Demir and S. Hanif Tanyildizi
Abstract: We discuss effective interactions among brane matter induced by modifications of higher dimensional Einstein gravity via the replacement of Einstein-Hilbert term with a generic function f(R) of the curvature scalar R. After deriving the graviton propagator, we analyze impact of virtual graviton exchanges on particle interactions, and conclude that f(R) gravity effects are best probed by high-energy processes involving massive gauge bosons, heavy fermions or the Higgs boson. We perform a comparative analysis of the predictions of f(R) gravity and of Arkani-Hamed-Dvali-Dimopoulos (ADD) scenario, and find that the former competes with the latter when f''(0) is positive and comparable to the fundamental scale of gravity in higher dimensions. In addition, we briefly discuss graviton emission from the brane as well as its decays into brane-localized matter, and find that they hardly compete with the ADD expectations. Possible existence of higher-curvature gravitational interactions in large extra spatial dimensions opens up various signatures to be confronted with existing and future collider experiments.
