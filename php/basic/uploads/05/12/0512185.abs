Title: Tachyon condensation and D-branes in generalized geometries
Authors: Pascal Grange and Ruben Minasian
Abstract: In generalized complex geometry, D-branes can be seen as maximally isotropic spaces and are thus in one-to-one correspondence with pure spinors. When considered on the sum of the tangent and cotangent bundles to the ambient space, all the branes are of the same dimension and the transverse scalars enter on par with the gauge fields; the split between the longitudinal and transverse directions is done in accordance with the type of the pure spinor corresponding to the given D-brane. We elaborate on the relation of this picture to the T-duality transformations and stability of D-branes. A discussion of tachyon condensation in the context of the generalized complex geometry is given, linking the description of D-branes as generalized complex submanifolds to their K-theoretic classification.
