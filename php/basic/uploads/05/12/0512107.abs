Title: The Free Particle in Deformed Special Relativity
Authors: F. Girelli and T. Konopka and J. Kowalski-Glikman and E. R. Livine
Abstract: The phase space of a classical particle in DSR contains de Sitter space as the space of momenta. We start from the standard relativistic particle in five dimensions with an extra constraint and reduce it to four dimensional DSR by imposing appropriate gauge fixing. We analyze some physical properties of the resulting theories like the equations of motion, the form of Lorentz transformations and the issue of velocity. We also address the problem of the origin and interpretation of different bases in DSR.
