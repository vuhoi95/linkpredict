Title: Surface-Invariants in 2D Classical Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Rafael DÃ­az and E. Fuenmayor and Lorenzo Leal
Abstract: We study a method to obtain invariants under area-preserving diffeomorphisms associated to closed curves in the plane from classical Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions. Taking as starting point the Yang-Mills field coupled to non dynamical particles carrying chromo-electric charge, and by means of a perturbative scheme, we obtain the first two contributions to the on shell action, which are area-invariants. A geometrical interpretation of these invariants is given.
