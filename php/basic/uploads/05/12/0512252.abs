Title: Vacuum solutions of five dimensional Einstein equations generated by  inverse scattering method
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Yoshiyuki Morisawa and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We study stationary and axially symmetric two solitonic solutions of five dimensional vacuum Einstein equations by using the inverse scattering method developed by Belinski and Zakharov. In this generation of the solutions, we use five dimensional Minkowski spacetime as a seed. It is shown that if we restrict ourselves to the case of one angular momentum component, the generated solution coincides with a black ring solution with a rotating two sphere which was found by Mishima and Iguchi recently.
