Title: Gravitational Kaluza-Klein Modes in Warped Superstring Compactification
Authors: Tatsuya Noguchi and Masahiro Yamaguchi and Masakazu Yamashita
Abstract: The Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of graviton are studied in the IIB superstring compactification where the warped geometry is realized at the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) throat. Knowledge of the metric of the KS throat enables us to determine their wave functions with good accuracy, without any further specification of the rest of Calabi-Yau space, owing to the localization of the KK modes. Mass spectrum and couplings to the four dimensional fields are computed for some type of the KK modes, and compared to those of the well-known Randall-Sundrum model. We find that the properties of the KK modes of the two models are very different in both the masses and the couplings, and thus they are distinguishable from each other experimentally.
