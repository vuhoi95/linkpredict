Title: On the Topology of the Reduced Classical Configuration Space of Lattice  QCD
Authors: S. Charzy≈Ñski and G. Rudolph and M. Schmidt
Abstract: We study the topological structure of the quotient of $SU(3)\times SU(3)$ by diagonal conjugation. This is the simplest nontrivial example for the classical reduced configuration space of chromodynamics on a spatial lattice in the Hamiltonian approach. We construct a cell complex structure of the quotient in such a way that the closures of strata are subcomplexes and we compute the homology and cohomology groups of the strata and their closures.
