Title: Renormalization of the Vector Current in QED
Authors: John C. Collins and Aneesh V. Manohar and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: It is commonly asserted that the electromagnetic current is conserved and therefore is not renormalized. Within QED we show (a) that this statement is false, (b) how to obtain the renormalization of the current to all orders of perturbation theory, and (c) how to correctly define an electron number operator. The current mixes with the four-divergence of the electromagnetic field-strength tensor. The true electron number operator is the integral of the time component of the electron number density, but only when the current differs from the MSbar-renormalized current by a definite finite renormalization. This happens in such a way that Gauss's law holds: the charge operator is the surface integral of the electric field at infinity. The theorem extends naturally to any gauge theory.
