Title: Noncommutative Two Dimensional BF Model
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore and Michele Montobbio
Abstract: We consider the noncommutative extension of the BF theory in two spacetime dimensions. We show that the introduction of the noncommutative parameter \theta_{\mu\nu}, already at first order in the analytical sector, induces infinitely many terms in the quantum extension of the model. This clashes with the commonly accepted rules of QFT, and we believe that this problem is not peculiar to this particular model, but it might concern the noncommutative extension of any ordinary quantum field theory obtained via the Moyal prescription. A detailed study of noncommutative anomalies is also presented.
