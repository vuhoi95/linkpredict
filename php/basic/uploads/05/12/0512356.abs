Title: Localized U(1) Gauge Fields, Millicharged Particles, and Holography
Authors: Brian Batell and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: We consider U(1) gauge fields in a slice of AdS_5 with bulk and boundary mass parameters. The zero mode of a bulk U(1) gauge field can be localized either on the UV or IR brane. This leads to a simple model of millicharged particles in which fermions can have arbitrarily small electric charge. In the electroweak sector we also discuss phenomenological implications of a localized U(1)_Y gauge boson. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we present the 4D holographic interpretation of the 5D model. In particular the photon is shown to be a composite particle when localized near the IR brane, whereas it is elementary when localized near the UV brane. In the dual interpretation the ``millicharge'' results from an elementary fermion coupling to a composite photon via a vector current with large anomalous dimension.
