Title: Non-singlet Q-deformations of N=2 gauge theories
Authors: A. De Castro and E. Ivanov and O. Lechtenfeld and L. Quevedo
Abstract: We study a non-anticommutative chiral non-singlet deformation of the N=(1,1) abelian gauge multiplet in Euclidean harmonic superspace. We present a closed form of the gauge transformations and the unbroken N =(1,0) supersymmetry transformations preserving the Wess-Zumino gauge, as well as the bosonic sector of the N =(1,0) invariant action. This contribution is a summary of our main results in hep-th/0510013.
