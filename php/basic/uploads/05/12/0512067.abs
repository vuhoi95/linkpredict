Title: Brane world effective actions for D-branes with fluxes
Authors: Matteo Bertolini and Marco Billo and Alberto Lerda and Jose F. Morales and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We develop systematic string techniques to study brane world effective actions for models with magnetized (or equivalently intersecting) D-branes. In particular, we derive the dependence on all NS-NS moduli of the kinetic terms of the chiral matter in a generic non-supersymmetric brane configurations with non-commuting open string fluxes. Near a N=1 supersymmetric point the effective action is consistent with a Fayet-Iliopoulos supersymmetry breaking and the normalization of the scalar kinetic terms is nothing else than the Kahler metric. We also discuss, from a stringy perspective, D and F term breaking mechanisms, and how, in this generic set up, the Kahler metric enters in the physical Yukawa couplings.
