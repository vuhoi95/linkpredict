Abstract: We report on the recent progress in the investigation of the influence of hyperacoustic vibrations on the coherent electron-positron pair creation by high-energy photons in crystals. In dependence of the values for the parameters, the presence of the deformation field can either enhance or reduce the cross-section. This can be used to control the parameters of the positron sources for storage rings and colliders.
