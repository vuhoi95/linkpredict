Title: Comments on the four-dimensional effective theory for warped  compactification
Authors: Hideo Kodama and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We derive four-dimensional effective theories for warped compactification of the ten-dimensional IIB supergravity and the eleven-dimensional Horava-Witten model. We show that these effective theories allow a much wider class of solutions than the original higher-dimensional theories. In particular, the effective theories have cosmological solutions in which the size of the internal space decreases with the cosmic expansion in the Einstein frame. This type of compactifying solutions are not allowed in the original higher-dimensional theories. This result indicates that the effective four-dimensional theories should be used with caution, if one regards the higher-dimensional theories more fundamental.
