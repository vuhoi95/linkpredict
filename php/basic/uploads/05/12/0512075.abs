Title: On Non-Critical Superstring/Black Hole Transition
Authors: Andrei Parnachev and David A. Sahakyan
Abstract: An interesting case of string/black hole transition occurs in two-dimensional non-critical string theory dressed with a compact CFT. In these models the high energy densities of states of perturbative strings and black holes have the same leading behavior when the Hawking temperature of the black hole is equal to the Hagedorn temperature of perturbative strings. We compare the first subleading terms in the black hole and closed string entropies in this setting and argue that the entropy interpolates between these expressions as the energy is varied. We compute the subleading correction to the black hole entropy for a specific simple model.
