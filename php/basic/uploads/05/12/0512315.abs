Title: Generalized lagrangian of the Rarita--Schwinger field
Authors: A. E. Kaloshin and V. P. Lomov and A. M. Moiseeva
Abstract: We derive the most general lagrangian of the free massive Rarita--Schwinger field, which generalizes the previously known ones. The special role of the reparameterization transformation is discussed.
