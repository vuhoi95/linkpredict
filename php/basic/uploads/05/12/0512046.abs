Title: Twisted Space-Time Symmetry, Non-Commutativity and Particle Dynamics
Authors: J. Lukierski and M. Woronowicz
Abstract: We describe the twisted space-time symmetries which imply the quantum Poincar\'{e} covariance of noncommutative Minkowski spaces, with constant, Lie algebraic and quadratic commutators. Further we present the relativistic and nonrelativistic particle models invariant respectively under twisted relativistic and twisted Galilean symmetries.
