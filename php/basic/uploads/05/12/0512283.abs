Title: Unoriented WZW Models and Holonomy of Bundle Gerbes
Authors: Urs Schreiber and Christoph Schweigert and Konrad Waldorf
Abstract: The Wess-Zumino term in two-dimensional conformal field theory is best understood as a surface holonomy of a bundle gerbe. We define additional structure for a bundle gerbe that allows to extend the notion of surface holonomy to unoriented surfaces. This provides a candidate for the Wess-Zumino term for WZW models on unoriented surfaces. Our ansatz reproduces some results known from the algebraic approach to WZW models.
