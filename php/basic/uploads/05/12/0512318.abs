Title: p-Adic and Adelic Superanalysis
Authors: Branko Dragovich and Andrei Khrennikov
Abstract: After a brief review of p-adic numbers, adeles and their functions, we consider real, p-adic and adelic superalgebras, superspaces and superanalyses. A concrete illustration is given by means of the Grassmann algebra generated by two anticommuting elements.
