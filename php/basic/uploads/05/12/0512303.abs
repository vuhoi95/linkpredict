Title: UHECR Particle Spectra from Crypton Decays
Authors: John Ellis and V. E. Mayes and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We calculate the spectra of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in an explicit top-down model based on the decays of metastable neutral `crypton' states in a flipped SU(5) string model. For each of the eight specific 10th-order superpotential operators that might dominate crypton decays, we calculate the spectra of both protons and photons, using a code incorporating supersymmetric evolution of the injected spectra. For all the decay operators, the total UHECR spectra are compatible with the available data. Also, the fractions of photons are compatible with all the published upper limits, but may be detectable in future experiments.
