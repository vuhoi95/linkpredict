Title: Reflection factors and exact g-functions for purely elastic scattering  theories
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Anna Lishman and Chaiho Rim and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: We discuss reflection factors for purely elastic scattering theories and relate them to perturbations of specific conformal boundary conditions, using recent results on exact off-critical g-functions. For the non-unitary cases, we support our conjectures using a relationship with quantum group reductions of the sine-Gordon model. Our results imply the existence of a variety of new flows between conformal boundary conditions, some of them driven by boundary-changing operators.
