Title: Consequences of strong fluctuations on high-energy QCD evolution
Authors: C. Marquet and R. Peschanski and G. Soyez
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the QCD evolution towards high-energy, in the diffusive approximation, in the limit where the fluctuation contribution is large. Our solution for the equivalent stochastic Fisher equation predicts the amplitude as well as the whole set of correlators in the strong noise limit. The speed of the front and the diffusion coefficient are obtained. We analyse the consequences on high-energy evolution in QCD.
