Title: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from Sequestered X Bursts
Authors: Peter L. Biermann and Paul H. Frampton
Abstract: Assuming that there is no GZK (Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin) cut-off and that super-GZK cosmic rays correlate with AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) at cosmological distances, it is speculated that a relic superheavy particle (X) has its lifetime enhanced by sequestration in an extra dimension. This sequestration is assumed to be partially liberated by proximity of merging supermassive black holes in an AGN, temporarily but drastically reducing the lifetime, thus stimulating an X burst. Based on sequestration of the decay products of X, a speculative explanation of the observed $\gamma/N$ ratio is proposed.
