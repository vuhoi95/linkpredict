Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Moduli Stabilization in AdS
Authors: Andrey Katz and Michele Redi and Yael Shadmi and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: We study the one loop effective potential for the radion superfield in the supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum scenario with detuned brane tensions. At the classical level the distance between the branes is stabilized while the VEV of the fifth component of the graviphoton is a flat direction which breaks supersymmetry. At the quantum level a potential is generated. This leads to a toy model of a supersymmetric compactification with all the moduli stabilized perturbatively.
