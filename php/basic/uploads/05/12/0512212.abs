Abstract: We show the dynamical stability of a six-dimensional braneworld solution with warped flux compactification recently found by the authors. We consider linear perturbations around this background spacetime, assuming the axisymmetry in the extra dimensions. The perturbations are expanded by scalar-, vector- and tensor-type harmonics of the four-dimensional Minkoswki spacetime and we analyze each type separately. It is found that there is no unstable mode in each sector and that there are zero modes only in the tensor sector, corresponding to the four-dimensional gravitons. We also obtain the first few Kaluza-Klein modes in each sector.
