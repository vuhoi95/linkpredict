Title: Double sine-Gordon model revisited
Authors: G. Takacs and F. Wagner
Abstract: We reconsider the mass spectrum of double sine-Gordon theory where recent semiclassical results called into question the previously accepted picture. We use the Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA) to investigate the claims. We demonstrate that the numerics supports the original results, and strongly disagrees with those obtained from semiclassical soliton form factor techniques. Besides the numerical analysis, we also discuss the underlying theoretical arguments.
