Title: Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking in String Compactifications
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Bogdan Florea and Shamit Kachru and Peter Svrcek
Abstract: We provide string theory examples where a toy model of a SUSY GUT or the MSSM is embedded in a compactification along with a gauge sector which dynamically breaks supersymmetry. We argue that by changing microscopic details of the model (such as precise choices of flux), one can arrange for the dominant mediation mechanism transmitting SUSY breaking to the Standard Model to be either gravity mediation or gauge mediation. Systematic improvement of such examples may lead to top-down models incorporating a solution to the SUSY flavor problem.
