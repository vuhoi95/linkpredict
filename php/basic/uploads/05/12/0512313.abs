Title: Deformations of the antibracket
Authors: S. E. Konstein and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: We consider antiPoisson superalgebras realized on the smooth Grassmann-valued functions with compact supports in R^n and with the grading inverse to Grassmanian parity. The deformations of these superalgebras and their central extensions are found.
