Title: Fermionic construction of partition functions for two-matrix models and  perturbative Schur function expansions
Authors: J. Harnad and A. Yu. Orlov
Abstract: A new representation of the 2N fold integrals appearing in various two-matrix models that admit reductions to integrals over their eigenvalues is given in terms of vacuum state expectation values of operator products formed from two-component free fermions. This is used to derive the perturbation series for these integrals under deformations induced by exponential weight factors in the measure, expressed as double and quadruple Schur function expansions, generalizing results obtained earlier for certain two-matrix models. Links with the coupled two-component KP hierarchy and the two-component Toda lattice hierarchy are also derived.
