Title: Connection Between Color Confinement and the Gluon Mass
Authors: M. Chaichian and K. Nishijima
Abstract: It is argued that there are two phases in QCD distinguished by different choices of the gauge parameter. In one phase the color confinement is realized and gluons turn out to be massive, whereas in the other phase it ceases to be realized, but the gluons remain massless.
