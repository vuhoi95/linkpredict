Title: Holographic Renormalization of Probe D-Branes in AdS/CFT
Authors: Andreas Karch and Andy O'Bannon and Kostas Skenderis
Abstract: We perform holographic renormalization for probe branes in AdS_5 x S^5. We show that for four known probe D-branes wrapping an AdS_m x S^n, the counterterms needed to render the action finite are identical to those for the free, massive scalar in AdS_m plus counterterms for the renormalization of the volume of AdS_m. The four cases we consider are the probe D7, two different probe D5's and a probe D3. In the D7 case there are scheme-dependent finite counterterms that can be fixed by supersymmetry.
