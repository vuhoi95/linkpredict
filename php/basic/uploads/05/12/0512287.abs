Title: Moduli Stabilization in Toroidal Type IIB Orientifolds
Authors: Susanne Reffert and Emanuel Scheidegger
Abstract: We discuss the first step in the moduli stabilization program a la KKLT for a general class of resolved toroidal type IIB orientifolds. In particular, we discuss their geometry, the topology of the divisors relevant for the D3-brane instantons which can contribute to the superpotential, and some non--trivial aspects of the orientifold action.
