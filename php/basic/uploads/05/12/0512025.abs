Title: Lie symmetries of semi-linear Schr√∂dinger equations and applications
Authors: Stoimen Stoimenov and Malte Henkel
Abstract: Conditional Lie symmetries of semi-linear 1D Schr\"odinger and diffusion equations are studied if the mass (or the diffusion constant) is considered as an additional variable. In this way, dynamical symmetries of semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations become related to the parabolic and almost-parabolic subalgebras of a three-dimensional conformal Lie algebra conf_3. The corresponding representations of the parabolic and almost-parabolic subalgebras of conf_3 are classified and the complete list of conditionally invariant semi-linear Schr\"odinger equations is obtained. Applications to the phase-ordering kinetics of simple magnets and to simple particle-reaction models are briefly discussed.
