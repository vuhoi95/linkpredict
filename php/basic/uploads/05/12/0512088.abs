Title: Exact Asymptotic Behaviour of Fermion Correlation Functions in the  Massive Thirring Model
Authors: Leonardo Mondaini and E. C. Marino
Abstract: We obtain an exact asymptotic expression for the two-point fermion correlation functions in the massive Thirring model (MTM) and show that, for $\beta^2=8\pi$, they reproduce the exactly known corresponding functions of the massless theory, explicitly confirming the irrelevance of the mass term at this point. This result is obtained by using the Coulomb gas representation of the fermionic MTM correlators in the bipolar coordinate system.
