Title: A Deformation of Twistor Space and a Chiral Mass Term in N=4 Super  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Dah-Wei Chiou and Ori J. Ganor and Bom Soo Kim
Abstract: Super twistor space admits a certain (super) complex structure deformation that preserves the Poincare subgroup of the symmetry group PSL(4|4) and depends on 10 parameters. In a previous paper [hep-th/0502076], it was proposed that in twistor string theory this deformation corresponds to augmenting N=4 super Yang-Mills theory by a mass term for the left-chirality spinors. In this paper we analyze this proposal in more detail. We calculate 4-particle scattering amplitudes of fermions, gluons and scalars and show that they are supported on holomorphic curves in the deformed twistor space.
