Title: Anyons, group theory and planar physics
Authors: J. Negro and M. A. del Olmo and J. Tosiek
Abstract: Relativistic and nonrelativistic anyons are described in a unified formalism by means of the coadjoint orbits of the symmetry groups in the free case as well as when there is an interaction with a constant electromagnetic field. To deal with interactions we introduce the extended Poincar\'e and Galilei Maxwell groups.
