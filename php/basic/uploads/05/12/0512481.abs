Title: The Full Second-Order Radiation Transfer Function for Large-Scale CMB  Anisotropies
Authors: N. Bartolo and S. Matarrese and A. Riotto
Abstract: We calculate the full second-order radiation transfer function for Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies on large angular scales in a flat universe filled with matter and cosmological constant. It includes (i) the second-order generalization of the Sachs-Wolfe effect, and of (ii) both the early and late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, (iii) the contribution of the second-order tensor modes, and is valid for a generic set of initial conditions specifying the level of primordial non-Gaussianity.
