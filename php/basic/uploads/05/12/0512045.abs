Title: The initial conditions of the Universe and holography
Authors: P. Diaz and M. A. Per and A. Segui
Abstract: We address the initial conditions for an expanding cosmology using the holographic principle. For the case of a closed model, the old prescription of Fishler and Susskind, that uses the particle horizon to encode the bulk degrees of freedom, can be implemented for accelerated models with enough acceleration. As a bonus we have singularity free bouncing models. The bound is saturated for co-dimension one branes dominated universes.
