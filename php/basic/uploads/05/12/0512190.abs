Title: Supersymmetry and the LHC Inverse Problem

Abstract: Given experimental evidence at the LHC for physics beyond the standard model, how can we determine the nature of the underlying theory? We initiate an approach to studying the "inverse map" from the space of LHC signatures to the parameter space of theoretical models within the context of low-energy supersymmetry, using 1808 LHC observables including essentially all those suggested in the literature and a 15 dimensional parametrization of the supersymmetric standard model. We show that the inverse map of a point in signature space consists of a number of isolated islands in parameter space, indicating the existence of "degeneracies"--qualitatively different models with the same LHC signatures. The degeneracies have simple physical characterizations, largely reflecting discrete ambiguities in electroweak-ino spectrum, accompanied by small adjustments for the remaining soft parameters. The number of degeneracies falls in the range 1<d<100, depending on whether or not sleptons are copiously produced in cascade decays. This number is large enough to represent a clear challenge but small enough to encourage looking for new observables that can further break the degeneracies and determine at the LHC most of the SUSY physics we care about. Degeneracies occur because signatures are not independent, and our approach allows testing of any new signature for its independence. Our methods can also be applied to any other theory of physics beyond the standard model, allowing one to study how model footprints differ in signature space and to test ways of distinguishing qualitatively different possibilities for new physics at the LHC.
