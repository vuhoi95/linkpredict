Title: Landau Quantization of Neutral Particles in an External Field
Authors: Claudio Furtado and J. R. Nascimento and L. R. Ribeiro
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of an induced electric dipole in the presence of a configuration of crossed electric and magnetic fields is analyzed. This field configuration confines the dipole in a plane and produces a coupling similar to the coupling of a charged particle in the presence of external magnetic field. In this work we investigate the analog of Landau levels in induced electric dipoles in a sistem of neutral particles. The energy levels and eigenfunctions are obtained exactly.
