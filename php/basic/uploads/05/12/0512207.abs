Title: Elastic properties of anisotropic domain wall lattices
Authors: Richard A. Battye and Elie Chachoua and Adam Moss
Abstract: Interest in the elastic properties of regular lattices constructed from domain walls has recently been motivated by cosmological applications as solid dark energy. This work investigates the particularly simple examples of triangular, hexagonal and square lattices in two dimensions and a variety of more complicated lattices in three dimensions which have cubic symmetry. The relevant rigidity coefficients are computed taking into account non-affine perturbations where necessary, and these are used to evaluate the propagation velocity for any macroscopic scale perturbation mode. Using this information we assess the stability of the various configurations.
