Title: Neutron star cooling constraints for color superconductivity in hybrid  stars
Authors: S. Popov and H. Grigorian and D. Blaschke
Abstract: We apply the recently developed Log N - Log S test of compact star cooling theories for the first time to hybrid stars with a color superconducting quark matter core. While there is not yet a microscopically founded superconducting quark matter phase which would fulfill constraints from cooling phenomenology, we explore the hypothetical 2SC+X phase and show that the magnitude and density-dependence of the X-gap can be chosen to satisfy a set of tests: temperature - age (T - t), the brightness constraint, Log N - Log S, and the mass spectrum constraint. The latter test appears as a new conjecture from the present investigation.
