Title: An Effect of $Î±'$ Corrections on Racetrack Inflation
Authors: Brian R. Greene and Amanda Weltman
Abstract: We study the effects of $ \alpha '$ corrections to the K\"ahler potential on volume stabilisation and racetrack inflation. In a region where classical supergravity analysis is justified, stringy corrections can nevertheless be relevant for correctly analyzing moduli stabilisation and the onset of inflation.
