Title: Universal Correction to the Inflationary Vacuum
Authors: Brian Greene and Maulik Parikh and Jan Pieter van der Schaar
Abstract: The Bunch-Davies state appears precisely thermal to a free-falling observer in de Sitter space. However, precise thermality is unphysical because it violates energy conservation. Instead, the true spectrum must take a certain different form, with the Boltzmann factor $\exp(-\beta \omega_k)$ replaced by $\exp(\Delta S)$, where $S$ is the entropy of the de Sitter horizon. The deviation from precise thermality can be regarded as an explicitly calculable correction to the Bunch-Davies state. This correction is mandatory in that it relies only on energy conservation. The modified Bunch-Davies state leads, in turn, to an ${\cal O} (H/M_p)^2$ modification of the primordial power spectrum of inflationary perturbations, which we determine.
