Title: Conformal characters and the modular representation
Authors: P. Bantay and T. Gannon
Abstract: A general procedure is presented to determine, given any suitable representation of the modular group, the characters of all possible Rational Conformal Field Theories whose associated modular representation is the given one. The relevant ideas and methods are illustrated on two non-trivial examples: the Yang-Lee and the Ising models.
