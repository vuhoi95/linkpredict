Title: Open/closed duality for FZZT branes in c=1
Authors: Ian Ellwood and Akikazu Hashimoto
Abstract: We describe how the matrix integral of Imbimbo and Mukhi arises from a limit of the FZZT partition function in the double-scaled c=1 matrix model. We show a similar result for 0A and comment on subtleties in 0B.
