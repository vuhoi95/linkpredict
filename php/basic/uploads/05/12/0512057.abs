Title: Cosmic Superstrings Stabilized by Fermions
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Alberto Iglesias
Abstract: We show that there exist massive perturbative states of the ten dimensional Green-Schwarz closed superstring that are stabilized against collapse due to presence of fermionic zero modes on its worldsheet. The excited fermionic degrees of freedom backreact on the spacetime motion of the string in the same way as a neutral persistent current would, rendering these string loops stable. We point out that the existence of these states could have important consequences as stable loops of cosmological size as well as long lived states within perturbative string theory.
