Title: Hawking emission of gravitons in higher dimensions: non-rotating black  holes
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Marco Cavaglia and Leonardo Gualtieri
Abstract: We compute the absorption cross section and the total power carried by gravitons in the evaporation process of a higher-dimensional non-rotating black hole. These results are applied to a model of extra dimensions with standard model fields propagating on a brane. The emission of gravitons in the bulk is highly enhanced as the spacetime dimensionality increases. The implications for the detection of black holes in particle colliders and ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray air showers are briefly discussed.
