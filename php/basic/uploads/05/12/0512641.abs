Title: Analytic Results for a Flat Universe Dominated by Dust and Dark Energy
Authors: A. Gruppuso and F. Finelli
Abstract: We find the solution for the scale factor in a flat Universe driven by dust plus a component characterized by a constant parameter of state which dominates in the asymptotic future. We also present an analytic formula (in terms of hypergeometric functions) for the past light cone in such a universe. As applications of this result, we give analytic expressions for the Luminosity Distance and for the Acoustic Scale, where the latter determines the peaks positions in the pattern of CMB anisotropies.
