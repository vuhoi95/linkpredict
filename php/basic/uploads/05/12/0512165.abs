Title: A surprise in mechanics with nonlinear chiral supermultiplet
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We show that the nonlinear chiral supermultiplet allows one to construct, over given two-dimensional bosonic mechanics, the family of two-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric mechanics parameterized with the holomorphic function $\lambda (z)$. We show, that this family includes, as a particular case, the ${\cal N}=4$ superextensions of two-dimensional mechanics with magnetic fields, which have factorizable Schroedinger equations.
