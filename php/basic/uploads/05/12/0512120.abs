Title: A Comparison of Quintessence and Nonlinear Born-Infeld Scalar Field  Using Gold Supernova data
Authors: Wei Fang and H. Q. Lu and B. Li and K. F Zhang
Abstract: We study the Non-Linear Born-Infeld(NLBI) scalar field model and quintessence model with two different potentials($V(\phi)=-s\phi$ and ${1/2}m^2\phi^2$). We investigate the differences between those two models. We explore the equation of state parameter w and the evolution of scale factor $a(t)$ in both NLBI scalar field and quintessence model. The present age of universe and the transition redshift are also obtained. We use the Gold dataset of 157 SN-Ia to constrain the parameters of the two models. All the results show that NLBI model is slightly superior to quintessence model.
