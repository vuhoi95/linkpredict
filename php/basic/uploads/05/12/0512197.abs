Title: First-order formalism and dark energy
Authors: D. Bazeia and C. B. Gomes and L. Losano and R. Menezes
Abstract: This work deals with cosmological models driven by real scalar field, described by standard dynamics in generic spherical, flat, and hyperbolic geometries. We introduce a first-order formalism, which shows how to relate the potential that specifies the scalar field model to Hubble's parameter in a simple and direct manner. Extensions to tachyonic dynamics, and to two or more real scalar fields are also presented.
