Title: More on ghosts in DGP model
Authors: Dmitry Gorbunov and Kazuya Koyama and Sergei Sibiryakov
Abstract: It is shown by an explicit calculation that the excitations about the self-accelerating cosmological solution of the Dvali--Gabadaze--Porrati model contain a ghost mode. This raises serious doubts about viability of this solution. Our analysis reveals the similarity between the quadratic theory for the perturbations around the self-accelerating Universe and an Abelian gauge model with two Stueckelberg fields.
