Title: Cohomology of antiPoisson superalgebra
Authors: S. E. Konstein and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: We consider antiPoisson superalgebras realized on the smooth Grassmann-valued functions with compact supports in R^n and with the grading inverse to Grassmanian parity. The lower cohomologies of these superalgebras are found.
