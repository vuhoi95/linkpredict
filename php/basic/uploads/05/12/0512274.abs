Title: Non-perturbative materialization of ghosts
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Jaume Garriga
Abstract: In theories with a hidden ghost sector that couples to visible matter through gravity only, empty space can decay into ghosts and ordinary matter by graviton exchange. Perturbatively, such processes can be very slow provided that the gravity sector violates Lorentz invariance above some cut-off scale. Here, we investigate non-perturbative decay processes involving ghosts, such as the spontaneous creation of self-gravitating lumps of ghost matter, as well as pairs of Bondi dipoles (i.e., lumps of ghost matter chasing after positive energy objects). We find the corresponding instantons and calculate their Euclidean action. In some cases, the instantons induce topology change or have negative Euclidean action. To shed some light on the meaning of such peculiarities, we also consider the nucleation of concentrical domain walls of ordinary and ghost matter, where the Euclidean calculation can be compared with the canonical (Lorentzian) description of tunneling. We conclude that non-perturbative ghost nucleation processes can be safely suppressed in phenomenological scenarios.
