Abstract: Among 12672 Feynman diagrams contributing to the electron anomalous magnetic moment at the tenth order, 6354 are the diagrams having no lepton loops, i.e., those of quenched type. Because the renormalization structure of these diagrams is very complicated, some automation scheme is inevitable to calculate them. We developed an algorithm to write down FORTRAN programs for numerical evaluation of these diagrams, where the necessary counterterms to subtract out ultraviolet subdivergence are generated according to Zimmermann's forest formula. Thus far we have evaluated crudely integrals of 2232 tenth-order vertex diagrams which require vertex renormalization only. Remaining 4122 diagrams, which have ultraviolet-divergent self-energy subdiagrams and infrared-divergent subdiagrams, are being evaluated by giving small mass lambda to photons to control the infrared problem.
