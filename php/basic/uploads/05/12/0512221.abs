Title: D-term Inflation and Leptogenesis by Right-handed Sneutrino
Authors: Kenji Kadota and J. Yokoyama
Abstract: We discuss a D-term inflation scenario where a right-handed sneutrino can be an inflaton field leading to a viable inflation and leptogenesis, with a minimal form of K\"ahler potential. The decay of an inflaton sneutrino can non-thermally create large enough lepton asymmetry. Its entropy production is also big enough to ameliorate the gravitino problem caused by too high a reheating temperature from the decay of a symmetry breaking field.
