Title: From Toric Geometry to Quiver Gauge Theory: the Equivalence of  a-maximization and Z-minimization
Authors: Agostino Butti and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: AdS/CFT predicts a precise relation between the central charge a, the scaling dimensions of some operators in the CFT on D3-branes at conical singularities and the volumes of the horizon and of certain cycles in the supergravity dual. We review how a quantitative check of this relation can be performed for all toric singularities. In addition to the results presented in hep-th/0506232, we also discuss the relation with the recently discovered map between toric singularities and tilings; in particular, we discuss how to find the precise distribution of R-charges in the quiver gauge theory using dimers technology.
