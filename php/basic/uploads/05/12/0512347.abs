Title: The Runaway Quiver
Authors: Kenneth Intriligator and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We point out that some recently proposed string theory realizations of dynamical supersymmetry breaking actually do not break supersymmetry in the usual desired sense. Instead, there is a runaway potential, which slides down to a supersymmetric vacuum at infinite expectation values for some fields. The runaway direction is not on a separated branch; rather, it shows up as a"tadpole" everywhere on the moduli space of field expectation values.
