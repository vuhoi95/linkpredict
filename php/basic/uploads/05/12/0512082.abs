Title: Flat coordinates and dilaton fields for three--dimensional conformal  sigma models
Authors: L. Hlavaty and M. Turek
Abstract: Riemannian coordinates for flat metrics corresponding to three--dimensional conformal Poisson--Lie T--dualizable sigma models are found by solving partial differential equations that follow from the transformations of the connection components. They are then used for finding general forms of the dilaton fields satisfying the vanishing beta equations of the sigma models.
