Title: Gravitational radiation from elastic particle scattering in models with  extra dimensions
Authors: B. Koch and M. Bleicher
Abstract: In this paper we derive a formula for the energy loss due to elastic N to N particle scattering in models with extra dimensions that are compactified on a radius R. In contrast to a previous derivation we also calculate additional terms that are suppressed by factors of frequency over compactification radius. In the limit of a large compactification radius R those terms vanish and the standard result for the non compactified case is recovered.
