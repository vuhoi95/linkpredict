Title: Brane Dualities in Non-relativistic Limit
Authors: Kiyoshi Kamimura and Toni Ramirez
Abstract: We analyze brane dualities in the non-relativistic limit of the worldvolume actions. In particular we have analyzed how the non-relativistic M2-brane is related via these dualities to non-relativistic D2-brane, non-relativistic IIA fundamental string and also, by using T-duality, to non-relativistic D1-string. These actions coincide with ones obtained from relativistic actions by taking non-relativistic limit, showing that the non-relativistic limit and the dualities commute in these cases.
