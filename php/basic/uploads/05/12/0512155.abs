Title: Calogero-Sutherland-Moser Systems, Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen  Systems and Orthogonal Polynomials
Authors: S. Odake and R. Sasaki
Abstract: The equilibrium positions of the multi-particle classical Calogero-Sutherland-Moser (CSM) systems with rational/trigonometric potentials associated with the classical root systems are described by the classical orthogonal polynomials; the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. The eigenfunctions of the corresponding single-particle quantum CSM systems are also expressed in terms of the same orthogonal polynomials. We show that this interesting property is inherited by the Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen (RSvD) systems, which are integrable deformation of the CSM systems; the equilibrium positions of the multi-particle classical RSvD systems and the eigenfunctions of the corresponding single-particle quantum RSvD systems are described by the same orthogonal polynomials, the continuous Hahn (special case), Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials. They belong to the Askey-scheme of the basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and are deformation of the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials, respectively. The Hamiltonians of these single-particle quantum mechanical systems have two remarkable properties, factorization and shape invariance.
