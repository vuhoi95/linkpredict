Title: Conformal Sigma-Models on Supercoset Targets
Authors: David Kagan and Charles A. S. Young
Abstract: We investigate the quantum behaviour of sigma models on coset superspaces G/H defined by Z_{2n} gradings of G. We find that, whenever G has vanishing Killing form, there is a choice of WZ term which renders the model quantum conformal, at least to one loop. The choice coincides with that for which the model is known to be classically integrable. This generalizes results for models associated to Z_4 gradings, including IIB superstrings in AdS_5\times S^5.
