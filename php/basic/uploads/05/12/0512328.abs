Title: Form-field bremsstrahlung under collision of p-branes
Authors: Dmitry Galtsov and Elena Melkumova and Karim Salehi
Abstract: We calculate classically the radiation of the antisymmetric form field generated in the collision of two non-excited membranes moving with ultrarelativistic velocities in five space-time dimensions. The interaction between branes through the form field is treated perturbatively with the deflection angle as a small parameter. Radiation arises in the second order approximation if the domain of the minimal separation between the branes moves with the superluminal velocity. It exhibits typical Cherenkov cone features. Generalization to p-branes colliding in $D=p+3$ dimensions is straightforward.
