Title: On the construction of Chern-Simons terms in the presence of flux
Authors: Nikos Irges and Mirian Tsulaia
Abstract: We develop a method for relating the boundary effective action associated with an orbifold of the D+1 dimensional theory of a p-form field to D dimensional fluxed Chern-Simons type of terms. We apply the construction to derive from twelve dimensions the Chern-Simons terms of the eleven dimensional supergravity theory in the presence of flux.
