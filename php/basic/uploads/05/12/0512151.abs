Title: Spinning strings in AdS_5 x S^5: A worldsheet perspective
Authors: Benjamin A. Burrington and James T. Liu
Abstract: We examine the leading Regge string states relevant for semi-classical spinning string solutions. Using elementary RNS techniques, quadratic terms in an effective lagrangian are constructed which describe massive NSNS strings in a space-time with five-form flux. We then examine the specific case of AdS_5 x S^5, finding the dependence of AdS "energy" (E_0) on spin in AdS (S), spin on the sphere (J), and orbital angular momentum on the sphere (\nabla_a \nabla^a).
