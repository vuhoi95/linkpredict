Title: Comments on conformal masses, asymptotics backgrounds and conservation  laws
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Joseph Katz
Abstract: The "conformal mass prescriptions" were used recently to calculate the mass of spacetimes in higher dimensional and higher curvature theories of gravity. These definitions are closely related to Komar integrals for spacetimes that are conformally flat at great distances from the sources. We derive these relations without using the conformal infinity formalism.
