Title: New Facts about Berezinians
Authors: Hovhannes M. Khudaverdian and Theodore Th. Voronov
Abstract: We consider a new formula for Berezinian (superdeterminant). The Berezinian of a supermatrix $A$ is expressed as the ratio of polynomial invariants of $A$. This formula follows from recurrence relations existing for supertraces of exterior powers.
