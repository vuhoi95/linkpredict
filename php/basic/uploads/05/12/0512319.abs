Title: Hamiltonian Formalism of the de-Sitter Invariant Special Relativity
Authors: Mu-Lin Yan and Neng-Chao Xiao and Wei Huang and Si Li
Abstract: Lagrangian of the Einstein's special relativity with universal parameter $c$ ($\mathcal{SR}_c$) is invariant under Poincar\'e transformation which preserves Lorentz metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$. The $\mathcal{SR}_c$ has been extended to be one which is invariant under de Sitter transformation that preserves so called Beltrami metric $B_{\mu\nu}$. There are two universal parameters $c$ and $R$ in this Special Relativity (denote it as $\mathcal{SR}_{cR}$). The Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formulism of $\mathcal{SR}_{cR}$ is formulated in this paper. The canonic energy, canonic momenta, and 10 Noether charges corresponding to the space-time's de Sitter symmetry are derived. The canonical quantization of the mechanics for $\mathcal{SR}_{cR}$-free particle is performed. The physics related to it is discussed.
