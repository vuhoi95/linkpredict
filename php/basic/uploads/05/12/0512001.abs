Title: Asymptotically AdS brane black holes
Authors: Christophe Galfard and Cristiano Germani and Akihiro Ishibashi
Abstract: We study the possibility of having a static, asymptotically AdS black hole localized on a braneworld with matter fields, within the framework of the Randall and Sundrum scenario. We attempt to look for such a brane black hole configuration by slicing a given bulk spacetime and taking Z_2 symmetry about the slices. We find that such configurations are possible, and as an explicit example, we provide a family of asymptotically AdS brane black hole solutions for which both the bulk and brane metrics are regular on and outside the black hole horizon and brane matter fields are realistic in the sense that the dominant energy condition is satisfied. We also find that our braneworld models exhibit signature change inside the black hole horizon.
