Title: The Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian Density in a 2-dimensional Spacetime is  an Exact Differential
Authors: Roldao da Rocha and W. A. Rodrigues Jr
Abstract: Recently Kiriushcheva and Kuzmin claimed to have shown that the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian cannot be written in any coordinate gauge as an exact differential in a 2-dimensional spacetime. Since this is contrary to other statements on the subject found in the literature, as e.g., by Deser and Jackiw, Jackiw, Grumiller, Kummer and Vassilevich it is necessary to do decide who has reason. This is done in this paper in a very simply way using the Clifford bundle formalism. In this version we added Section 18 which discusses a recent comment on our paper just posted by Kiriushcheva and Kuzmin.
