Title: The general Leigh-Strassler deformation and integrability
Authors: D. Bundzik and T. Mansson
Abstract: The success of the identification of the planar dilatation operator of N=4 SYM with an integrable spin chain Hamiltonian has raised the question if this also is valid for a deformed theory. Several deformations of SYM have recently been under investigation in this context. In this work we consider the general Leigh-Strassler deformation. For the generic case the S-matrix techniques cannot be used to prove integrability. Instead we use R-matrix techniques to study integrability. Some new integrable points in the parameter space are found.
