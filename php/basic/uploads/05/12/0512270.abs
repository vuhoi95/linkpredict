Title: The Higgs Mechanism in Heterotic Orbifolds
Authors: Stefan Forste and Hans Peter Nilles and Akin Wingerter
Abstract: We study spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in the framework of orbifold compactifcations of heterotic string theory. In particular we investigate the electroweak symmetry breakdown via the Higgs mechanism. Such a breakdown can be achieved by continuous Wilson lines. Exploiting the geometrical properties of this scheme we develop a new technique which simplifies the analysis used in previous discussions.
