Abstract: After introducing the generators and irreducible representations of the ${\rm su}(5)$ and ${\rm so}(6)$ Lie algebras in terms of the Schwinger's scillators, the general kernel solutions of the Kostant operators on eight-dimensional quotient spaces ${\rm su}(5)/{\rm su}(4)\times {\rm u}(1)$ and ${\rm so}(6)/{\rm so}(4)\times {\rm so}(2)$ are derived in terms of the diagonal subalgebras ${\rm su}(4)\times {\rm u}(1)$ and ${\rm so}(4)\times {\rm so}(2)$, respectively.
