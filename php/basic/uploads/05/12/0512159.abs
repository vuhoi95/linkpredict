Title: D-brane dynamics in a plane wave background
Authors: J. Kluson and Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: By using the Dirac-Born-Infeld action we study the dynamics of Dp-brane propagating in the NS5-near horizon plane wave background. We study systematically D-brane embedding in this pp-wave background, and analyze the equations of motion for various auxiliary fields. We further discuss the motion of the probe Dq-brane in the presence of source Dp-branes in this plane wave background.
