Title: Skyrmion and Skyrme-Black holes in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate
Abstract: Numerical arguments are presented for the existence of regular and black hole solutions of the Einstein-Skyrme equations with a positive cosmological constant. These classical configurations approach asymptotically the de Sitter spacetime. The main properties of the solutions and the differences with respect to the asymptotically flat ones are discussed. It particular our results suggest that, for a positive cosmological constant, the mass evaluated as timelike infinity in infinite. Special emphasis is set to De Sitter black holes Skyrmions which display two horizons.
