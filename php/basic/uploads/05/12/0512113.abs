Title: 3d Quantum Gravity and Effective Non-Commutative Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Etera R. Livine
Abstract: We show that the effective dynamics of matter fields coupled to 3d quantum gravity is described after integration over the gravitational degrees of freedom by a braided non-commutative quantum field theory symmetric under a kappa-deformation of the Poincare group.
