Title: Color Superconductivity in N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Masato Arai and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: We study vacuum structure of N=2 supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD, based on the gauge group SU(2) with N_f=2 flavors of massive hypermultiplet quarks, in the presence of non-zero baryon chemical potential (\mu). The theory has a classical vacuum preserving baryon number symmetry, when a mass term, which breaks N=2 SUSY but preserves N=1 SUSY, for the adjoint gauge chiral multiplet (m_{ad}) is introduced. By using the exact result of N=2 SUSY QCD, we analyze low energy effective potential at the leading order of perturbation with respect to small SUSY breaking parameters, \mu and m_{ad}. We find that the baryon number is broken as a consequence of the SU(2) strong gauge dynamics, so that color superconductivity dynamically takes place at the non-SUSY vacuum.
