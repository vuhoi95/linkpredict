Title: Superconformal Field Theory and SUSY N=1 KdV Hierarchy II: The  Q-operator
Authors: Petr P. Kulish and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: The algebraic structures related with integrable structure of superconformal field theory (SCFT) are introduced. The SCFT counterparts of Baxter's Q-operator are constructed. The fusion-like relations for the transfer-matrices in different representations and their truncations are obtained.
