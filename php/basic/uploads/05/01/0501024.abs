Title: Nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity and unity of nature - Is the  real shape of nature unstable spacetime?
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: The Einstein-Hilbert-type action for nonlinear supersymmetric(NLSUSY) general relativity(GR) proposed as the fundamental action for nature is written down explicitly in terms of the fundamental fields, the graviton and the Nambu-Goldstone(NG) fermion(superons). For comparisons the expansion of the action is carried out by using the affine connection formalism and the spin connection formalism. The linearization of NLSUSY GR is considered and carried out explicitly for the N=2 NLSUSY(Volkov-Akulov) model, which reproduce the equivalent renormalizable theory of the gauge vector multiplet of N=2 LSUSY. Some characteristic structures including some hidden symmetries of the gravitational coupling of superons are manifested (in two dimensional space-time) with some details of the calculations. SGM cosmology is discussed briefly.
