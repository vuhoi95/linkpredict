Title: The Radion in 5D Conformal SUGRA: Superspace Action
Authors: Filipe Paccetti Correia and Michael G. Schmidt and Zurab Tavartkiladze
Abstract: We shortly review our new superfield formalism in the framework of Fujita, Kugo, Ohashi 5D conformal supergravity, in particular with an $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. The radion of the fifth dimension is embedded in two related superfields, a chiral and a general multiplet and is linked to the radion superfield of rigid SUSY. The superspace action of the gauge sector is of the Chern-Simons type. We also present the superspace action for hypermultiplets and discuss the role of compensators. The presented formalism should be very useful for applications. We demonstrate this for obtaining the RS solution.
