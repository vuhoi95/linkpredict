Title: Semiclassical String Solutions on 1/2 BPS Geometries
Authors: Hajar Ebrahim and Amir E. Mosaffa
Abstract: We study semiclassical string solutions on the 1/2 BPS geometry of type IIB string theory characterized by concentric rings on the boundary plane. We consider both folded rotating strings carrying nonzero R-charge and circular pulsating strings. We find that unlike rotating strings, as far as circular pulsating strings are concerned, the dynamics remains qualitatively unchanged when the concentric rings replace AdS_5\times S^5. Using the gravity dual we have also studied the Wilson loop of the corresponding gauge theory. The result is qualitatively the same as that in AdS_5\times S^5 in the global coordinates where the corresponding gauge theory is defined on S^3\times R. We show that there is a correction to 1/L leading order behavior of the potential between external objects.
