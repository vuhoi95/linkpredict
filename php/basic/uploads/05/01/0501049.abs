Title: Dark energy cosmologies for codimension-two branes
Authors: Jan-Markus Schwindt and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: A six-dimensional universe with two branes in the "football-shaped" geometry leads to an almost realistic cosmology. We describe a family of exact solutions with time dependent characteristic size of internal space. After a short inflationary period the late cosmology is either of quintessence type or turns to a radiation dominated Friedmann universe where the cosmological constant appears as a free integration constant of the solution. The radiation dominated universe with relativistic fermions is analyzed in detail, including its dimensional reduction.
