Abstract: Lagrangians for several new off-shell 4D, N = 1 supersymmetric descriptions of massive superspin-1 and superspin-3/2 multiplets are described. Taken together with the models previously constructed, there are now four off-shell formulations for the massive gravitino multiplet (superspin-1) and six off-shell formulations for the massive graviton multiplet (superspin-3/2). Duality transformations are derived which relate some of these dynamical systems.
