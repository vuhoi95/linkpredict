Title: String Pair Creations in D-brane Systems
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Phillial Oh and Cheonsoo Park and Jonghyeon Shin
Abstract: We investigate the criterion, on the Born-Infeld background fields, for the open string pair creation to occur in D$p$-(anti-)D$p$-brane systems. Although the pair creation occurs generically in both D$p$-D$p$ and D$p$-anti-D$p$ systems for the cases which meet the criterion, it is more drastic in D$p$-anti-D$p$-brane systems by some exponential factor depending on the background fields. Various configurations exhibiting pair creations are obtained via duality transformations. These include the spacelike scissors and two D-strings (slanted at different angles) passing through each other. We raise the scissors paradox and suggest a resolution based on the triple junction in IIB setup.
