Title: On Higher Spins with a Strong Sp(2,R) Condition
Authors: A. Sagnotti and E. Sezgin and P. Sundell
Abstract: We report on an analysis of the Vasiliev construction for minimal bosonic higher-spin master fields with oscillators that are vectors of SO(D-1,2) and doublets of Sp(2,R). We show that, if the original master field equations are supplemented with a strong Sp(2,R) projection of the 0-form while letting the 1-form adjust to the resulting Weyl curvatures, the linearized on-shell constraints exhibit both the proper mass terms and a geometric gauge symmetry with unconstrained, traceful parameters. We also address some of the subtleties related to the strong projection and the prospects for obtaining a finite curvature expansion.
