Title: Casimir Effect for Gauge Fields in Spaces with Negative Constant  Curvature
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and M. E. X. Guimaraes and V. S. Mendes
Abstract: We consider gauge theories based on abelian $p-$forms on real compact hyperbolic spaces. Using the zeta-function regularization method and the trace tensor kernel formula, we determine explicitly an expression for the vacuum energy (Casimir energy) corresponding to skew-symmetric tensor fields. It is shown that the topological component of the Casimir energy for co-exact forms on even-dimensional spaces, associated with the trivial character, is always negative. We infer on the possible cosmological consequences of this result.
