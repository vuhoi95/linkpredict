Title: Scalar and Vector Massive Fields in Lyra's Manifold
Authors: R. Casana and C. A. M. de Melo and B. M. Pimentel
Abstract: The problem of coupling between spin and torsion is analysed from a Lyra's manifold background for scalar and vector massive fields using the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) theory. We found the propagation of the torsion is dynamical, and the minimal coupling of DKP field corresponds to a non-minimal coupling in the standard Klein-Gordon-Fock and Proca approaches. The origin of this difference in the couplings is discussed in terms of equivalence by surface terms.
