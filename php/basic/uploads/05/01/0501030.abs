Title: Bosonic p-brane and A--D--M decomposition
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee and Anirban Saha
Abstract: A master action for the bosonic p-brane, interpolating between the Nambu--Goto and Polyakov formalisms, is discussed. The fundamental arbitrariness of extended structures (p-brane) embeded in space time manifold has been exploited to build an independent metric in the brane world volume. The cosmological term for the generic case follows naturally in the scheme. The dynamics of the structure leads to a natural emergence of the A--D--M like split of this world volume. The role of the gauge symmetries vis-\`{a}-vis reparametrization symmetries is analyzed by a constrained Hamiltonian approach.
