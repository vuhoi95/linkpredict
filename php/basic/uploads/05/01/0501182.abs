Abstract: We construct an N=1 supersymmetric three-family flipped SU(5) model from type IIA orientifolds on $T^6/(\Z_2\times \Z_2)$ with D6-branes intersecting at general angles. The spectrum contains a complete grand unified and electroweak Higgs sector. In addition, it contains extra exotic matter both in bi-fundamental and vector-like representations as well as two copies of matter in the symmetric representation of SU(5).
