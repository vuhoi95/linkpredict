Title: A Note on Four-Point Functions in Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Michael Flohr and Marco Krohn
Abstract: The generic structure of 4-point functions of fields residing in indecomposable representations of arbitrary rank is given. The presented algorithm is illustrated with some non-trivial examples and permutation symmetries are exploited to reduce the number of free structure-functions, which cannot be fixed by global conformal invariance alone.
