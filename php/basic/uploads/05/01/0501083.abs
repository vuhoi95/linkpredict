Title: Self-adjoint extensions and SUSY breaking in Supersymmetric Quantum  Mechanics
Authors: H. Falomir and P. A. G. Pisani
Abstract: We consider the self-adjoint extensions (SAE) of the symmetric supercharges and Hamiltonian for a model of SUSY Quantum Mechanics in $\mathbb{R}^+$ with a singular superpotential. We show that only for two particular SAE, whose domains are scale invariant, the algebra of N=2 SUSY is realized, one with manifest SUSY and the other with spontaneously broken SUSY. Otherwise, only the N=1 SUSY algebra is obtained, with spontaneously broken SUSY and non degenerate energy spectrum.
