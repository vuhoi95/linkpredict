Title: Exactly solvable systems and the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism
Authors: Constantin Rasinariu and John J. Dykla and Asim Gangopadhyaya and Jeffry V. Mallow
Abstract: We connect Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory with supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). We show that the shape invariance, which is an integrability condition of SUSYQM, translates into fractional linear relations among the quantum momentum functions.
