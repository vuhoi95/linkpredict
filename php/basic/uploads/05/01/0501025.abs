Title: Properties of singularities in (phantom) dark energy universe
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: The properties of future singularities are investigated in the universe dominated by dark energy including the phantom-type fluid. We classify the finite-time singularities into four classes and explicitly present the models which give rise to these singularities by assuming the form of the equation of state of dark energy. We show the existence of a stable fixed point with an equation of state $w<-1$ and numerically confirm that this is actually a late-time attractor in the phantom-dominated universe. We also construct a phantom dark energy scenario coupled to dark matter that reproduces singular behaviors of the Big Rip type for the energy density and the curvature of the universe. The effect of quantum corrections coming from conformal anomaly can be important when the curvature grows large, which typically moderates the finite-time singularities.
