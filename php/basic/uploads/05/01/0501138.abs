Title: Stability and quasi-normal modes of charged black holes in Born-Infeld  gravity
Authors: Sharmanthie Fernando and Chad Holbrook
Abstract: In this paper we study the stability and quasi-normal modes of scalar perturbations of black holes. The static charged black hole considered here is a solution to Born-Infeld electrodynamics coupled to gravity. We conclude that the black hole is stable. We also compare the stability of it with its linear counter-part Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The quasi-normal modes are computed using the WKB method. The behavior of these modes with the non-linear parameter, temperature, mass of the scalar field and the spherical index are analyzed in detail.
