Title: Integrable open spin chains from giant gravitons
Authors: David Berenstein and Samuel E. Vazquez
Abstract: We prove that in the presence of a maximal giant graviton state in N=4 SYM, the states dual to open strings attached to the giant graviton give rise to an PSU(2,2|4) open spin chain model with integrable boundary conditions in the SO(6) sector of the spin chain to one loop order.
