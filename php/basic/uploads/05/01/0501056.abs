Title: Two-dimensional interactions between a BF-type theory and a collection  of vector fields
Authors: E. M. Cioroianu and S. C. Sararu
Abstract: Consistent interactions that can be added to a two-dimensional, free abelian gauge theory comprising a special class of BF-type models and a collection of vector fields are constructed from the deformation of the solution to the master equation based on specific cohomological techniques. The deformation procedure modifies the Lagrangian action, the gauge transformations, as well as the accompanying algebra of the interacting model.
