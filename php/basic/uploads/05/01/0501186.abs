Abstract: With the aim of a further investigation of the nonperturbative Hamiltonian approach in gauge field theories, the mass spectrum of QED-2 is calculated numerically by using the corrected Hamiltonian that was constructed previously for this theory on the light front. The calculations are performed for a wide range of the ratio of the fermion mass to the fermion charge at all values of the parameter \hat\theta related to the vacuum angle \theta. The results obtained in this way are compared with the results of known numerical calculations on a lattice in Lorentz coordinates. A method is proposed for extrapolating the values obtained within the infrared-regularized theory to the limit where the regularization is removed. The resulting spectrum agrees well with the known results in the case of \theta=0; in the case of \theta=\pi, there is agreement at small values of the fermion mass (below the phase-transition point).
