Title: Exactly Soluble BPS Black Holes in Higher Curvature N=2 Supergravity
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Seok Kim and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: We find a class of d=4, N=2 supergravity with $R^2$-interactions that admits exact BPS black holes. The prepotential contains quadratic, cubic and chiral curvature-squared terms. Black hole geometry realizes stretched horizon, and consists of anti-de Sitter, intermediate and outermost flat regions. Mass and entropy depends on charges and are modified not only by higher curvature terms but also by quadratic term in the prepotential. Consequently, even for large charges, entropy is no longer proportional to mass-squared.
