Title: QCD and a Holographic Model of Hadrons
Authors: Joshua Erlich and Emanuel Katz and Dam T. Son and Mikhail A. Stephanov
Abstract: We propose a five-dimensional framework for modeling low-energy properties of QCD. In the simplest three parameter model we compute masses, decay rates and couplings of the lightest mesons. The model fits experimental data to within 10%. The framework is a holographic version of the QCD sum rules, motivated by the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. The model naturally incorporates properties of QCD dictated by chiral symmetry, which we demonstrate by deriving the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relationship for the pion mass.
