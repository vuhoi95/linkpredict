Title: Can mass-less QCD dynamically generate heavy quarks?
Authors: Alejandro Cabo Montes de Oca and Danny Martinez-Pedrera
Abstract: As it was suggested by previous works on a modified perturbation expansion for QCD, the possibility for the generation of large quark condensates in the mass-less version of the theory is explored. For this purpose, it is firstly presented a way of well define the Feynman diagrams at any number of loops by just employing dimensional regularization. After that, the calculated zero and one loop corrections to the effective potential indicate a strong instability of the system under the generation of quark condensates. The also evaluated quark condensate dependence of particular two loop terms does not modify the instability picture arising at one loop. The results suggest a possible mechanism for a sort of Top Condensate Model to be a dynamically fixed effective action for mass-less QCD. The inability of lattice calculations in detecting this possibility could be related with the limitations in treating the fermion determinants.
