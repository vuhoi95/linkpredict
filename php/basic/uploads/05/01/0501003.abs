Title: An algebraic scheme associated with the noncommutative KP hierarchy and  some of its extensions
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: A well-known ansatz (`trace method') for soliton solutions turns the equations of the (noncommutative) KP hierarchy, and those of certain extensions, into families of algebraic sum identities. We develop an algebraic formalism, in particular involving a (mixable) shuffle product, to explore their structure. More precisely, we show that the equations of the noncommutative KP hierarchy and its extension (xncKP) in the case of a Moyal-deformed product, as derived in previous work, correspond to identities in this algebra. Furthermore, the Moyal product is replaced by a more general associative product. This leads to a new even more general extension of the noncommutative KP hierarchy. Relations with Rota-Baxter algebras are established.
