Title: On a Classification of Irreducible Almost Commutative Geometries, A  Second Helping
Authors: Jan-H. Jureit and Christoph A. Stephan
Abstract: We complete the classification of almost commutative geometries from a particle physics point of view given in hep-th/0312276. Four missing Krajewski diagrams will be presented after a short introduction into irreducible, non-degenerate spectral triples.
