Title: Higher-Spin Gauge Fields and Duality
Authors: D. Francia and C. M. Hull
Abstract: We review the construction of free gauge theories for gauge fields in arbitrary representations of the Lorentz group in $D$ dimensions. We describe the multi-form calculus which gives the natural geometric framework for these theories. We also discuss duality transformations that give different field theory representations of the same physical degrees of freedom, and discuss the example of gravity in $D$ dimensions and its dual realisations in detail.
