Title: The Spectrum of Yang Mills on a Sphere
Authors: Alexander Barabanschikov and Lars Grant and Lisa L Huang and Suvrat Raju
Abstract: In this note, we determine the representation content of the free, large N, SU(N) Yang Mills theory on a sphere by decomposing its thermal partition function into characters of the irreducible representations of the conformal group SO(4,2). We also discuss the generalization of this procedure to finding the representation content of N=4 Super Yang Mills.
