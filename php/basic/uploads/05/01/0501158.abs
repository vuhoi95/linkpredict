Title: Renormalization of initial conditions and the trans-Planckian problem of  inflation
Authors: Hael Collins and R. Holman
Abstract: Understanding how a field theory propagates the information contained in a given initial state is essential for quantifying the sensitivity of the cosmic microwave background to physics above the Hubble scale during inflation. Here we examine the renormalization of a scalar theory with nontrivial initial conditions in the simpler setting of flat space. The renormalization of the bulk theory proceeds exactly as for the standard vacuum state. However, the short distance features of the initial conditions can introduce new divergences which are confined to the surface on which the initial conditions are imposed. We show how the addition of boundary counterterms removes these divergences and induces a renormalization group flow in the space of initial conditions.
