Title: D-brane dynamics near compactified NS5-branes
Authors: Steven Thomas and John Ward
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a $Dp$-brane in the background of $k$ coincident, parallel $NS$5-branes which have had one of their common transverse directions compactified. We find that for small energy, bound orbits can exist at sufficiently large distances where there will be no stringy effects. The orbits are dependent upon the energy density, angular momentum and electric field. The analysis breaks down at radial distances comparable with the compactification radius and we must resort to using a modified form of the harmonic function in this region.
