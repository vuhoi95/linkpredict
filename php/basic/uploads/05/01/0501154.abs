Title: AdS/CFT Duality and the Higgs Branch of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM
Authors: Zachary Guralnik and Stefano Kovacs and Bogdan Kulik
Abstract: We construct the AdS description of the Higgs branch of the finite {\cal N}=2 Sp(N) gauge theory with one antisymmetric hypermultiplet and four fundamental hypermultiplets. Holography, combined with the non-renormalization of the metric on the Higgs branch, leads to novel constraints on unknown terms in the non-abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action. These terms include non-minimal couplings of D-branes to bulk supergravity fields.
