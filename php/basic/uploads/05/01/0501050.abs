Title: Symmetries of the Poincare sphere and decoherence matrices
Authors: S. Baskal and Y. S. Kim
Abstract: The Stokes parameters form a Minkowskian four-vector under various optical transformations. As a consequence, the resulting two-by-two density matrix constitutes a representation of the Lorentz group. The associated Poincare sphere is a geometric representation of the Lorentz group. Since the Lorentz group preserves the determinant of the density matrix, it cannot accommodate the decoherence process through the decaying off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, which yields to an incerese in the value of the determinant. It is noted that the O(3,2) deSitter group contains two Lorentz subgroups. The change in the determinant in one Lorentz group can be compensated by the other. It is thus possible to describe the decoherence process as a symmetry transformation in the O(3,2) space. It is shown also that these two coupled Lorentz groups can serve as a concrete example of Feynman's rest of the universe.
