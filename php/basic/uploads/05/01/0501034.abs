Title: U(1) Noncommutative Gauge Fields and Magnetogenesis
Authors: J. Gamboa and J. Lopez-Sarrion
Abstract: The connection between the Lorentz invariance violation in the lagrangean context and the quantum theory of noncommutative fields is established for the U(1) gauge field. The modified Maxwell equations coincide with other derivations obtained using different procedures. These modified equations are interpreted as describing macroscopic ones in a polarized and magnetized medium. A tiny magnetic field (seed) emerges as particular static solution that gradually increases once the modified Maxwell equations are solved as a self-consistent equations system.
