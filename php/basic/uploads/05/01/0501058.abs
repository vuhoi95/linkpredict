Title: Entanglement Induced Fluctuations of Cold Bosons
Authors: Ram Brustein and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We show that due to entanglement, quantum fluctuations may differ significantly from statistical fluctuations. We calculate quantum fluctuations of the particle number and of the energy in a sub-volume of a system of bosons in a pure state, and briefly discuss the possibility of measuring them. We find that energy fluctuations have a non-extensive nature.
