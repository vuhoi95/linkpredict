Title: Zero-Curvature Formalism of Supersymmetric Principal Chiral Model
Authors: U. Saleem and M. Hassan
Abstract: We investigate one-parameter family of transformation on superfields of super principal chiral model and obtain different zero-curvature representations of the model. The parametric transformation is related to the super Riccati equations and an infinite set of local and non-local conservation laws is derived. A Lax representation of the model is presented which gives rise to a superspace monodromy operator.
