Title: Brane induced gravity from asymmetric warped compactification
Authors: Kazuya Koyama and Kayoko Koyama
Abstract: We show that brane induced gravity can be realized as a low energy effective theory of brane worlds with asymmetric warped compactification. A self-accelerating universe without cosmological constant on the brane can be realized in a model where one side of the bulk has finite volume, but the other side has infinite volume. The spin-2 perturbations for brane induced gravity and asymmetric warped compactification models have the same spectrum at low energies. For a de Sitter brane, the spin-2 graviton has mass in the range $0<m^2 \leq 2H^2$, with $m^2=2H^2$ in the self-accelerating universe.
