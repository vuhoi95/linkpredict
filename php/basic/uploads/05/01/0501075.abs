Title: Reconstructing Quantum Geometry from Quantum Information: Spin Networks  as Harmonic Oscillators
Authors: Florian Girelli and Etera R. Livine
Abstract: Loop Quantum Gravity defines the quantum states of space geometry as spin networks and describes their evolution in time. We reformulate spin networks in terms of harmonic oscillators and show how the holographic degrees of freedom of the theory are described as matrix models. This allow us to make a link with non-commutative geometry and to look at the issue of the semi-classical limit of LQG from a new perspective. This work is thought as part of a bigger project of describing quantum geometry in quantum information terms.
