Title: Gauged maximal supergravities and hierarchies of nonabelian  vector-tensor systems
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We describe generalizations of the manifestly E_{6(6)} covariant formulation of five-dimensional gauged maximal supergravity with regard to the structure of the vector and tensor fields. We indicate how the group-theoretical structures that we discover seem to play a role in gauged supergravities in various space-time dimensions.
