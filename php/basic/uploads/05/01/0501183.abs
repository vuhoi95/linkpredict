Title: Dynamical radion superfield in 5D action
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We derive 5D N=1 superspace action including the radion superfield. The radion is treated as a dynamical field and identified as a solution of the equation of motion even in the presence of the radius stabilization mechanism. Our derivation is systematic and based on the superconformal formulation of 5D supergravity. We can read off the couplings of the dynamical radion superfield to the matter superfields from our result. The correct radion mass can be obtained by calculating the radion potential from our superspace action.
