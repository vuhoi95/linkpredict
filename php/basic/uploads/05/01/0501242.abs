Abstract: The Hamiltonian approach to cosmological perturbations in general relativity in finite space-time is developed, where a cosmological scale factor is identified with spatial averaging the metric determinant logarithm. This identification preserves the number of variables and leads to a cosmological perturbation theory with the scalar potential perturbations in contrast to the kinetic perturbations in the Lifshitz version which are responsible for the ``primordial power spectrum'' of CMB in the inflationary model. The Hamiltonian approach enables to explain this ``spectrum'' in terms of scale-invariant variables and to consider other topical problem of modern cosmology in the context of quantum cosmological creation of both universes and particles from the stable Bogoliubov vacuum.
