Title: Splitting strings and chains
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Jan Plefka and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We review a study of the semiclassical decay of macroscopic spinning strings in AdS_5 x S^5 as well as its dual gauge theory description. The conservation of the infinite tower of commuting charges in the semiclassical string sigma-model description of the process suggests that the decay channel of maximal probability should preserve integrability in the gauge theory.
