Title: String breaking in QCD: dual superconductor vs. stochastic vacuum model
Authors: D. Antonov and A. Di Giacomo
Abstract: Effects of dispersion of the chromoelectric field of the flux tube on the string-breaking distance are studied. The leading-order correction is shown to slightly diminish the result following from the Schwinger formula. Instead, accounting for corrections of all orders might result, at certain values of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter, in an increase of the string-breaking distance up to one order of magnitude. An alternative formula for this distance is obtained when produced pairs are treated as holes in a confining pellicle, which spans over the contour of an external quark-antiquark pair. Generalizations of the obtained results to the cases of small temperatures, as well as temperatures close to the critical one are also discussed.
