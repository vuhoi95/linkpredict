Title: Absence of pre-classical solutions in Bianchi I loop quantum cosmology
Authors: Daniel Cartin and Gaurav Khanna
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology, the symmetry reduction of quantum geometry for the study of various cosmological situations, leads to a difference equation for its quantum evolution equation. To ensure that solutions of this equation act in the expected classical manner far from singularities, additional restrictions are imposed on the solution. In this paper, we consider the Bianchi I model, both the vacuum case and the addition of a cosmological constant, and show using generating function techniques that only the zero solution satisfies these constraints. This implies either that there are technical difficulties with the current method of quantizing the evolution equation, or else loop quantum gravity imposes strong restrictions on the physically allowed solutions.
