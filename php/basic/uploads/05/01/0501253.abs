Authors: Cristine N. Ferreira and Helder Chavez and Jose A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: In this letter, we reconsider the delicate issue of symmetry and supersymmetry breakings for gauge theories with gauge-field mixings. The purpose is to study generalyzed potentials in the presence of more than a single gauge potential. In this work, following a stream of investigation on supersymmetric gauge theories without flat directions, we contemplate the possibility of building up D- and F-term potentials by means of a gauge-field mixing in connection with a U(1)x U(1)' -symmetry. We investigate a generalized potential including an N=1 supersymmetric extension of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model focusing on the study of cosmic string configurations. This analysis sheds some light on the formation of cosmic strings for model with violation of Lorentz symmetry.
