Title: Fundamental strings in SFT
Authors: L. Bonora and C. Maccaferri and R. J. Scherer Santos and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: In this letter we show that vacuum string field theory contains exact solutions that can be interpreted as macroscopic fundamental strings. They are formed by a condensate of infinitely many completely space-localized solutions (D0-branes).
