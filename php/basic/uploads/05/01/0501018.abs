Title: Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and (Super)Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Petr P. Kulish and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: In this paper we consider the possibility of application of the quantum inverse scattering method for studying the superconformal field theory and it's integrable perturbations. The classical limit of the considered constructions is based on $\hat{osp}(1|2)$ super-KdV hierarchy. The quantum counterpart of the monodromy matrix corresponding to the linear problem associated with the L-operator is introduced. Using the explicit form of the irreducible representations of $\hat{osp}_q(1|2)$, the ``fusion relations'' for the transfer-matrices (i.e. the traces of the monodromy matrices in different representations) are obtained.
