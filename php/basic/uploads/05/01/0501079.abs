Title: Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity in Light-Cone Superspace
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Lars Brink and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: We show that Supergravity in eleven dimensions can be described in terms of a constrained superfield on the light-cone, without the use of auxiliary fields. We build its action to first order in the gravitational coupling constant \kappa, by "oxidizing" (N=8,d=4) Supergravity. This is simply achieved, as for N=4 Yang-Mills, by extending the transverse derivatives into superspace. The eleven-dimensional SuperPoincare algebra is constructed and a fourth order interaction is conjectured.
