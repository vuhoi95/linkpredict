Title: Hessence: A New View of Quintom Dark Energy
Authors: Hao Wei and Rong-Gen Cai and Ding-Fang Zeng
Abstract: Recently a lot of attention has been drawn to build dark energy model in which the equation-of-state parameter $w$ can cross the phantom divide $w=-1$. One of models to realize crossing the phantom divide is called quintom model, in which two real scalar fields appears, one is a normal scalar field and the other is a phantom-type scalar field. In this paper we propose a non-canonical complex scalar field as the dark energy, which we dub ``hessence'', to implement crossing the phantom divide, in a similar sense as the quintom dark energy model. In the hessence model, the dark energy is described by a single field with an internal degree of freedom rather than two independent real scalar fields. However, the hessence is different from an ordinary complex scalar field, we show that the hessence can avoid the difficulty of the Q-balls formation which gives trouble to the spintessence model (An ordinary complex scalar field acts as the dark energy). Furthermore, we find that, by choosing a proper potential, the hessence could correspond to a Chaplygin gas at late times.
