Title: Negative Energy (Dirac-like) Sea for Bosons and Supersymmetry
Authors: Yoshinobu Habara and Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We consider the long standing problem in field theories of bosons that the boson vacuum does not consist of a `sea', unlike the fermion vacuum. We show with the help of supersymmetry considerations that the boson vacuum indeed does also consist of a sea in which the negative energy states are all "filled", analogous to the Dirac sea of the fermion vacuum, and that a hole produced by the annihilation of one negative energy boson is an anti-particle. This might be formally coped with by introducing the notion of a double harmonic oscillator, which is obtained by extending the condition imposed on the wave function. Next, we present an attempt to formulate the supersymmetric and relativistic quantum mechanics utilizing the equations of motion.
