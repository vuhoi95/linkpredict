Title: Recursion Relations for Tree Amplitudes in Super Gauge Theories
Authors: Mingxing Luo and Congkao Wen
Abstract: Using newly proposed BCF/BCFW recursion relations, compact formulas are obtained for tree-level n-gluon amplitudes of helicity structure --++...+. We then make an extension of these recursion relations to include fermions of multi-flavors, from which MHV and \bar{MHV} amplitudes are reproduced. We also calculate non-MHV amplitudes of processes with two fermions and four gluons. Results thus obtained are equivalent to those obtained by extended CSW prescriptions, and those by conventional field theory calculations.
