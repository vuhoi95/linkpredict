Title: On the Couplings of the Rho Meson in AdS/QCD
Authors: Sungho Hong and Sukjin Yoon and Matthew J. Strassler
Abstract: We argue that in generic AdS/QCD models (confining gauge theories dual to string theory on a weakly-curved background), the couplings g_{rho HH} of any rho meson to any hadron H are quasi-universal, lying within a narrow band near m(rho)^2/f(rho). The argument relies upon the fact that the rho is the lowest-lying state created by a conserved current, and the detailed form of the integrals which determine the couplings in AdS/QCD. Quasi-universality holds even when rho-dominance is violated. The argument fails for all other hadrons, except the lowest-lying spin-two hadron created by the energy-momentum tensor. Explicit examples are discussed.
