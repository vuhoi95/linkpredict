Title: Discrete and oscillatory Matrix Models in Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Sebastian de Haro and Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We derive discrete and oscillatory Chern-Simons matrix models. The method is based on fundamental properties of the associated orthogonal polynomials. As an application, we show that the discrete model allows to prove and extend the recently found relationship between Chern-Simons theory and q-deformed 2dYM. In addition, the equivalence of the Chern-Simons matrix models gives a complementary view on the equivalence of effective superpotentials in N=1 gauge theories.
