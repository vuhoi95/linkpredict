Title: The spinorial geometry of supersymmetric IIB backgrounds
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We investigate the Killing spinor equations of IIB supergravity for one Killing spinor. We show that there are three types of orbits of Spin(9,1) in the space of Weyl spinors which give rise to Killing spinors with stability subgroups $Spin(7)\ltimes \bR^8$, $SU(4)\ltimes \bR^8$ and $G_2$. We solve the Killing spinor equations for the $Spin(7)\ltimes \bR^8$ and $SU(4)\ltimes \bR^8$ invariant spinors, give the fluxes in terms of the geometry and determine the conditions on the spacetime geometry imposed by supersymmetry. In both cases, the spacetime admits a null, self-parallel, Killing vector field. We also apply our formalism to examine a class of $SU(4)\ltimes \bR^8$ backgrounds which admit one and two pure spinors as Killing spinors and investigate the geometry of the spacetimes.
