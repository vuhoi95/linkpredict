Title: Holographic energy density in the Brans-Dicke teory
Authors: Hungsoo Kim and H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We study cosmological applications of the holographic energy density. Considering the holographic energy density as a dynamical cosmological constant, we need the Brans-Dicke theory as a dynamical framework instead of general relativity. In this case we use the Bianchi identity as a consistency relation to obtain physical solutions. It is shown that the future event horizon as the IR cutoff provides the dark energy in the Brans-Dicke theory. Furthermore the role of the Brans-Dicke scalar is clarified in the dark energy-dominated universe by calculating its equation of state.
