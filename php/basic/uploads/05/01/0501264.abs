Title: Orbifold Unification for the Gauge and Higgs Fields and Their Couplings
Authors: Ilia Gogoladze and Tianjun Li and Yukihiro Mimura and S. Nandi
Abstract: We present an orbifold GUT model in which the NMSSM Higgs trilinear couplings are unified with the three Standard Model gauge couplings. The model is constructed as an N=2 supersymmetric SU(8) gauge theory in six dimensions, which is reduced to the NMSSM with extra U(1) factors upon compactification. Such an unification is in good agreement with experiments. The predicted upper limit for the lightest CP-even neutral Higgs boson is somewhat larger than in the MSSM, and can be tested in the upcoming Large Hadron Collider.
