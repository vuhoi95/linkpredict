Title: One-dimensional model of a quantum nonlinear harmonic oscillator
Authors: J. F. Cariñena and M. F. Rañada and M. Santander
Abstract: In this paper we study the quantization of the nonlinear oscillator introduced by Mathews and Lakshmanan. This system with position-dependent mass allows a natural quantization procedure and is shown to display shape invariance. Its energy spectrum is found by factorization. The linear harmonic oscillator appears as the $\lambda\to 0$ limit of this nonlinear oscillator, whose energy spectrum and eigenfunctions are compared to the linear ones.
