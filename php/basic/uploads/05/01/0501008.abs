Abstract: In this paper, we consider solutions and spectral functions of M-theory from Milne spaces with extra free dimensions. Conformal deformations to the metric associated with the real hyperbolic space forms are derived. For the three-dimensional case, the orbifold identifications $SL(2,{\mathbb Z}+i{\mathbb Z})/\{\pm Id\}$, where $Id$ is the identity matrix, is analyzed in detail. The spectrum of a eleven-dimensional field theory can be obtained with the help of the theory of harmonic functions in the fundamental domain of this group and it is associated with the cusp forms and the Eisenstein series. The supersymmetry surviving for supergravity solutions involving real hyperbolic space factors is briefly discussed.
