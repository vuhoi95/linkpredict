Title: Brane Inflation and Cosmic String Tension in Superstring Theory
Authors: Hassan Firouzjahi and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: In a simple reanalysis of the KKLMMT scenario, we argue that the slow roll condition in the D3-anti-D3-brane inflationary scenario in superstring theory requires no more than a moderate tuning. The cosmic string tension is very sensitive to the conformal coupling: with less fine-tuning, the cosmic string tension (as well as the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbation mode) increases rapidly and can easily saturate the present observational bound. In a multi-throat brane inflationary scenario, this feature substantially improves the chance of detecting and measuring the properties of the cosmic strings as a window to the superstring theory and our pre-inflationary universe.
