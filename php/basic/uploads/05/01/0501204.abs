Title: Accidental Goldstone Bosons
Authors: Kenneth Lane and Adam Martin
Abstract: We study vacuum alignment in theories in which the chiral symmetry of a set of massless fermions is both spontaneously and explicitly broken. We find that transitions occur between different phases of the fermions' CP symmetry as parameters in their symmetry breaking Hamiltonian are varied. We identify a new phase that we call pseudoCP-conserving. We observe first and second-order transitions between the various phases. At a second-order (and possibly first-order) transition a pseudoGoldstone boson becomes massless as a consequence of a spontaneous change in the discrete, but not the continuous, symmetry of the ground state. We relate the masslessness of these ``accidental Goldstone bosons'' (AGBs) bosons to singularities of the order parameter for the phase transition. The relative frequency of CP-phase transitions makes it commonplace for the AGBs to be light, much lighter than their underlying strong interaction scale. We investigate the AGBs' potential for serving as light composite Higgs bosons by studying their vacuum expectation values, finding promising results: AGB vevs are also often much less than their strong scale.
