Title: All Higher Genus BPS Membranes in the Plane Wave Background
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We consider supermembranes in the maximally supersymmetric plane wave geometry of the eleven dimensions and construct complete solutions of the continuum version of the 1/4 BPS equations. The supermembranes may have an arbitrary number of holes and arbitrary cross sectional shapes. In the matrix regularized version, we solve the matrix equations for several simple cases including fuzzy torus. In addition, we show that these solutions are trivially generalized to 1/8 and 1/16 BPS configuations.
