Abstract: Within the context of the E_8 x E_8 heterotic superstring compactified on a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold with an SU(4) gauge instanton, we show the existence of simple, realistic N=1 supersymmetric vacua that are compatible with low energy particle physics. The observable sector of these vacua has gauge group SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y x U(1)_{B-L}, three families of quarks and leptons, each with an additional right-handed neutrino, two Higgs-Higgs conjugate pairs, a small number of uncharged moduli and no exotic matter. The hidden sector contains non-Abelian gauge fields and moduli. In the strong coupling case there is no exotic matter, whereas for weak coupling there are a small number of additional matter multiplets in the hidden sector. The construction exploits a mechanism for ``splitting'' multiplets. The minimal nature and rarity of these vacua suggest the possible theoretical and experimental relevance of spontaneously broken U(1)_{B-L} gauge symmetry and two Higgs-Higgs conjugate pairs. The U(1)_{B-L} symmetry helps to naturally suppress the rate of nucleon decay.
