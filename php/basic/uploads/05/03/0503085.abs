Title: Finding the Standard Model of Particle Physics, A Combinatorial Problem
Authors: Jan-H. Jureit and Christoph A. Stephan
Abstract: We present a combinatorial problem which consists in finding irreducible Krajewski diagrams from finite geometries. This problem boils down to placing arrows into a quadratic array with some additional constrains. The Krajewski diagrams play a central role in the description of finite noncommutative geometries. They allow to localise the standard model of particle physics within the set of all Yang-Mills-Higgs models.
