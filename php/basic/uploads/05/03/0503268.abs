Title: A Single Scalar Field Model of Dark Energy with Equation of State  Crossing -1
Authors: Mingzhe Li and Bo Feng and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: In this paper we study the possibility of building models of dark energy with equation of state across -1 and propose explicitly a model with a single scalar field which gives rise to an equation of state larger than -1 in the past and less than -1 at the present time, consistent with the current observations.
