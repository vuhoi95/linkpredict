Title: Entangled state representations in noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: S. C. Jing and Q. Y. Liu and H. Y. Fan
Abstract: We introduce new representations to formulate quantum mechanics on noncommutative coordinate space, which explicitly display entanglement properties between degrees of freedom of different coordinate components and hence could be called entangled state representations. Furthermore, we derive unitary transformations between the new representations and the ordinary one used in noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM) and obtain eigenfunctions of some basic operators in these representations. To show the potential applications of the entangled state representations, a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator on the noncommutative plane with both coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings is exactly solved.
