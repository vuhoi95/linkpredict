Title: Duality and confinement in D=3 models driven by condensation of  topological defects
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We study the interplay of duality and confinement in certain three-dimensional models induced by the condensation of topological defects. To this end we check for the confinement phenomenon, in both sides of the duality, using the static quantum potential within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. Our calculations show that the interaction energy contains a linear term leading to the confinement of static probe charges.
