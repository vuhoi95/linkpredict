Title: On the Chemical Potential of D-instantons in c=0 Noncritical String  Theory
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Atsushi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We study the chemical potential of D-instantons in c=0 noncritical string theory. In a recent work(hep-th/0405076), it was shown that the chemical potential can be calculated using the one matrix model. The calculation was done using the method of orthogonal polynomials and the authors obtained a universal value in the double scaling limit. We present an alternative method to calculate this value.
