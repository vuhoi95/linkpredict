Title: A black hole mass threshold from non-singular quantum gravitational  collapse
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Rituparno Goswami and Roy Maartens and Parampreet Singh
Abstract: Quantum gravity is expected to remove the classical singularity that arises as the end-state of gravitational collapse. To investigate this, we work with a toy model of a collapsing homogeneous scalar field. We show that non-perturbative semi-classical effects of Loop Quantum Gravity cause a bounce and remove the black hole singularity. Furthermore, we find a critical threshold scale, below which no horizon forms -- quantum gravity may exclude very small astrophysical black holes.
