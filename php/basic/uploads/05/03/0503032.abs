Title: Semiclassical Geometry of 4D Reduced Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Integrals
Authors: Zdzislaw Burda and Bengt Petersson and Marc Wattenberg
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical properties of space-time geometry of the low energy limit of reduced four dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills integrals using Monte-Carlo simulations. The limit is obtained by an one-loop approximation of the original Yang-Mills integrals leading to an effective model of branched polymers. We numerically determine the behaviour of the gyration radius, the two-point correlation function and the Polyakov-line operator in the effective model and discuss the results in the context of the large-distance behaviour of the original matrix model.
