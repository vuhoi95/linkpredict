Title: Dissipation of quantum information near the event horizon of  Schwarzschild black holes
Authors: D. Ahn and S. W. Hwang
Abstract: We found that the Wigner rotation of a particle with spin 1/2, which is unitary in Minkowski spacetime, becomes non-unitary as the particle is falling onto the black hole. This implies that, from the quantum information processing point of view, any quantum information encoded in spins will be dissipated near the black hole. The gravitational field around the black hole thus acts like a dissipative quantum channel, especially the bit flip channel.
