Title: A new (in)finite dimensional algebra for quantum integrable models
Authors: P. Baseilhac and K. Koizumi
Abstract: A new (in)finite dimensional algebra which is a fundamental dynamical symmetry of a large class of (continuum or lattice) quantum integrable models is introduced and studied in details. Finite dimensional representations are constructed and mutually commuting quantities - which ensure the integrability of the system - are written in terms of the fundamental generators of the new algebra. Relation with the deformed Dolan-Grady integrable structure recently discovered by one of the authors and Terwilliger's tridiagonal algebras is described. Remarkably, this (in)finite dimensional algebra is a ``$q-$deformed'' analogue of the original Onsager's algebra arising in the planar Ising model. Consequently, it provides a new and alternative algebraic framework for studying massive, as well as conformal, quantum integrable models.
