Title: Factorization and Unitarity in Superstring Theory
Authors: Zhi-Guang Xiao and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: The overall coefficient of the two-loop 4-particle amplitude in superstring theory is determined by making use of the factorization and unitarity. To accomplish this we computed in detail all the relevant tree and one-loop amplitudes involved and determined their overall coefficients in a consistent way.
