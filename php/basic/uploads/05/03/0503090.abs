Title: Stress tensor for extreme 2D dilatonic Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
Authors: Serena Fagnocchi and Sara Farese
Abstract: We calculate the expectation value of the stress energy tensor for a massless dilaton-coupled 2D scalar field propagating on an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole formed by the collapse of a timelike shell, showing its regularity on the horizon.
