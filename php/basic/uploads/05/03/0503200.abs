Title: Complete Spectrum of Long Operators in N=4 SYM at One Loop
Authors: N. Beisert and V. A. Kazakov and K. Sakai and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We construct the complete spectral curve for an arbitrary local operator, including fermions and covariant derivatives, of one-loop N=4 gauge theory in the thermodynamic limit. This curve perfectly reproduces the Frolov-Tseytlin limit of the full spectral curve of classical strings on AdS_5xS^5 derived in hep-th/0502226. To complete the comparison we introduce stacks, novel bound states of roots of different flavors which arise in the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations. We furthermore show the equivalence of various types of Bethe equations for the underlying su(2,2|4) superalgebra, in particular of the type "Beauty" and "Beast".
