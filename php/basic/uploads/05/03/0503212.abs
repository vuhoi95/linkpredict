Title: On the Electric Charge Quantization from the Dirac-Aharonov-Bohm  Potential
Authors: F. A. Barone and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show that, under certain restrictions, we can take a Dirac-Aharonov-Bohm potential as a pure gauge field. We argue that a modified quantization condition comes out for the electric charge that may open up the way for the understanding of fractional charges. One does not need any longer to rely on the existence of a magnetic monopole to justify electric charge quantization.
