Title: On nonanticommutative N=2 sigma-models in two dimensions
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We study nonanticommutative deformations of N=2 two-dimensional Euclidean sigma models. We find that these theories are described by simple deformations of Zumino's Lagrangian and the holomorphic superpotential. Geometrically, this deformation can be interpreted as a fuzziness in target space controlled by the vacuum expectation value of the auxiliary field. In the case of nonanticommutative deformations preserving Euclidean invariance, we find that a continuation of the deformed supersymmetry algebra to Lorentzian signature leads to a rather intriguing central extension of the ordinary (2,2) superalgebra.
