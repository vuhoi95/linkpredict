Abstract: We employ the light-cone superspace formalism to develop an efficient approach to constructing superconformal operators of twist two in Yang-Mills theories with N=1,2,4 supercharges. These operators have an autonomous scale dependence to one-loop order and determine the eigenfunctions of the dilatation operator in the underlying gauge theory. We demonstrate that for arbitrary N the superconformal operators are given by remarkably simple, universal expressions involving the light-cone superfields. When written in components field, they coincide with the known results obtained by conventional techniques.
