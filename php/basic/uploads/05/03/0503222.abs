Title: Toda systems in closed string tachyon condensation
Authors: Sunggeun Lee and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider $tt^*$ equations appearing in the study of localized tachyon condensations. They are described by various Toda system when we consider the condensation by the lowest tachyon corresponding to the monomial $xy$. The tachyon potential is calculated as a solution to these equations. The Toda system appearing in the deformation of $\C^2/\Z_n$ by $xy$ is identical to that of $D_n$ singularity deformed by $x$. For $\C^3/\Z_n$ with $xyz$ deformation, we find only generic non-simple form, similar to the case appearing in $\C/\Z_5\to \C/\Z_3$ and we discuss the difficulties in these cases.
