Title: Lepton masses and mixing angles from heterotic orbifold models
Authors: Pyungwon Ko and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Jae-hyeon Park
Abstract: We systematically study the possibility for realizing realistic values of lepton mass ratios and mixing angles by using only renormalizable Yukawa couplings derived from heterotic $Z_6$-I orbifold. We assume one pair of up and down sector Higgs fields. We consider both the Dirac neutrino mass scenario and the seesaw scenario with degenerate right-handed majorana neutrino masses. It is found that realistic values of the charged lepton mass ratios, $m_e/m_\tau$ and $m_\mu/m_\tau$, the neutrino mass squared difference ratio, $\Delta m^2_{31}/\Delta m^2_{21}$, and the lepton mixing angles can be obtained in certain cases.
