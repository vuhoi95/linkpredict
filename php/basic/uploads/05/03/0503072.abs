Title: Conformally symmetric vacuum solutions of the gravitational field  equations in the brane-world models
Authors: T. Harko and M. K. Mak
Abstract: A class of exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in the vacuum on the brane are obtained by assuming the existence of a conformal Killing vector field, with non-static and non-central symmetry. In this case the general solution of the field equations can be obtained in a parametric form in terms of the Bessel functions. The behavior of the basic physical parameters describing the non-local effects generated by the gravitational field of the bulk (dark radiation and dark pressure) is also considered in detail, and the equation of state satisfied at infinity by these quantities is derived. As a physical application of the obtained solutions we consider the behavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable circular orbit. The tangential velocity of the particle is a monotonically increasing function of the radial distance and, in the limit of large values of the radial coordinate, tends to a constant value, which is independent on the parameters describing the model. Therefore a brane geometry admitting a one-parameter group of conformal motions may provide an explanation for the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic center, which is usually explained by postulating the existence of the dark matter.
