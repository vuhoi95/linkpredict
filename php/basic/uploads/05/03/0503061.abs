Title: Classification and a toolbox for orientifold models
Authors: P. Anastasopoulos and A. B. Hammou
Abstract: We provide the general tadpole conditions for a class of supersymmetric orientifold models by studing the general properties of the elements included in the orientifold group. In this talk, we concentrate on orientifold models of the type $T^6/Z_M\times Z_N$.
