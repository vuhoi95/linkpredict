Title: Conformally coupled scalar solitons and black holes with negative  cosmological constant
Authors: Eugen Radu and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of both globally regular and black hole solutions of the Einstein equations with a conformally coupled scalar field, in the presence of a negative cosmological constant, for space-time dimensions greater than or equal to four. These configurations approach asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime and are indexed by the central value of the scalar field. We also study the stability of these solutions, and show that, at least for all the solutions studied numerically, they are linearly stable.
