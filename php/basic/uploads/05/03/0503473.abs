Title: Braneworld black holes in cosmology and astrophysics
Authors: A. S. Majumdar and N. Mukherjee
Abstract: The braneworld description of our universe entails a large extra dimension and a fundamental scale of gravity that might be lower by several orders of magnitude compared to the Planck scale. An interesting consequence of the braneworld scenario is in the nature of spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the brane gravitational field equations which could represent black holes with properties quite distinct compared to ordinary black holes in 4-dimensions. We discuss certain key features of some braneworld black hole geometries. Such black holes are likely to have diverse cosmological and astrophysical ramifications. The cosmological evolution of primordial braneworld black holes is described highlighting their longevity due to modified evaporation and effective accretion of radiation during the early braneworld high energy era. Observational abundance of various evaporation products of the black holes at different eras impose constraints on their initial mass fraction. Surviving primordial black holes could be candidates of dark matter present in galactic haloes. We discuss gravitational lensing by braneworld black holes. Observables related to the relativistic images of strong field gravitational lensing could in principle be used to distinguish between different braneworld black hole metrics in future observations.
