Abstract: We investigate the critical behaviour of the $N$-component Euclidean $\lambda \phi^4$ model at leading order in $\frac{1}{N}$-expansion. We consider it in three situations: confined between two parallel planes a distance $L$ apart from one another, confined to an infinitely long cylinder having a square cross-section of area $A$ and to a cubic box of volume $V$. Taking the mass term in the form $m_{0}^2=\alpha(T - T_{0})$, we retrieve Ginzburg-Landau models which are supposed to describe samples of a material undergoing a phase transition, respectively in the form of a film, a wire and of a grain, whose bulk transition temperature ($T_{0}$) is known. We obtain equations for the critical temperature as functions of $L$ (film), $A$ (wire), $V$ (grain) and of $T_{0}$, and determine the limiting sizes sustaining the transition.
