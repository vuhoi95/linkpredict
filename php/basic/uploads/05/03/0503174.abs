Title: Universal properties of conformal quantum many-body systems
Authors: S. Meljanac and A. Samsarov
Abstract: Universal properties of many-body systems in conformal quantum mechanics in arbitrary dimensions are presented. Specially, a general structure of discrete energy spectra and eigenstates is found. Finally, a simple construction of a universal time operator conjugated to a conformal Hermitian or a $ PT-$ invariant Hamiltonian is proposed.
