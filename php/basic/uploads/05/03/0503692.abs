Title: Primordial non-gaussianities in single field inflation
Authors: David Seery and James E. Lidsey
Abstract: We calculate the three-point function for primordial scalar fluctuations in a single field inflationary scenario where the scalar field Lagrangian is a completely general function of the field and its first derivative. We obtain an explicit expression for the three-point correlation function in a self-consistent approximation scheme where the expansion rate varies slowly, analogous to the slow-roll limit in standard, single-field inflation. The three-point function can be written in terms of the familiar slow-roll parameters and three new parameters which measure the non-trivial kinetic structure of the scalar field, the departure of the sound speed from the speed of light, and the rate of change of the sound speed.
