Title: A Euclidean Lattice Construction of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories  with Sixteen Supercharges
Authors: David B. Kaplan and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: We formulate supersymmetric Euclidean spacetime Ad* lattices whose classical continuum limits are U(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges in d=1,2,3 and 4 dimensions. This family includes the especially interesting N=4 supersymmetry in four dimensions, as well as a Euclidean path integral formulation of Matrix Theory on a one dimensional lattice.
