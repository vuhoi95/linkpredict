Title: Noncompact KK theory of gravity: stochastic treatment for a  nonperturbative inflaton field in a de Sitter expansion
Authors: Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We study a stochastic formalism for a nonperturbative treatment of the inflaton field in the framework of a noncompact Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory during an inflationary (de Sitter) expansion, without the slow-roll approximation.
