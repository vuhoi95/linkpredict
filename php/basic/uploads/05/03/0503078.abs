Title: On The Bound States Of Photons In Noncommutative Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Amir H. Fatollahi and Abolfazl Jafari
Abstract: We consider the possibility that photons of noncommutative QED can make bound states. Using the potential model, developed based on the constituent gluon picture of QCD glue-balls, arguments are presented in favor of existence of these bound states. The basic ingredient of potential model is that the self-interacting massless gauge particles may get mass by inclusion non-perturbative effects.
