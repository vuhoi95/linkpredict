Title: Hamiltonian Noether theorem for gauge systems and two time physics
Authors: V. M. Villanueva and J. A. Nieto and L. Ruiz and J. Silvas
Abstract: The Noether theorem for Hamiltonian constrained systems is revisited. In particular, our review presents a novel method to show that the gauge transformations are generated by the conserved quantities associated with the first class constraints. We apply our results to the relativistic point particle, to the Friedberg et al. model and, with special emphasis, to two time physics.
