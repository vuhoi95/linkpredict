Title: Renormalization of Supersymmetric Gauge Theories on Orbifolds: Brane  Gauge Couplings and Higher Derivative Operators
Authors: Stefan Groot Nibbelink and Mark Hillenbach
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to hyper multiplets on five and six dimensional orbifolds and determine the bulk and local fixed point renormalizations of the gauge couplings. We infer from a component analysis that the hyper multiplet does not induce renormalization of the brane gauge couplings on the five dimensional orbifold S^1/Z_2. This is not due to supersymmetry, since the bosonic and fermionic contributions cancel separately. We extend this investigation to T^2/Z_N orbifolds using supergraph techniques in six dimensions. On general Z_N orbifolds the gauge couplings do renormalize at the fixed points, except for the Z_2 fixed points of an even ordered orbifold. To cancel the bulk one-loop divergences a dimension six higher derivative operator is needed, in addition to the standard bulk gauge kinetic term.
