Title: Rotating black holes at future colliders II: Anisotropic scalar field  emission
Authors: Daisuke Ida and Kin-ya Oda and Seong Chan Park
Abstract: This is the sequel to the first paper of the series, where we have discussed the Hawking radiation from five-dimensional rotating black holes for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 brane fields in the low frequency regime. We consider the emission of a brane localized scalar field from rotating black holes in general space-time dimensions without relying on the low frequency expansions.
