Title: Probing the 5th Dimension with the QCD String
Authors: Richard C. Brower and Chung-I Tan and Ethan Thompson
Abstract: A salient feature of String/Gauge duality is an extra 5th dimension. Here we study the effect of confining deformations of AdS5 and compute the spectrum of a string stretched between infinitely massive quarks and compare it with the quantum states of the QCD flux as determined by Kuti, Juge and Morningstar in lattice simulations. In the long flux tube limit the AdS string probes the metric near the IR cutoff of the 5th dimension with a spectrum approximated by a Nambu-Goto string in 4-d flat space, whereas at short distance the string moves to the UV region with a discrete spectrum for pure AdS5. We also review earlier results on glueballs states and the cross-over between hard and soft diffractive scattering that support this picture.
