Abstract: We study in this paper the possible influence of the dark energy on the detection of the dark matter particles. In models of dark energy described by a dynamical scalar field such as the Quintessence, its interaction with the dark matter will cause the dark matter particles such as the neutralino vary as a function of space and time. Given a specific model of the Quintessence and its interaction in this paper we calculate numerically the corrections to the neutralino masses and the induced spectrum of the neutrinos from the annihilation of the neutralinos pairs in the core of the Sun. This study gives rise to a possibility of probing for dark energy in the experiments of detecting the dark matter particles.
