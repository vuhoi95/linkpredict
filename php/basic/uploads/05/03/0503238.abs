Title: The O(N) model on a squashed S^3 and the Klebanov-Polyakov  correspondence
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and S. Prem Kumar
Abstract: We solve the O(N) vector model at large N on a squashed three-sphere with a conformal mass term. Using the Klebanov-Polyakov version of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence we match various aspects of the strongly coupled theory with the physics of the bulk AdS Taub-NUT and AdS Taub-Bolt geometries. Remarkably, we find that the field theory reproduces the behaviour of the bulk free energy as a function of the squashing parameter. The O(N) model is realised in a symmetric phase for all finite values of the coupling and squashing parameter, including when the boundary scalar curvature is negative.
