Title: On decoherence in noncommutative plane with perpendicular magnetic field
Authors: B. Dragovich and M. Dugic
Abstract: In the last years noncommutative quantum mechanics has been investigated intensively. We consider the influence of magnetic field on decoherence of a system in the noncommutative quantum plane. Particularly, we point out a model in which the magnetic field allows {\it in situ} dynamical control of decoherence as well as, in principle, observation of noncommutativity.
