Title: Extracting New Physics from the CMB
Authors: B. Greene and K. Schalm and G. Shiu and J. P. van der Schaar
Abstract: We review how initial state effects generically yield an oscillatory component in the primordial power spectrum of inflationary density perturbations. These oscillatory corrections parametrize unknown new physics at a scale $M$ and are potentially observable if the ratio $H_{infl}/M$ is sufficiently large. We clarify to what extent present and future CMB data analysis can distinguish between the different proposals for initial state corrections.
