Title: Instanton constraints in supersymmetric gauge theories I. Supersymmetric  QCD
Authors: P. M. Glerfoss and J. Hylsberg and N. K. Nielsen
Abstract: A previous analysis of possible constraints of Yang-Mills instantons in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is extended to supersymmetric QCD. It is again found that a constraint is necessary for the gauge field in second and fourth order of the gauge breaking parameter v. While the supersymmetric zero mode is well behaved to all orders, the lifted superconformal and quark zero modes show nonpermissible behaviour, but only at first order in v.
