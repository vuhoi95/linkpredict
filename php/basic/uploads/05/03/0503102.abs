Title: Deformed black strings in 5-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We construct the first examples of deformed non-abelian black strings in a 5-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills model. Assuming all fields to be independent of the extra coordinate, we construct deformed black strings, which in the 4-dimensional picture correspond to axially symmetric non-abelian black holes in gravity-dilaton theory. These solutions thus have deformed S^2 x R horizon topology. We study fundamental properties of the black strings and find that for all choices of the gravitational coupling two branches of solutions exist. The limiting behaviour of the second branch of solutions however depends strongly on the choice of the gravitational coupling.
