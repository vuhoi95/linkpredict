Title: Numerical Solutions of Inflating Higher Dimensional Global Defects
Authors: Satsuki Shimono and Takeshi Chiba
Abstract: We find numerical solutions of Einstein equations and scalar field equation for a global defect in higher dimensional spacetimes ($\geq 6$). We examine in detail the relation among the expansion rate $H$ and the symmetry-breaking scale $\eta$ and the number of extra dimensions $n$ for these solutions. We find that even if the extra dimensions do not have a cigar geometry, the expansion rate $H$ grows as $\eta$ increases, which is opposite to what is needed for the recently proposed mechanism for solving the cosmological constant problem. We also find that the expansion rate $H$ decreases as $n$ increases.
