Title: Hint for Quintessence-like Scalars from Holographic Dark Energy
Authors: B. Guberina and R. Horvat and H. Stefancic
Abstract: We use the generalized holographic dark energy model, in which both the cosmological constant (CC) and Newton's constant G_N are scale-dependent, to set constraints on the renormalization-group (RG) evolution of both quantities phrased within quantum field theory (QFT) in a curved background. Considering the case in which the energy-momentum tensor of ordinary matter stays individually conserved, we show from the holographic dark energy requirement that the RG laws for the CC and G_N are completely determined in terms of the lowest part of the particle spectrum of an underlying QFT. From simple arguments one can then infer that the lowest-mass fields should have a Compton wavelength comparable with the size of the current Hubble horizon. Hence, although the models with the variable CC (or with both the CC and the G_N varying) are known tolead to successful cosmologies without introducing a new light degree of freedom, we nonetheless find that holography actually brings us back to the quintessence proposal. An advantage of having two different components of the vacuum energy in the cosmological setting is also briefly mentioned.
