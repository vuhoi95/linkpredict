Title: The Analogue of the Dedekind Eta Function for CY Manifolds I
Authors: Jamey Bass and Andrey Todorov
Abstract: This is the first of a series of articles in which we are going to study the regularized determinants of the Laplacians of Calabi Yau metrics acting on (0,q) forms on the moduli space of CY manifolds with a fixed polarization. It is well known that in case of the elliptic curves the Kronecker limit formula gives an explicit formula for the regularized determinants of the flat metrics with fixed volume on the elliptic curves. The following formula holds in this case; the regularized determinant is the product of the imaginary part of the complex number in the Siegel upper half plane with the Dedekind eta function. It is well known fact that the Dedekind eta function in power 24 is a cusp automorphic form of weight 12 related to the discriminant of the elliptic curve. Thus we can view that the regularized determinant is the norm of a section of some power of the line bundle of the classes of cohomologies of (1,0) forms of the elliptic curves over its moduli space. Our purpose is to generalize this fact in the case of CY manifolds. In this paper we will establish the local analogue of the Kronecker limit formula for CY manifolds.
