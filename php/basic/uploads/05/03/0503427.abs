Title: Born-Infeld Phantom Gravastars
Authors: Neven Bilic and Gary B. Tupper and Raoul D. Viollier
Abstract: We construct new gravitational vacuum star solutions with a Born-Infeld phantom replacing the de Sitter interior. The model allows for a wide range of masses and radii required by phenomenology, and can be motivated from low energy string theory.
