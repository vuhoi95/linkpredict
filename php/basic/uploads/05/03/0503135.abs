Title: A New Approach to Canonical Quantization of the Radiation Damping
Authors: A. C. R. Mendes and C. Neves and W. Oliveira and F. I. Takakura
Abstract: Inspired in some works about quantization of dissipative systems, in particular of the damped harmonic oscillator\cite{MB,RB,12}, we consider the dissipative system of a charge interacting with its own radiation, which originates the radiation damping (RD). Using the indirect Lagrangian representation we obtained a Lagrangian formalism with a Chern-Simons-like term. A Hamiltonian analysis is also done, what leads to the quantization of the system.
