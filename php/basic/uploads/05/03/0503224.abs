Authors: Takeo Araki and Katsushi Ito and Akihisa Ohtsuka
Abstract: We study a reduction of deformation parameters in non(anti)commutative N=2 harmonic superspace to those in non(anti)commutative N=1 superspace. By this reduction we obtain the exact gauge and supersymmetry transformations in the Wess-Zumino gauge of non(anti)commutative N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory defined in the deformed harmonic superspace. We also find that the action with the first order correction in the deformation parameter reduces to the one in the N=1 superspace by some field redefinition. We construct deformed N=(1,1/2) supersymmetry in N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in non(anti)commutative N=1 superspace.
