Title: Solitons of Sigma Model on Noncommutative Space as Solitons of Electron  System
Authors: H. Otsu and T. Sato and H. Ikemori and S. Kitakado
Abstract: We study the relationship of soliton solutions for electron system with those of the sigma model on the noncommutative space, working directly in the operator formalism. We find that some soliton solutions of the sigma model are also the solitons of the electron system and are classified by the same topological numbers.
