Title: Scaling of Multi-Tension Cosmic Superstring Networks
Authors: S. -H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman and Mark Wyman
Abstract: Brane inflation in superstring theory ends when branes collide, initiating the hot big bang. Cosmic superstrings are produced during the brane collision. The cosmic superstrings produced in a D3-brane-antibrane inflationary scenario have a spectrum: $(p,q)$ bound states of $p$ fundamental (F) strings and $q$ D-strings, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime. By extending the velocity-dependent one-scale network evolution equations for abelian Higgs cosmic strings to allow a spectrum of string tensions, we construct a coupled (infinite) set of equations for strings that interact through binding and self-interactions. We apply this model to a network of $(p,q)$ superstrings. Our numerical solutions show that $(p,q)$ networks rapidly approach a stable scaling solution. We also extract the relative densities of each string type from our solutions. Typically, only a small number of the lowest tension states are populated substantially once scaling is reached. The model we study also has an interesting new feature: the energy released in $(p,q)$ string binding is by itself adequate to allow the network to reach scaling. This result suggests that the scaling solution is robust. To demonstrate that this result is not trivial, we show that choosing a different form for string interactions can lead to network frustration.
