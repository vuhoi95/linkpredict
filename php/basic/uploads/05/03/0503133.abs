Title: Thermodynamic limit and semi--intensive quantities
Authors: J. Cleymans and K. Redlich and L. Turko
Abstract: The properties of statistical ensembles with abelian charges close to the thermodynamic limit are discussed. The finite volume corrections to the probability distributions and particle density moments are calculated. Results are obtained for statistical ensembles with both exact and average charge conservation. A new class of variables (semi--intensive variables) which differ in the thermodynamic limit depending on how charge conservation is implemented in the system is introduced. The thermodynamic limit behavior of these variables is calculated through the next to leading order finite volume corrections to the corresponding probability density distributions.
