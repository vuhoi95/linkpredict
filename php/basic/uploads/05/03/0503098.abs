Title: Extending the Picard-Fuchs system of local mirror symmetry
Authors: Brian Forbes and Masao Jinzenji
Abstract: We propose an extended set of differential operators for local mirror symmetry. If $X$ is Calabi-Yau such that $\dim H_4(X,\Z)=0$, then we show that our operators fully describe mirror symmetry. In the process, a conjecture for intersection theory for such $X$ is uncovered. We also find new operators on several examples of type $X=K_S$ through similar techniques. In addition, open string PF systems are considered.
