Title: Inhomogeneous models of interacting dark matter and dark energy
Authors: Roberto A Sussman and Israel Quiros and Osmel Martin Gonzalez
Abstract: We derive and analyze a class of spherically symmetric cosmological models whose source is an interactive mixture of inhomogeneous cold dark matter (DM) and a generic homogeneous dark energy (DE) fluid. If the DE fluid corresponds to a quintessense scalar field, the interaction term can be associated with a well motivated non--minimal coupling to the DM component. By constructing a suitable volume average of the DM component we obtain a Friedman evolution equation relating this average density with an average Hubble scalar, with the DE component playing the role of a repulsive and time-dependent $\Lambda$ term. Once we select an ``equation of state'' linking the energy density ($\mu$) and pressure ($p$) of the DE fluid, as well as a free function governing the radial dependence, the models become fully determinate and can be applied to known specific DE sources, such as quintessense scalar fields or tachyonic fluids. Considering the simple equation of state $p= (\gamma-1) \mu$ with $0\leq\gamma <2/3$, we show that the free parameters and boundary conditions can be selected for an adequate description of a local DM overdensity evolving in a suitable cosmic background that accurately fits current observational data. While a DE dominated scenario emerges in the asymptotic future, with total $\Omega$ and $q$ tending respectively to 1 and -1/2 for all cosmic observers, the effects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy yield different local behavior and evolution rates for these parameters in the local overdense region. We suggest that the models presented can be directly applied to explore the effects of various DE formalisms on local DM cosmological inhomogeneities.
