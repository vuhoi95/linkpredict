Title: Effective Actions for Massive Kaluza-Klein States on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We construct the effective supergravity actions for the lowest massive Kaluza-Klein states on the supersymmetric background AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3. In particular, we describe the coupling of the supergravity multiplet to the lowest massive spin-3/2 multiplet which contains 256 physical degrees of freedom and includes the moduli of the theory. The effective theory is realized as the broken phase of a particular gauging of the maximal three-dimensional supergravity with gauge group SO(4) x SO(4). Its ground state breaks half of the supersymmetries leading to 8 massive gravitinos acquiring mass in a super Higgs effect. The holographic boundary theory realizes the large N=(4,4) superconformal symmetry.
