Title: Non-locality requires fine tuning and multi-degenerate vacua
Authors: D. L. Bennett and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: Our Multiple Point Principle (MPP) states that the realized values for e.g. the parameters of the standard model correspond to having a maximally degenerate vacuum. In the original appearence of MPP the gauge coupling values were predicted to within experimental uncertainties. A mechanism for fine-tuning follows in a natural way from the MPP. Using the cosmological constant as a example, we attempt to justify the assertion that at least a mild form of non-locality is inherent to fine-tuning. This mild form - namely an interaction between pairs of spacetime points that is identical for all pairs regardless of spacetime separation - is insured by requiring non-local action contributions to be reparametrization invariant. However, even this form of non-locality potentially harbours time-machine-like paradoxes. These are seemingly avoided by the MPP fine-tuning mechanism. A (favorable)comparison of the results of MPP in the original lattice gauge theory context with a new implementation with monopoles that uses MPP at the transition to a monopole condensate phase is also described.
