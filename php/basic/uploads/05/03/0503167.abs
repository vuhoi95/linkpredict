Title: Split supersymmetry and the role of a light fermion in a  supergravity-based scenario
Authors: Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We investigate split supersymmetry (SUSY) within a supergravity framework, where local SUSY is broken by the F-term of a hidden sector chiral superfield X. With reasonably general assumptions, we show that the fermionic component of X will always have mass within a Tev. Though its coupling to the observable sector superfields is highly suppressed in Tev scale SUSY, we show that it can be enhanced by many orders in split SUSY, leading to its likely participation in accelerator phenomenology.We conclude with a specific example of such a scenario in a string based supergravity model.
