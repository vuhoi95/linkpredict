Title: A New Infinite Class of Quiver Gauge Theories
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Pavlos Kazakopoulos and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We construct a new infinite family of N=1 quiver gauge theories which can be Higgsed to the Y^{p,q} quiver gauge theories. The dual geometries are toric Calabi-Yau cones for which we give the toric data. We also discuss the action of Seiberg duality on these quivers, and explore the different Seiberg dual theories. We describe the relationship of these theories to five dimensional gauge theories on (p,q) 5-branes. Using the toric data, we specify some of the properties of the corresponding dual Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. These theories generically have algebraic R-charges which are not quadratic irrational numbers. The metrics for these manifolds still remain unknown.
