Title: Topology Change and Unitarity in Quantum Black Hole Dynamics
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We discuss to what extent semiclassical topology change is capable of restoring unitarity in the relaxation of perturbations of eternal black holes in thermal equilibrium. The Poincare recurrences required by unitarity are not correctly reproduced in detail, but their effect on infinite time-averages can be mimicked by these semiclassical topological fluctuations. We also discuss the possible implications of these facts to the question of unitarity of the black hole S-matrix.
