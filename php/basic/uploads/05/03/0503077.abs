Title: Non-perturbative contributions to the plane-wave string mass matrix
Authors: Michael B. Green and Stefano Kovacs and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: D-instanton contributions to the mass matrix of arbitrary excited string states of type IIB string theory in the maximally supersymmetric plane-wave background are calculated to leading order in the string coupling using a supersymmetric light-cone boundary state formalism. The explicit non-perturbative dependence of the mass matrix on the complex string coupling, the plane-wave mass parameter and the mode numbers of the excited states is determined.
