Title: Smeared D0 charge and the Gubser-Mitra conjecture
Authors: Simon F. Ross and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: We relate a Dp or NS-brane with D0-brane charge smeared over its worldvolume to the system with no D0-charge. This allows us to generalise Reall's partial proof of the Gubser-Mitra conjecture. We show explicitly for specific examples that the dynamical instability coincides with thermodynamic instability in the ensemble where the D0-brane charge can vary. We also comment on consistency checks of the conjecture for more complicated systems, using the example of the D4 with F1 and D0 charges smeared on its worldvolume.
