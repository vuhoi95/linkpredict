Title: Integration of massive states as contractions of non linear  $Ïƒ$-models
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and S. Ferrara and M. A. Lledo and O. Macia
Abstract: We consider the contraction of some non linear sigma models which appear in effective supergravity theories. In particular we consider the contractions of maximally symmetric spaces corresponding to N=1 and N=2 theories, as they appear in certain low energy effective supergravity actions with mass deformations. The contraction procedure is shown to describe the integrating out of massive modes in the presence of interactions, as it happens in many supergravity models after spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
