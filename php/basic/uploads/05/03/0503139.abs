Title: The U(1)A anomaly in noncommutative SU(N) theories
Authors: C. P. Martin and C. Tamarit
Abstract: We work out the one-loop $U(1)_A$ anomaly for noncommutative SU(N) gauge theories up to second order in the noncommutative parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. We set $\theta^{0i}=0$ and conclude that there is no breaking of the classical $U(1)_A$ symmetry of the theory coming from the contributions that are either linear or quadratic in $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. Of course, the ordinary anomalous contributions will be still with us. We also show that the one-loop conservation of the nonsinglet currents holds at least up to second order in $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. We adapt our results to noncommutative gauge theories with SO(N) and U(1) gauge groups.
