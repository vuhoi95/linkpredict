Title: Quantum backreaction in dilute Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Ralf Sch√ºtzhold and Michael Uhlmann and Yan Xu and Uwe R. Fischer
Abstract: For many physical systems which can be approximated by a classical background field plus small (linearized) quantum fluctuations, a fundamental question concerns the correct description of the backreaction of the quantum fluctuations onto the dynamics of the classical background. We investigate this problem for the example of dilute atomic/molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, for which the microscopic dynamical behavior is under control. It turns out that the effective-action technique does not yield the correct result in general and that the knowledge of the pseudo-energy-momentum tensor ${<\hat T_{\mu\nu}>}$ is not sufficient to describe quantum backreaction.
