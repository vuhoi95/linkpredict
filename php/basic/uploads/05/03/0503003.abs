Authors: Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang and Shao-You Zhao
Abstract: We construct the Drinfeld twists (or factorizing $F$-matrices) of the supersymmetric model associated with quantum superalgebra $U_q(gl(m|n))$, and obtain the completely symmetric representations of the creation operators of the model in the $F$-basis provided by the $F$-matrix. As an application of our general results, we present the explicit expressions of the Bethe vectors in the $F$-basis for the $U_q(gl(2|1))$-model (the quantum t-J model).
