Title: A remark on alpha vacua for quantum field theories on de Sitter space
Authors: Romeo Brunetti and Klaus Fredenhagen and Stefan Hollands
Abstract: It is shown that the so-called $\alpha$-vacua which have been proposed as candidates for states of free quantum fields on de Sitter space have infinitely strong fluctuations for typical observables as averaged renormalized energy momentum tensor.
