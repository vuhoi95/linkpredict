Title: A Classification of Toroidal Orientifold Models
Authors: P. Anastasopoulos and A. B. Hammou
Abstract: We develop the general tools for model building with orientifolds, including SS supersymmetry breaking. In this paper, we work out the general formulae of the tadpole conditions for a class of non supersymmetric orientifold models of type IIB string theory compactified on $T^6$, based on the general properties of the orientifold group elements. By solving the tadpoles we obtain the general anomaly free massless spectrum.
