Title: Periodic integrable systems with delta-potentials
Authors: Erdal Emsiz and Eric M. Opdam and Jasper V. Stokman
Abstract: In this paper we study root system generalizations of the quantum Bose-gas on the circle with pair-wise delta function interactions. The underlying symmetry structures are shown to be governed by the associated graded of Cherednik's (suitably filtered) degenerate double affine Hecke algebra, acting by Dunkl-type differential-reflection operators. We use Gutkin's generalization of the equivalence between the impenetrable Bose-gas and the free Fermi-gas to derive the Bethe ansatz equations and the Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions.
