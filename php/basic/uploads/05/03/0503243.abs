Title: Induced Curvature in Brane Worlds by Surface Terms in String Effective  Actions with Higher-Curvature Corrections
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos and Eleftherios Papantonopoulos
Abstract: In string-inspired effective actions, representing the low-energy bulk dynamics of brane/string theories, the higher-curvature ghost-free Gauss-Bonnet combination is obtained by local field redefinitions which leave the (perturbative) string amplitudes invariant. We show that such redefinitions lead to surface terms which induce curvature on the brane world boundary of the bulk spacetime.
