Title: Matrix factorisations and permutation branes
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Matthias R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: The description of B-type D-branes on a tensor product of two N=2 minimal models in terms of matrix factorisations is related to the boundary state description in conformal field theory. As an application we show that the D0- and D2-brane for a number of Gepner models are described by permutation boundary states. In some cases (including the quintic) the images of the D2-brane under the Gepner monodromy generate the full charge lattice.
