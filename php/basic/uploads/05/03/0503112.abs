Title: Grand Unification, Dark Matter, Baryon Asymmetry, and the Small Scale  Structure of the Universe
Authors: Ryuichiro Kitano and Ian Low
Abstract: We consider a minimal grand unified model where the dark matter arises from non-thermal decays of a messenger particle in the TeV range. The messenger particle compensates for the baryon asymmetry in the standard model and gives similar number densities to both the baryon and the dark matter. The non-thermal dark matter, if massive in the GeV range, could have a free-streaming scale in the order of 0.1 Mpc and potentially resolve the discrepancies between observations and the LCDM model on the small scale structure of the Universe. Moreover, a GeV scale dark matter naturally leads to the observed puzzling proximity of baryonic and dark matter densities. Unification of gauge couplings is achieved by choosing a "Higgsino" messenger.
