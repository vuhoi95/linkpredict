Title: Higher order relations in Fedosov supermanifolds
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and O. V. Radchenko
Abstract: Higher order relations existing in normal coordinates between affine extensions of the curvature tensor and basic objects for any Fedosov supermanifolds are derived. Representation of these relations in general coordinates is discussed.
