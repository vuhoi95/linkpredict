Title: Gauge Theories with Lorentz-Symmetry Violation by Symplectic Projector  Method
Authors: H. Belich and M. A. De Andrade and M. A. Santos
Abstract: The violation of Lorentz symmetry is studied from the point of view of a canonical formulation. We make the usual analysis on the constraints structure of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw model. In this context we derive the equations of motion for the physical variables and check out the dispersion relations obtained from them. Therefore, by the analysis using Symplectic Projector Method (SPM), we can check the results about this type of Lorentz breaking with those in the recent literature: in this sense we can confirm that the configuration of $v^{\mu}$ space-like is stable, and the $v^{\mu}$ time-like carry tachionic modes.
