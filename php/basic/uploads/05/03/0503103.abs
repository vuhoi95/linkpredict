Title: Dynamically generated embeddings of spacetime
Authors: F. Dahia and C. Romero
Abstract: We discuss how embeddings in connection with the Campbell-Magaard (CM) theorem can have a physical interpretation. We show that any embedding whose local existence is guaranteed by the CM theorem can be viewed as a result of the dynamical evolution of initial data given in a four-dimensional spacelike hypersurface. By using the CM theorem, we establish that for any analytic spacetime, there exist appropriate initial data whose Cauchy development is a five-dimensional vacuum space into which the spacetime is locally embedded. We shall see also that the spacetime embedded is Cauchy stable with respect these the initial data.
