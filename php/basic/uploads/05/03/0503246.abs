Title: Spectral triples of holonomy loops
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup
Abstract: The machinery of noncommutative geometry is applied to a space of connections. A noncommutative function algebra of loops closely related to holonomy loops is investigated. The space of connections is identified as a projective limit of Lie-groups composed of copies of the gauge group. A spectral triple over the space of connections is obtained by factoring out the diffeomorphism group. The triple consist of equivalence classes of loops acting on a separable hilbert space of sections in an infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. We find that the Dirac operator acting on this hilbert space does not fully comply with the axioms of a spectral triple.
