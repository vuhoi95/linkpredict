Title: Entropy of spatial monopole currents in pure SU(2) QCD at finite  temperature
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Katsuya Ishiguro and Tsuneo Suzuki
Abstract: We study properties of space-like monopole trajectories in the Maximal Abelian gauge of quenched SU(2) QCD at the finite temperature. We concentrate on infrared monopole clusters which are responsible for the confinement properties of the theory. We determine numerically the effective action of the monopoles projected onto the three-dimensional time-slice. Then we derive the length distributions of the monopole loops and fix their entropy.
