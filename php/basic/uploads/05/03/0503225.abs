Title: Vacuum Polarization of a Massless Scalar Field in the Background of a  Global Monopole with Finite Core
Authors: J. Spinelly and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the vacuum polarization effects of a massless scalar field in the background of a global monopole considering a inner structure to it. Specifically we investigate the effect of its structure on the vacuum expectation value of the square of the field operator, $<\hat{\Phi}^2(x)>$, admitting a non-minimal coupling between the field with the geometry: $\xi {\cal{R}}\hat{\Phi}^2$. Also we calculate the corrections on the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor, $<\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}>$, due to the inner structure of the monopole. In order to develop these analysis, we calculate the Euclidean Green function associated with the system for points in the region outside the core. As we shall see, for specific value of the coupling parameter $\xi$, the corrections caused by the inner structure of the monopole can provide relevant contributions on these vacuum polarizations.
