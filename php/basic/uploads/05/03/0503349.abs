Abstract: Cosmological consequences of a coupling between massive neutrinos and dark energy are investigated. In such models, the neutrino mass is a function of a scalar field, which plays the role of dark energy. The background evolution, as well as the evolution of cosmological perturbations is discussed. We find that mass-varying neutrinos can leave a significant imprint on the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation and even lead to a reduction of power on large angular scales.
