Title: The cosmology of the nonsymmetric theory of gravitation
Authors: Tomislav Prokopec and Wessel Valkenburg
Abstract: We show that during cosmological inflation the nonsymmetric metric tensor theory of gravitation develops a spectrum which is potentially observable by cosmic microwave background observations, and may be the most sensitive probe of the scale of cosmic inflation.
