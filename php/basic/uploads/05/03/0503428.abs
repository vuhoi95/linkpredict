Title: Transient acceleration from a hybrid Chaplygin gas
Authors: Neven Bilic and Gary B. Tupper and Raoul D. Viollier
Abstract: We extend the Chaplygin gas model for dark matter and dark energy unification by promoting the Chaplygin gas parameter A to the potential for an extra scalar with canonical kinetic energy. The hybrid model allows for accelerated Hubble expansion to be a transient effect around redshift zero.
