Title: Functional integral with "phi^4" term in the action beyond standard  perturbative methods
Authors: J. Bohacik and P. Presnajder
Abstract: We propose the another, in principe nonperturbative, method of the evaluatiom of the Wiener functional integral for "phi^4" term in the action. We find the "generalized" Gelfand-Yaglom differential equation implying the functional integral in the continuum limit.
