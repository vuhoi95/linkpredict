Title: Topological order in Josephson junction ladders with Mobius boundary  conditions
Authors: G. Cristofano and V. Marotta and A. Naddeo
Abstract: We propose a CFT description for a closed one-dimensional fully frustrated ladder of quantum Josephson junctions with Mobius boundary conditions, in particular we show how such a system can develop topological order. Such a property is crucial for its implementation as a "protected" solid state qubit.
