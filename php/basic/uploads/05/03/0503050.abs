Title: Two Point Correlation Function of Sine-Liouville Theory
Authors: Jongwook Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: Exact two point correlation functions of sine-Liouville theory are presented for primary fields with U(1) charge neutral, which may either preserve or break winding number. Our result is checked with perturbative calculation and is also consistent with previous one which can be obtained by restricting the action parameters.
