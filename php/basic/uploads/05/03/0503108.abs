Title: Scattering of a Klein-Gordon particle by a Woods-Saxon potential
Authors: Clara Rojas and Victor M. Villalba
Abstract: We solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a spatially one-dimensional Woods-Saxon potential. The scattering solutions are obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions and the condition for the existence of transmission resonances is derived. It is shown how the zero-reflection condition depends on the shape of the potential.
