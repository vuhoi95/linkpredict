Title: Ultrarelativistic boost of the black ring
Authors: Marcello Ortaggio and Pavel Krtous and Jiri Podolsky
Abstract: We investigate the ultrarelativistic boost of the five-dimensional Emparan-Reall non-rotating black ring. Following the classical method of Aichelburg and Sexl, we determine the gravitational field generated by a black ring moving ``with the speed of light'' in an arbitrary direction. In particular, we study in detail two different boosts along axes orthogonal and parallel to the plane of the ring circle, respectively. In both cases, after the limit one obtains a five-dimensional impulsive pp-wave propagating in Minkowski spacetime. The curvature singularity of the original static spacetime becomes a singular source within the wave front, in the shape of a ring or a rod according to the direction of the boost. In the case of an orthogonal boost, the wave front contains also a remnant of the original disk-shaped membrane as a component of the Ricci tensor (which is everywhere else vanishing). We also analyze the asymptotic properties of the boosted black ring at large spatial distances from the singularity, and its behaviour near the sources. In the limit when the singularity shrinks to a point, one recovers the well known five-dimensional analogue of the Aichelburg-Sexl ``monopole'' solution.
