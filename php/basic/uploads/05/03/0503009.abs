Title: Aspects of Open-Closed Duality in a Background B-Field
Authors: S. Sarkar and B. Sathiapalan
Abstract: We study closed string exchanges in background $B$-field. By analysing the two point one loop amplitude in bosonic string theory, we show that tree-level exchange of lowest lying, tachyonic and massless closed string modes, have IR singularities similar to those of the nonplanar sector in noncommutative gauge theories. We further isolate the contributions from each of the massless modes. We interpret these results as the manifestation of open/closed string duality, where the IR behaviour of the boundary noncommutative gauge theory is reconstructed from the bulk theory of closed strings.
