Title: Hawking Radiation from a (4+n)-Dimensional Rotating Black Hole on the  Brane
Authors: C. M. Harris and P. Kanti
Abstract: We study the emission of Hawking radiation in the form of scalar fields from a (4+n)-dimensional, rotating black hole on the brane. We perform a numerical analysis to solve both the radial and angular parts of the scalar field equation, and derive exact results for the radial wavefunction and angular eigenvalues, respectively. We then determine the Hawking radiation energy emission rate, and find that, as the angular momentum increases, it is suppressed in the low-energy regime but enhanced in the intermediate and high-energy regimes. Our results agree with previous analytical studies, derived in the low-angular momentum and low-energy approximation, and generalize them to include angular momentum and energy regimes that were until now unexplored. We also investigate the energy amplification due to super-radiance and we find that, in the presence of extra dimensions, the effect is significantly enhanced.
