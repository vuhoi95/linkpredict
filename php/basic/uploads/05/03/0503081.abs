Title: Simulations of the End of Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation and  Non-Topological Soliton Formation
Authors: Matt Broadhead and John McDonald
Abstract: We present two- and three-dimensional simulations of the growth of quantum fluctuations of the scalar fields in supersymmetric hybrid inflation models. For a natural range of couplings, sub-horizon quantum fluctuations undergo rapid growth due to scalar field dynamics, resulting in the formation of quasi-stable non-topological solitons (inflaton condensate lumps) which dominate the post-inflation era.
