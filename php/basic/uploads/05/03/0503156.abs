Title: On the Gauge/Gravity Correspondence and the Open/Closed String Duality
Authors: Paolo Di Vecchia and Antonella Liccardo and Raffaele Marotta and Franco Pezzella
Abstract: In this article we review the conditions for the validity of the gauge/gravity correspondence in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric string models. We start by reminding what happens in type IIB theory on the orbifolds C^2/Z_2 and C^3/(Z_2 x Z_2), where this correspondence beautifully works. In these cases, by performing a complete stringy calculation of the interaction among D3 branes, it has been shown that the fact that this correspondence works is a consequence of the open/closed duality and of the absence of threshold corrections. Then we review the construction of type 0 theories with their orbifolds and orientifolds having spectra free from both open and closed string tachyons and for such models we study the validity of the gauge/gravity correspondence, concluding that this is not a peculiarity of supersymmetric theories, but it may work also for non-supersymmetric models. Also in these cases, when it works, it is again a consequence of the open/closed string duality and of vanishing threshold corrections.
