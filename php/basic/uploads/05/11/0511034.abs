Abstract: Recently the 1/R gravity has been proposed in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, it was argued that the 1/R gravity conflicts with solar system tests. While this statement is true if one views the 1/R gravity as an effective theory, we find that this difficulty might be avoided if one treats the 1/R term as a correction to the scalar curvature term in the high curvature limit $R \gg \mu^2$.
