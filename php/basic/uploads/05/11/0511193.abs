Title: Deformed defects with applications to braneworlds
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano
Abstract: In this work we investigate two distinct extensions of the deformation procedure introduced in former works on deformed defects. The first extension deals with the use of deformation functions which can assume complex values, and the second concerns the possibility of making the deformation dependent on the defect solution of the model used to implement the deformation. These two extensions bring the deformation procedure to a significantly higher standard and allow to build interesting results, as we explicitly illustrate with examples of current interest to high energy physics.
