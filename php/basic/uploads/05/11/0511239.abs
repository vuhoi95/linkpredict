Title: Topological Cigar and the c=1 String : Open and Closed
Authors: Sujay K. Ashok and Sameer Murthy and Jan Troost
Abstract: We clarify some aspects of the map between the c=1 string theory at self-dual radius and the topologically twisted cigar at level one. We map the ZZ and FZZT D-branes in the c=1 string theory at self dual radius to the localized and extended branes in the topological theory on the cigar. We show that the open string spectrum on the branes in the two theories are in correspondence with each other, and their two point correlators are equal. We also find a representation of an extended N=2 algebra on the worldsheet which incorporates higher spin currents in terms of asymptotic variables on the cigar.
