Title: Non-commutative (D)-instantons
Authors: Marco Billo and Marialuisa Frau and Stefano Sciuto and Giuseppe Vallone and Alberto Lerda
Abstract: We study systems of D3 and D(-1) branes in a NS-NS magnetic background and show that, when the brane configuration is stable, the physical degrees of freedom of the open strings with at least one end-point on the D-instantons describe the ADHM moduli of instantons for non-commutative gauge theories. We also prove that disk diagrams with mixed boundary conditions are the sources for the classical profile of the non-commutative gauge instantons in the singular gauge. We finally compare the string theory description in a large distance expansion with the non-commutative ADHM construction in the singular gauge and find complete agreement at perturbative level in the non-commutativity parameter.
