Title: Covariant Lagrangian Formulation of Chern-Simons and BF Theories
Authors: A. Borowiec and L. Fatibene and M. Ferraris and M. Francaviglia
Abstract: We investigate the covariant formulation of Chern-Simons theories in a general odd dimension which can be obtained by introducing a vacuum connection field as a reference. Field equations, Noether currents and superpotentials are computed so that results are easily compared with the well-known results in dimension 3. Finally we use this covariant formulation of Chern-Simons theories to investigate their relation with topological BF theories.
