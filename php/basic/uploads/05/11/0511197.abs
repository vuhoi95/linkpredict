Title: Noncommutativity, Extra Dimensions, and Power Law Running in the  Infrared
Authors: Steven A. Abel and Joerg Jaeckel and Valentin V. Khoze and Andreas Ringwald
Abstract: We investigate the running gauge couplings of U(N) noncommutative gauge theories with compact extra dimensions. Power law running of the trace-U(1) gauge coupling in the ultraviolet is communicated to the infrared by ultraviolet/infrared mixing, whereas the SU(N) factors run exactly as in the commutative theory. This results in theories where the experimentally excluded trace-U(1) factors decouple with a power law running of the momentum in the extreme infrared, effectively hiding them from detection.
