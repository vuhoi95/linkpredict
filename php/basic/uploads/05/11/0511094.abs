Title: The stability of modified gravity models
Authors: Valerio Faraoni and Shahn Nadeau
Abstract: Conditions for the existence and stability of de Sitter space in modified gravity are derived by considering inhomogeneous perturbations in a gauge-invariant formalism. The stability condition coincides with the corresponding condition for stability with respect to homogeneous perturbations, while this is not the case in scalar-tensor gravity. The stability criterion is applied to various modified gravity models of the early and the present universe.
