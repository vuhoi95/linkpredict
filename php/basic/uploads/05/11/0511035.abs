Title: Supersymmetric Standard Model from the Heterotic String
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Koichi Hamaguchi and Oleg Lebedev and Michael Ratz
Abstract: We present a Z_6 orbifold compactification of the E_8xE_8 heterotic string which leads to the (supersymmetric) Standard Model gauge group and matter content. The quarks and leptons appear as three 16-plets of SO(10), whereas the Higgs fields do not form complete SO(10) multiplets. The model has no exotic states at low energies and is consistent with gauge coupling unification. The top quark Yukawa coupling arises from gauge interactions and is of the order of the gauge couplings, whereas the other Yukawa couplings are suppressed.
