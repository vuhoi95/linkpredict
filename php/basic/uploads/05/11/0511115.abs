Title: Off-diagonal coefficients of the DeWitt-Schwinger and Hadamard  representations of the Feynman propagator
Authors: Yves DÃ©canini and Antoine Folacci
Abstract: Having in mind applications to gravitational wave theory (in connection with the radiation reaction problem), stochastic semiclassical gravity (in connection with the regularization of the noise kernel) and quantum field theory in higher-dimensional curved spacetime (in connection with the Hadamard regularization of the stress-energy tensor), we improve the DeWitt-Schwinger and Hadamard representations of the Feynman propagator of a massive scalar field theory defined on an arbitrary gravitational background by deriving higher-order terms for the covariant Taylor series expansions of the geometrical coefficients -- i.e., the DeWitt and Hadamard coefficients -- that define them.
