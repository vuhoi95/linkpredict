Title: Brane Decay of a (4+n)-Dimensional Rotating Black Hole. II: spin-1  particles
Authors: M. Casals and P. Kanti and E. Winstanley
Abstract: The present works complements and expands a previous one, focused on the emission of scalar fields by a (4+n)-dimensional rotating black hole on the brane, by studying the emission of gauge fields on the brane from a similar black hole. A comprehensive analysis of the particle, energy and angular momentum emission rates is undertaken, for arbitrary angular momentum of the black hole and dimensionality of spacetime. Our analysis reveals the existence of a number of distinct features associated with the emission of spin-1 fields from a rotating black hole on the brane, such as the behaviour and magnitude of the different emission rates, the angular distribution of particles and energy, the relative enhancement compared to the scalar fields, and the magnitude of the superradiance effect. Apart from their theoretical interest, these features can comprise clear signatures of the emission of Hawking radiation from a brane-world black hole during its spin-down phase upon successful detection of this effect during an experiment.
