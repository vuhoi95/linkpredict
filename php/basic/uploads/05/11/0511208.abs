Title: Consistent dimensional reduction of five-dimensional off-shell  supergravity
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: There are some points to notice in the dimensional reduction of the off-shell supergravity. We discuss a consistent way of the dimensional reduction of five-dimensional off-shell supergravity compactified on S^1/Z_2. There are two approaches to the four-dimensional effective action, which are complementary to each other. Their essential difference is the treatment of the compensator and the radion superfields. We explain these approaches in detail and examine their consistency. Comments on the related works are also provided.
