Title: On the Reliability of the Langevin Pertubative Solution in Stochastic  Inflation
Authors: Jerome Martin and Marcello Musso
Abstract: A method to estimate the reliability of a perturbative expansion of the stochastic inflationary Langevin equation is presented and discussed. The method is applied to various inflationary scenarios, as large field, small field and running mass models. It is demonstrated that the perturbative approach is more reliable than could be naively suspected and, in general, only breaks down at the very end of inflation.
