Title: Phenomenology of black hole evaporation with a cosmological constant
Authors: J. Labbe and A. Barrau and J. Grain
Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some possible experimental consequences of the de-Sitter or Anti-de-Sitter background spacetime structure for d-dimensional evaporating black holes. Possible observational signatures in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) events are considered in the framework of the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) braneworld model. Lower bounds on the value of the bulk cosmological constant required to produce visible effects are derived thanks to a dynamical Monte-Carlo simulation. This preliminary study has to be refined by the accurate computation of the greybody factors. It opens a new way to investigate the structure of non-asymptotically flat higher-dimensional spacetimes.
