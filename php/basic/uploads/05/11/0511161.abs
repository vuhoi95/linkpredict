Title: The Effective Potential in the Massive $Ï†_4^4$ Model
Authors: F. T. Brandt and F. A. Chishtie and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: By applying the renormalization group equation, it has been shown that the effective potential $V$ in the massless $\phi_4^4$ model and in massless scalar quantum electrodynamics is independent of the scalar field. This analysis is extended here to the massive $\phi_4^4$ model, showing that the effective potential is independent of $\phi$ here as well.
