Title: Distribution function of the dark matter
Authors: N. W. Evans and J. An
Abstract: There is good evidence from N-body simulations that the velocity distribution in the outer parts of halos is radially anisotropic, with the kinetic energy in the radial direction roughly equal to the sum of that in the two tangential directions. We provide a simple algorithm to generate such cosmologically important distribution functions. Introducing r_E(E), the radius of the largest orbit of a particle with energy E, we show how to write down almost trivially a distribution function of the form f(E,L)=g(r_E)/L for any spherical model -- including the NFW profile. We in addition give the generic form of the distribution function for any model with a local density power-law index and anisotropy parameter, and provide limiting forms appropriate for the central parts and envelopes of dark matter halos. From those, we argue that, regardless of the anisotropy, the density fall-off at large radii must evolve to 1/r^4 or steeper ultimately.
