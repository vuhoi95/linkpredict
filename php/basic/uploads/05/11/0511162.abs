Title: Asymptotic charges in 3d gravity with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojevic and B. Cvetkovic
Abstract: We discuss some new developments in three-dimensional gravity with torsion, based on Riemann-Cartan geometry. Using the canonical approach, we study the structure of asymptotic symmetry, clarify its fundamental role in defining the gravitational conserved charges, and explore the influence of the asymptotic structure on the black hole entropy.
