Title: Zero-point energy in spheroidal geometries
Authors: A. R. Kitson and A. I. Signal
Abstract: We study the zero-point energy of a massless scalar field subject to spheroidal boundary conditions. Using the zeta-function method, the zero-point energy is evaluated for small ellipticity. Axially symmetric vector fields are also considered. The results are interpreted within the context of QCD flux tubes and the MIT bag model.
