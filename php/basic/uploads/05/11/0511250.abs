Title: Hawking Radiation as Tunneling: the D-dimensional rotating case
Authors: M. Nadalini and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The tunneling method for the Hawking radiation is revisited and applied to the $D$ dimensional rotating case. Emphasis is given to covariance of results. Certain ambiguities afflicting the procedure are resolved.
