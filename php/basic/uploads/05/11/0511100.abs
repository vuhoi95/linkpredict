Title: Non Abelian gauge symmetries induced by the unobservability of  extra-dimensions in a Kaluza-Klein approach
Authors: F. Cianfrani and G. Montani
Abstract: In this work we deal with the extension of the Kaluza-Klein approach to a non-Abelian gauge theory; we show how we need to consider the link between the n-dimensional model and a four-dimensional observer physics, in order to reproduce fields equations and gauge transformations in the four-dimensional picture. More precisely, in fields equations any dependence on extra-coordinates is canceled out by an integration, as consequence of the unobservability of extra-dimensions. Thus, by virtue of this extra-dimensions unobservability, we are able to recast the multidimensional Einstein equations into the four-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills ones, as well as all the right gauge transformations of fields are induced. The same analysis is performed for the Dirac equation describing the dynamics of the matter fields and, again, the gauge coupling with Yang-Mills fields are inferred from the multidimensional free fields theory, together with the proper spinors transformations.
