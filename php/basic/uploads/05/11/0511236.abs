Title: Dynamical Casimir effect with Robin boundary conditions
Authors: B. Mintz and C. Farina and P. A. Maia Neto and R. Rodrigues
Abstract: We consider a massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions that satisfies a Robin boundary condition at a non-relativistic moving boundary. Using the perturbative approach introduced by Ford and Vilenkin, we compute the total force on the moving boundary. In contrast to what happens for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, in addition to a dissipative part, the force acquires also a dispersive one. Further, we also show that with an appropriate choice for the mechanical frequency of the moving boundary it is possible to turn off the vacuum dissipation almost completely.
