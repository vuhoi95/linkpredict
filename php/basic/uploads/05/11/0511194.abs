Authors: J. J. Godina and L. Li and Y. Meurice and M. B. Oktay
Abstract: We perform high-accuracy calculations of the critical exponent gamma and its subleading exponent for the 3D O(N) Dyson's hierarchical model, for N up to 20. We calculate the critical temperatures for the nonlinear sigma model measure. We discuss the possibility of extracting the first coefficients of the 1/N expansion from our numerical data. We show that the leading and subleading exponents agreewith Polchinski equation and the equivalent Litim equation, in the local potential approximation, with at least 4 significant digits.
