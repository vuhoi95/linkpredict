Title: Casimir effect for a spherical shell in de Sitter spacetime with  signature change
Authors: M. R. Setare and F. Darabi
Abstract: The Casimir stress on a spherical shell in de Sitter signature changing background for massless scalar field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions on the shell is calculated. The Casimir stress is calculated for inside and outside of the shell with different backgrounds corresponding to different metric signatures and cosmological constants. An important contribution appears due to signature change which leads to a transient rapid expansion of the bubbles in this background.
