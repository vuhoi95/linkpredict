Title: On vacuum gravitational collapse in nine dimensions
Authors: P. Bizo≈Ñ and T. Chmaj and A. Rostworowski and B. G. Schmidt and Z. Tabor
Abstract: We consider the vacuum gravitational collapse for cohomogeneity-two solutions of the nine dimensional Einstein equations. Using combined numerical and analytical methods we give evidence that within this model the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole is asymptotically stable. In addition, we briefly discuss the critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation.
