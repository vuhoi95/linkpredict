Title: On the gravitational energy of the Kaluza Klein monopole
Authors: Robert B. Mann and Cristian Stelea
Abstract: We use local counterterm prescriptions for asymptotically flat space to compute the action and conserved quantities in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theories. As an application of these prescriptions we compute the mass of the Kaluza-Klein magnetic monopole. We find consistent results with previous approaches that employ a background subtraction.
