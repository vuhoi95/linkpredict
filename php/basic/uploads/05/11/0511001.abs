Abstract: We describe new half-BPS cosmic string solutions in N=2, d=4 supergravity coupled to one vector multiplet and one hypermultiplet. They are closely related to D-term strings in N=1 supergravity. Fields of the N=2 theory that are frozen in the solution contribute to the triplet moment map of the quaternionic isometries and leave their trace in N=1 as a constant Fayet-Iliopoulos term. The choice of U(1) gauging and of special geometry are crucial. The construction gives rise to a non-minimal Kaehler potential and can be generalized to higher dimensional quaternionic-Kaehler manifolds.
