Title: BTZ black holes, WZW models and noncommutative geometry
Authors: P. Bieliavsky and S. Detournay and M. Rooman and Ph. Spindel
Abstract: This note is based on a talk given by one of the authors (S. D.) at the "Rencontres Math\'ematiques de Glanon", held in Glanon in July 2004. We will first introduce the BTZ black hole, solution of Einstein's gravity in 2+1 dimensions, and emphasize some remarkable properties of its geometry. We will essentially pay attention to the non-rotating black hole, whose structure is significantly different to the generic case. We will then turn the some aspects of string theory, namely the emergence of non-commutative geometry and the embedding of the BTZ black hole as an exact string background using the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. We will show the existence of winding symmetric WZW D1-branes in this space-time from the geometrical properties of the non-rotating black hole. Finally, we will introduce strict deformations of these spaces, yielding an example of non-commutative lorentzian non-compact space, with non-trivial causal structure.
