Title: Inhomogeneous Yang-Mills algebras
Authors: Roland Berger and Michel Dubois-Violette
Abstract: We determine all inhomogeneous Yang-Mills algebras and super Yang-Mills algebras which are Koszul. Following a recent proposal, a non-homogeneous algebra is said to be Koszul if the homogeneous part is Koszul and if the PBW property holds. In this paper, the homogeneous parts are the Yang-Mills algebra and the super Yang-Mills algebra.
