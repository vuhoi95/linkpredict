Title: Exotic Galilean Conformal Symmetry and its Dynamical Realisations
Authors: J. Lukierski and P. C. Stichel and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: The six-dimensional exotic Galilean algebra in (2+1) dimensions with two central charges $m$ and $\theta$, is extended when $m=0$, to a ten-dimensional Galilean conformal algebra with dilatation, expansion, two acceleration generators and the central charge $\theta$. A realisation of such a symmetry is provided by a model with higher derivatives recently discussed in \cite{peterwojtek}. We consider also a realisation of the Galilean conformal symmetry for the motion with a Coulomb potential and a magnetic vortex interaction. Finally, we study the restriction, as well as the modification, of the Galilean conformal algebra obtained after the introduction of the minimally coupled constant electric and magnetic fields.
