Abstract: Observing dark energy dynamics is the most important aspect of the dark energy research. In this paper we perform an analysis of the constraints on the property of dark energy from the current astronomical observations. We pay particular attention to the effects of dark energy perturbations. Using the data from SNIa (157 "gold" sample), WMAP and SDSS we find that the best fitting dark energy model is given by the dynamical model with the equation of state across -1. Nevertheless the standard \LambdaCDM models are still a very good fit to the current data and evidence for dynamics is currently not very strong. We also consider the constraints from SNLS.
