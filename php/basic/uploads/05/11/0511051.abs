Title: M-theory Supertubes with Three and Four Charges
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Kyungyu Kim and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: Using the covariant M5-brane action, we construct configurations corresponding to supertubes with three and four charges. We derive the BPS equations and study the full structure of the solutions. In particular, we find new solutions involving arbitrariness in field strengths.
