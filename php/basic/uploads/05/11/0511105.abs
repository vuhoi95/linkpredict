Title: Electroweak inflation and reheating in the NMSSM
Authors: Takeshi Fukuyama and Tatsuru Kikuchi and Wade Naylor
Abstract: A low reheating temperature is now well motivated by the recently reconsidered gravitino problem, if we incorporate supergravity. In this article, we propose a model which naturally realizes a low reheating temperature. The model is based on the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) by identifying a singlet scalar field as the inflaton. This entertains the possibility that the inflaton may be detected at future colliders, such as the LHC.
