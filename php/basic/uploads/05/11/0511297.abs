Title: ADHM is Tachyon Condensation
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We completely realize the ADHM construction of instantons in D-brane language of tachyon condensations. Every step of the construction is given a physical interpretation in string theory, in a boundary state formalism valid all order in \alpha'. Accordingly, equivalence between Yang-Mills configurations on D4-branes and D0-branes inside the D4-branes is proven, which shows that small instanton configurations of the Yang-Mills fields are protected against stringy \alpha' corrections. We provide also D-brane realizations of the inverse ADHM construction, the completeness, and the noncommutative ADHM construction.
