Title: Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics in  four and higher dimensions
Authors: Emanuele Berti and Vitor Cardoso and Marc Casals
Abstract: Spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics are useful in a variety of physical situations, including light scattering, nuclear modeling, signal processing, electromagnetic wave propagation, black hole perturbation theory in four and higher dimensions, quantum field theory in curved space-time and studies of D-branes. We first review analytic and numerical calculations of their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in four dimensions, filling gaps in the existing literature when necessary. Then we compute the angular dependence of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics corresponding to slowly-damped quasinormal mode frequencies of the Kerr black hole, providing numerical tables and approximate formulas for their scalar products. Finally we present an exhaustive analytic and numerical study of scalar spheroidal harmonics in (n+4) dimensions.
