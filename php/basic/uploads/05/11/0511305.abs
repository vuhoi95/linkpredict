Title: Global monopoles, cosmological constant and maximal mass conjecture
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We consider global monopoles as well as black holes with global monopole hair in Einstein-Goldstone model with a cosmological constant in four spacetime dimensions. Similar to the $\Lambda=0$ case, the mass of these solutions defined in the standard way diverges. We use a boundary counterterm subtraction method to compute the mass and action of $\Lambda \neq 0$ configurations. The mass of the asymptotically de Sitter solutions computed in this way turns out to take positive values in a specific parameter range and, for a relaxed set of asymptotic boundary conditions, yields a counterexample to the maximal mass conjecture.
