Title: Nonabelian Confinement near Nontrivial Conformal Vacua
Authors: Kenichi Konishi and Giacomo Marmorini and Naoto Yokoi
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking in the so-called nonabelian Argyres-Douglas vacua, which occur very generally in supersymmetric theories. These systems are characterized by strongly-coupled nonabelian monopoles and dyons; confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking are caused by the condensation of monopole composites, rather than by condensation of single weakly-coupled monopoles. In general, there are strong constraints on which kind of monopoles can appear as the infrared degrees of freedom, related to the proper realization of the global symmetry of the theory. Drawing analogies to some of the phenomena found here, we make a speculation on the ground state of the standard QCD.
