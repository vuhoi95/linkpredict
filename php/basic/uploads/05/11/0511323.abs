Title: Noncommutativity of Space and Rotation of Polarization of Light in a  Background Magnetic Field
Authors: M. Chaichian and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and A. Tureanu
Abstract: Recently the PVLAS collaboration has reported the observation of rotation of polarization of light propagating in a background magnetic field. In this letter we explore the possibility that such a rotation is a result of noncommutativity in the background space-time. To explain the reported polarization rotation within noncommutative QED we need the noncommutativity parameter $\theta\simeq (30 {\rm GeV})^{-2}$.
