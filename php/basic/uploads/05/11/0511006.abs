Authors: L. Bonora and R. J. Scherer Santos and A. S. Sorin and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: We show that the three strings vertex coefficients in light--cone open string field theory satisfy the Hirota equations for the dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy. We show that Hirota equations allow us to calculate the correlators of an associated quantum system where the Neumann coefficients represent the two--point functions. We consider next the three strings vertex coefficients of the light--cone string field theory on a maximally supersymmetric pp--wave background. Using the previous results we are able to show that these Neumann coefficients satisfy the Hirota equations for the full Toda lattice hierarchy at least up to second order in the 'string mass' $\mu$.
