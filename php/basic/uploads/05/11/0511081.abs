Title: Parity Doubling and SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R Restoration in the Hadron Spectrum
Authors: Robert L. Jaffe and Dan Pirjol and Antonello Scardicchio
Abstract: We construct the most general nonlinear representation of chiral SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R broken down spontaneously to the isospin SU(2), on a pair of hadrons of same spin and isospin and opposite parity. We show that any such representation is equivalent, through a hadron field transformation, to two irreducible representations on two hadrons of opposite parity with different masses and axial couplings. This implies that chiral symmetry realized in the Nambu-Goldstone mode does not predict the existence of degenerate multiplets of hadrons of opposite parity nor any relations between their couplings or masses.
