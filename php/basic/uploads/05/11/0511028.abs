Title: Determinant Representations of Correlation Functions for the  Supersymmetric t-J Model
Authors: Shao-You Zhao and Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: Working in the $F$-basis provided by the factorizing $F$-matrix, the scalar products of Bethe states for the supersymmetric t-J model are represented by determinants. By means of these results, we obtain determinant representations of correlation functions for the model.
