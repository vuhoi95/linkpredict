Abstract: We carry out a thorough analysis of the moduli space of the cascading gauge theory found on p D3-branes and M wrapped D5-branes at the tip of the conifold. We find various mesonic branches of the moduli space whose string duals involve the warped deformed conifold with different numbers of mobile D3-branes. The branes that are not mobile form a BPS bound state at threshold. In the special case where p is divisible by M there also exists a one-dimensional baryonic branch whose family of supergravity duals, the resolved warped deformed conifolds, was constructed recently. The warped deformed conifold is a special case of these backgrounds where the resolution parameter vanishes and a Z_2 symmetry is restored. We study various brane probes on the resolved warped deformed conifolds, and successfully match the results with the gauge theory. In particular, we show that the radial potential for a D3-brane on this space varies slowly, suggesting a new model of D-brane inflation.
