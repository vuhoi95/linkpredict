Title: Renormalized Stress Tensor for trans-Planckian Cosmology
Authors: D. Lopez Nacir and F. D. Mazzitelli and C. Simeone
Abstract: Finite expressions for the mean value of the stress tensor corresponding to a scalar field with a generalized dispersion relation in a Friedman--Robertson--Walker universe are obtained using adiabatic renormalization. Formally divergent integrals are evaluated by means of dimensional regularization. The renormalization procedure is shown to be equivalent to a redefinition of the cosmological constant and the Newton constant in the semiclassical Einstein equations.
