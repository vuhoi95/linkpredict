Title: A complete solution of a Constrained System: SUSY Monopole Quantum  Mechanics
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Joohan Lee and Tae Hoon Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We solve the quantum mechanical problem of a charged particle on S^2 in the background of a magnetic monopole for both bosonic and supersymmetric cases by constructing Hilbert space and realizing the fundamental operators obeying complicated Dirac bracket relations in terms of differential operators. We find the complete energy eigenfunctions. Using the lowest energy eigenstates we count the number of degeneracies and examine the supersymmetric structure of the ground states in detail.
