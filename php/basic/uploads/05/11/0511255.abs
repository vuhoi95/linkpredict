Authors: Cuauhtemoc Campuzano and Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera
Abstract: The curvaton reheating in a tachyonic braneworld inflationary universe model with an exponential potential is studied. We have found that the energy density in the kinetic epoch, has a complicated dependencies of the scale factor. For different scenarios the temperature of reheating is computed, finding an upper limit that lies in the range $10^{14}$--$10^{16}$GeV.
