Title: Algorithm for Probing the Unitarity of Topologically Massive Models
Authors: Antonio Accioly and Marco Dias
Abstract: An uncomplicated and easily handling prescription that converts the task of checking the unitarity of massive, topologically massive, models into a straightforward algebraic exercise, is developed. The algorithm is used to test the unitarity of both topologically massive higher-derivative electromagnetism and topologically massive higher-derivative gravity. The novel and amazing features of these effective field models are also discussed.
