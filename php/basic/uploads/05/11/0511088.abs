Abstract: We completely determine the moduli space M_{N,k} of k-vortices in U(N) gauge theory with N Higgs fields in the fundamental representation. Its open subset for separated vortices is found as the symmetric product (C x CP^{N-1})^k / S_k. Orbifold singularities of this space correspond to coincident vortices and are resolved resulting in a smooth moduli manifold. Relation to Kahler quotient construction is discussed.
