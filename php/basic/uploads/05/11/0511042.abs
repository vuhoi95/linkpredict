Title: String-localized Quantum Fields and Modular Localization
Authors: J. Mund and B. Schroer and J. Yngvason
Abstract: We study free, covariant, quantum (Bose) fields that are associated with irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group and localized in semi-infinite strings extending to spacelike infinity. Among these are fields that generate the irreducible representations of mass zero and infinite spin that are known to be incompatible with point-like localized fields. For the massive representation and the massless representations of finite helicity, all string-localized free fields can be written as an integral, along the string, of point-localized tensor or spinor fields. As a special case we discuss the string-localized vector fields associated with the point-like electromagnetic field and their relation to the axial gauge condition in the usual setting.
