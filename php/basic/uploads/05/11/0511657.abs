Title: Twistor and Reflector Spaces of Almost Para-Quaternionic Manifolds
Authors: Stefan Ivanov and Ivan Minchev and Simeon Zamkovoy
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of natural almost complex structures on the twistor space of an almost para-quaternionic manifold as well as the integrability of natural almost paracomplex structures on the reflector space of an almost para-quaternionic manifold constructed with the help of a para-quaternionic connection. We show that if there is an integrable structure it is independent on the para-quaternionic connection. In dimension four, we express the anti-self-duality condition in terms of the Riemannian Ricci forms with respect to the associated para-quaternionic structure.
