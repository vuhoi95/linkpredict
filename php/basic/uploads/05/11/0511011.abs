Title: On effective F-theory action in type IIA compactifications
Authors: Igor Kriz and Hao Xing
Abstract: Diaconescu, Moore and Witten proved that the partition function of type IIA string theory coincides (to the extent checked) with the partition function of M-theory. One of us (Kriz) and Sati proposed in a previous paper a refinement of the IIA partition function using elliptic cohomology and conjectured that it coincides with a partition function coming from F-theory. In this paper, we define the geometric term of the F-theoretical effective action on type IIA compactifications. In the special case when the first Pontrjagin class of spacetime vanishes, we also prove a version of the Kriz-Sati conjecture by extending the arguments of Diaconescu-Moore-Witten. We also briefly discuss why even this special case contains interesting examples.
