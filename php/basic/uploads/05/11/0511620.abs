Title: Increase of the electron-positron Hawking radiation from Schwarzschild  black holes by Dirac monopoles
Authors: Yu. P. Goncharov and N. E. Firsova
Abstract: An algorithm for numerical computation of the barrier transparency for the potentials surrounding Schwarzschild black holes is described for massive spinor particles. It is then applied to calculate the total (including electronic neutrino and the contributions of twisted field configurations connected with Dirac monopoles) luminosity for the electron-positron Hawking radiation from a Schwarzschild black hole with mass $M=10^{15}$ g. It is found that the contribution due to monopoles can be of order 12% of the total electron-positron luminosity.
