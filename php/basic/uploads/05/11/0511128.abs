Title: Curvaton reheating in tachyonic inflationary models
Authors: C. Campuzano and S. del Campo and R. Herrera
Abstract: The curvaton reheating in a tachyonic inflationary universe model with an exponential potential is studied. We have found that the energy density in the kinetic epoch, has a complicated dependencies of the scale factor. For different scenarios, the temperature of reheating is computed. These temperature result to be analogous to those obtained in the standard case of the curvaton scenario.
