Title: Adiabatic-Impulse approximation for avoided level crossings: from phase  transition dynamics to Landau-Zener evolutions and back again
Authors: Bogdan Damski and Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: We show that a simple approximation based on concepts underlying the Kibble-Zurek theory of second order phase transition dynamics can be used to treat avoided level crossing problems. The approach discussed in this paper provides an intuitive insight into quantum dynamics of two level systems, and may serve as a link between the theory of dynamics of classical and quantum phase transitions. To illustrate these ideas we analyze dynamics of a paramagnet-ferromagnet quantum phase transition in the Ising model. We also present exact unpublished solutions of the Landau-Zener like problems.
