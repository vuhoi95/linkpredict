Title: A note on the Coulomb branch of susy Yang-Mills
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz
Abstract: We compute the force between oppositely charged W bosons in the large N limit of Yang-Mills with 16 supercharges broken to SU(N) x U(1) by a finite Higgs vev. We clarify some issues regarding Wilson line computations and show that there is a regime in which the force between W bosons is independent of separation distance.
