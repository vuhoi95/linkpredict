Title: "Root" Action for N=4 Supersymmetric Mechanics Theories
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Marrani and E. Orazi
Abstract: We propose to consider the N=4,d=1 supermultiplet with $% (4,4,0) component content as a ``root'' one. We elaborate a new reduction scheme from the ``root'' multiplet to supermultiplets with a smaller number of physical bosons. Starting from the most general sigma-model type action for the ``root'' multiplet, we explicitly demonstrate that the actions for the rest of linear and nonlinear N=4 supermultiplets can be easily obtained by reduction. Within the proposed reduction scheme there is a natural possibility to introduce Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. In the reduced systems, such terms give rise to potential terms, and in some cases also to terms describing the interaction with a magnetic field. We demonstrate that known N=4 superconformal actions, together with their possible interactions, appear as results of the reduction from a free action for the ``root'' supermultiplet. As a byproduct, we also construct an N=4 supersymmetric action for the linear (3,4,1) supermultiplet, containing both an interaction with a Dirac monopole and a harmonic oscillator-type potential, generalized for arbitrary conformally flat metrics.
