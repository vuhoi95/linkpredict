Title: Baxter Q-operators of the XXZ chain and R-matrix factorization
Authors: S. Derkachov and D. Karakhanyan and R. Kirschner
Abstract: We construct Baxter operators as generalized transfer matrices being traces of products of generic $R$ matrices. The latter are shown to factorize into simpler operators allowing for explicit expressions in terms of functions of a Weyl pair of basic operators. These explicit expressions are the basis for explicit expression for Baxter Q-operators and for investigating their properties.
