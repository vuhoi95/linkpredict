Title: Flipped SU(5) From D-branes With Type IIB Fluxes
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and V. E. Mayes and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We construct flipped SU(5) GUT models as Type IIB flux vacua on $\Z_2\times \Z_2$ orientifolds. Turning on supergravity self-dual NSNS and RR three-form fluxes fixes the toroidal complex structure moduli and the dilaton. We give a specific example of a three-generation flipped SU(5) model with a complete Higgs sector where supersymmetry is softly broken by the supergravity fluxes in the closed string sector. All of the required Yukawa couplings are present if global U(1) factors resulting from a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism are broken spontaneously or by world-sheet instantons. In addition, the model contains extra chiral and vector-like matter, potentially of mass $\mathcal{O}(M_{string})$ via trilinear superpotential couplings.
