Title: Spin Calogero models and dynamical r-matrices
Authors: L. Feher and B. G. Pusztai
Abstract: The main point of the construction of spin Calogero type classical integrable systems based on dynamical r-matrices, developed by L.-C. Li and P. Xu, is reviewed. It is shown that non-Abelian dynamical r-matrices with variables in a reductive Lie algebra ${\cal F}$ and their Abelian counterparts with variables in a Cartan subalgebra of ${\cal F}$ lead essentially to the same models.
