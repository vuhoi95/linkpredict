Title: Hawking radiation of charged particles as tunneling from  Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes with a global monopole
Authors: Qing-Quan Jiang and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: Applying Parikh's semi-classical tunneling method, we consider Hawking radiation of the charged massive particles as a tunneling process from the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black hole with a global monopole. The result shows that the tunneling rate is related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the radiant spectrum is not a pure thermal one, but is consistent with an underlying unitary theory.
