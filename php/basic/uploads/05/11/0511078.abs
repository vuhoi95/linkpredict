Title: The RR charges of A-type Gepner models
Authors: Claudio Caviezel and Stefan Fredenhagen and Matthias R. Gaberdiel
Abstract: It is shown that the RR charges of Gepner models are not all accounted for by the usual tensor product and permutation branes. In order to characterise the missing D-branes we study the matrix factorisation approach to the description of D-branes for Gepner models. For each of the A-type models we identify a set of matrix factorisations whose charges generate the full lattice of quantised charges. The additional factorisations that are required correspond to generalised permutation branes.
