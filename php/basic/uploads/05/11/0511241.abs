Title: Central Charges in Non(anti)commutative N=2 Supersymmetric U(N) Gauge  Theory
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: We study the central charge of the deformed N=(1,0) supersymmetry algebra in non(anti)commutative N=2 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory. In the cases of N=1/2 superspace and N=2 harmonic superspace with the singlet deformation, we find that the central charge is deformed by the non(anti)commutative parameters but depends on the electric and magnetic charges. For generic deformation of N=2 harmonic superspace, we compute the O(C) correction to the central charges in the case of U(1) gauge group.
