Title: Graviton and Spherical Graviton Potentials in Plane-Wave Matrix Model -  overview and perspective -
Authors: Hyeonjoon Shin and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We briefly review our works for graviton and spherical graviton potentials in a plane-wave matrix model. To compute them, it is necessary to devise a configuration of the graviton solutions, since the plane-wave matrix model includes mass terms and hence the gravitons are not free particles as in the BFSS matrix model but harmonic oscillators or rotating particles. The configuration we proposed consists of a rotating graviton and an elliptically rotating graviton. It is applied to the two-body interaction of spherical gravitons in the SO(6) symmetric space, and then to that of point-like gravitons in the SO(3) symmetric space. In both cases the leading term of the resulting potential is 1/r^7. This result strongly suggests that the potentials should be closely related to the light-front eleven-dimensional supergravity linearized around the pp-wave background.
