Title: Comments on Long-Wavelength Backreaction and Dark Energy
Authors: E. W. Kolb and S. Matarrese and A. Riotto
Abstract: In this brief note we comment on a recent attempt by Martineau and Brandenberger (astro-ph/0510523) to explain the acceleration of the Universe using the back-reaction of long-wavelength perturbations associated with isocurvature perturbation modes.
