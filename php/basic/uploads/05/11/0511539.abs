Title: Geometric effects on critical behaviours of the Ising model
Authors: Hiroyuki Shima and Yasunori Sakaniwa
Abstract: We investigate the critical behaviour of the two-dimensional Ising model defined on a curved surface with a constant negative curvature. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that the critical exponents for the zero-field magnetic susceptibility and the correlation length deviate from those for the Ising lattice model on a flat plane. Furthermore, when reducing the effects of boundary spins, the values of the critical exponents tend to those derived from the mean field theory. These findings evidence that the underlying geometric character is responsible for the critical properties the Ising model when the lattice is embedded on negatively curved surfaces.
