Title: Classification of the solutions of constant rational semi-dynamical  reflection equations
Authors: Jean Avan and Genevieve Rollet
Abstract: We propose a classification of the solutions K to the semi-dynamical reflection equation with constant rational structure matrices associated to rational scalar Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. Four sets of solutions are identified and simple analytic transformations generate all solutions from these sets.
