Title: Scaling, self-similar solutions and shock waves for V-shaped field  potentials
Authors: H. Arodz and P. Klimas and T. Tyranowski
Abstract: We investigate a (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear field theoretic model with the field potential $V(\phi)| = |\phi|.$ It can be obtained as the universal small amplitude limit in a class of models with potentials which are symmetrically V-shaped at their minima, or as a continuum limit of certain mechanical system with infinite number of degrees of freedom. The model has an interesting scaling symmetry of the 'on shell' type. We find self-similar as well as shock wave solutions of the field equation in that model.
