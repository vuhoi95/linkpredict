Title: Twistors of Almost Quaternionic Manifolds
Authors: Stefan Ivanov and Ivan Minchev and Simeon Zamkovoy
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of almost complex structures on the twistor space of an almost quaternionic manifold constructed with the help of a quaternionic connection. We show that if there is an integrable structure it is independent on the quaternionic connection. In dimension four, we express the anti-self-duality condition in terms of the Riemannian Ricci forms with respect to the associated quaternionic structure.
