Title: On an Exact Cosmological Solution of Higher Spin Gauge Theory
Authors: E. Sezgin and P. Sundell
Abstract: We review our recent exact solution to four-dimensional higher spin gauge theory invariant under a higher spin extension of SO(3,1) and we comment on its cosmological interpretation. We find an effective Einstein-scalar field theory that admits this solution, and we highlight the significance of the Einstein frame and what we call higher spin frame in the cosmological interpretation of the solution. We also compare the properties of the solution with those based on an Einstein-scalar system that arises in a consistent truncation of gauged N=8,D=4 supergravity.
