Title: Emergent geometry from q-deformations of N=4 super Yang-Mills
Authors: David Berenstein and Diego H. Correa
Abstract: We study BPS states in a marginal deformation of super Yang-Mills on R x S^3 using a quantum mechanical system of q-commuting matrices. We focus mainly on the case where the parameter q is a root of unity, so that the AdS dual of the field theory can be associated to an orbifold of AdS_5x S^5. We show that in the large N limit, BPS states are described by density distributions of eigenvalues and we assign to these distributions a geometrical spacetime interpretation. We go beyond BPS configurations by turning on perturbative non-q-commuting excitations. Considering states in an appropriate BMN limit, we use a saddle point approximation to compute the BMN energy to all perturbative orders in the 't Hooft coupling. We also examine some BMN like states that correspond to twisted sector string states in the orbifold and we show that our geometrical interpretation of the system is consistent with the quantum numbers of the corresponding states under the quantum symmetry of the orbifold.
