Title: Topological Mass Generation in Four Dimensions
Authors: Gia Dvali and R. Jackiw and So - Young Pi
Abstract: Schwinger's mechanism for mass generation relies on topological structures of a 2-dimensional gauge theory. In the same manner, corresponding 4-dimensional topological entities give rise to topological mass generation in four dimensions.
