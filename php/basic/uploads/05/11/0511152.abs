Title: Conifold geometries, matrix models and quantum solutions
Authors: G. Bonelli and L. Bonora and A. Ricco
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of hepth/0507224 where open topological B-models describing D-branes on 2-cycles of local Calabi--Yau geometries with conical singularities were studied. After a short review, the paper expands in particular on two aspects: the gauge fixing problem in the reduction to two dimensions and the quantum matrix model solutions.
