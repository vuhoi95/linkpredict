Title: Quivers, Tilings, Branes and Rhombi
Authors: Amihay Hanany and David Vegh
Abstract: We describe a simple algorithm that computes the recently discovered brane tilings for a given generic toric singular Calabi-Yau threefold. This therefore gives AdS/CFT dual quiver gauge theories for D3-branes probing the given non-compact manifold. The algorithm solves a longstanding problem by computing superpotentials for these theories directly from the toric diagram of the singularity. We study the parameter space of a-maximization; this study is made possible by identifying the R-charges of bifundamental fields as angles in the brane tiling. We also study Seiberg duality from a new perspective.
