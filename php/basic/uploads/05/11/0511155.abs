Title: Matrix Factorizations and Representations of Quivers II: type ADE case
Authors: Hiroshige Kajiura and Kyoji Saito and Atsushi Takahashi
Abstract: We study a triangulated category of graded matrix factorizations for a polynomial of type ADE. We show that it is equivalent to the derived category of finitely generated modules over the path algebra of the corresponding Dynkin quiver. Also, we discuss a special stability condition for the triangulated category in the sense of T. Bridgeland, which is naturally defined by the grading.
