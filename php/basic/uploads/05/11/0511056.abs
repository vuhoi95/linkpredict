Title: Quasinormal modes for arbitrary spins in the Schwarzschild background
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and G. Yu. Ruban
Abstract: The leading term of the asymptotic of quasinormal modes in the Schwarzschild background, omega_n = - i n/2, is obtained in two straightforward analytical ways for arbitrary spins. One of these approaches requires almost no calculations. As simply we demonstrate that for any odd integer spin, described by the Teukolsky equation, the first correction to the leading term vanishes. Then, this correction for half-integer spins is obtained in a slightly more intricate way. At last, we derive analytically the general expression for the first correction for all spins, described by the Teukolsky equation.
