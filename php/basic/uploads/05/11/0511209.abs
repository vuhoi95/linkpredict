Title: Knot soliton models, submodels, and their symmetries
Authors: C. Adam and J. Sanchez-Guillen
Abstract: For some non-linear field theories which allow for soliton solutions, submodels with infinitely many conservation laws can be defined. Here we investigate the symmetries of the submodels, where in some cases we find a symmetry enhancement for the submodels, whereas in others we do not.
