Title: A Fly in the SOUP
Authors: R. Holman and L. Mersini-Houghton
Abstract: We investigate the Selection of Original Universe Proposal (SOUP) of Tye et al. and show that as it stands, this proposal is flawed. The corrections to the Euclidean gravity action that were to select a Universe with a sufficiently large value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to allow for an inflationary phase, only serve to {\it renormalize} the cosmological constant so that $\Lambda \to \Lambda_{\rm eff}$, thereby reintroducing the issue of how to select the initial conditions allowing for inflation in the early Universe.
