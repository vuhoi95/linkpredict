Title: E10 Cosmology
Authors: Axel Kleinschmidt and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We construct simple exact solutions to the E10/K(E10) coset model by exploiting its integrability. Using the known correspondences with the bosonic sectors of maximal supergravity theories, these exact solutions translate into exact cosmological solutions. In this way, we are able to recover some recently discovered solutions of M-theory exhibiting phases of accelerated expansion, or, equivalently, S-brane solutions, and thereby accommodate such solutions within the E10/K(E10) model. We also discuss the difficulties regarding solutions with non-vanishing (constant) curvature of the internal manifold.
