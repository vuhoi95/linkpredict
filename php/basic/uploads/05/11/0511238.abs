Title: One more observational consequence of many-worlds quantum theory
Authors: A. V. Yurov and V. A. Yurov
Abstract: Using new cosmological doomsday argument Page predicts that the maximal lifetime of de Sitter universe should be $t_{max}=10^{60}$ yr which is way too small in comparison with strings predictions ($t_f>$googleplex). However, since this prediction is dependant on the total number of human observations, we show that Page arguments results instead in astounding conclusion that this number is the quantum variable and is therefore much greater then Page's estimation. Identifying it with the number of coarse-grained histories in de Sitter universe we get the lifetime of the universe comparable with strings predictions. Moreover, it seems that this result can be considered as another one of the observational evidences of validity of the many-worlds quantum theory. Finally, we show that for the universe filled with phantom energy $t_{max}\sim t_f$ up to very high precision.
