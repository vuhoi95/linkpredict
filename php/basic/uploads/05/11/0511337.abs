Title: Non commutative finite dimensional manifolds II. Moduli space and  structure of non commutative 3-spheres
Authors: Alain Connes and Michel Dubois-Violette
Abstract: This paper contains detailed proofs of our results on the moduli space and the structure of noncommutative 3-spheres. We develop the notion of central quadratic form for quadratic algebras, and a general theory which creates a bridge between noncommutative differential geometry and its purely algebraic counterpart. It allows to construct a morphism from an involutive quadratic algebras to a C*-algebra constructed from the characteristic variety and the hermitian line bundle associated to the central quadratic form. We apply the general theory in the case of noncommutative 3-spheres and show that the above morphism corresponds to a natural ramified covering by a noncommutative 3-dimensional nilmanifold. We then compute the Jacobian of the ramified covering and obtain the answer as the product of a period (of an elliptic integral) by a rational function. We describe the real and complex moduli spaces of noncommutative 3-spheres, relate the real one to root systems and the complex one to the orbits of a birational cubic automorphism of three dimensional projective space. We classify the algebras and establish duality relations between them.
