Title: Consistent discretization and canonical classical and quantum Regge  calculus
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We apply the ``consistent discretization'' technique to the Regge action for (Euclidean and Lorentzian) general relativity in arbitrary number of dimensions. The result is a well defined canonical theory that is free of constraints and where the dynamics is implemented as a canonical transformation. This provides a framework for the discussion of topology change in canonical quantum gravity. In the Lorentzian case, the framework appears to be naturally free of the ``spikes'' that plague traditional formulations. It also provides a well defined recipe for determining the measure of the path integral.
