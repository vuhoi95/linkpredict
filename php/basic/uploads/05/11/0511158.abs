Title: Supersymmetric completion of M-theory 4D-gauge algebra from twisted tori  and fluxes
Authors: Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio Ferrara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We present the supersymmetric completion of the M-theory free differential algebra resulting from a compactification to four dimensions on a twisted seven-torus with 4-form and 7-form fluxes turned on. The super--curvatures are given and the local supersymmetry transformations derived. Dual formulations of the theory are discussed in connection with classes of gaugings corresponding to diverse choices of vacua. This also includes seven dimensional compactifications on more general spaces not described by group manifolds.
