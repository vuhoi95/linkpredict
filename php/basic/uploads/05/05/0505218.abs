Title: Casimir effect for thin films from imperfect materials
Authors: V. N. Markov and Yu. M. Pis'mak
Abstract: We propose an approach for investigation of interaction of thin material films with quantum electrodynamic fields. Using main principles of quantum electrodynamics (locality, gauge invariance, renormalizability) we construct a single model for Casimir-like phenomena arising near the film boundary on distances much larger then Compton wavelength of the electron where fluctuations of Dirac fields are not essential. In this model the thin film is presented by a singular background field concentrated on a 2-dimensional surface. All properties of the film material are described by one dimensionless parameter. For two parallel plane films we calculate the photon propagator and the Casimir force, which appears to be dependent on film material and can be both attractive and repulsive. We consider also an interaction of plane film with point charge and straight line current. Here, besides usual results of classical electrodynamics the model predicts appearance of anomalous electric and magnetic fields.
