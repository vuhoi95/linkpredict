Title: Gauge invariants and Killing tensors in higher-spin gauge theories
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger
Abstract: In free completely symmetric tensor gauge field theories on Minkowski space-time, all gauge invariant functions and Killing tensor fields are computed, both on-shell and off-shell. These problems are addressed in the metric-like formalisms.
