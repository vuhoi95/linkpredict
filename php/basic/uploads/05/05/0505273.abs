Title: An Oscillon in the SU(2) Gauged Higgs Model

Abstract: We study classical dynamics in the spherical ansatz for the SU(2) gauge and Higgs fields of the electroweak Standard Model in the absence of fermions and the photon. With the Higgs boson mass equal to twice the gauge boson mass, we numerically demonstrate the existence of oscillons, extremely long-lived localized configurations that undergo regular oscillations in time. We have only seen oscillons in this reduced theory when the masses are in a two-to-one ratio. If a similar phenomenon were to persist in the full theory, it would suggest a preferred value for the Higgs mass.
