Title: Inflaton field governed universe from NKK theory of gravity: stochastic  approach
Authors: Mariano Anabitarte and Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We study a nonperturbative single field (inflaton) governed cosmological model from a 5D Noncompact Kaluza-Klein (NKK) theory of gravity. The inflaton field fluctuations are estimated for different epochs of the evolution of the universe. We conclude that the inflaton field has been sliding down its (quadratic) potential hill along all the evolution of the universe and a mass of the order of the Hubble parameter. In the model here developed the only free parameter is the Hubble parameter, which could be reconstructed in future from Super Nova Acceleration Probe (SNAP) data.
