Title: Type III Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions
Authors: A. Fuster and J. W. van Holten
Abstract: We construct two distinct classes of exact type III solutions of the D=4 Einstein-Yang-Mills system. The solutions are embeddings of the non-abelian plane waves in spacetimes in Kundt's class. Reduction of the solutions to type N leads to generalized $pp$ and Kundt waves. The geodesic equations are briefly discussed.
