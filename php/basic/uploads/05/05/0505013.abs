Title: Strange Quark Matter Attached to the String Cloud in the Spherical  Symmetric Space-Time Admitting Conformal Motion
Authors: İ. Yavuz and İ. Yılmaz and H. Baysal
Abstract: In this paper, we have examined charged strange quark matter attached to the string cloud in the spherical symmetric space-time admitting one-parameter group of conformal motions. For this purpose, we have solved Einstein's field equations for spherical symmetric space-time with strange quark matter attached to the string cloud via conformal motions. Also, we have discussed the features of the obtained solutions.
