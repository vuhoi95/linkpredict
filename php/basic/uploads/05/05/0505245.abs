Title: Seiberg-Witten maps and commutator anomalies in noncommutative  electrodynamics
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Kuldeep Kumar
Abstract: We exploit the Seiberg-Witten maps for fields and currents in a U(1) gauge theory relating the noncommutative and commutative (usual) descriptions to obtain the O(\theta) structure of the commutator anomalies in noncommutative electrodynamics. These commutators involve the (covariant) current-current algebra and the (covariant) current-field algebra. We also establish the compatibility of the anomalous commutators with the noncommutative covariant anomaly through the use of certain consistency conditions derived here.
