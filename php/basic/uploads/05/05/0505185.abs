Title: General Supersymmetric Solutions of Five-Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: The classification of 1/4-supersymmetric solutions of five dimensional gauged supergravity coupled to arbitrary many abelian vector multiplets, which was initiated in hep-th/0401129, is completed. The structure of all solutions for which the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is null is investigated in both the gauged and the ungauged theories and some new solutions are constructed.
