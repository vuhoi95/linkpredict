Title: Accelerating Universes from Short-Range Interactions
Authors: Alberto Diez-Tejedor and Alexander Feinstein
Abstract: We show that short-range interactions between the fundamental particles in the universe can drive a period of accelerated expansion. This description fits the early universe. In the present day universe, if one postulates short-range interactions or a sort of "shielded gravity", the picture may repeat.
