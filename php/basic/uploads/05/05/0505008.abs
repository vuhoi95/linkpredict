Title: SO(N) Reformulated Link Invariants from Topological Strings
Authors: Pravina Borhade and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: Large N duality conjecture between U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory on $S^3$ and A-model topological string theory on the resolved conifold was verified at the level of partition function and Wilson loop observables. As a consequence, the conjectured form for the expectation value of the topological operators in A-model string theory led to a reformulation of link invariants in U(N) Chern-Simons theory giving new polynomial invariants whose integer coefficients could be given a topological meaning. We show that the A-model topological operator involving SO(N) holonomy leads to a reformulation of link invariants in SO(N) Chern-Simons theory. Surprisingly, the SO(N) reformulated invariants also has a similar form with integer coefficients. The topological meaning of the integer coefficients needs to be explored from the duality conjecture relating SO(N) Chern-Simons theory to A-model closed string theory on orientifold of the resolved conifold background.
