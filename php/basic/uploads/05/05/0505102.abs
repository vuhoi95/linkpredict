Title: Photon emission in a constant magnetic field in 2+1 dimensional  space-time
Authors: J. T. S. Amaral and S. I. Zlatev
Abstract: We calculate by the proper-time method the amplitude of the two-photon emission by a charged fermion in a constant magnetic field in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The relevant dynamics reduces to that of a supesymmetric quantum-mechanical system with one bosonic and one fermionic degrees of freedom.
