Title: Adding flavor to the gravity dual of non-commutative gauge theories
Authors: Daniel Arean and Angel Paredes and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the addition of flavor degrees of freedom to the supergravity dual of the non-commutative deformation of the maximally supersymmetric gauge theories. By considering D7 flavor branes in the probe approximation and studying their fluctuations we extract the spectrum of scalar and vector mesons as a function of the non-commutativity. We find that the spectrum for very large non-commutative parameter is equal to the one in the commutative theory, while for some intermediate values of the non-commutativity some of the modes disappear from the discrete spectrum. We also study the semiclassical dynamics of rotating open strings attached to the D7-brane, which correspond to mesons with large spin. Under the effect of the non-commutativity the open strings get tilted. However, at small(large) distances they display the same Regge-like (Coulombic) behaviour as in the commutative theory. We also consider the addition of D5-flavor branes to the non-commutative deformation of the N=1 supersymmetric Maldacena-Nunez background.
