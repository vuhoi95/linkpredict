Abstract: We present the results of an analysis of superradiant energy flow due to scalar fields incident on an acoustic black hole. In addition to providing independent confirmation of the recent results in [5], we determine in detail the profile of energy flow everywhere outside the horizon. We confirm explicitly that in a suitable frame the energy flow is inward at the horizon and outward at infinity, as expected on physical grounds.
