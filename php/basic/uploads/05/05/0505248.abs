Title: One-loop renormalisation of general N=1/2 supersymmetric gauge theory
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and L. A. Worthy
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop renormalisability of a general N=1/2 supersymmetric gauge theory coupled to chiral matter, and show the existence of an N=1/2 supersymmetric SU(N)xU(1) theory which is renormalisable at one loop.
