Authors: L. G. Aldrovandi and F. A. Schaposnik and G. A. Silva
Abstract: We consider non(anti)commutative superspace with coordinate dependent deformation parameters $C^{\alpha\beta}$. We show that a chiral ${\cal N}=1/2$ supersymmetry can be defined and that chiral and antichiral superfields are still closed under the Moyal-Weyl associative product implementing the deformation. A consistent ${\cal N}=1/2$ Super Yang-Mills deformed theory can be constructed provided $C^{\alpha\beta}$ satisfies a suitable condition which can be connected with the graviphoton background at the origin of the deformation. After adding matter we also discuss the Konishi anomaly and the gluino condensation.
