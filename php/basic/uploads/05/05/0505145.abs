Title: Braneworld resonances
Authors: Chris Clarkson and Sanjeev S. Seahra
Abstract: We investigate in detail gravitational waves in an Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter bulk spacetime surrounded by an Einstein static brane with generic matter content. Such a model provides a useful analogy to braneworld cosmology at various stages of its evolution, and generalizes our previous work [gr-qc/0504023] on pure tension Einstein-static branes. We find that the behaviour of tensor-mode perturbations is completely dominated by quasi-normal modes, and we use a variety of numeric and analytic techniques to find the frequencies and lifetimes of these excitations. The parameter space governing the model yields a rich variety of resonant phenomena, which we thoroughly explore. We find that certain configurations can support a number of lightly damped `quasi-bound states'. A zero-mode which reproduces 4-dimensional general relativity is recovered on infinitely large branes. We also examine the problem in the time domain using Green's function techniques in addition to direct numeric integration. We conclude by discussing how the quasi-normal resonances we find here can impact on braneworld cosmology.
