Title: Bazhanov-Stroganov model from 3D approach
Authors: G. von Gehlen and S. Pakuliak and S. Sergeev
Abstract: We apply a 3-dimensional approach to describe a new parametrization of the L-operators for the 2-dimensional Bazhanov-Stroganov (BS) integrable spin model related to the chiral Potts model. This parametrization is based on the solution of the associated classical discrete integrable system. Using a 3-dimensional vertex satisfying a modified tetrahedron equation, we construct an operator which generalizes the BS quantum intertwining matrix S. This operator describes the isospectral deformations of the integrable BS model.
