Title: From non-degenerate conducting polymers to dense matter in the massive  Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Michael Thies and Konrad Urlichs
Abstract: Using results from the theory of non-degenerate conducting polymers like cis-polyacetylene, we generalize our previous work on dense baryonic matter and the soliton crystal in the massless Gross-Neveu model to finite bare fermion mass. In the large N limit, the exact crystal ground state can be constructed analytically, in close analogy to the bipolaron lattice in polymers. These findings are contrasted to the standard scenario with homogeneous phases only and a first order phase transition at a critical chemical potential.
