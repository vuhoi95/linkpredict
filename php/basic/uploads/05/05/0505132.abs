Title: Extended supersymmetry and its reduction on a circle with point  singularities
Authors: Tomoaki Nagasawa and Makoto Sakamoto and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We investigate $N$-extended supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics on a circle with point singularities. For any integer $n$, $N=2n+1$ supercharges are explicitly constructed in terms of discrete transformations, and a class of singularities compatible with supersymmetry is clarified. In our formulation, the supersymmetry can be reduced to $M$-extended supersymmetry for any integer $M<N$. The degeneracy of the spectrum and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking are also studied.
