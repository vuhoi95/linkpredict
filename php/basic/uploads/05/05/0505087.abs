Title: Smooth dynamical (de)-phantomization of a scalar field in simple  cosmological models
Authors: Alexander A. Andrianov and Francesco Cannata and Alexander Y. Kamenshchik
Abstract: Simple scalar field cosmological models are considered describing gravity assisted crossing of the phantom divide line. This crossing or (de)-phantomization characterized by the change of the sign of the kinetic term of the scalar field is smooth and driven dynamically by the Einstein equations. Different cosmological scenarios, including the phantom phase of matter are sketched.
