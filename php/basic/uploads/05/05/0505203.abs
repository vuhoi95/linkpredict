Title: The Stoyanovsky-Ribault-Teschner Map and String Scattering Amplitudes
Authors: Gaston Giribet and Yu Nakayama
Abstract: Recently, Ribault and Teschner pointed out the existence of a one-to-one correspondence between N-point correlation functions for the SL(2,C)_k/SU(2) WZNW model on the sphere and certain set of 2N-2-point correlation functions in Liouville field theory. This result is based on a seminal work by Stoyanovsky. Here, we discuss the implications of this correspondence focusing on its application to string theory on curved backgrounds. For instance, we analyze how the divergences corresponding to worldsheet instantons in AdS_3 can be understood as arising from the insertion of the dual screening operator in the Liouville theory side. We also study the pole structure of N-point functions in the 2D Euclidean black hole and its holographic meaning in terms of the Little String Theory. This enables us to interpret the correspondence between CFTs as encoding a LSZ-type reduction procedure. Furthermore, we discuss the scattering amplitudes violating the winding number conservation in those backgrounds and provide a formula connecting such amplitudes with observables in Liouville field theory. Finally, we study the WZNW correlation functions in the limit k -> 0 and show that, at the point k=0, the Stoyanovsky-Ribault-Teschner dictionary turns out to be in agreement with the FZZ conjecture at a particular point of the space of parameters where the Liouville central charge becomes c=-2. This result makes contact with recent studies on the dynamical tachyon condensation in closed string theory.
