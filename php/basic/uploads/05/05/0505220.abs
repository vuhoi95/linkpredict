Authors: V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and A. Simoni and A. Stern and F. Ventriglia
Abstract: The quantum-classical limits for quantum tomograms are studied and compared with the corresponding classical tomograms, using two different definitions for the limit. One is the Planck limit where $\hbar \to 0$ in all $\hbar $-dependent physical observables, and the other is the Ehrenfest limit where $\hbar \to 0$ while keeping constant the mean value of the energy.The Ehrenfest limit of eigenstate tomograms for a particle in a box and a harmonic oscillatoris shown to agree with the corresponding classical tomograms of phase-space distributions, after a time averaging. The Planck limit of superposition state tomograms of the harmonic oscillator demostrating the decreasing contribution of interferences terms as $\hbar \to 0$.
