Title: Higher Derivative Operators from Transmission of Supersymmetry Breaking  on S_1/Z_2
Authors: D. M. Ghilencea and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We discuss the role that higher derivative operators play in field theory orbifold compactifications on S_1/Z_2 with local and non-local (Scherk-Schwarz) breaking of supersymmetry. Integrating out the bulk fields generates brane-localised higher derivative counterterms to the mass of the brane (or zero-mode of the bulk) scalar field, identified with the Higgs field in many realistic models. Both Yukawa and gauge interactions are considered and the one-loop results found can be used to study the ``running'' of the scalar field mass with respect to the momentum scale in 5D orbifolds. In particular this allows the study of the behaviour of the mass under UV scaling of the momentum. The relation between supersymmetry breaking and the presence of higher derivative counterterms to the mass of the scalar field is investigated. This shows that, regardless of the breaking mechanism, (initial) supersymmetry cannot, in general, prevent the emergence of such operators. Some implications for phenomenology of the higher derivative operators are also presented.
