Title: Hawking Radiation as Tunneling through the Quantum Horizon
Authors: Michele Arzano and A. J. M. Medved and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: Planck-scale corrections to the black-hole radiation spectrum in the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling framework are calculated. The corrective terms arise from modifications in the expression of the surface gravity in terms of the mass-energy of the black hole-emitted particle system. The form of the new spectrum is discussed together with the possible consequences for the fate of black holes in the late stages of evaporation.
