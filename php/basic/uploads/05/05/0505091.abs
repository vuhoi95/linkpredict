Title: The Holographic Principle and the Early Universe
Authors: F. Canfora and G. Vilasi
Abstract: A scenario is proposed in which the matter-antimatter asymmetry behaves like a seed for the inflationary phase of the universe. The mechanism which makes this scenario plausible is the holographic principle: this scheme is supported by a good prediction of the number of e-folds. It seems that such a mechanism can only work in the presence of a Hagedorn-like phase transition. The issue of the "graceful exit" can also be naturally accounted for.
