Title: High-Energy Scattering in Non-Commutative Field Theory
Authors: Jason Kumar and Arvind Rajaraman
Abstract: We analyze high energy scattering for non-commutative field theories using the dual gravity description. We find that the Froissart-Martin bound still holds, but that cross-sections stretch in the non-commutative directions in a way dependent on the infrared cutoff. This puzzling behavior suggests new aspects of UV/IR mixing.
