Title: Doubly Periodic Instanton Zero Modes
Authors: Chris Ford and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: Fermionic zero modes associated with doubly periodic SU(2) instantons of unit charge are considered. In cases where the action density exhibits two `instanton cores' the zero mode peaks on one of four line-segments joining the two constituents. Which of the four possibilities is realised depends on the fermionic boundary conditions; doubly periodic, doubly anti-periodic or mixed.
