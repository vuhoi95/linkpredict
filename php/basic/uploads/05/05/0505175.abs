Title: Hologrphy and holographic dark energy model
Authors: Yungui Gong and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: The holographic principle is used to discuss the holographic dark energy model. We find that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound is far from saturation under certain conditions. A more general constraint on the parameter of the holographic dark energy model is also derived.
