Title: Effective action of (massive) IIA on manifolds with SU(3) structure
Authors: Thomas House and Eran Palti
Abstract: In this paper we consider compactifications of massive type IIA supergravity on manifolds with SU(3) structure. We derive the gravitino mass matrix of the effective four-dimensional N = 2 theory and show that vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields naturally induce spontaneous partial supersymmetry breaking. We go on to derive the superpotential and the Kaehler potential for the resulting N = 1 theories. As an example we consider the SU(3) structure manifold SU(3)/U(1)xU(1) and explicitly find N = 1 supersymmetric minima where all the moduli are stabilised at non-trivial values without the use of non-perturbative effects.
