Title: Slow-roll Inflation for Generalized Two-Field Lagrangians
Authors: Fabrizio Di Marco and Fabio Finelli
Abstract: We study the slow-roll regime of two field inflation, in which the two fields are also coupled through their kinetic terms. Such Lagrangians are motivated by particle physics and by scalar-tensor theories studied in the Einstein frame. We compute the power spectra of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations on large scales to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We discuss the relevance of the extra coupling terms for the amplitude and indexes of the power spectra. Beyond the consistency condition which involves the amplitude of gravitational waves, additional relations may be found in particular models based on such Lagrangians: as an example, we find an additional general consistency condition in implicit form for Brans-Dicke theory in the Einstein frame.
