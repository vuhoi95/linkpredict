Title: Equilibrium Positions and Eigenfunctions of Shape Invariant (`Discrete')  Quantum Mechanics
Authors: S. Odake and R. Sasaki
Abstract: Certain aspects of the integrability/solvability of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser systems and the Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen systems with rational and trigonometric potentials are reviewed. The equilibrium positions of classical multi-particle systems and the eigenfunctions of single-particle quantum mechanics are described by the same orthogonal polynomials: the Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi, continuous Hahn, Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials. The Hamiltonians of these single-particle quantum mechanical systems have two remarkable properties, factorization and shape invariance.
