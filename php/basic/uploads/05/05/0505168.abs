Title: Marginal Deformations with U(1)^3 Global Symmetry
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We generate new 11-dimensional supergravity solutions from deformations based on U(1)^3 symmetries. The initial geometries are of the form AdS_4 x Y_7, where Y_7 is a 7-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space. We consider a general family of cohomogeneity one Sasaki-Einstein spaces, as well as the recently-constructed cohomogeneity three L^{p,q,r,s} spaces. For certain cases, such as when the Sasaki-Einstein space is S^7, Q^{1,1,1} or M^{1,1,1}, the deformed gravity solutions correspond to a marginal deformation of a known dual gauge theory.
