Title: Superconformal Quantum Mechanics of Small Black Holes
Authors: Seok Kim and Joris Raeymaekers
Abstract: Recently, Gaiotto, Strominger and Yin have proposed a holographic dual description for the near-horizon physics of certain N=2 black holes in terms of the superconformal quantum mechanics on D0-branes in the attractor geometry. We provide further evidence for their proposal by applying it to the case of `small' black holes which have vanishing horizon area in the leading supergravity approximation. We consider 2-charge black holes in type IIA on $T^2 \times M$, where $M$ can be either $K_3$ or $T^4$, made up out of D0-branes and D4-branes wrapping $M$. We construct the corresponding superconformal quantum mechanics and show that the asymptotic growth of chiral primaries exactly matches with the known entropy of these black holes. The state-counting problem reduces to counting lowest Landau levels on $T^2$ and Dolbeault cohomology classes on $M$.
