Title: Dual interacting cosmologies and late accelerated expansion
Authors: Luis P. Chimento and Diego Pavon
Abstract: In this paper we show that by considering a universe dominated by two interacting components a superaccelerated expansion can be obtained from a decelerated one by applying a dual transformation that leaves the Einstein's field equations invariant.
