Title: 511 KeV photons from superconducting cosmic strings
Authors: Francesc Ferrer and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We show that a tangle of light superconducting strings in the Milky Way could be the source of the observed 511 KeV emission from electron-positron annihilation in the Galactic bulge. The scenario predicts a flux that is in agreement with observations if the strings are at the ~ 1 TeV scale making the particle physics within reach of planned accelerator experiments. The emission is directly proportional to the galactic magnetic field and future observations should be able to differentiate the superconducting string scenario from other proposals.
