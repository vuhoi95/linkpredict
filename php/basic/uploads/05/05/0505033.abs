Title: Merging gauge coupling constants without Grand Unification
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and G. E. Volovik
Abstract: The merging of the running couplings constants of the weak, strong, and electromagnetic fields does not require the unification of these gauge fields at high energy. It can, in fact, be the property of a general fermionic system in which gauge bosons are not fundamental.
