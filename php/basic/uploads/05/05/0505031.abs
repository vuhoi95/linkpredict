Title: Taming the Tachyon in Cubic String Field Theory
Authors: Erasmo Coletti and Ilya Sigalov and Washington Taylor
Abstract: We give evidence based on level-truncation computations that the rolling tachyon in cubic open string field theory (CSFT) has a well-defined but wildly oscillatory time-dependent solution which goes as $e^t$ for $t \to -\infty$. We show that a field redefinition taking the CSFT effective tachyon action to the analogous boundary string field theory (BSFT) action takes the oscillatory CSFT solution to the pure exponential solution $e^t$ of the BSFT action.
