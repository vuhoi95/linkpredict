Title: Multi Shell Model for Majumdar-Papapetrau Spacetimes
Authors: Metin Gurses and Burak Himmetoglu
Abstract: Exact solutions to static and non-static Einstein-Maxwell equations in the presence of extremely charged dust embedded on thin shells are constructed. Singularities of multi-black hole Majumdar-Papapetrou and Kastor-Trashen solutions are removed by placing the matter on thin shells. Double spherical thin shell solution is given as an illustration and the matter densitiies on the shells are derived.
