Title: Baryogenesis and CP-Violating Domain Walls in the Background of a  Magnetic Field
Authors: Leonardo Campanelli and Paolo Cea and Gian Luigi Fogli and Luigi Tedesco
Abstract: Within the domain wall-mediated electroweak baryogenesis, we study fermion scattering off a CP-violating wall in the background of an uniform magnetic field. In particular, we calculate the asymmetry between the reflection coefficients for right-handed and left-handed chiral fermions, \Delta R = R_{R \to L} - R_{L \to R}, which is of relevance to non local baryogenesis mechanisms.
