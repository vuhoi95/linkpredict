Title: Type IIA Moduli Stabilization
Authors: Oliver DeWolfe and Alexander Giryavets and Shamit Kachru and Washington Taylor
Abstract: We demonstrate that flux compactifications of type IIA string theory can classically stabilize all geometric moduli. For a particular orientifold background, we explicitly construct an infinite family of supersymmetric vacua with all moduli stabilized at arbitrarily large volume, weak coupling, and small negative cosmological constant. We obtain these solutions from both ten-dimensional and four-dimensional perspectives. For more general backgrounds, we study the equations for supersymmetric vacua coming from the effective superpotential and show that all geometric moduli can be stabilized by fluxes. We comment on the resulting picture of statistics on the landscape of vacua.
