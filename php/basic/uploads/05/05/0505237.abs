Title: Supersymmetric Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Yoshinobu Habara and Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We present an attempt to formulate the supersymmetric and relativistic quantum mechanics in the sense of realizing supersymmetry on the single particle level, by utilizing the equations of motion which is equivalent to the ordinary 2nd quantization of the chiral multiplet. The matrix formulation is used to express the operators such as supersymmtry generators and fields of the chiral multiplets. We realize supersymmetry prior to filling the Dirac sea.
