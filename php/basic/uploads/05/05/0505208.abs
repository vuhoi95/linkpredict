Title: A Stringy Test of Flux-Induced Isometry Gauging
Authors: Amir-Kian Kashani-Poor and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: Supergravity analysis suggests that the effect of fluxes in string theory compactifications is to gauge isometries of the scalar manifold. However, isometries are generically broken by brane instanton effects. Here we demonstrate how fluxes protect exactly those isometries from quantum corrections which are gauged according to the classical supergravity analysis. We also argue that all other isometries are generically broken.
