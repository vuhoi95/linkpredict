Title: A Stringy Wave Function for an S^3 Cosmology
Authors: Sergei Gukov and Kirill Saraikin and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: Using the recent observations of the relation between Hartle-Hawking wave function and topological string partition function, we propose a wave function for scalar metric fluctuations on S^3 embedded in a Calabi-Yau. This problem maps to a study of non-critical bosonic string propagating on a circle at the self-dual radius. This can be viewed as a stringy toy model for a quantum cosmology.
