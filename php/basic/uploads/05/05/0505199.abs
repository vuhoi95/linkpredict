Title: Dualities and signatures of G++ invariant theories
Authors: Sophie de Buyl and Laurent Houart and Nassiba Tabti
Abstract: The G++ content of the formulation of gravity and M-theories as very-extended Kac-Moody invariant theories is further analysed. The different exotic phases of all the G_B++ theories, which admit exact solutions describing intersecting branes smeared in all directions but one, are derived. This is achieved by analysing for all G++ the signatures which are related to the conventional one (1,D-1) by `dualities' generated by the Weyl reflections.
