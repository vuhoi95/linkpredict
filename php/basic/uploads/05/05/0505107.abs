Title: Spherical Deconstruction
Authors: R. P. Andrews and N. Dorey
Abstract: We present evidence that N=1* SUSY Yang-Mills provides a deconstruction of a six-dimensional gauge theory compactified on a two-sphere. The six-dimensional theory is a twisted compactification of N=(1,1) SUSY Yang-Mills theory of the type considered by Maldacena and Nunez (MN). In particular, we calculate the full classical spectrum of the N=1* theory with gauge group U(N) in its Higgs vacuum. In the limit N goes to infinity, we find an exact agreement with the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the MN compactification.
