Title: The $\star$-value Equation and Wigner Distributions in Noncommutative  Heisenberg algebras
Authors: Marcos Rosenbaum and J. David Vergara
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanical equivalence of the Seiberg-Witten map in the context of the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal phase-space formalism in order to construct a quantum mechanics over noncommutative Heisenberg algebras. The formalism is then applied to the exactly soluble Landau and harmonic oscillator problems in the 2-dimensional noncommutative phase-space plane, in order to derive their correct energy spectra and corresponding Wigner distributions. We compare our results with others that have previously appeared in the literature.
