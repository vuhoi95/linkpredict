Title: Soldered Bundle Background for the De Sitter Top
Authors: J. Armenta and J. A. Nieto
Abstract: We prove that the mathematical framework for the de Sitter top system is the de Sitter fiber bundle. In this context, the concept of soldering associated with a fiber bundle plays a central role. We comment on the possibility that our formalism may be of particular interest in different contexts including MacDowell-Mansouri theory, two time physics and oriented matroid theory.
