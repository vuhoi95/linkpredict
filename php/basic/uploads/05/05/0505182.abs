Title: Isotropization far from equilibrium
Authors: J. Berges and Sz. Borsanyi and C. Wetterich
Abstract: Isotropization occurs on time scales much shorter than the thermal equilibration time. This is a crucial ingredient for the understanding of collision experiments of heavy nuclei or other nonequilibrium phenomena in complex many body systems. We discuss in detail the limitations of estimates based on standard ``linear'' or relaxation-time approximations, where isotropization and thermal equilibration rates agree. For a weak-coupling $\phi^4$-model the relaxation-time approximation underestimates the thermal equilibration time by orders of magnitude, in contrast to the isotropization time. The characteristic nonequilibrium isotropization rate can be enhanced as compared to the close-to-equilibrium value. Our results are obtained from the two-particle irreducible effective action, which includes off-shell and memory effects and does not involve a gradient expansion. This allows us to determine the range of validity of a description to lowest-order in gradients, which is typically employed in kinetic equations.
