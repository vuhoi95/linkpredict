Title: Some effects of the quantum field theory in the early Universe
Authors: A. A. Grib and Yu. V. Pavlov
Abstract: Effects of the vacuum polarization leading to change of the effective gravitational constant and particle creation in the early Universe are discussed. Gauss-Bonnet type coupling to the curvature is considered. Renormalization methods are generalized for such coupling and the N-dimensional space-time. Calculations of creation of entropy and visible matter of the Universe by the gravity of dark matter are made.
