Title: Crossing w=-1 in Gauss-Bonnet Brane World with Induced Gravity
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Hong-Sheng Zhang and Anzhong Wang
Abstract: Recent type Ia supernovas data seemingly favor a dark energy model whose equation of state $w(z)$ crosses -1 very recently, which is a much more amazing problem than the acceleration of the universe. In this paper we show that it is possible to realize such a crossing without introducing any phantom component in a Gauss-Bonnet brane world with induced gravity, where a four dimensional curvature scalar on the brane and a five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk are present. In this realization, the Gauss-Bonnet term and the mass parameter in the bulk play a crucial role.
