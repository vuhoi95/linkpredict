Title: Canonical Quantization of SU(3) Skyrme Model in a General Representation
Authors: D. Jurciukonis and E. Norvaisas and D. O. Riska
Abstract: A complete canonical quantization of the SU(3) Skyrme model performed in the collective coordinate formalism in general irreducible representations. In the case of SU(3) the model differs qualitatively in different representations. The Wess-Zumino-Witten term vanishes in all self-adjoint representations in the collective coordinate method for separation of space and time variables. The canonical quantization generates representation dependent quantum mass corrections, which can stabilize the soliton solution. The standard symmetry breaking mass term, which in general leads to representation mixing, degenerates to the SU(2) form in all self-adjoint representations.
