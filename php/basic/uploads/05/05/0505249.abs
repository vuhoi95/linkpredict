Title: Supersymmetric Ward Identities and NMHV Amplitudes involving Gluinos
Authors: Steven J. Bidder and David C. Dunbar and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We show how Supersymmetric Ward identities can be used to obtain amplitudes involving gluinos or adjoint scalars from purely gluonic amplitudes. We obtain results for all one-loop six-point NMHV amplitudes in $\NeqFour$ Super Yang-Mills theory which involve two gluinos or two scalar particles. More general cases are also discussed.
