Title: Supertubes versus superconducting tubes
Authors: Ruben Cordero and Efrain Rojas
Abstract: In this paper we show the relationship between cylindrical D2-branes and cylindrical superconducting membranes described by a generic effective action at the bosonic level. In the first case the extended objects considered, arose as blown up type IIA superstrings to D2-branes, named supertubes. In the second one, the cosmological objects arose from some sort of field theories. The Dirac-Born-Infeld action describing supertubes is shown to be equivalent to the generic effective action describing superconducting membranes via a special transformation.
