Title: Ghosts in Massive Gravity
Authors: Paolo Creminelli and Alberto Nicolis and Michele Papucci and Enrico Trincherini
Abstract: In the context of Lorentz-invariant massive gravity we show that classical solutions around heavy sources are plagued by ghost instabilities. The ghost shows up in the effective field theory at huge distances from the source, much bigger than the Vainshtein radius. Its presence is independent of the choice of the non-linear terms added to the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian. At the Vainshtein radius the mass of the ghost is of order of the inverse radius, so that the theory cannot be trusted inside this region, not even at the classical level.
