Title: Dual Interpretations of Seiberg-Witten and Dijkgraaf-Vafa curves
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Sergio Montero
Abstract: We give dual interpretations of Seiberg-Witten and Dijkgraaf-Vafa (or matrix model) curves in n=1 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory. This duality interchanges the rank of the gauge group with the degree of the superpotential; moreover, the constraint of having at most log-normalizable deformations of the geometry is mapped to a constraint in the number of flavors N_f < N in the dual theory.
