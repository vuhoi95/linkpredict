Title: Quasi-Periodic Solutions of Heun's Equation
Authors: Avinash Khare and Uday Sukhatme
Abstract: By exploiting a recently developed connection between Heun's differential equation and the generalized associated Lam\'e equation, we not only recover the well known periodic solutions, but also obtain a large class of new, quasi-periodic solutions of Heun's equation. Each of the quasi-periodic solutions is doubly degenerate.
