Title: Fuzzy 5-spheres and pp-wave Matrix Actions
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: Using the action describing N coincident gravitational waves in M-theory we construct a pp-wave Matrix model cointaning a fuzzy 5-sphere giant graviton solution. This fuzzy 5-sphere is constructed as a U(1) fibration over a fuzzy $CP^2$, and has the correct dependence of the radius with the light-cone momentum, $r^4\sim p^+$, to approach the 5-sphere giant graviton solution of Mc.Greevy et al in the large N limit.
