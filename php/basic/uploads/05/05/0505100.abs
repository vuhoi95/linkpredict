Title: Dipole Deformations of N=1 SYM and Supergravity backgrounds with U(1) X  U(1) global symmetry
Authors: Umut Gursoy and Carlos Nunez
Abstract: We study SL(3,R) deformations of a type IIB background based on D5 branes that is conjectured to be dual to N=1 SYM. We argue that this deformation of the geometry correspond to turning on a dipole deformation in the field theory on the D5 branes. We give evidence that this deformation only affects the KK-sector of the dual field theory and helps decoupling the KK dynamics from the pure gauge dynamics. Similar deformations of the geometry that is dual to N=2 SYM are studied. Finally, we also study a deformation that leaves us with a possible candidate for a dual to N=0 YM theory.
