Title: Cross-ladder effects in Bethe-Salpeter and Light-Front equations
Authors: J. Carbonell and V. A. Karmanov
Abstract: Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation in Minkowski space for scalar particles is solved for a kernel given by a sum of ladder and cross-ladder exchanges. The solution of corresponding Light-Front (LF) equation, where we add the time-ordered stretched boxes, is also obtained. Cross-ladder contributions are found to be very large and attractive, whereas the influence of stretched boxes is negligible. Both approaches -- BS and LF -- give very close results.
