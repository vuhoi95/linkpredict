Abstract: High-energy limit of zero-norm states (HZNS) in the old covariant first quantized (OCFQ) spectrum of the 26D open bosonic string, together with the assumption of a smooth behavior of string theory in this limit, are used to derive infinitely many linear relations among the leading high-energy, fixed angle behavior of four point functions of different string states. As a result, ratios among all high-energy scattering amplitudes of four arbitrary string states can be calculated algebraically and the leading order amplitudes can be expressed in terms of that of four tachyons as conjectured by Gross in 1988. A dual calculation can also be performed and equivalent results are obtained by taking the high-energy limit of Virasoro constraints. Finally, as a consistent sample calculation, we compute all high-energy scattering amplitudes of three tachyons and one massive state at the leading order by saddle-point approximation to justify our results.
