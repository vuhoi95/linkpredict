Title: Perturbations and absorption cross-section of infinite-radius black  rings
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias and Shijun Yoshida
Abstract: We study scalar field perturbations on the background of non-supersymmetric black rings and of supersymmetric black rings. In the infinite-radius limit of these geometries, we are able to separate the wave equation, and to study wave phenomena in its vicinities. In this limit, we show that (i) both geometries are stable against scalar field perturbations, (ii) the absorption cross-section for scalar fields is equal to the area of the event horizon in the supersymmetric case, and proportional to it in the non-supersymmetric situation.
