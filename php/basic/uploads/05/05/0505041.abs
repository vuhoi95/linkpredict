Abstract: Stable, holomorphic vector bundles are constructed on an torus fibered, non-simply connected Calabi-Yau threefold using the method of bundle extensions. Since the manifold is multiply connected, we work with equivariant bundles on the elliptically fibered covering space. The cohomology groups of the vector bundle, which yield the low energy spectrum, are computed using the Leray spectral sequence and fit the requirements of particle phenomenology. The physical properties of these vacua were discussed previously. In this paper, we systematically compute all relevant cohomology groups and explicitly prove the existence of the necessary vector bundle extensions. All mathematical details are explained in a pedagogical way, providing the technical framework for constructing heterotic standard model vacua.
