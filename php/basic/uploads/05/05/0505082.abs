Title: Renormalizable supersymmetric gauge theory in six dimensions
Authors: E. A. Ivanov and A. V. Smilga and B. M. Zupnik
Abstract: We construct and discuss a 6D supersymmetric gauge theory involving four derivatives in the action. The theory involves a dimensionless coupling constant and is renormalizable. At the tree level, it enjoys N = (1,0) superconformal symmetry, but the latter is broken by quantum anomaly. Our study should be considered as preparatory for seeking an extended version of this theory which would hopefully preserve conformal symmetry at the full quantum level and be ultraviolet-finite.
