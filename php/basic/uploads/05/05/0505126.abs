Title: D-type supersymmetry breaking and brane-to-brane gravity mediation
Authors: T. Gregoire and R. Rattazzi and C. A. Scrucca
Abstract: We revisit the issue of gravitational contributions to soft masses in five-dimensional sequestered models. We point out that, unlike for the case of F-type supersymmetry breaking, for D-type breaking these effects generically give positive soft masses squared for the sfermions. This drastically improves model building. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our result.
