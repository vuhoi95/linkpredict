Title: Quantum metastability in time-periodic potentials
Authors: Chung-Chieh Lee and Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: In this paper we investigate quantum metastability of a particle trapped in between an infinite wall and a square barrier, with either a time-periodically oscillating barrier (Model A) or bottom of the well (Model B). Based on the Floquet theory, we derive in each case an equation which determines the stability of the metastable system. We study the influence on the stability of two Floquet states when their Floquet energies (real part) encounter a direct or an avoided crossing at resonance. The effect of the amplitude of oscillation on the nature of crossing of Floquet energies is also discussed. It is found that by adiabatically changing the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation field, one can manipulate the stability of states in the well. By means of a discrete transform, the two models are shown to have exactly the same Floquet energy spectrum at the same oscillating amplitude and frequency. The equivalence of the models is also demonstrated by means of the principle of gauge invariance.
