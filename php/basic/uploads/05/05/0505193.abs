Title: Entanglement entropy and quantum field theory: a non-technical  introduction
Authors: Pasquale Calabrese and John Cardy
Abstract: In these proceedings we give a pedagogical and non-technical introduction to the Quantum Field Theory approach to entanglement entropy. Particular attention is devoted to the one space dimensional case, with a linear dispersion relation, that, at a quantum critical point, can be effectively described by a two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory.
