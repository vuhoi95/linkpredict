Title: Chaplygin gas dominated anisotropic brane world cosmological models
Authors: M. K. Mak and T. Harko
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in the generalized Randall-Sundrum model for an anisotropic brane with Bianchi type I geometry, with a generalized Chaplygin gas as matter source. The generalized Chaplygin gas, which interpolates between a high density relativistic era and a non-relativistic matter phase, is a popular dark energy candidate. For a Bianchi type I space-time brane filled with a cosmological fluid obeying the generalized Chaplygin equation of state the general solution of the gravitational field equations can be expressed in an exact parametric form, with the comoving volume taken as parameter. In the limiting cases of a stiff cosmological fluid, with pressure equal to the energy density, and for a pressureless fluid, the solution of the field equations can be expressed in an exact analytical form. The evolution of the scalar field associated to the Chaplygin fluid is also considered and the corresponding potential is obtained. The behavior of the observationally important parameters like shear, anisotropy and deceleration parameter is considered in detail.
