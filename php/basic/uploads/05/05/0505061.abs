Title: Explicitly connecting T and Buscher dualities in String Theory
Authors: P. Matlock and R. Parthasarathy
Abstract: Buscher duality is a sigma-model duality, implemented by transformation of the target space. Not only in the case of a flat target space, but in a general background, should the Buscher duality reduce to the T-duality familiar in the flat-space string context. We exhibit this reduction explicitly using a pp-wave background as a tractable example. String theory is solved in a compactified Nappi-Witten background and the Buscher-dual theory is likewise solved. The Hamiltonian is computed in both cases, and the results are verified to be T-dual.
