Title: Perturbative Search for Fixed Lines in Large N Gauge Theories
Authors: A. Dymarsky and I. R. Klebanov and R. Roiban
Abstract: The logarithmic running of marginal double-trace operators is a general feature of 4-d field theories containing scalar fields in the adjoint or bifundamental representation. Such operators provide leading contributions in the large N limit; therefore, the leading terms in their beta functions must vanish for a theory to be large N conformal. We calculate the one-loop beta functions in orbifolds of the N=4 SYM theory by a discrete subgroup Gamma of the SU(4) R-symmetry, which are dual to string theory on AdS_5 x S^5/Gamma. We present a general strategy for determining whether there is a fixed line passing through the origin of the coupling constant space. Then we study in detail some classes of non-supersymmetric orbifold theories, and emphasize the importance of decoupling the U(1) factors. Among our examples, which include orbifolds acting freely on the S^5, we do not find any large N non-supersymmetric theories with fixed lines passing through the origin. Connection of these results with closed string tachyon condensation in AdS_5 x S^5/Gamma is discussed.
