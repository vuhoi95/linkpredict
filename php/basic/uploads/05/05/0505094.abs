Title: Recounting Dyons in N=4 String Theory
Authors: David Shih and Andrew Strominger and Xi Yin
Abstract: A recently discovered relation between 4D and 5D black holes is used to derive weighted BPS black hole degeneracies for 4D N=4 string theory from the well-known 5D degeneracies. They are found to be given by the Fourier coefficients of the unique weight 10 automorphic form of the modular group Sp(2,Z). This result agrees exactly with a conjecture made some years ago by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde.
