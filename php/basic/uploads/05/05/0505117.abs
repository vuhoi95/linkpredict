Title: On the geometry of coset branes
Authors: Jurgen Fuchs and Albrecht Wurtz
Abstract: Coset models and their symmetry preserving branes are studied from a representation theoretic perspective, relating e.g. the horizontal branching spaces to a truncation of the space of bulk fields, and accounting for field identification. This allows us to describe the fuzzy geometry of the branes at finite level.
