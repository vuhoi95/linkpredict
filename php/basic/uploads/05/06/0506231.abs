Title: Higher genus superstring amplitudes from the geometry of moduli spaces
Authors: Marco Matone and Roberto Volpato
Abstract: We show that the higher genus 4-point superstring amplitude is strongly constrained by the geometry of moduli space of Riemann surfaces. A detailed analysis leads to a natural proposal which satisfies several conditions. The result is based on the recently derived Siegel induced metric on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and on combinatorial products of determinants of holomorphic abelian differentials.
