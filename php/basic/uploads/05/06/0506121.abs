Title: Simultaneous Type A N-fold Supersymmetry with Two Different Values of N
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho and Toshiaki Tanaka
Abstract: We investigate one-dimensional quantum mechanical systems which have type A N-fold supersymmetry with two different values of N simultaneously. We find that there are essentially four inequivalent models possessing the property, one is conformal, two of them are hyperbolic (trigonometric) including Rosen-Morse type, and the other is elliptic.
