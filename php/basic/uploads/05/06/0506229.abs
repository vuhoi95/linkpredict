Title: Supersymmetry and spin structures
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Sunil Gadhia
Abstract: We construct examples of isometric M-theory backgrounds which preserve a different amount of supersymmetry depending on the choice of spin structure. These examples are of the form AdS_4 x L, where L is a seven-dimensional lens space whose fundamental group is cyclic of order 4k.
