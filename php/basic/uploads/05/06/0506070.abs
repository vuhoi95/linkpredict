Authors: Shao-You Zhao and Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: With the help of the factorizing $F$-matrix, the scalar products of the $U_q(gl(1|1))$ free fermion model are represented by determinants. By means of these results, we obtain the determinant representations of correlation functions of the model.
