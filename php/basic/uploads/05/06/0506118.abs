Title: Local bulk operators in AdS/CFT: a boundary view of horizons and  locality
Authors: Alex Hamilton and Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We develop the representation of local bulk fields in AdS by non-local operators on the boundary, working in the semiclassical limit and using AdS_2 as our main example. In global coordinates we show that the boundary operator has support only at points which are spacelike separated from the bulk point. We construct boundary operators that represent local bulk operators inserted behind the horizon of the Poincare patch and inside the Rindler horizon of a two dimensional black hole. We show that these operators respect bulk locality and comment on the generalization of our construction to higher dimensional AdS black holes.
