Title: What is the Temperature Dependence of the Casimir Effect?
Authors: J. S. Hoye and I. Brevik and J. B. Aarseth and K. A. Milton
Abstract: There has been recent criticism of our approach to the Casimir force between real metallic surfaces at finite temperature, saying it is in conflict with the third law of thermodynamics and in contradiction with experiment. We show that these claims are unwarranted, and that our approach has strong theoretical support, while the experimental situation is still unclear.
