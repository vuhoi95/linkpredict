Title: Super Janus
Authors: A. B. Clark and A. Karch
Abstract: We propose and study a supersymmetric version of the Janus domain wall solution of type IIB supergravity. Janus is dual to N=4 super Yang Mills theory with a coupling constant that jumps across an interface. While the interface in the Janus field theory completely breaks all supersymmetries, it was found earlier that some supersymmetry can be restored in the field theory at the cost of breaking the SO(6) R-symmetry down to at least SU(3). We find the gravity dual to this supersymmetric interface theory by studying the SU(3) invariant subsector of N=8 gauged supergravity in 5D, which is described by 5D N=2 gauged supergravity with one hypermultiplet.
