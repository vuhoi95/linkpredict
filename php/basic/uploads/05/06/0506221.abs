Title: Excited D-branes and Supergravity Solutions
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Shinpei Kobayashi and So Matsuura
Abstract: We investigate the general solution with the symmetry ISO(1,p)xSO(9-p) of Type II supergravity (the three-parameter solution) from the viewpoint of the superstring theory. We find that one of the three parameters (c_1) is closely related to the ``dilaton charge'' and the appearance of the dilaton charge is a consequence of deformations of the boundary condition from that of the boundary state for BPS D-branes. We give three examples of the deformed D-branes by considering the tachyon condensation from systems of D-\bar{D}p-branes, unstable D9-branes and unstable D-instantons to the BPS saturated Dp-branes, respectively. We argue that the deformed systems are generally regarded as tachyonic and/or massive excitations of the open strings on Dp-\bar{D}p-brane systems.
