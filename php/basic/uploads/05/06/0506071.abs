Abstract: The component structure of a generic N=1/2 supersymmetric Non-Linear Sigma-Model (NLSM) defined in the four-dimensional (Euclidean) Non-Anti-Commutative (NAC) superspace is investigated in detail.The most general NLSM is described in terms of arbitrary K"ahler potential,and chiral and anti-chiral superpotentials. The case of a single chiral superfield gives rise to splitting of the NLSM potentials, whereas the case of several chiral superfields results in smearing (or fuzziness) of the NLSM potentials, while both effects are controlled by the auxiliary fields. We eliminate the auxiliary fields by solving their algebraic equations of motion, and demonstrate that the results are dependent upon whether the auxiliary integrations responsible for the fuzziness are performed before or after elimination of the auxiliary fields. There is no ambiguity in the case of splitting, i.e. for a single chiral superfield. Fully explicit results are derived in the case of the N=1/2 supersymmetric NAC-deformed CP(n) NLSM in four dimensions. Here we find another surprise that our results differ from the N=1/2 supersymmetric CP(n) NLSM derived by the quotient construction from the N=1/2 supersymmetric NAC-deformed gauge theory. We conclude that an N=1/2 supersymmetric deformation of a generic NLSM from the NAC superspace is not unique.
