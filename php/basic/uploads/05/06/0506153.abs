Title: Viscous dark energy and phantom evolution
Authors: Mauricio Cataldo and Norman Cruz and Samuel Lepe
Abstract: In order to study if the bulk viscosity may induce a big rip singularity on the flat FRW cosmologies, we investigate dissipative processes in the universe within the framework of the standard Eckart theory of relativistic irreversible thermodynamics, and in the full causal Israel&#8211;Stewart-Hiscock theory. We have found cosmological solutions which exhibit, under certain constraints, a big rip singularity. We show that the negative pressure generated by the bulk viscosity cannot avoid that the dark energy of the universe to be phantom energy.
