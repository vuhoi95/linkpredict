Abstract: Extra dimensions offer new ways to address long-standing problems in beyond the standard model particle physics. In some classes of extra-dimensional models, the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle is a viable dark matter candidate. In this work, we study indirect detection of Kaluza-Klein dark matter via its annihilation into antiprotons. We use a sophisticated galactic cosmic ray diffusion model whose parameters are fully constrained by an extensive set of experimental data. We discuss how fluxes of cosmic antiprotons can be used to exclude low Kaluza-Klein masses.
