Title: General soft terms from Supergravity including D-terms
Authors: Emilian Dudas and Sudhir K Vempati
Abstract: We derive general expressions for soft terms in supergravity where D-terms contribute significantly to the supersymmetry breaking. Such D-terms can produce large splitting between scalar and fermionic partners in the spectrum. By requiring that supersymmetry breaking sets the cosmological constant to zero, we then parameterize the soft terms when D-terms dominate over F-terms or are comparable to them. We present an application of our results to the split supersymmetry scenario and briefly address the issue of moduli stabilisation.
