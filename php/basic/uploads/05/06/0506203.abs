Title: R-charged AdS_{5} black holes and large N unitary matrix models
Authors: Pallab Basu and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT, we establish a correspondence between the intricate thermal phases of R-charged AdS_{5} blackholes and the R-charge sector of the N=4 gauge theory, in the large N limit. Integrating out all fields in the gauge theory except the thermal Polyakov line, leads to an effective unitary matrix model. In the canonical ensemble, a logarithmic term is generated in the non-zero charge sector of the matrix model. This term is important to discuss various supergravity properties like i) the non-existence of thermal AdS as a solution, ii) the existence of a point of cusp catastrophe in the phase diagram and iii) the matching of saddle points and the critical exponents of supergravity and those of the effective matrix model.
