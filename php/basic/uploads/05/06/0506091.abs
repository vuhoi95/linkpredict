Title: More on supersymmetric D-branes in type IIB plane wave background
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Jong-won Lee and Chanyong Park and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We extend the study on D-branes in the type IIB plane wave background to less supersymmetric configurations. We show that many new supersymmetric D-branes can be found by turning on electric as well as magnetic background fluxes, or constantly boosting D-branes.
