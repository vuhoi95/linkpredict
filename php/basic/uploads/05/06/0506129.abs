Title: Gravitino dark matter in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Karsten Jedamzik and Martin Lemoine and Gilbert Moultaka
Abstract: This paper investigates the parameter space of theories with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking leading to gravitino (cold) dark matter with mass m_{3/2}= 1keV - 10MeV. We pay particular attention to the cosmological role of messenger fields. Cosmology requires that these messengers decay to the visible sector if the lightest messenger mass M_X > 30TeV. We then examine the various possible messenger number violating interactions allowed by the symmetries of the theory and by phenomenology. Late messenger decay generally results in entropy production hence in the dilution of pre-existing gravitinos. We find that in SU(5) grand unification only specific messenger-matter couplings allow to produce the required amount of gravitino dark matter particles. Gravitino dark matter with the correct abundance is however expected in larger gauge groups such as SO(10) for generic non-renormalizable messenger-matter interactions and for arbritrarily high post-inflationary reheating temperatures.
