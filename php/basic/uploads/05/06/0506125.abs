Title: Are We Living in a Higher Dimensional Universe?
Authors: V H Satheesh Kumar and P K Suresh
Abstract: It is a brief review of the physical theories embodying the idea of extra dimensions, starting from the pre-historic times to the present day. Here we have classified the developments into three eras, such as Pre-Einstein, Einstein and Kaluza-Klein. Here the views and flow of thoughts are emphasized rather rigorous mathematical details. Majour developments in Quantum field theory and Particle physics are outlined. Some well known higher dimensional approaches to unification are discussed. This is concluded with some examples for visualizing extra dimensions and a short discussion on the cosmological implications and possible existence of the same.
