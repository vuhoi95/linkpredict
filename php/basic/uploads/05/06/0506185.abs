Title: The quantum one loop trace anomaly of the higher spin conformal  conserved currents in the bulk of $AdS_{4}$
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: An analysis of the structure and singularities of the one loop two point function of the higher spin traceless and conserved currents constructed from the single scalar field in $AdS$ space is presented. The detailed renormalization procedure is constructed and the quantum violation of the traceless Ward identity is investigated. The connection with the one loop effective action for higher spin gauge fields is discussed.
