Title: Conquest of the ghost pyramid of the superstring
Authors: Kiyoung Lee and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We give a new Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin operator for the superstring. It implies a quadratic gauge-fixed action, and a new gauge-invariant action with first-class constraints. The infinite pyramid of spinor ghosts appears in a simple way through ghost gamma matrices.
