Title: Noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions and its  dual
Authors: E. Harikumar and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We consider the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in noncommutative three dimensional space-time. We show that the Seiberg-Witten map is ambiguous due to the dimensional coupling constant. To get the dual theory we start from a master action obtained by promoting the global shift invariance to a local one. We also obtain the mapping between the observables of the two equivalent theories. We show that the equivalence between the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the self-dual model in commutative space-time does not survive in the non-commutative setting.
