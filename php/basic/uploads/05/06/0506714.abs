Title: Lightning Stars: Anomalous Photoproduction in Neutron Stars via  Parametric Resonance Mechanism
Authors: S. D. Campos and A. Maia Jr
Abstract: In this work we propose a new mechanism for photoproduction inside a neutron star based on Parametric Resonance phenomenon as firstly applied to Inflationary Cosmology. Our assumptions are based on the pion condensation model by Harrington and Shepard. We show that a huge number of photons are created which, on turns, reheats the matter in the star's core. Thus, we argue that Parametric Resonance can be effective during a brief period out of an neutron star lifetime leading to an anomalous uprising variation of its brightness departing from the black body radiation at regularly spaced frequencies. In adition, a time periodic signal is obtained in moderate (not exponential) regimes. We argue also that our PR mechanism offers a simple and feasible explanation for some recent observations of giant flares from neutron stars.
