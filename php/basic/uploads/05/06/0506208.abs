Title: The matrix factorisations of the D-model
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Matthias R Gaberdiel
Abstract: The fundamental matrix factorisations of the D-model superpotential are found and identified with the boundary states of the corresponding conformal field theory. The analysis is performed for both GSO-projections. We also comment on the relation of this analysis to the theory of surface singularities and their orbifold description.
