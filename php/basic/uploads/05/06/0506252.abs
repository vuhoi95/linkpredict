Title: Surveying Standard Model Flux Vacua on $T^6/Z_2\times Z_2$
Authors: Jason Kumar and James D. Wells
Abstract: We consider the SU(2)LxSU(2)R Standard Model brane embedding in an orientifold of T6/Z2xZ2. Within defined limits, we construct all such Standard Model brane embeddings and determine the relative number of flux vacua for each construction. Supersymmetry preserving brane recombination in the hidden sector enables us to identify many solutions with high flux. We discuss in detail the phenomenology of one model which is likely to dominate the counting of vacua. While Kahler moduli stabilization remains to be fully understood, we define the criteria necessary for generic constructions to have fixed moduli.
