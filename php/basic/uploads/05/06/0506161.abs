Title: Superfield integrals in high dimensions
Authors: Michael B. Green and Kasper Peeters and Christian Stahn
Abstract: We present an efficient, covariant, graph-based method to integrate superfields over fermionic spaces of high dimensionality. We illustrate this method with the computation of the most general sixteen-dimensional Majorana-Weyl integral in ten dimensions. Our method has applications to the construction of higher-derivative supergravity actions as well as the computation of string and membrane vertex operator correlators.
