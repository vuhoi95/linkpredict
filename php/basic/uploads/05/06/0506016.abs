Title: Morita Duality and Noncommutative Wilson Loops in Two Dimensions
Authors: Michele Cirafici and Luca Griguolo and Domenico Seminara and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We describe a combinatorial approach to the analysis of the shape and orientation dependence of Wilson loop observables on two-dimensional noncommutative tori. Morita equivalence is used to map the computation of loop correlators onto the combinatorics of non-planar graphs. Several nonperturbative examples of symmetry breaking under area-preserving diffeomorphisms are thereby presented. Analytic expressions for correlators of Wilson loops with infinite winding number are also derived and shown to agree with results from ordinary Yang-Mills theory.
