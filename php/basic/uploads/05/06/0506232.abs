Title: R-charges from toric diagrams and the equivalence of a-maximization and  Z-minimization
Authors: Agostino Butti and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We conjecture a general formula for assigning R-charges and multiplicities for the chiral fields of all gauge theories living on branes at toric singularities. We check that the central charge and the dimensions of all the chiral fields agree with the information on volumes that can be extracted from toric geometry. We also analytically check the equivalence between the volume minimization procedure discovered in hep-th/0503183 and a-maximization, for the most general toric diagram. Our results can be considered as a very general check of the AdS/CFT correspondence, valid for all superconformal theories associated with toric singularities.
