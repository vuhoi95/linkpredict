Title: Supertube Dynamics in Diverse Backgrounds
Authors: J. Kluson and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study the homogeneous and time dependent dynamics of the supertube in diverse backgrounds. After deriving a general form of the Hamiltonian in general background, we use a particular gauge fixing, relevant to our analysis to derive a simpler Hamiltonian. We then study the homogeneous solutions of the equations of motion in various backgrounds and study the effective potential in detail.
