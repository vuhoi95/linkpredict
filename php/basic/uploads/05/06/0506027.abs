Title: Quantum Supersymmetric Toda-mKdV Hierarchies
Authors: Petr P. Kulish and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the quantization procedure of Toda-mKdV hierarchies to the case of arbitrary affine (super)algebras. The quantum analogue of the monodromy matrix, related to the universal R-matrix with the lower Borel subalgebra represented by the corresponding vertex operators is introduced. The auxiliary L-operators satisfying RTT-relation are constructed and the quantum integrability condition is obtained. General approach is illustrated by means of two important examples.
