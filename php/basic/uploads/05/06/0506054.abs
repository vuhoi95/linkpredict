Title: Solutions of the compatibility conditions for a Wigner quantum  oscillator
Authors: N. I. Stoilova and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: We consider the compatibility conditions for a N-particle D-dimensional Wigner quantum oscillator. These conditions can be rewritten as certain triple relations involving anticommutators, so it is natural to look for solutions in terms of Lie superalgebras. In the recent classification of ``generalized quantum statistics'' for the basic classical Lie superalgebras [math-ph/0504013], each such statistics is characterized by a set of creation and annihilation operators plus a set of triple relations. In the present letter, we investigate which cases of this classification also lead to solutions of the compatibility conditions. Our analysis yields some known solutions and several classes of new solutions.
