Abstract: In this paper we present a non-singular black hole model as a possible end-product of gravitational collapse. The depicted spacetime which is type [II,(II)], by Petrov classification, is an exact solution of the Einstein equations and contains two horizons. The equation of state in the radial direction, is a well-behaved function of the density and smoothly reproduces vacuum-like behavior near r=0 while tending to a polytrope at larger r, low density, values. The final equilibrium configuration comprises of a de Sitter-like inner core surrounded by a family of 2-surfaces of matter fields with variable equation of state. The fields are all concentrated in the vicinity of the radial center r=0. The solution depicts a spacetime that is asymptotically Schwarzschild at large r, while it becomes de Sitter-like for vanishing r. Possible physical interpretations of the macro-state of the black hole interior in the model are offered. We find that the possible state admits two equally viable interpretations, namely either a quintessential intermediary region or a phase transition in which a two-fluid system is in both dynamic and thermodynamic equilibrium. We estimate the ratio of pure matter present to the total energy and in both (interpretations) cases find it to be virtually the same, being 0.83. Finally, the well-behaved dependence of the density and pressure on the radial coordinate provides some insight on dealing with the information loss paradox.
