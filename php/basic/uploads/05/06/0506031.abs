Title: New evidence for the saturation of the Froissart bound
Authors: M. M. Block and F. Halzen
Abstract: Fits to high energy data alone cannot cleanly discriminate between asymptotic $\ln s$ and $\ln^2s$ behavior of total hadronic cross sections. We demonstrate that this is no longer true when we require that these amplitudes also describe, on average, low energy data dominated by resonances.
