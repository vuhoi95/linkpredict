Title: The maximal D=7 supergravities
Authors: Henning Samtleben and Martin Weidner
Abstract: The general seven-dimensional maximal supergravity is presented. Its universal Lagrangian is described in terms of an embedding tensor which can be characterized group-theoretically. The theory generically combines vector, two-form and three-form tensor fields that transform into each other under an intricate set of nonabelian gauge transformations. The embedding tensor encodes the proper distribution of the degrees of freedom among these fields. In addition to the kinetic terms the vector and tensor fields contribute to the Lagrangian with a unique gauge invariant Chern-Simons term. This new formulation encompasses all possible gaugings. Examples include the sphere reductions of M theory and of the type IIA/IIB theories with gauge groups SO(5), CSO(4,1), and SO(4), respectively.
