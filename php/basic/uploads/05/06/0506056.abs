Title: Primordial non-gaussianities from multiple-field inflation
Authors: David Seery and James E. Lidsey
Abstract: We calculate the three-point correlation function evaluated at horizon crossing for a set of interacting scalar fields coupled to gravity during inflation. This provides the initial condition for the three-point function of the curvature perturbation in the Sasaki--Stewart \delta N formulation. We find that the effect is small, of the order of a slow-roll parameter, and that the non-gaussianity can be determined on large scales once the unperturbed background evolution is known. As an example of the use of our formalism, we calculate the primordial non-gaussianity arising in a model of assisted inflation.
