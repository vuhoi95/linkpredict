Title: Reconnection of Non-Abelian Cosmic Strings
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and David Tong
Abstract: Cosmic strings in non-abelian gauge theories naturally gain a spectrum of massless, or light, excitations arising from their embedding in color and flavor space. This opens up the possibility that colliding strings miss each other in the internal space, reducing the probability of reconnection. We study the topology of the non-abelian vortex moduli space to determine the outcome of string collision. Surprisingly we find that the probability of classical reconnection in this system remains unity, with strings passing through each other only for finely tuned initial conditions. We proceed to show how this conclusion can be changed by symmetry breaking effects, or by quantum effects associated to fermionic zero modes, and present examples where the probability of reconnection in a U(N) gauge theory ranges from 1/N for low-energy collisions to one at higher energies.
