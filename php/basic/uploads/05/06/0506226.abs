Title: Affine Toda field theories related to Coxeter groups of  non-crystallographic type
Authors: Andreas Fring and Christian Korff
Abstract: We propose affine Toda field theories related to the non-crystallographic Coxeter groups H_2, H_3 and H_4. The classical mass spectrum, the classical three-point couplings and the one-loop corrections to the mass renormalisation are determined. The construction is carried out by means of a reduction procedure from crystallographic to non-crystallographic Coxeter groups. The embedding structure explains for various affine Toda field theories that their particles can be organised in pairs, such that their relative masses differ by the golden ratio.
