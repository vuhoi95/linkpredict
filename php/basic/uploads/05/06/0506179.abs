Title: An Open String Landscape
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Fernando Marchesano and David Mateos
Abstract: The effect of fluxes on open string moduli is studied by analyzing the constraints imposed by supersymmetry on D-branes in type IIB flux backgrounds. We show that generically the conditions of supersymmetry cannot be maintained when moving along the geometrical moduli space of the brane, so that open string moduli are lifted. We argue that there is a disconnected and discrete set of supersymmetric solutions to the open string equations of motion, which extends the familiar closed string landscape to the open string sector.
