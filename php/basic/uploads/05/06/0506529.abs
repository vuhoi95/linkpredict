Abstract: In this paper, we study a 3D compact U(1) lattice gauge theory with a variety of nonlocal interactions that simulates the effects of gapless/gapful matter fields. This theory is quite important to investigate the phase structures of QED$_3$ and strongly-correlated electron systems like the 2D quantum spin models, the fractional quantum Hall effect, the t-J model of high-temperature superconductivity. We restrict the nonlocal interactions among gauge variables only to those along the temporal direction and adjust their coupling constants optimally to simulate the isotropic nonlocal couplings of the original models. We perform numerical studies of the model to find that, for a certain class of power-decaying couplings, there appears a second-order phase transition to the deconfinement phase as the gauge coupling constant is decreased. On the other hand, for the exponentially-decaying coupling, there are no signals for second-order phase transition. These results indicate the possibility that introduction of sufficient number of massless matter fields destabilizes the permanent confinement in the 3D compact U(1) pure gauge theory due to instantons.
