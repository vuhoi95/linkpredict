Title: The Z_k^(su(2),3/2) Parafermions
Authors: P. Jacob and P. Mathieu
Abstract: We introduce a novel parafermionic theory for which the conformal dimension of the basic parafermion is 3(1-1/k)/2, with k even. The structure constants and the central charges are obtained from mode-type associativity calculations. The spectrum of the completely reducible representations is also determined. The primary fields turns out to be labeled by two positive integers instead of a single one for the usual parafermionic models. The simplest singular vectors are also displayed. It is argued that these models are equivalent to the non-unitary minimal W_k(k+1,k+3) models. More generally, we expect all W_k(k+1,k+2 beta) models to be identified with generalized parafermionic models whose lowest dimensional parafermion has dimension beta(1-1/k).
