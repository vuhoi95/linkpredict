Title: On Graviphoton F-terms of N=1 SU(N) SYM with Fundamental Matter
Authors: Ido Adam and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider N=1 SU(N_c) supersymmetric gauge theory with chiral matter multiplets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. The general form of the meson correlation functions in the presence of graviphoton background with or without gravity is obtained. Finally, the perturbation theory scheme of computing these correlation functions is discussed.
