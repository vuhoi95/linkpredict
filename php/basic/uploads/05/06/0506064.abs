Title: Ultrarelativistic boost of spinning black rings
Authors: Marcello Ortaggio and Jiri Podolsky and Pavel Krtous
Abstract: We study the D=5 Emparan-Reall spinning black ring under an ultrarelativistic boost along an arbitrary direction. We analytically determine the resulting shock pp-wave, in particular for boosts along axes orthogonal and parallel to the plane of rotation. The solution becomes physically more interesting and simpler if one enforces equilibrium between the forces on the ring. We also comment on the ultrarelativistic limit of recently found supersymmetric black rings with two independent angular momenta. Essential distinct features with respect to the boosted Myers-Perry black holes are pointed out.
