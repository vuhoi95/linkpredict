Title: Marginal Deformations and Classical Solutions in Open Superstring Field  Theory
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We construct a class of classical solutions in the Berkovits' open superstring field theory. The resulting solutions correspond to marginal boundary deformations in conformal field theory. The vacuum energy vanishes exactly for the solutions. Investigating the theory expanded around one of the solutions, we find that it reflects the effect of background Wilson lines. The solution has a well-defined Fock space expression and it is invariant under space-time supersymmetry transformation.
