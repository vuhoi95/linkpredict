Title: Solving coupled Dyson--Schwinger equations on a compact manifold
Authors: C. S. Fischer and B. Gruter and R. Alkofer
Abstract: We present results for the gluon and ghost propagators in SU(N) Yang--Mills theory on a four-torus at zero and nonzero temperatures from a truncated set of Dyson-Schwinger equations. When compared to continuum solutions at zero temperature sizeable modifications due to the finite volume of the manifold, especially in the infrared, are found. Effects due to non-vanishing temperatures T, on the other hand, are minute for T < 250 MeV.
