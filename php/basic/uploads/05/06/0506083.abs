Title: Exploring Vacuum Manifold of Open String Field Theory
Authors: Y. Igarashi and K. Itoh and F. Katsumata and T. Takahashi and S. Zeze
Abstract: The global symmetry generated by K_n is a subgroup of the stringy gauge symmetry. We explore the part of the vacuum manifold related by this symmetry. A strong evidence is presented that the analytic classical solutions to the cubic string field theory found earlier in Refs. [5,6] are actually related by the symmetry and, therefore, all of them describe the same tachyon vacuum. Some remaining subtlety is pointed out.
