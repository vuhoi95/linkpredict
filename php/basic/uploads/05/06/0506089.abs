Title: Casimir force between planes as a boundary finite size effect
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs
Abstract: The ground state energy of a boundary quantum field theory is derived in planar geometry in D+1 dimensional spacetime. It provides a universal expression for the Casimir energy which exhibits its dependence on the boundary conditions via the reflection amplitudes of the low energy particle excitations. We demonstrate the easy and straightforward applicability of the general expression by analyzing the free scalar field with Robin boundary condition and by rederiving the most important results available in the literature for this geometry.
