Title: Dirac Operator Zero-modes on a Torus
Authors: Yasushi Tenjinbayashi and Hiroshi Igarashi and Takanori Fujiwara
Abstract: We study Dirac operator zero-modes on a torus for gauge background with uniform field strengths. Under the basic translations of the torus coordinates the wave functions are subject to twisted periodic conditions. In a suitable torus coordinates the zero-mode wave functions can be related to holomorphic functions of the complex torus coordinates. We construct the zero-mode wave functions that satisfy the twisted periodic conditions. The chirality and the degeneracy of the zero-modes are uniquely determined by the gauge background and are consistent with the index theorem.
