Title: Excursions beyond the horizon: Black hole singularities in Yang-Mills  theories (I)
Authors: Guido Festuccia and Hong Liu
Abstract: We study black hole singularities in the AdS/CFT correspondence. These singularities show up in CFT in the behavior of finite-temperature correlation functions. We first establish a direct relation between space-like geodesics in the bulk and momentum space Wightman functions of CFT operators of large dimensions. This allows us to probe the regions inside the horizon and near the singularity using the CFT. Information about the black hole singularity is encoded in the exponential falloff of finite-temperature correlators at large imaginary frequency. We construct new gauge invariant observables whose divergences reflect the presence of the singularity. We also find a UV/UV connection that governs physics inside the horizon. Additionally, we comment on the possible resolution of the singularity.
