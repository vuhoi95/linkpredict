Title: Abelian Higgs Model Effective Potential in the Presence of Vortices
Authors: Rudnei O. Ramos and J. F. Medeiros Neto and Daniel G. Barci and Cesar A. Linhares
Abstract: We determine the contribution of nontrivial vacuum (topological) excitations, more specifically vortex--strings of the Abelian Higgs model in 3+1 dimensions, to the functional partition function. By expressing the original action in terms of dual transformed fields we make explicit in the equivalent action the contribution of the vortex--strings excitations of the model. The effective potential of an appropriately defined local vacuum expectation value of the vortex--string field in the dual transformed action is then evaluated both at zero and finite temperatures and its properties discussed in the context of the finite temperature phase transition.
