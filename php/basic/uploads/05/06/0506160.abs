Title: N=1,2 supersymmetric vacua of IIA supergravity and SU(2) structures
Authors: Jo Bovy and Dieter Lust and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We consider backgrounds of (massive) IIA supergravity of the form of a warped product $M_{1,3}\times_{\omega} X_6$, where $X_6$ is a six-dimensional compact manifold and $M_{1,3}$ is $AdS_4$ or a four-dimensional Minkowski space. We analyse conditions for $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry on manifolds of SU(2) structure. We prove the absence of solutions in certain cases.
