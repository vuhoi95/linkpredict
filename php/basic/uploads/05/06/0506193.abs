Title: Pseudoclassical Mechanics for the spin 0 and 1 particles
Authors: R. Casana and M Pazetti and B. M. Pimentel and J. S. Valverde
Abstract: We give an action for the massless spinning particle in pseudoclassical mechanics by using grassmann variables. The constructed action is invariant under $\tau $-reparametrizations, local SUSY and O(N) transformations. After quantization, for the special case N=2, we get an action which describes the spin 0, 1 particles and topological sectors of the massless DKP theory. A SUSY formulation of the given model is also explored.
