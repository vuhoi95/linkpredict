Abstract: We find a simple exact solution of 6-dimensional braneworld which captures some essential features of warped flux compactification, including a warped geometry, compactification, a magnetic flux, and one or two 3-brane(s). In this setup we analyze how the Hubble expansion rate on each brane changes when the brane tension changes. It is shown that effective Newton's constant resulting from this analysis agrees with that inferred by simply integrating extra dimensions out. Based on the result, a general formula for effective Newton's constant is conjectured and its application to cosmology with type IIB warped string compactification is discussed.
