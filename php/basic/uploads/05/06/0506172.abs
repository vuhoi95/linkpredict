Title: Large D-terms, hierarchical soft spectra and moduli stabilisation
Authors: Emilian Dudas and Sudhir K. Vempati
Abstract: We derive general expressions for soft terms in supergravity where D-terms contribute significantly to the supersymmetry breaking in addition to the standard F-type breaking terms. Such D-terms can strongly influence the scalar mass squared terms, while having limited impact on gaugino masses and the B-terms. We present parameterisations for the soft terms when D-terms dominate over F-terms or become comparable with them. Novel patterns emerge which can be tested phenomenologically. In a mixed anomaly-D mediated scenario, the scalars have masses from D-mediation, whereas gaugino masses are generated by anomaly mediation. As an application of this analysis, we show that while the "split supersymmetry" like mass spectrum with one fine tuned Higgs is not an automatic outcome of these scenarios, explicit models can be constructed where it can be realised. Finally, we show that large D-mediated supersymmetry breaking can be realised in string models based on intersecting D-branes. Examples are presented where the moduli are stabilised in the presence of large D-terms using non-perturbative gaugino condensation like effects.
