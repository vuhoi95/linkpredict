Title: Generalizations of Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Philip Pearle and Antony Valentini
Abstract: We review realistic models that reproduce quantum theory in some limit and yield potentially new physics outside that limit. In particular, we consider deterministic hidden-variables theories (such as the pilot-wave model) and their extension to 'quantum nonequilibrium', and we consider the continuous spontaneous localization model of wave function collapse. Other models are briefly discussed.
