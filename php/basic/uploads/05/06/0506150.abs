Title: Two-point correlators in the beta-deformed N=4 SYM at the  next-to-leading order
Authors: Silvia Penati and Alberto Santambrogio and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We compute two-point functions of lowest weight operators at the next-to-leading order in the couplings for the beta-deformed N=4 SYM. In particular we focus on the CPO Tr(Phi_1^2) and the operator Tr(Phi_1 Phi_2) not presently listed as BPS. We find that for both operators no anomalous dimension is generated at this order, then confirming the results recently obtained in hep-th/0506128. However, in both cases a finite correction to the two-point function appears.
