Abstract: We consider a finite sub-chain on an interval of the infinite XXX model in the ground state. The density matrix for such a subsystem was described in our previous works for the model with inhomogeneous spectral parameters. In the present paper, we give a compact formula for the physically interesting case of the homogeneous model.
