Title: Heat Content Asymptotics for Riemannian manifolds with Zaremba boundary  conditions
Authors: M. van den Berg and P. Gilkey and K. Kirsten and V. A. Kozlov
Abstract: The existence of a full asymptotic expansion for the heat content asymptotics of an operator of Laplace type with classical Zaremba boundary conditions on a smooth manifold is established. The first three coefficients in this asymptotic expansion are determined in terms of geometric invariants; partial information is obtained about the fourth coefficient.
