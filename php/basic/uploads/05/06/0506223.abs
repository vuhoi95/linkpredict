Title: R-symmetries from higher dimensions
Authors: Z. Lalak and R. Matyszkiewicz
Abstract: The supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model can tolerate quite a large hierarchy between various supersymmetry breaking terms, a good example being the models of split supersymmetry. However, theoretical models generating such a stable hierarchy are not so easy to construct. An interesting idea consists in coupling the brane localized gauge sector to extended supergravities in the bulk of extra dimensions, and using different sources of supersymmetry breaking in the bulk and on the brane. This in principle allows one to separate the magnitude of the gravitino mass from the supersymmetry breaking masses of gaugini and of charged matter. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of a simple field theoretical model where such an idea is realized. Departure from this symmetric set of boundary conditions breaks R-symmetry, and gaugino masses are generated at one-loop order, however the magnitude of the resulting soft gaugino masses is proportional to the R-symmetry breaking Majorana-type gravitino mass which is continously deformable to zero.
