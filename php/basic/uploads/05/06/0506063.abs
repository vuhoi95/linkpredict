Title: Semiclassical strings in Lunin-Maldacena background
Authors: N. P. Bobev and H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: In this paper we investigate semiclassical rotating string configurations in the recently found Lunin-Maldacena background. This background is conjectured to be dual to the Leigh-Strassler beta-deformation of N=4 SYM and therefore a good laboratory for tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence beyond the well explored AdS(5)x S(5) case. We consider different multispin configurations of rotating strings by allowing the strings to move in both the AdS(5) and the deformed S(5) part of the Lunin-Maldacena background. For all of these configurations we compute the string energy in terms of the angular momenta and the string winding numbers and thus provide the possibility of comparing our results to the anomalous dimension of the corresponding dilatation operator.
