Title: Detectability of Cosmic Topology in Generalized Chaplygin Gas Models
Authors: B. Mota and M. Makler and M. J. Reboucas
Abstract: If the spatial section of the universe is multiply connected, repeated images or patterns are expected to be detected observationally. However, due to the finite distance to the last scattering surface, such pattern repetitions could be unobservable. This raises the question of whether a given cosmic topology is detectable, depending on the values of the parameters of the cosmological model. We study how detectability is affected by the choice of the model itself for the matter-energy content of the universe, focusing our attention on the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model for dark matter and dark energy unification, and investigate how the detectability of cosmic topology depends on the GCG parameters. We determine to what extent a number of topologies are detectable for the current observational bounds on these parameters. It emerges from our results that the choice of GCG as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM matter-energy content model has an impact on the detectability of cosmic topology.
