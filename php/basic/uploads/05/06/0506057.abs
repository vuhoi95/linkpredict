Title: Conserved Charges of Higher D Kerr-AdS Spacetimes
Authors: S. Deser and Inanc Kanik and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We compute the energy and angular momenta of recent D-dimensional Kerr-AdS solutions to cosmological Einstein gravity, as well as of the BTZ metric, using our invariant charge definitions.
