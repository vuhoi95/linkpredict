Title: Comments on the beta-deformed N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: Daniel Z. Freedman and Umut Gursoy
Abstract: Several calculations of 2- and 3-point correlation functions in the deformed theory are presented. The central charge in the Lunin-Maldacena gravity dual is shown to be independent of the deformation parameter. Calculations show that 2- and 3-point functions of chiral primary operators have no radiative corrections to lowest order in the interactions. Correlators of the operator tr(Z_1Z_2), which has not previously been identified as chiral primary, also have vanishing lowest order corrections.
