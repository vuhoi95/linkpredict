Title: Fluctuations and Energy Shifts in the Bethe Ansatz
Authors: N. Beisert and L. Freyhult
Abstract: We study fluctuations and finite size corrections for the ferromagnetic thermodynamic limit in the Bethe ansatz for the Heisenberg XXX1/2 spin chain, which is the AdS/CFT dual of semiclassical spinning strings. For this system we derive the standard quantum mechanical formula which expresses the energy shift as a sum over fluctuation energies. As an example we apply our results to the simplest, one-cut solution of this system and derive its spectrum of fluctuations.
