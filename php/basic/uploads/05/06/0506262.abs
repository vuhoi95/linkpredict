Title: Defect Structures in Lorentz and CPT Violating Scenarios
Authors: M. N. Barreto and D. Bazeia and R. Menezes
Abstract: We investigate models described by real scalar fields, searching for defect structures in the presence of interactions which explicitly violate Lorentz and CPT symmetries. We first deal with a single field, and we investigate a class of models which supports traveling waves that violate Lorentz invariance. This scenario is then generalized to the case of two (or more) real scalar fields. In the case of two fields, in particular, we introduce another class of models, which supports topological structures that attain a Bogomol'nyi bound, although violating both Lorentz and CPT symmetries. An example is considered, for which we construct the Bogomol'nyi bound and find some explicit solutions. We show that violation of both Lorentz and CPT symmetries induces the appearance of an asymmetry between defects and anti-defects, including the presence of linearly stable solutions with negative energy density in their outer side.
