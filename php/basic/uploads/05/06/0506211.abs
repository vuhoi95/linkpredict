Title: A Laurent expansion for regularised integrals of holomorphic symbols
Authors: Sylvie Paycha and Simon Scott
Abstract: For a holomorphic family of classical pseudodifferential operators on a closed manifold we give exact formulae for all coefficients in the Laurent expansion of its Kontsevich-Vishik canonical trace. This generalizes a known result identifying the Wodzicki residue with the pole at zero to all higher order terms.
