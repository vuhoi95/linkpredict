Title: The Ï†_3^4 lattice field theory viewed from the high-temperature side
Authors: P. Butera and M. Comi
Abstract: We analyze high-temperature series expansions of the two-point and four-point correlation-functions in the three-dimensional euclidean lattice scalar field theory with quartic self-coupling, which have been recently extended through twenty-fifth order for the simple-cubic and body-centered-cubic lattices. We conclude that the length of the present series is sufficient for a fairly accurate description of the critical behavior of the model and confirm the validity of universality, scaling and hyperscaling. In the case of the body-centered-cubic lattice, we determine the value of the quartic self-coupling for which the leading corrections to scaling approximately vanish and correspondingly the universal critical parameters can be determined with high accuracy. In particular, for the susceptibility and the correlation-length exponents we find \gamma=1.2373(2) and \nu=0.6301(2). For the four-point renormalized coupling we find g=23.56(3). In the case of the simple-cubic lattice our results are consistent with earlier estimates.
