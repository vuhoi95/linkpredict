Title: Separable sequences in Bianchi I loop quantum cosmology
Authors: Daniel Cartin and Gaurav Khanna
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the properties of one-parameter sequences that arise when solving the Hamiltonian constraint in Bianchi I loop quantum cosmology using a separation of variables method. In particular, we focus on finding an expression for the sequence for all real values of the parameter, and discuss the pre-classicality of this function. We find that the behavior of these preclassical sequences imply time asymmetry on either side of the classical singularity in Bianchi I cosmology.
