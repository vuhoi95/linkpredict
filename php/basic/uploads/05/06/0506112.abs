Title: On A Superfield Extension of The ADHM Construction and N=1 Super  Instantons
Authors: Takeo Araki and Tatsuhiko Takashima and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We give a superfield extension of the ADHM construction for the Euclidean theory obtained by Wick rotation from the Lorentzian four dimensional N=1 super Yang-Mills theory. In particular, we investigate the procedure to guarantee the Wess-Zumino gauge for the superfields obtained by the extended ADHM construction, and show that the known super instanton configurations are correctly obtained.
