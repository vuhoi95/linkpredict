Title: Dyons of One Half Monopole Charge
Authors: Rosy Teh and Khai-Ming Wong
Abstract: We would like to present some exact SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs dyon solutions of one half monopole charge. These static dyon solutions satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations and are characterized by a parameter, $m$. They are axially symmetric. The gauge potentials and the electromagnetic fields possess a string singularity along the negative z-axis and hence they possess infinite energy density along the line singularity. However the net electric charges of these dyons which varies with the parameter $m$ are finite.
