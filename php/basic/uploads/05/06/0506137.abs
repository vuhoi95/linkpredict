Title: Constraints on Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Dark Energy Cosmologies
Authors: Luca Amendola and Christos Charmousis and Stephen C. Davis
Abstract: Models with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian appear naturally from Kaluza-Klein compactifications of pure higher-dimensional gravity. We study linear, cosmological perturbations in the limits of weak coupling and slow-roll, and derive simple expressions for the main observable sub-horizon quantities: the anisotropic stress factor, the time-dependent gravitational constant, and the matter perturbation growth factor. Using present observational data, and assuming slow-roll for the dark energy field, we find that the fraction of energy density associated with the coupled Gauss-Bonnet term cannot exceed 15%. The bound should be treated with caution, as there are significant uncertainies in the data used to obtain it. Even so, it indicates that the future prospects for constraining the coupled Gauss-Bonnet term with cosmological observations are encouraging.
