Title: Multi-(super)graviton theory on topologically non-trivial backgrounds
Authors: Guido Cognola and Emilio Elizalde and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: It is shown that in some multi-supergraviton models, the contributions to the effective potential due to a non-trivial topology can be positive, giving rise in this way to a positive cosmological constant, as demanded by cosmological observations.
