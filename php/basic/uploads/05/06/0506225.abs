Abstract: We solve N=(8,8) super Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions at strong coupling to directly confirm the predictions of supergravity at weak coupling. We do our calculations in the large-N_c approximation using Supersymmetric Discrete Light-Cone Quantization with up to 3*10^{12} basis states. We calculate the stress-energy correlator <T^{++}(r) T^{++}(0)> as a function of the separation r and find that at intermediate values of r the correlator behaves as r^{-5} to within errors as predicted by weak-coupling supergravity. We also present an extension to significantly higher resolution of our earlier results for the same correlator in the N=(2,2) theory and see that in this theory the correlator has very different behavior at intermediate values of r.
