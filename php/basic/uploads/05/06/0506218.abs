Title: Conjecture on the Avoidance of the Big Crunch
Authors: C. Y. Sun and D. H. Zhang
Abstract: KKLT give a mechanism to generate de Sitter vacua in string theory. And recently, the scenario, {\em landscape}, is suggested to explain the problem of the cosmological constant. In this scenario, the cosmological constant is a de Sitter vacuum. The vacuum is metastable and would decay into an anti-de Sitter vacuum finally. Then the catastrophe of the big crunch appears. In this paper by conjecturing the physics at the Planck scale, we modify the definition of the Hawking temperature. Hinted by this modification, we modify the Friedmann equation. we find that this avoid the singularity and gives a bouncing cosmological model.
