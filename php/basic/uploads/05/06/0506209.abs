Title: Numerical Investigation of Monopole Chains
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Vishesh Khemani
Abstract: We present numerical results for chains of SU(2) BPS monopoles constructed from Nahm data. The long chain limit reveals an asymmetric behavior transverse to the periodic direction, with the asymmetry becoming more pronounced at shorter separations. This analysis is motivated by a search for semiclassical finite temperature instantons in the 3D SU(2) Georgi-Glashow model, but it appears that in the periodic limit the instanton chains either have logarithmically divergent action or wash themselves out.
