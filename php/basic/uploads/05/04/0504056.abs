Abstract: The dS/dS correspondence provides a holographic description of quantum gravity in d dimensional de Sitter space near the horizon of a causal region in a well defined approximation scheme; it is equivalent to the low energy limit of conformal field theory on de Sitter space in d-1 dimensions coupled to d-1 dimensional gravity. In this work, we extend the duality to higher energy scales by performing calculations of various basic physical quantities sensitive to the UV region of the geometry near the center of the causal patch. In the regime of energies below the d dimensional Planck scale but above the curvature scale of the geometry, these calculations encode the physics of the d-1 dimensional matter plus gravity system above the crossover scale where gravitational effects become strong. They exhibit phenomena familiar from studies of two dimensional gravity coupled to conformal field theory, including the cancellation of the total Weyl anomaly in d-1 dimensions. We also outline how the correspondence can be used to address the issue of observables in de Sitter space, and generalize the correspondence to other space times, such as black holes, inflationary universes, and landscape bubble decays. In the cases with changing cosmological constant, we obtain a dual description in terms of renormalization group flow.
