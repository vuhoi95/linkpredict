Title: The Electromagnetic Field Stress Tensor between Dielectric Half-Spaces
Authors: V. Sopova and L. H. Ford
Abstract: The stress tensor for the quantized electromagnetic field is calculated in the region between a pair of dispersive, dielectric half-spaces. This generalizes the stress tensor for the Casimir energy to the case where the boundaries have finite reflectivity. We also include the effects of finite temperature. This allows us to discuss the circumstances under which the weak energy condition and the null energy condition can be violated in the presence of finite reflectivity and finite temperature.
