Title: Representation theory of sl(2|1)
Authors: Gerhard Gotz and Thomas Quella and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: In this note we present a complete analysis of finite dimensional representations of the Lie superalgebra sl(2|1). This includes, in particular, the decomposition of all tensor products into their indecomposable building blocks. Our derivation makes use of a close relation with the representation theory of gl(1|1) for which analogous results are described and derived.
