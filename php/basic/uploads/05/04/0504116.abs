Title: Hermitean matrix model free energy: Feynman graph technique for all  genera
Authors: L. Chekhov and B. Eynard
Abstract: We present a diagrammatic technique for calculating the free energy of the Hermitian one-matrix model to all orders of 1/N expansion in the case where the limiting eigenvalue distribution spans arbitrary (but fixed) number of disjoint intervals (curves).
