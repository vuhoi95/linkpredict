Title: Delocalization of brane gravity by a bulk black hole
Authors: Sanjeev S. Seahra and Chris Clarkson and Roy Maartens
Abstract: We investigate the analogue of the Randall-Sundrum brane-world in the case when the bulk contains a black hole. Instead of the static vacuum Minkowski brane of the RS model, we have an Einstein static vacuum brane. We find that the presence of the bulk black hole has a dramatic effect on the gravity that is felt by brane observers. In the RS model, the 5D graviton has a stable localized zero-mode that reproduces 4D gravity on the brane at low energies. With a bulk black hole, there is no such solution -- gravity is delocalized by the 5D horizon. However, the brane does support a discrete spectrum of metastable massive bound states, or quasinormal modes, as was recently shown to be the case in the RS scenario. These states should dominate the high frequency component of the bulk gravity wave spectrum on a cosmological brane. We expect our results to generalize to any bulk spacetime containing a Killing horizon.
