Title: Three-dimensional black holes from deformed anti-de Sitter
Authors: Stephane Detournay and Domenico Orlando and P. Marios Petropoulos and Philippe Spindel
Abstract: We present new exact three-dimensional black-string backgrounds, which contain both NS--NS and electromagnetic fields, and generalize the BTZ black holes and the black string studied by Horne and Horowitz. They are obtained as deformations of the Sl(2,R) WZW model. Black holes resulting from purely continuous deformations possess true curvature singularities. When discrete identifications are introduced, extra chronological singularities appear, which under certain circumstances turn out to be naked. The backgrounds at hand appear in the moduli space of the Sl(2,R) WZW model. Hence, they provide exact string backgrounds and allow for a more algebraical CFT description. This makes possible the determination of the spectrum of primaries.
