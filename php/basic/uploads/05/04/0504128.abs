Title: High-Energy theory for close Randall Sundrum branes
Authors: Claudia de Rham and Samuel Webster
Abstract: We obtain an effective theory for the radion dynamics of the two-brane Randall Sundrum model, correct to all orders in brane velocity in the limit of close separation, which is of interest for studying brane collisions and early Universe cosmology. Obtained via a recursive solution of the Bulk equation of motions, the resulting theory represents a simple extension of the corresponding low-energy effective theory to the high energy regime. The four-dimensional low-energy theory is indeed not valid when corrections at second order in velocity are considered. This extension has the remarkable property of including only second derivatives and powers of first order derivatives. This important feature makes the theory particularly easy to solve. We then extend the theory by introducing a potential and detuning the branes.
