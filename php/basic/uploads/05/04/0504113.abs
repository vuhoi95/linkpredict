Title: On Hawking Radiation as Tunneling with Back-Reaction
Authors: A. J. M. Medved and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: Recently, Angheben et.al. [hep-th/0503081] have presented a refined method for calculating the (tree-level) black hole temperature by way of the tunneling paradigm. In the current letter, we demonstrate how their formalism can be suitably adapted to accommodate the (higher-order) effects of the gravitational back-reaction.
