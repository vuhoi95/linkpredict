Title: Lorentz-violation and cosmological perturbations: a toy brane-world  model
Authors: M. V. Libanov and V. A. Rubakov
Abstract: We study possible effects of Lorentz-violation on the generation of cosmological perturbations at inflation by introducing a simple inflating five-dimensional brane-world setup with violation of four-dimensional Lorentz-invariance at an energy scale $k$. We consider massless scalar field, meant to mimic perturbations of inflaton and/or gravitational field, in this background. At three-momenta below $k$, there exists a zero mode localized on the brane, whose behaviour coincides with that in four-dimensional theory. On the contrary, at three-momenta above $k$, the localized mode is absent and physics is entirely five-dimensional. As three-momenta get redshifted, more modes get localized on the brane, the phenomenon analogous to ``mode generation''. We find that for $k\gg H$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble scale, the spectrum of perturbations coincides with that in four-dimensional theory. For $k < H$ and time-dependent bulk parameters, the spectrum deviates, possibly strongly, from the flat spectrum even for pure de Sitter inflation.
