Abstract: The functional formulation and one-loop effective action for scalar self-interacting theory non-linearly coupled with some power of the curvature are studied. After the explicit one-loop renormalization at weak curvature, we investigated numerically the phase structure for such unusual phi^4 theory. It is demonstrated the possibility of curvature-induced phase transitions for positive values of the curvature power, while for negative values the radiative symmetry breaking does not take place. The dynamical mechanism for the explanation of the current smallness of the cosmological constant is presented for several models from the class of theories under consideration.
