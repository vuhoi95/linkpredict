Title: Charges of twisted branes: the exceptional cases
Authors: Stefan Fredenhagen and Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Thomas Mettler
Abstract: The charges of the twisted D-branes for the two exceptional cases (SO(8) with the triality automorphism and E_6 with charge conjugation) are determined. To this end the corresponding NIM-reps are expressed in terms of the fusion rules of the invariant subalgebras. As expected the charge groups are found to agree with those characterising the untwisted branes.
