Title: Instanton constraints and renormalization
Authors: P. M. Glerfoss and N. K. Nielsen
Abstract: The renormalization is investigated of one-loop quantum fluctuations around a constrained instanton in $\phi ^4$-theory with negative coupling. It is found that the constraint should be renormalized also. This indicates that in general only renormalizable constraints are permitted.
