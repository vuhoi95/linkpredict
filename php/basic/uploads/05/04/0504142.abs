Title: Black Rings in Taub-NUT
Authors: Iosif Bena and Per Kraus and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We construct the most generic three-charge, three-dipole-charge, BPS black-ring solutions in a Taub-NUT background. These solutions depend on seven charges and six moduli, and interpolate between a four-dimensional black hole and a five-dimensional black ring. They are also instrumental in determining the correct microscopic description of the five-dimensional BPS black rings.
