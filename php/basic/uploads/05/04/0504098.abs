Title: 1/2 BPS Geometries of M2 Giant Gravitons
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Sanjay Siwach and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We construct the general 1/2 BPS M2 giant graviton solutions asymptotic to the eleven-dimensional maximally supersymmetric plane wave background, based on the recent work of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena. The solutions have null singularity and we argue that it is unavoidable to have null singularity in the proposed framework, although the solutions are still physically relevant. They involve an arbitrary function F(x) which is shown to have a correspondence to the 1/2 BPS states of the BMN matrix model. A detailed map between the 1/2 BPS states of both sides is worked out.
