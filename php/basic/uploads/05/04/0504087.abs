Title: Thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes with a conformally coupled  scalar field
Authors: Anne-Marie Barlow and Daniel Doherty and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes with a conformally coupled scalar field. The geometry is that of the ``lukewarm'' Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes, with the event and cosmological horizons at the same temperature. This means that the region between the event and cosmological horizons can form a regular Euclidean instanton. The entropy is modified by the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field to the geometry, but can still be derived from the Euclidean action, provided suitable modifications are made to deal with the electrically charged case. We use the first law as derived from the isolated horizons formalism to compute the local horizon energies for the event and cosmological horizons.
