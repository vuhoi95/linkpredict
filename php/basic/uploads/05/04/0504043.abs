Title: Supersymmetric Non-local Gas Equation
Authors: Ashok Das and Z. Popowicz
Abstract: In this paper we study systematically the question of supersymmetrization of the non-local gas equation. We obtain both the N=1 and the N=2 supersymmetric generalizations of the system which are integrable. We show that both the systems are bi-Hamiltonian. While the N=1 supersymmetrization allows the hierarchy of equations to be extended to negative orders (local equations), we argue that this is not the case for the N=2 supersymmetrization. In the bosonic limit, however, the N=2 system of equations lead to a new coupled integrable system of equations.
