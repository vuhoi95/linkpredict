Title: Classical and Quantum Systems: Alternative Hamiltonian Descriptions
Authors: G. Marmo and G. Scolarici and A. Simoni and F. Ventriglia
Abstract: In complete analogy with the classical situation (which is briefly reviewed) it is possible to define bi-Hamiltonian descriptions for Quantum systems. We also analyze compatible Hermitian structures in full analogy with compatible Poisson structures.
