Title: New Axisymmetric Stationary Solutions of Five-dimensional Vacuum  Einstein Equations with Asymptotic Flatness
Authors: Takashi Mishima and Hideo Iguchi
Abstract: New axisymmetric stationary solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations in five-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes are obtained by using solitonic solution-generating techniques. The new solutions are shown to be equivalent to the four-dimensional multi-solitonic solutions derived from particular class of four-dimensional Weyl solutions and to include different black rings from those obtained by Emparan and Reall.
