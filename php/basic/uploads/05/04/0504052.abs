Title: Gauss-Bonnet dark energy
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We propose the Gauss-Bonnet dark energy model inspired by string/M-theory where standard gravity with scalar contains additional scalar-dependent coupling with Gauss-Bonnet invariant. It is demonstrated that effective phantom (or quintessence) phase of late universe may occur in the presence of such term when the scalar is phantom or for non-zero potential (for canonical scalar). However, with the increase of the curvature the GB term may become dominant so that phantom phase is transient and $w=-1$ barrier may be passed. Hence, the current acceleration of the universe may be caused by mixture of scalar phantom and (or) potential/stringy effects. It is remarkable that scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling acts against the Big Rip occurence in phantom cosmology.
