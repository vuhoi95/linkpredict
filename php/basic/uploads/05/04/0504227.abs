Title: On Dynamics of Strings and Branes
Authors: A. V. Golovnev and L. V. Prokhorov
Abstract: We study Nambu-Goto strings and branes. It is shown that they can be considered as continuous limits of ordered discrete sets of relativistic particles for which the tangential velocities are excluded from the action. The linear in unphysical momenta constraints are found. It allows to derive the evolution operators for the objects under consideration from the "first principles".
