Title: Lectures on Twistor Strings and Perturbative Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and Peter Svrcek
Abstract: Recently, Witten proposed a topological string theory in twistor space that is dual to a weakly coupled gauge theory. In this lectures we will discuss aspects of the twistor string theory. Along the way we will learn new things about Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes. The string theory sheds light on Yang-Mills perturbation theory and leads to new methods for computing Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes.
