Title: On $N$-differential graded algebras
Authors: Mauricio Angel and Rafael DÃ­az
Abstract: We introduce the concept of $N$-differential graded algebras (N-dga), and study the moduli space of deformations of the differential of a N-dga. We prove that it is controlled by what we call the N-Maurer-Cartan equation.
