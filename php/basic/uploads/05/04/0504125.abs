Title: Supersymmetric 4D Rotating Black Holes from 5D Black Rings
Authors: Henriette Elvang and Roberto Emparan and David Mateos and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: We present supersymmetric solutions describing black holes with non-vanishing angular momentum in four dimensional asymptotically flat space. The solutions are obtained by Kaluza-Klein reduction of five-dimensional supersymmetric black rings wrapped on the fiber of a Taub-NUT space. We show that in the four-dimensional description the singularity of the nut can be hidden behind a regular black hole event horizon and thereby obtain an explicit example of a non-static multi-black hole solution in asymptotically flat four dimensions.
