Title: Recursion Relations for Gauge Theory Amplitudes with Massive Particles
Authors: S. D. Badger and E. W. N. Glover and V. V. Khoze and P. Svrcek
Abstract: We derive general tree-level recursion relations for amplitudes which include massive propagating particles. As an illustration, we apply these recursion relations to scattering amplitudes of gluons coupled to massive scalars. We provide new results for all amplitudes with a pair of scalars and n < 5 gluons. These amplitudes can be used as building blocks in the computation of one-loop 6-gluon amplitudes using unitarity based methods.
