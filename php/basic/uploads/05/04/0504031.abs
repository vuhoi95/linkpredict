Title: Stability of smeared black branes and the Gubser-Mitra conjecture
Authors: Gungwon Kang and Youngone Lee
Abstract: Recently, it was suggested that the system of smeared black branes might provide a counter example to the Gubser-Mitra conjecture. Concerning to this issue, we have investigated the s-wave perturbation analysis to see how the stability of such system behaves. Some partial results are reported in this meeting.
