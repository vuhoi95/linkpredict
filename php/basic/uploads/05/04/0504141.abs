Title: Spacetime structure of static solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity: charged  case
Authors: Takashi Torii and Hideki Maeda
Abstract: We have studied spacetime structures of static solutions in the $n$-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system. Especially we focus on effects of the Maxwell charge. We assume that the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$ is non-negative and $4{\tilde \alpha}/\ell^2\leq 1$ in order to define the relevant vacuum state. Solutions have the $(n-2)$-dimensional Euclidean sub-manifold whose curvature is $k=1,~0$, or -1. In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, solutions are classified into plus and minus branches. In the plus branch all solutions have the same asymptotic structure as those in general relativity with a negative cosmological constant. The charge affects a central region of the spacetime. A branch singularity appears at the finite radius $r=r_b>0$ for any mass parameter. There the Kretschmann invariant behaves as $O((r-r_b)^{-3})$, which is much milder than divergent behavior of the central singularity in general relativity $O(r^{-4(n-2)})$. Some charged black hole solutions have no inner horizon in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Although there is a maximum mass for black hole solutions in the plus branch for $k=-1$ in the neutral case, no such maximum exists in the charged case. The solutions in the plus branch with $k=-1$ and $n\geq6$ have an "inner" black hole, and inner and the "outer" black hole horizons. Considering the evolution of black holes, we briefly discuss a classical discontinuous transition from one black hole spacetime to another.
