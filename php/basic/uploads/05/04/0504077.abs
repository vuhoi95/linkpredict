Title: Double Shape Invariance of Two-Dimensional Singular Morse Model
Authors: F. Cannata and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: A second shape invariance property of the two-dimensional generalized Morse potential is discovered. Though the potential is not amenable to conventional separation of variables, the above property allows to build purely algebraically part of the spectrum and corresponding wave functions, starting from {\it one} definite state, which can be obtained by the method of $SUSY$-separation of variables, proposed recently.
