Title: Chaplygin-Kalb-Ramond Quartessence
Authors: Neven Bilic and Gary B. Tupper and Raoul D. Viollier
Abstract: Unified dark matter/energy models (quartessence) based upon the Chaplygin gas D-brane fail owing to the suppression of structure formation by the adiabatic speed of sound. Including string theory effects, in particular the Kalb-Ramond field which becomes massive via the brane, we show how nonadiabatic perturbations allow successful structure formation.
