Title: Continuous area spectrum in regular black hole
Authors: Hidefumi Nomura and Takashi Tamaki
Abstract: We investigate highly damped quasinormal modes of regular black hole coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. Using the WKB approximation combined with complex-integration technique, we show that the real part of the frequency disappears in the highly damped limit. If we use the Bohr's correspondence principle, the area spectrum of this black hole is continuous. We discuss its implication in the loop quantum gravity.
