Title: Topological expansion of the 2-matrix model correlation functions:  diagrammatic rules for a residue formula
Authors: Bertrand Eynard and Nicolas Orantin
Abstract: We solve the loop equations of the hermitian 2-matrix model to all orders in the topological $1/N^2$ expansion, i.e. we obtain all non-mixed correlation functions, in terms of residues on an algebraic curve. We give two representations of those residues as Feynman-like graphs, one of them involving only cubic vertices.
