Title: Non-supersymmetric smooth geometries and D1-D5-P bound states
Authors: Vishnu Jejjala and Owen Madden and Simon F. Ross and Georgina Titchener
Abstract: We construct smooth non-supersymmetric soliton solutions with D1-brane, D5-brane and momentum charges in type IIB supergravity compactified on T^4 x S^1, with the charges along the compact directions. This generalises previous studies of smooth supersymmetric solutions. The solutions are obtained by considering a known family of U(1) x U(1) invariant metrics, and studying the conditions imposed by requiring smoothness. We discuss the relation of our solutions to states in the CFT describing the D1-D5 system, and describe various interesting features of the geometry.
