Title: Soft-Gluon Production Due to a Gluon Loop in a Constant Chromo-Electric  Background Field
Authors: Gouranga C. Nayak and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We obtain an exact result for the soft gluon production and its p_T distribution due to a gluon loop in a constant chromo-electric background field E^a with arbitrary color. Unlike Schwinger's result for e^+e^- pair production in QED which depends only on one gauge invariant quantity, the Electric field E, we find that the p_T distribution of the gluons depend on two gauge invariant quantities, E^aE^a and [d_{abc}E^aE^bE^c]^2.
