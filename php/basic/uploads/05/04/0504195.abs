Title: Infrared enhanced analytic coupling and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD
Authors: A. C. Aguilar and A. V. Nesterenko and J. Papavassiliou
Abstract: We study the impact on chiral symmetry breaking of a recently developed model for the QCD analytic invariant charge. This charge contains no adjustable parameters, other than the QCD mass scale $\Lambda$, and embodies asymptotic freedom and infrared enhancement into a single expression. Its incorporation into the standard form of the quark gap equation gives rise to solutions for the dynamically generated mass that display a singular confining behaviour at the origin. Using the Pagels-Stokar method we relate the obtained solutions to the pion decay constant $f_{\pi}$, and estimate the scale parameter $\Lambda$, in the presence of four active quarks, to be about 880 MeV.
