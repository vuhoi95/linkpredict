Title: Supersymmetric Kerr--anti-deSitter solutions
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Peng Gao and Joan Sim√≥n
Abstract: We prove the existence of one quarter supersymmetric type IIB configurations that arise as non-trivial scaling solutions of the standard five dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes by the explicit construction of its Killing spinors. This neutral, spinning solution is asymptotic to the static anti-deSitter space-time with cosmological constant $-\textstyle{\frac{1}{\ell^2}}$, it has two finite equal angular momenta $J_1=\pm J_2$, mass $M=\textstyle{\frac{1}{\ell}} (|J_1|+|J_2|)$ and a naked singularity.We also address the scaling limit associated with one half supersymmetric solution with only one angular momentum.
