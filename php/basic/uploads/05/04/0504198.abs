Title: BRST symmetry of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in Cho--Faddeev--Niemi  decomposition
Authors: K. -I. Kondo and T. Murakami and T. Shinohara
Abstract: We determine the nilpotent BRST and anti-BRST transformations for the Cho--Faddeev-Niemi variables for the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory based on the new interpretation given in the previous paper of the Cho--Faddeev-Niemi decomposition. This gives a firm ground for performing the BRST quantization of the Yang--Mills theory written in terms of the Cho--Faddeev-Niemi variables. We propose also a modified version of the new Maximal Abelian gauge which could play an important role in the reduction to the original Yang-Mills theory.
