Title: On positive functions with positive Fourier transforms
Authors: B. G. Giraud and R. Peschanski
Abstract: Using the basis of Hermite-Fourier functions (i.e. the quantum oscillator eigenstates) and the Sturm theorem, we derive the practical constraints for a function and its Fourier transform to be both positive. We propose a constructive method based on the algebra of Hermite polynomials. Applications are extended to the 2-dimensional case (i.e. Fourier-Bessel transforms and the algebra of Laguerre polynomials) and to adding constraints on derivatives, such as monotonicity or convexity.
