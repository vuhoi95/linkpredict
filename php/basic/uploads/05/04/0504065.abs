Title: Quantum Bi-Hamiltonian systems, alternative Hermitian structures and  Bi-Unitary transformations
Authors: G. Marmo and G. Scolarici and A. Simoni and F. Ventriglia
Abstract: We discuss the dynamical quantum systems which turn out to be bi-unitary with respect to the same alternative Hermitian structures in a infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space. We give a necessary and sufficient condition so that the Hermitian structures are in generic position. Finally the transformations of the bi-unitary group are explicitly obtained.
