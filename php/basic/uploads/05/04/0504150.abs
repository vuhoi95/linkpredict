Title: The Classical and Commutative Limits of noncommutative Quantum  Mechanics: A Superstar \bigstar Wigner-Moyal Equation
Authors: Ardeshir Eftekharzadeh and B. L. Hu
Abstract: We are interested in the similarities and differences between the quantum-classical (Q-C) and the noncommutative-commutative (NC-Com) correspondences. As one useful platform to address this issue we derive the superstar Wigner-Moyal equation for noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM). A superstar $\bigstar$-product combines the usual phase space $\ast$ star and the noncommutative $\star$ star-product. Having dealt with subtleties of ordering present in this problem we show that the classical correspondent to the NC Hamiltonian has the same form as the original Hamiltonian, but with a non-commutativity parameter $\theta$-dependent, momentum-dependent shift in the coordinates. Using it to examine the classical and the commutative limits, we find that there exist qualitative differences between these two limits. Specifically, if $\theta \neq 0$ there is no classical limit. Classical limit exists only if $\theta \to 0$ at least as fast as $\hbar \to 0$, but this limit does not yield Newtonian mechanics, unless the limit of $\theta/\hbar$ vanishes as $\theta \to 0$. Another angle to address this issue is the existence of conserved currents and the Noether's theorem in the continuity equation, and the Ehrenfest theorem in the NCQM context.
