Title: The Non-Abelian Topological Gauge Field Theory of \tilde{p}-Branes
Authors: Yi-Shi Duan and Ji-rong Ren
Abstract: By the generalization of Chern--Simons topological current and Gauss--Bonnet-Chern theorem, the purpose of this paper is to make a non-Abelian gauge field theory foundation of the topological current of $\tilde{p}$-branes formulated in our previous work. Using $\phi $--mapping topological current theory proposed by Professor Duan, we find that the topological $\tilde p$-branes are created at every isolated zero of vector field $\vec \phi (x)$. It is shown that the topological charges carried by $\tilde p$-branes are topologically quantized and labeled by Hopf index and Brouwer degree, i.e., the winding number of the $\phi $--mapping. The action of topological $\tilde p$--branes is obtained and is just Nambu action for multistrings when $D- \tilde d=2$.
