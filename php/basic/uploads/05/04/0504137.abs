Title: Non-Gaussianity in KKLMMT model
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Ke Ke
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussianity of the brane inflation which happens in the same throat in the framework of the generalized KKLMMT model. When we take the constraints from non-Gaussianity into account, various consequences are discussed including the bound on the string coupling, such as the string coupling is larger than 0.08 and the effective string scale on the brane is larger than $1.3 \times 10^{-4} M_p$ in KKLMMT model.
