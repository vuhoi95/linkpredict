Title: A resolution of spacetime singularity and black hole paradoxes through  avoidance of trapped surface formation in Einstein gravity
Authors: Rituparno Goswami and Pankaj S. Joshi
Abstract: The occurrence of a spacetime singularity indicates the breakdown of Einstein gravitation theory in these extreme regimes. We consider here the singularity issue and various black hole paradoxes at classical and quantum levels. It is pointed out that a possible resolution to these problems could be arrived at by avoiding the formation of trapped surfaces during a continual gravitational collapse. A class of perfect fluid collapse models is constructed which realizes such a possibility. While the pressure could be negative in the interior of the cloud, the weak energy condition is satisfied. The collapsing star radiates away most of its matter as the process of gravitational collapse evolves, so as to avoid the formation of trapped surfaces and the spacetime singularity. The collapsing interior is matched to an exterior which is a generalized Vaidya spacetime to complete the model.
