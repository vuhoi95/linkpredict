Title: Quantum Hydrodynamics, Quantum Benjamin-Ono Equation, and Calogero Model
Authors: Alexander G. Abanov and Paul B. Wiegmann
Abstract: Collective field theory for Calogero model represents particles with fractional statistics in terms of hydrodynamic modes -- density and velocity fields. We show that the quantum hydrodynamics of this model can be written as a single evolution equation on a real holomorphic Bose field -- quantum integrable Benjamin-Ono equation. It renders tools of integrable systems to studies of nonlinear dynamics of 1D quantum liquids.
