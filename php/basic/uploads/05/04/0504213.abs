Title: Isospin Separation of Hidden Non-Abelian Monopole
Authors: Le Van Hoang and Nguyen Thanh Son
Abstract: The scheme of isospin separation is suggested for the equation describing the five-dimensional 'charge-dyon' system in a non-Abelian SU(2) model. As a result, we obtain the Schrodinger equation for 'bare' particle, moving in Coulomb potential plus potential of five-dimensional Dirac monopole.
