Title: On Exponential corrections to the 1/N expansion in two-dimensional Yang  Mills theory
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Antal Jevicki and Sanjaye Ramgoolam
Abstract: We compute $e^{-AN}$ corrections to the Gross-Taylor 1/N expansion of the paritition function of two-dimensional SU(N) and U(N) Yang Mills theory. We find a very similar structure of mixing between holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors as that described by Vafa for the 1/N expansion. Some of the non-perturbative terms are suggestive of D-strings wrapping the $T^2$ of the 2dYM but blowing up into a fuzzy geometry by the Myers effect in the directions transverse to the $T^2$.
