Title: Instabilities of noncommutative two dimensional BF model
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore and Michele Montobbio
Abstract: The noncommutative extension of two dimensional BF model is considered. It is shown that the realization of the noncommutative map via the Groenewold-Moyal star product leads to instabilities of the action, hence to a non renormalizable theory.
