Title: Dark Energy Dominance and Cosmic Acceleration in First Order Formalism

Abstract: The current accelerated universe could be produced by modified gravitational dynamics as it can be seen in particular in its Palatini formulation. We analyze here a specific non-linear gravity-scalar system in the first order Palatini formalism which leads to a FRW cosmology different from the purely metric one. It is shown that the emerging FRW cosmology may lead either to an effective quintessence phase (cosmic speed-up) or to an effective phantom phase. Moreover, the already known gravity assisted dark energy dominance occurs also in the first order formalism. Finally, it is shown that a dynamical theory able to resolve the cosmological constant problem exists also in this formalism, in close parallel with the standard metric formulation.
