Title: Two-Dimensional Thermofield Bosonization
Authors: R. L. P. G. Amaral and L. V. Belvedere and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to obtain an operator realization for the bosonization of fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions, at finite, non-zero temperature T. This is achieved in the framework of the real time formalism of Thermofield Dynamics. Formally the results parallel those of the T = 0 case. The well known two-dimensional Fermion-Boson correspondences at zero temperature are shown to hold also at finite temperature. In order to emphasize the usefulness of the operator realization for handling a large class of two-dimensional quantum field-theoretic problems, we contrast this global approach with the cumbersome calculation of the fermion-current two-point function in the imaginary-time formalism and real time formalisms. The calculations also illustrate the very different ways in which the transmutation from Fermi-Dirac to Bose-Einstein statistics is realized.
