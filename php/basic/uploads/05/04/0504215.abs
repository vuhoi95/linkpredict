Title: The flight of the bumblebee: vacuum solutions of a gravity model with  vector-induced spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking
Authors: O. Bertolami and J. Paramos
Abstract: We study the vacuum solutions of a gravity model where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken once a vector field acquires a vacuum expectation value. Results are presented for the purely radial Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB), radial/temporal LSB and axial/temporal LSB. The purely radial LSB result corresponds to new black hole solutions. When possible, Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters are computed and observational boundaries used to constrain the Lorentz symmetry breaking scale.
