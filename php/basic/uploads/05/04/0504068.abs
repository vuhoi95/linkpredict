Title: Strings at the bottom of the deformed conifold
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Alberto Iglesias
Abstract: We present solutions of the equations of motion of macroscopic F and D strings extending along the non compact 4D sections of the conifold geometry and winding around the internal directions. The effect of the Goldstone modes associated with the position of the strings on the internal manifold can be seen as a current on the string that prevents it from collapsing and allows the possibility of static 4D loops. Its relevance in recent models of brane inflation is discussed.
