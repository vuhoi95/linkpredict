Title: U(1) gauge field theory on kappa-Minkowski space
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Larisa Jonke and Lutz MÃ¶ller
Abstract: This study of U(1) gauge field theory on the kappa-deformed Minkowski spacetime extends previous work on gauge field theories on this type of noncommutative spacetime. We discuss in detail the properties of the Seiberg-Witten map and the resulting effective action for U(1) gauge theory with fermionic matter expanded in ordinary fields. We construct the conserved gauge current, fix part of the ambiguities in the Seiberg-Witten map and obtain an effective U(1) action invariant under the action of the undeformed Poincare group.
