Title: Quantum Behavior of Deterministic Systems with Information Loss. Path  Integral Approach
Authors: M. Blasone and P. Jizba and H. Kleinert
Abstract: 't Hooft's derivation of quantum from classical physics is analyzed by means of the classical path integral of Gozzi et al.. It is shown how the key element of this procedure - the loss of information constraint - can be implemented by means of Faddeev-Jackiw's treatment of constrained systems. It is argued that the emergent quantum systems are identical with systems obtained in [Phys.Rev. A 71 (2005) 052507] through Dirac-Bergmann's analysis. We illustrate our approach with two simple examples - free particle and linear harmonic oscillator. Potential Liouville anomalies are shown to be absent.
