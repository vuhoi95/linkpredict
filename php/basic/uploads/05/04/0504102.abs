Abstract: In general the gravitino mass and/or the soft supersymmetry breaking masses in the observable sector can be much larger than the TeV scale. Depending on the relation between the masses, new important channels for gravitino production in the early Universe can arise. Gravitinos with a mass above 50 TeV decay before big bang nucleosynthesis, which leads to relaxation of the well known bound on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm R} \leq 10^{10}$ GeV. However, if the heavy gravitinos are produced abundantly in the early Universe, their decay can alter the abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle. Moreover, they may dominate the energy density of the Universe. Their decay will in this case increase entropy and dilute already created baryon asymmetry and dark matter. Such considerations put new constraints on gravitino and sfermion masses, and the reheating temperature. In this paper we examine various cosmological consequences of supermassive gravitinos. We discuss advnatges and disadvantages of a large reheating temperature in connection with thermal leptogenesis, and find that large parts of the parameter space are opened up for the lightest right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We also discuss the viability of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis under the constraints from gravitino decay, and gravitino production from the decay of Q-balls.
