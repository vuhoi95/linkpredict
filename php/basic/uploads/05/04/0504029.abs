Title: Black hole evaporation: A paradigm
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Martin Bojowald
Abstract: A paradigm describing black hole evaporation in non-perturbative quantum gravity is developed by combining two sets of detailed results: i) resolution of the Schwarzschild singularity using quantum geometry methods; and ii) time-evolution of black holes in the trapping and dynamical horizon frameworks. Quantum geometry effects introduce a major modification in the traditional space-time diagram of black hole evaporation, providing a possible mechanism for recovery of information that is classically lost in the process of black hole formation. The paradigm is developed directly in the Lorentzian regime and necessary conditions for its viability are discussed. If these conditions are met, much of the tension between expectations based on space-time geometry and structure of quantum theory would be resolved.
