Title: The Meissner Effect in a Two Flavor LOFF Color Superconductor
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and Hai-Cang Ren
Abstract: We calculate the magnetic polarization tensor of the photon and of the gluons in a two flavor color superconductor with a LOFF pairing that consists of a single plane wave. We show that at zero temperature and within the range of the values of the displacement of the Fermi sea that favors the LOFF state, all the eigenvalues of the magnetic polarization tensor are positive. Therefore the chromomagnetic instabilities pertaining to a gapless color superconductor disappear.
