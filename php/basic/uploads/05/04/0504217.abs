Title: Dynamical generation of gauge groups in the massive  Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons matrix model
Authors: Takehiro Azuma and Subrata Bal and Jun Nishimura
Abstract: It has been known for some time that the dynamics of k coincident D-branes in string theory is described effectively by U(k) Yang-Mills theory at low energy. While these configurations appear as classical solutions in matrix models, it was not clear whether it is possible to realize the k =/= 1 case as the true vacuum. The massive Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons matrix model has classical solutions corresponding to all the representations of the SU(2) algebra, and provides an opportunity to address the above issue on a firm ground. We investigate the phase structure of the model, and find in particular that there exists a parameter region where O(N) copies of the spin-1/2 representation appear as the true vacuum, thus realizing a nontrivial gauge group dynamically. Such configurations are analogous to the ones that are interpreted in the BMN matrix model as coinciding transverse 5-branes in M-theory.
