Title: Geometry of Rank Reduction
Authors: Stefan Forste and Hans Peter Nilles and Akin Wingerter
Abstract: We introduce continuous Wilson lines to reduce the rank of the gauge group in orbifold constructions. In situations where the orbifold twist can be realised as a rotation in the root lattice of a grand unified group we derive an appealing geometric picture of the symmetry breakdown. This symmetry breakdown is smooth and corresponds to a standard field theory Higgs mechanism. The embedding into heterotic string theory is discussed.
