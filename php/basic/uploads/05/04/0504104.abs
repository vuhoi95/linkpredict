Title: Chiral Models in Noncommutative N=1/2 Four Dimensional Superspace
Authors: Thomas A. Ryttov and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We derive the component Lagrangian for a generic N=1/2 supersymmetric chiral model with an arbitrary number of fields in four space-time dimensions. We then investigate a toy model in which the deformation parameter modifies the undeformed potential near the origin of the field space in a way which suggests possible physical applications.
