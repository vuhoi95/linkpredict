Abstract: We study the tachyon and the RR field sourced by the $(m,n)$ ZZ D-branes in type 0 theories using three methods. We first use the mini-superspace approximation of the closed string wave functions of the tachyon and the RR scalar to probe these fields. These wave functions are then extended beyond the mini-superspace approximation using mild assumptions which are motivated by the properties of the corresponding wave functions in the mini-superspace limit. These are then used to probe the tachyon and the RR field sourced. Finally we study the space time fields sourced by the $(m,n)$ ZZ D-branes using the FZZT brane as a probe. In all the three methods we find that the tension of the $(m,n)$ ZZ brane is $mn$ times the tension of the $(1,1)$ ZZ brane. The RR charge of these branes is non-zero only for the case of both $m$ and $n$ odd, in which case it is identical to the charge of the $(1,1)$ brane. As a consistency check we also verify that the space time fields sourced by the branes satisfy the corresponding equations of motion.
