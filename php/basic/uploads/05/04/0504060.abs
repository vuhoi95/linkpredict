Title: Gaudin magnet with impurity and its generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov  equation
Authors: A. Lima-Santos and Wagner Utiel
Abstract: This work is concerned with the formulation of the boundary quantum inverse scattering method for the xxz Gaudin magnet coupled to boundary impurities with arbitrary exchange constants. The Gaudin magnet is diagonalized by taking a quasi-classical limit of the inhomogeneous lattice. Using the method proposed by Babujian, the integral representation for the solution of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation is explictly constructed and its rational limit discussed.
