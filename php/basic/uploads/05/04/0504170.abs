Abstract: Most studies of the potential for discovery of superpartners at the Fermilab Tevatron or CERN LHC have focused on the so-called mSUGRA (minimal supergravity mediated supersymmetry breaking) model, not because it is well motivated but because it has a minimal number of parameters. If signals are seen that could be superpartners, most analyses will attempt to interpret them in the mSUGRA framework since the needed software and computational tools exist. With only a few signal channels, and initially large statistical and systematic errors, it is very likely that an mSUGRA interpretation will look all right even if it is not. We present an approach to studying any potential signals of new physics in ``inclusive signature space'' that sensitively tests any proposed interpretation, and apply it to the mSUGRA case. The approach also has significant experimental advantages, reducing the sensitivity to jet energy corrections, dependence on beam luminosity, and other systematics. Basically, if one (or more) instances of reported data lies outside certain bounded regions of inclusive signature space characteristic of the physics being tested, that physics is excluded for any parameters. The approach can be used to study supersymmetry breaking and to point to the form of the underlying theory even without detailed measurements of a number of important parameters which will be difficult or impossible to measure at hadron colliders.
