Title: Quantum fields and motives
Authors: Alain Connes and Matilde Marcolli
Abstract: This is a survey of our results on the relation between perturbative renormalization and motivic Galois theory. The main result is that all quantum field theories share a common universal symmetry realized as a motivic Galois group, whose action is dictated by the divergences and generalizes that of the renormalization group. The existence of such a group was conjectured by P. Cartier based on number theoretic evidence and on the Connes-Kreimer theory of perturbative renormalization. The group provides a universal formula for counterterms and is obtained via a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence classifying equivalence classes of flat equisingular bundles, where the equisingularity condition corresponds to the independence of the counterterms on the mass scale.
