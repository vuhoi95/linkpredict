Title: From finite geometry exact quantities to (elliptic) scattering  amplitudes for spin chains: the 1/2-XYZ
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Marco Rossi
Abstract: Initially, we derive a nonlinear integral equation for the vacuum counting function of the spin 1/2-XYZ chain in the {\it disordered regime}, thus paralleling similar results by Kl\"umper \cite{KLU}, achieved through a different technique in the {\it antiferroelectric regime}. In terms of the counting function we obtain the usual physical quantities, like the energy and the transfer matrix (eigenvalues). Then, we introduce a double scaling limit which appears to describe the sine-Gordon theory on cylindrical geometry, so generalising famous results in the plane by Luther \cite{LUT} and Johnson et al. \cite{JKM}. Furthermore, after extending the nonlinear integral equation to excitations, we derive scattering amplitudes involving solitons/antisolitons first, and bound states later. The latter case comes out as manifestly related to the Deformed Virasoro Algebra of Shiraishi et al. \cite{SKAO}. Although this nonlinear integral equations framework was contrived to deal with finite geometries, we prove it to be effective for discovering or rediscovering S-matrices. As a particular example, we prove that this unique model furnishes explicitly two S-matrices, proposed respectively by Zamolodchikov \cite{ZAMe} and Lukyanov-Mussardo-Penati \cite{LUK, MP} as plausible scattering description of unknown integrable field theories.
