Title: Chaplygin gas with non-adiabatic pressure perturbations
Authors: Winfried Zimdahl and Julio C. Fabris
Abstract: Perturbations in a Chaplygin gas, characterized by an equation of state $p = -A/\rho$, may acquire non-adiabatic contributions if spatial variations of the parameter $A$ are admitted. This feature is shown to be related to a specific internal structure of the Chaplygin gas. We investigate how perturbations of this type modify the adiabatic sound speed and influence the time dependence of the gravitational potential which gives rise to the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.
