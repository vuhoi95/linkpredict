Title: Dually-charged mesoatom on the space of constant negative curvature
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: The discrete spectrum solutions corresponding to dually-charged mesoatom on the space of constant negative curvature are obtained. The discrete spectrum of energies is finite and vanishes, when the magnetic charge of the nucleus exceeds the critical value.
