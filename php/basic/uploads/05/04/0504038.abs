Title: On Z-gradations of twisted loop Lie algebras of complex simple Lie  algebras
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: We define the twisted loop Lie algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ as the Fr\'echet space of all twisted periodic smooth mappings from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathfrak g$. Here the Lie algebra operation is continuous. We call such Lie algebras Fr\'echet Lie algebras. We introduce the notion of an integrable $\mathbb Z$-gradation of a Fr\'echet Lie algebra, and find all inequivalent integrable $\mathbb Z$-gradations with finite dimensional grading subspaces of twisted loop Lie algebras of complex simple Lie algebras.
