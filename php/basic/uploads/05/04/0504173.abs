Title: Hole Theory of Boson Sea
Authors: Yoshinobu Habara and Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We propose a hole theory for bosons, in which, analogous to fermions, a hole produced by the annihilation of one negative energy boson is an anti-particle. We show that the boson vacuum indeed also consists of a sea in which all negative energy states are filled and the density of probability of the Klein-Gordon theory is positive definite also for the negative energy solution. This formalism is obtained by introducing the notion of a double harmonic oscillator, which is constructed by extending the condition imposed on the wave function. This double harmonic oscillator contains not only positive energy states but also negative energy ones. The physical result obtained from our method is consistent with that of the ordinary second quantization formalism. Our formulation is also consistent with the supersymmetric point of view. We finally suggest applications of our method to the anomalies of boson theories and the string theories.
