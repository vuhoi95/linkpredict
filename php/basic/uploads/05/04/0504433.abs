Title: The Vertex-Face Correspondence and Correlation Functions of the Fusion  Eight-Vertex Model I: The General Formalism
Authors: Takeo Kojima and Hitoshi Konno and Robert Weston
Abstract: Based on the vertex-face correspondence, we give an algebraic analysis formulation of correlation functions of the $k\times k$ fusion eight-vertex model in terms of the corresponding fusion SOS model. Here $k\in Z_{>0}$. A general formula for correlation functions is derived as a trace over the space of states of lattice operators such as the corner transfer matrices, the half transfer matrices (vertex operators) and the tail operator. We give a realization of these lattice operators as well as the space of states as objects in the level $k$ representation theory of the elliptic algebra $U_{q,p}(\hat{sl}_2)$.
