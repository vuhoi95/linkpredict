Title: B-Inflation
Authors: Alexey Anisimov and Eugeny Babichev and Alexander Vikman
Abstract: We propose a novel model of inflation based on a large class of covariant effective actions containing only the second derivatives of a scalar field. The initial conditions leading to the inflationary solutions in this model are rather generic. The graceful exit from the inflationary regime is natural once the first order derivative terms are included.
