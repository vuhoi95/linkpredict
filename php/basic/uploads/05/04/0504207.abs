Title: Casimir Energy for a Purely Dielectric Cylinder by the Mode Summation  Method
Authors: August Romeo and Kimball A. Milton
Abstract: We use the mode summation method together with zeta-function regularization to compute the Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric cylinder. The method is very transparent, and sheds light on the reason the resulting energy vanishes.
