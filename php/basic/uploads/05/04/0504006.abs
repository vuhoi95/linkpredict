Title: Charges of Exceptionally Twisted Branes
Authors: Terry Gannon and Muraari Vasudevan
Abstract: The charges of the exceptionally twisted (D4 with triality and E6 with charge conjugation) D-branes of WZW models are determined from the microscopic/CFT point of view. The branes are labeled by twisted representations of the affine algebra, and their charge is determined to be the ground state multiplicity of the twisted representation. It is explicitly shown using Lie theory that the charge groups of these twisted branes are the same as those of the untwisted ones, confirming the macroscopic K-theoretic calculation. A key ingredient in our proof is that, surprisingly, the G2 and F4 Weyl dimensions see the simple currents of A2 and D4, respectively.
