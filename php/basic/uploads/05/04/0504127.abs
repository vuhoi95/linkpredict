Title: Spacetime structure of static solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity: neutral  case
Authors: Takashi Torii and Hideki Maeda
Abstract: We study the spacetime structures of the static solutions in the $n$-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-$\Lambda$ system systematically. We assume the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$ is non-negative. The solutions have the $(n-2)$-dimensional Euclidean sub-manifold, which is the Einstein manifold with the curvature $k=1,~0$ and -1. We also assume $4{\tilde \alpha}/\ell^2\leq 1$, where $\ell$ is the curvature radius, in order for the sourceless solution (M=0) to be defined. The general solutions are classified into plus and minus branches. The structures of the center, horizons, infinity and the singular point depend on the parameters $\alpha$, $\ell^2$, $k$, $M$ and branches complicatedly so that a variety of global structures for the solutions are found. In the plus branch, all the solutions have the same asymptotic structure at infinity as that in general relativity with a negative cosmological constant. For the negative mass parameter, a new type of singularity called the branch singularity appears at non-zero finite radius $r=r_b>0$. The divergent behavior around the singularity in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is milder than that around the central singularity in general relativity. In the $k=1,~0$ cases the plus-branch solutions do not have any horizon. In the $k=-1$ case, the radius of the horizon is restricted as $r_h<\sqrt{2\tilde{\alpha}}$ ($r_h>\sqrt{2\tilde{\alpha}}$) in the plus (minus) branch. There is also the extreme black hole solution with positive mass in spite of the lack of electromagnetic charge. We briefly discuss the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet corrections on black hole formation in a collider and the possibility of the violation of third law of the black hole thermodynamics.
