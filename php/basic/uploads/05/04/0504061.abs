Title: A wide class of four point functions of BPS operators in N=4 SYM at  order g^4
Authors: Marco D'Alessandro and Luigi Genovese
Abstract: The calculation of a large family of four point functions of general BPS operators in N=4 SYM is reduced to the evaluation of colour contractions. For 1/2 BPS operators O_\Delta the explicit results at order g^4 for the function < O_n O_2 O_n O_2 > are given up to n=6. The OPE of the general result is performed up to the second order in the short distance expansion parameter. Two examples are given, in which the mixing of the operators in the intermediate channel can be resolved using four point functions computed by this method.
