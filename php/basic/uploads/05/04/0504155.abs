Title: Towards Supergravity Duals of Chiral Symmetry Breaking in  Sasaki-Einstein Cascading Quiver Theories
Authors: Benjamin A. Burrington and James T. Liu and Manavendra Mahato and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We construct a first order deformation of the complex structure of the cone over Sasaki-Einstein spaces Y^{p,q} and check supersymmetry explicitly. This space is a central element in the holographic dual of chiral symmetry breaking for a large class of cascading quiver theories. We discuss a solution describing a stack of N D3 branes and M fractional D3 branes at the tip of the deformed spaces.
