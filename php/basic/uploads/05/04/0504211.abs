Title: Four-Point Functions in Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Michael Flohr and Marco Krohn
Abstract: The generic structure of 4-point functions of fields residing in indecomposable representations of arbitrary rank is given. The used algorithm is described and we present all results for Jordan-rank $r=2$ and $r=3$ where we make use of permutation symmetry and use a graphical representation for the results. A number of remaining degrees of freedom which can show up in the correlator are discussed in detail. Finally we present the results for two-logarithmic fields for arbitrary Jordan-rank.
