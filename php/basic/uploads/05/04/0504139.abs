Title: The ringing wormholes
Authors: R. A. Konoplya and C. Molina
Abstract: We investigate the response of the traversable wormholes to the external perturbations through finding their characteristic frequencies and time-domain profiles. The considered solution describes traversable wormholes between the branes in the two brane Randall-Sundrum model and was previously found within Einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field. The evolution of perturbations of a wormhole is similar to that of a black hole and represents damped oscillations (ringing) at intermediately late times, which are suppressed by power law tails (proportional to t^{-2} for monopole perturbations) at asymptotically late times.
