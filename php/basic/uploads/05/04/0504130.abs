Title: A Possible Late Time $Î›$CDM-like Background Cosmology in  Relativistic MOND Theory
Authors: J. G. Hao and R. Akhoury
Abstract: In the framework of Relativistic MOND theory (TeVeS), we show that a late time background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology can be attained by choosing a specific $F(\mu)$ that also meets the requirement for the existence of Newtonian and MOND limits. We investigate the dynamics of the scalar field $\phi$ under our chosen $F(\mu)$ and show that the "slow roll" regime of $\phi$ corresponds to a dynamical attractor, where the whole system reduces to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
