Title: The fate of radiating black holes in noncommutative geometry
Authors: Piero Nicolini and Anais Smailagic and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of a radiating Schwarzschild black hole toy-model in a 2D noncommutative spacetime. It is shown that coordinate noncommutativity leads to: i) the existence of a minimal non-zero mass to which black hole can shrink; ii) a finite maximum temperature that the black hole can reach before cooling down to absolute zero; iii) the absence of any curvature singularity. The proposed scenario offers a possible solution to conventional difficulties when describing terminal phase of black hole evaporation.
