Title: The SU(N) Matrix Model at Two Loops
Authors: D. Grasso and I. N. McArthur
Abstract: Multi-loop calculations of the effective action for the matrix model are important for carrying out tests of the conjectured relationship of the matrix model to the low energy description of M-theory. In particular, comparison with N-graviton scattering amplitudes in eleven-dimensional supergravity requires the calculation of the effective action for the matrix model with gauge group SU(N). A framework for carrying out such calculations at two loops is established in this paper. The two-loop effective action is explicitly computed for a background corresponding to the scattering of a single D0-brane from a stack of N-1 D0-branes, and the results are shown to agree with known results in the case N=2.
