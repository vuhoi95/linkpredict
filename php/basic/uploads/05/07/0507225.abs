Title: Curvatures and potential of M-theory in D=4 with fluxes and twist
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. Trigiante
Abstract: We give the curvatures of the free differential algebra (FDA) of M--theory compactified to D=4 on a twisted seven--torus with the 4--form flux switched on. Two formulations are given, depending on whether the 1--form field strengths of the scalar fields (originating from the 3--form gauge field $\hat{A}^{(3)}$) are included or not in the FDA. We also give the bosonic equations of motion and discuss at length the scalar potential which emerges in this type of compactifications. For flat groups we show the equivalence of this potential with a dual formulation of the theory which has the full $\rE_{7(7)}$ symmetry.
