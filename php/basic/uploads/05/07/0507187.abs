Title: A-Model Correlators from the Coulomb Branch
Authors: Ilarion V. Melnikov and M. Ronen Plesser
Abstract: We compute the contribution of discrete Coulomb vacua to A-Model correlators in toric Gauged Linear Sigma Models. For models corresponding to a compact variety, this determines the correlators at arbitrary genus. For non-compact examples, our results imply the surprising conclusion that the quantum cohomology relations break down for a subset of the correlators.
