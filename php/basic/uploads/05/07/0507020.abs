Title: Gravitational dynamics in s+1+1 dimensions
Authors: László Á. Gergely and Zoltán Kovács
Abstract: We present the concomitant decomposition of an (s+2)-dimensional spacetime both with respect to a timelike and a spacelike direction. The formalism we develop is suited for the study of the initial value problem and for canonical gravitational dynamics in brane-world scenarios. The bulk metric is replaced by two sets of variables. The first set consist of one tensorial (the induced metric $g_{ij}$), one vectorial ($M^{i}$) and one scalar ($M$) dynamical quantity, all defined on the s-space. Their time evolutions are related to the second fundamental form (the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$), the normal fundamental form ($\mathcal{K}^{i}$) and normal fundamental scalar ($\mathcal{K}$), respectively. The non-dynamical set of variables is given by the lapse function and the shift vector, which however has one component less. The missing component is due to the externally imposed constraint, which states that physical trajectories are confined to the (s+1)-dimensional brane. The pair of dynamical variables ($g_{ij}$, $K_{ij}$), well-known from the ADM-decomposition is supplemented by the pairs ($M^{i}$, $\mathcal{K}^{i}$) and ($M$, $\mathcal{K}$) due to the bulk curvature. We give all projections of the junction condition across the brane and prove that for a perfect fluid brane neither of the dynamical variables has jump across the brane. Finally we complete the set of equations needed for gravitational dynamics by deriving the evolution equations of $K_{ij}$, $\mathcal{K}^{i}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ on a brane with arbitrary matter.
