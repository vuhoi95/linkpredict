Abstract: We construct an N=1 supersymmetric three-family flipped SU(5) model from type IIA orientifolds on $T^6/(\Z_2\times \Z_2)$ with D6-branes intersecting at general angles. The model is constrained by the requirement that Ramond-Ramond tadpoles cancel, the supersymmetry conditions, and that the gauge boson coupled to the $U(1)_X$ factor does not get a string-scale mass via a generalised Green-Schwarz mechanism. The model is further constrained by requiring cancellation of K-theory charges. The spectrum contains a complete grand unified and electroweak Higgs sector, however the latter in a non-minimal number of copies. In addition, it contains extra matter both in bi-fundamental and vector-like representations as well as two copies of matter in the symmetric representation of SU(5).
