Title: A Dynamical 2-dimensional Fuzzy Space
Authors: M. Buric and J. Madore
Abstract: The noncommutative extension of a dynamical 2-dimensional space-time is given and some of its properties discussed. Wick rotation to euclidean signature yields a surface which has as commutative limit the doughnut but in a singular limit in which the radius of the hole tends to zero.
