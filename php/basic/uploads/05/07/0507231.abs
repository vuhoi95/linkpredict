Title: Confining interquark potentials from nonabelian gauge theories coupled  to dilaton
Authors: Mohamed Chabab and Latifa Sanhaji
Abstract: Following a recently proposed confinement generating mechanism, we provide a new string inspired model with a massive dilaton and a new dilaton coupling function [5]. By solving analytically the equations of motion, a new class of confining interquark potentials is derived which includes several popular potential forms given in the literature.
