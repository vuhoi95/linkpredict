Title: Neutrinos in Warped Extra Dimensions
Authors: G. Moreau and J. I. Silva-Marcos
Abstract: Amongst the diverse propositions for extra dimensional scenarios, the model of Randall and Sundrum (RS), which offers a solution for the long standing puzzle of the gauge hierarchy problem, has attracted considerable attention from both the theoretical and experimental points of view. In the context of the RS model with gauge bosons and fermions living in the bulk, a novel type of mechanism has arisen for interpreting the strong mass hierarchy of the Standard Model fermions. This purely geometrical mechanism is based on a type and flavor dependent localization of fermions along a warped extra dimension. Here, we find concrete realizations of this mechanism, reproducing all the present experimental data on masses and mixings of the entire leptonic sector. We consider the case of Dirac neutrino masses (due to an additional right handed neutrino) where the various constraints on RS parameter space are taken into account. The scenarios, elaborated in this paper, generate the entire lepton mass hierarchy and mixing, essentially, via the higher-dimensional mechanism, as the Yukawa coupling dependence is chosen to be minimal. In addition, from the above mechanism, we predict the typical lepton mixing angle 10^-5 < sin(theta_13) < 10^-1, a neutrino mass spectrum with normal hierarchy and the smallest neutrino mass to lie approximately in the range: 10^-11 eV < m_nu_1 < 10^-2 eV. A large part of the sin(theta_13) interval should be testable in future neutrino experiments.
