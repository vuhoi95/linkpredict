Title: Inflation Dynamics and Reheating
Authors: Bruce A. Bassett and Shinji Tsujikawa and David Wands
Abstract: We review the theory of inflation with single and multiple fields paying particular attention to the dynamics of adiabatic and entropy/isocurvature perturbations which provide the primary means of testing inflationary models. We review the theory and phenomenology of reheating and preheating after inflation providing a unified discussion of both the gravitational and nongravitational features of multi-field inflation. In addition we cover inflation in theories with extra dimensions and models such as the curvaton scenario and modulated reheating which provide alternative ways of generating large-scale density perturbations. Finally we discuss the interesting observational implications that can result from adiabatic-isocurvature correlations and non-Gaussianity.
