Abstract: A numerical program is presented which facilitates a computation pertaining to the full set of one-gluon loop diagrams (including ghost loop contributions), with M attached external gluon lines in all possible ways. The feasibility of such a task rests on a suitably defined master formula, which is expressed in terms of a set of Grassmann and a set of Feynman parameters. The program carries out the Grassmann integration and performs the Lorentz trace on the involved functions, expressing the result as a compact sum of parametric integrals. The computation is based on tracing the structure of the final result, thus avoiding all intermediate unnecessary calculations and directly writing the output. Similar terms entering the final result are grouped together. The running time of the program demonstrates its effectiveness, especially for large M.
