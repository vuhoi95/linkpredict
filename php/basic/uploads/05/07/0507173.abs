Title: Moduli Stabilisation in Heterotic String Compactifications
Authors: Beatriz de Carlos and Sebastien Gurrieri and Andre Lukas and Andrei Micu
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the structure of supersymmetric vacua in compactifications of the heterotic string on certain manifolds with SU(3) structure. We first study the effective theories obtained from compactifications on half-flat manifolds and show that solutions which stabilise the moduli at acceptable values are hard to find. We then derive the effective theories associated with compactification on generalised half-flat manifolds. It is shown that these effective theories are consistent with four-dimensional N=1 supergravity and that the superpotential can be obtained by a Gukov-Vafa-Witten type formula. Within these generalised models, we find consistent supersymmetric (AdS) vacua at weak gauge coupling, provided we allow for general internal gauge bundles. In simple cases we perform a counting of such vacua and find that a fraction of about 1/1000 leads to a gauge coupling consistent with gauge unification.
