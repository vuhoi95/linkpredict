Title: Information locking in black holes
Authors: John Smolin and Jonathan Oppenheim
Abstract: The black hole information loss paradox has plagued physicists since Hawking's discovery that black holes evaporate thermally in contradiction to the unitarity expected by quantum mechanics. Here we show that one of the central presumptions of the debate is incorrect. Ensuring that information not escape during the semi-classical evaporation process does not require that all the information remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation. Using recent results in quantum information theory, we find that the amount of information that must remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation can be very small, even though the amount already radiated away is negligible. Quantum effects mean that information need not be additive: a small number of quanta can lock a large amount of information, making it inaccessible. When this small number of locking quanta are finally emitted, the full information (and unitarity) is restored. Only if the number of initial states is restricted will the locking mechanism leak out information early.
