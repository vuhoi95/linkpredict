Title: Distinguishing Off-Shell Supergravities With On-Shell Physics
Authors: Neil D. Lambert and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: We show that it is possible to distinguish between different off-shell completions of supergravity at the on-shell level. We focus on the comparison of the ``new minimal'' formulation of off-shell four-dimensional N=1 supergravity with the ``old minimal'' formulation. We show that there are 3-manifolds which admit supersymmetric compactifications in the new-minimal formulation but which do not admit supersymmetric compactifications in other formulations. Moreover, on manifolds with boundary the new-minimal formulation admits ``singleton modes'' which are absent in other formulations.
