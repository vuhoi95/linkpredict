Title: Contributions from Dilatonic Strings to the Flat Behaviour of the  Rotational Curves in Galaxies
Authors: M. Leineker Costa and A. L. Naves de Oliveira and M. E. X. Guimaraes
Abstract: We analyse the flat behaviour of the rotational curves in some galaxies in the framework of a dilatonic, current-carrying string. We determine the expression of the tangential velocity of test objects following a stable circular equatorial orbit in this spacetime.
