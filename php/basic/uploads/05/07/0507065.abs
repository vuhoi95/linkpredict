Title: Bound states of scalar particles in the presence of a short range  potential
Authors: Luis A. Gonzalez-Diaz and Victor M. Villalba
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of the energy spectrum of the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a truncated hyperbolic tangent potential. From our analysis we obtain that, for some values of the potential there is embedding of the bound states into the negative energy continuum, showing that, in opposition to the general belief, relativistic scalar particles in one-dimensional short range potentials can exhibit resonant behavior and not only the Schiff-Snyder effect.
