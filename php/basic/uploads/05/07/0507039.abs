Title: The Quark Form Factor at Higher Orders
Authors: S. Moch and J. A. M. Vermaseren and A. Vogt
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic on-shell form factor of quarks in massless perturbative QCD. We derive the complete pole part in dimensional regularization at three loops, and extend the resummation of the form factor to the next-to-next-to-leading contributions. These results are employed to evaluate the infrared finite absolute ratio of the time-like and space-like form factors up to the fourth order in the strong coupling constant. Besides for the pole structure of higher-loop QCD amplitudes, our new contributions to the form factor are also relevant for the high-energy limit of massive gauge theories like QED. The highest-transcendentality component of our results confirms a result recently obtained in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory.
