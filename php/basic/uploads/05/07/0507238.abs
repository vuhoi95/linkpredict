Authors: Gerardo Cristofano and Vincenzo Marotta and Adele Naddeo and Giuliano Niccoli
Abstract: We propose a CFT description for a closed one-dimensional fully frustrated ladder of quantum Josephson junctions with Mobius boundary conditions (see cond-mat/0503555; we show how such a system can develop topological order thanks to flux fractionalization. Such a property is crucial for its implementation as a "protected" solid state qubit.
