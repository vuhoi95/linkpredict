Title: Supersymmetric defects in the Maldacena-Nunez background
Authors: Felipe Canoura and Angel Paredes and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We find supersymmmetric configurations of a D5-brane probe in the Maldacena-Nunez background which are extended along one or two of the spatial directions of the gauge theory. These embeddings are worldvolume solitons which behave as codimension two or one defects in the gauge theory and preserve two of the four supersymmetries of the background.
