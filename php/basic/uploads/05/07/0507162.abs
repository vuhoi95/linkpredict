Title: Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory for curved spacetime backgrounds
Authors: E. Kant and F. R. Klinkhamer
Abstract: We consider a modified version of four-dimensional electrodynamics, which has a photonic Chern-Simons-like term with spacelike background vector in the action. Light propagation in curved spacetime backgrounds is discussed using the geometrical-optics approximation. The corresponding light path is modified, which allows for new effects. In a Schwarzschild background, for example, there now exist stable bounded orbits of light rays and the two polarization modes of light rays in unbounded orbits can have different gravitational redshifts. An Erratum with important corrections has been published, which appears as Appendix E in this arXiv version.
