Title: Kalb-Ramond field interactions in a braneworld scenario
Authors: Ayan Chatterjee and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: Electromagnetic and (linearized) gravitational interactions of the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field, derived from an underlying ten dimensional heterotic string in the zero slope limit, are studied in a five dimensional background Randall-Sundrum I spacetime with standard model fields confined to the visible brane having negative tension. The warp factor responsible for generating the gauge hierarchy in the Higgs sector is seen to appear inverted in the KR field couplings, when reduced to four dimensions. This leads to dramatically enhanced rotation, {\it far beyond observational bounds}, of the polarization plane of electromagnetic and gravitational waves, when scattered by a homogeneous KR background. Possible reasons for the conflict between theory and observation are discussed.
