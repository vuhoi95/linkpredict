Title: Supersymmetric solutions based on Y^{p,q} and L^{p,q,r}
Authors: Konstadinos Sfetsos and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We explicitly realize supersymmetric cones based on the five-dimensional Y^{p,q} and L^{p,q,r} Einstein--Sasaki spaces. We use them to construct supersymmetric type-IIB supergravity solutions representing a stack of D3- and D5-branes as warped products of the six-dimensional cones and R^{1,3}.
