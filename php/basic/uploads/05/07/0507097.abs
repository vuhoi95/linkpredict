Abstract: We present a toy model that exhibits clash-of-symmetries style Higgs field kink configurations in a Randall-Sundrum-like spacetime. The model has two complex scalar fields Phi_{1,2}, with a sextic potential obeying global U(1)xU(1) and discrete Phi_1 <--> Phi_2 interchange symmetries. The scalar fields are coupled to 4+1 dimensional gravity endowed with a bulk cosmological constant. We show that the coupled Einstein-Higgs field equations have an interesting analytic solution provided the sextic potential adopts a particular form. The 4+1 metric is shown to be that of a smoothed-out Randall-Sundrum type of spacetime. The thin-brane Randall-Sundrum limit, whereby the Higgs field kinks become step functions, is carefully defined in terms of the fundamental parameters in the action. The ``clash of symmetries'' feature, defined in previous papers, is manifested here through the fact that both of the U(1) symmetries are spontaneously broken at all non-asymptotic points in the extra dimension $w$. One of the U(1)'s is asymptotically restored as w --> -infinity, with the other U(1) restored as w --> +infinity. The spontaneously broken discrete symmetry ensures topological stability. In the gauged version of this model we find new flat-space solutions, but in the warped metric case we have been unable to find any solutions with nonzero gauge fields.
