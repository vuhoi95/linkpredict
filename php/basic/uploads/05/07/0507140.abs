Title: Trapping Black Hole Remnants
Authors: Sabine Hossenfelder and Benjamin Koch and Marcus Bleicher
Abstract: Large extra dimensions lower the Planck scale to values soon accessible. The production of TeV mass black holes at the {\sc LHC} is one of the most exciting predictions. However, the final phases of the black hole's evaporation are still unknown and there are strong indications that a black hole remnant can be left. Since a certain fraction of such objects would be electrically charged, we argue that they can be trapped. In this paper, we examine the occurrence of such charged black hole remnants. These trapped remnants are of high interest, as they could be used to closely investigate the evaporation characteristics. Due to the absence of background from the collision region and the controlled initial state, the signal would be very clear. This would allow to extract information about the late stages of the evaporation process with high precision.
