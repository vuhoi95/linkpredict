Title: Haunted Kaluza Universe with Four-dimensional Lorentzian Flat, Kerr, and  Taub-NUT Slices
Authors: Rossen I. Ivanov and Emil M. Prodanov
Abstract: The duality between the original Kaluza's theory and Klein's subsequent modification is duality between slicing and threading decomposition of the five-dimensional spacetime. The field equations of the original Kaluza's theory lead to the interpretation of the four-dimensional Lorentzian Kerr and Taub--NUT solutions as resulting from static electric and magnetic charges and dipoles in the presence of ghost matter and constant dilaton, which models Newton's constant.
