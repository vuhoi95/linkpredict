Title: Scale symmetry in classical and quantum mechanics
Authors: E. Gozzi and D. Mauro
Abstract: In this paper we address again the issue of the scale anomaly in quantum mechanical models with inverse square potential. In particular we examine the interplay between the classical and quantum aspects of the system using in both cases an operatorial approach.
