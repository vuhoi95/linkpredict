Title: Einstein's impact on the physics of the twentieth century
Authors: Domenico Giulini and Norbert Straumann
Abstract: Starting with Einstein's famous papers of 1905, we review some of the ensuing developments and their impact on present-day physics. We attempt to cover topics that are of interest to historians and philosophers of science as well as to physicists. This paper will appear in ``2005: The Centenary of Einstein's Annus Mirabilis'', the special March 2006 issue of Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics.
