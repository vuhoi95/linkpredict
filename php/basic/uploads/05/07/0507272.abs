Title: One-scale Model for Domain Wall Network Evolution
Authors: P. P. Avelino and C. J. A. P. Martins and J. C. R. E. Oliveira
Abstract: We introduce a new phenomenological one-scale model for the evolution of domain wall networks, and test it against high-resolution field theory numerical simulations. We argue that previous numerical estimates of wall velocities are inaccurate, and suggest a more accurate method of measurement. We show that the model provides an adequate approximation to the evolution of key parameters characterizing the evolution of the network. We use the model to study possible scaling solutions for domain wall networks, and discuss some of their cosmological consequences.
