Title: On the gauge invariance and coordinate transformations of non-Abelian  D-brane actions
Authors: Joke Adam and Ignacio A. Illan and Bert Janssen
Abstract: We study the variations of the worldvolume fields in the non-Abelian action for multiple D-branes. Using T-duality we find that the embedding scalars transform non-trivially under NS-NS gauge transformations as \delta X ~ [X, X] and prove that the non-Abelian Chern-Simons action is invariant under these transformations. Given that T-duality relates the (part of the) NS-NS transformation with (part of the) general coordinate transformations, we can get some insight in the structure of non-Abelian coordinate transformations.
