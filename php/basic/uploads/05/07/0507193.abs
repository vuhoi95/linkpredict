Abstract: We introduce and study in some detail the properties of a novel class of Weyl-conformally invariant p-brane theories which describe intrinsically lightlike branes for any odd world-volume dimension. Their dynamics significantly differs from that of the ordinary (conformally non-invariant) Nambu-Goto p-branes. We present explicit solutions of the Weyl-invariant lightlike brane- (WILL-brane) equations of motion in various gravitational models of physical relevance exhibiting various new phenomena. In D=4 the WILL-membrane serves as a material and charged source for gravity and electromagnetism in the coupled Einstein-Maxwell-WILL-membrane system; it automatically positions itself on (``straddles'') the common event horizon of the corresponding matching black hole solutions, thus providing an explicit dynamical realization of the membrane paradigm in black hole physics. In product spaces of interest in Kaluza-Klein theories the WILL-brane wraps non-trivially around the compact (internal)dimensions and still describes massless mode dynamics in the non-compact (space-time) dimensions. Due to nontrivial variable size of the internal compact dimensions we find new types of physically interesting solutions describing massless brane modes trapped on bounded planar circular orbits with non-trivial angular momentum, and with linear dependence between energy and angular momentum.
