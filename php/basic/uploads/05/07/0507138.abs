Title: Black Hole Remnants at the LHC
Authors: Benjamin Koch and Marcus Bleicher and Sabine Hossenfelder
Abstract: Within the scenario of large extra dimensions, the Planck scale is lowered to values soon accessible. Among the predicted effects, the production of TeV mass black holes at the {\sc LHC} is one of the most exciting possibilities. Though the final phases of the black hole's evaporation are still unknown, the formation of a black hole remnant is a theoretically well motivated expectation. We analyze the observables emerging from a black hole evaporation with a remnant instead of a final decay. We show that the formation of a black hole remnant yields a signature which differs substantially from a final decay. We find the total transverse momentum of the black hole event to be significantly dominated by the presence of a remnant mass providing a strong experimental signature for black hole remnant formation.
