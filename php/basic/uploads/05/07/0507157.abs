Title: Noncommutative Locally Anti-de Sitter Black Holes
Authors: Pierre Bieliavsky and Stephane Detournay and Marianne Rooman and Philippe Spindel
Abstract: We give a review of our joint work on strict deformation of BHTZ 2+1 black holes \cite{BRS02,BDHRS03}. However some results presented here are not published elsewhere, and an effort is made for enlightening the instrinsical aspect of the constructions. This shows in particular that the three dimensional case treated here could be generalized to an anti-de Sitter space of arbitrary dimension provided one disposes of a universal deformation formula for the actions of a parabolic subgroup of its isometry group.
