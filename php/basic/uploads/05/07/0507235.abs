Title: Supersymmetric Theories of Neutrino Dark Energy
Authors: Rob Fardon and Ann E. Nelson and Neal Weiner
Abstract: We present a supersymmetric model of dark energy from Mass Varying Neutrinos which is stable against radiative corrections to masses and couplings, and free of dynamical instabilities. This is the only such model of dark energy involving fields with significant couplings to any standard model particle. We briefly discuss consequences for neutrino oscillations and solar neutrinos.
