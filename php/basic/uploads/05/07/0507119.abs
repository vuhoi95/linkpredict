Title: Noncommutative Coulombic Monopole
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Yeranyan
Abstract: We have constructed the appropriate Hamiltonian of the noncommutative coulombic monopole (i.e. the noncommutative hydrogen atom with a monopole). The energy levels of this system have been calculated, discussed and compared with the noncommutative hydrogen atom ones. The main emphasis is put on the ground state. In addition, the Stark effect for the noncommutative coulombic monopole has been studied.
