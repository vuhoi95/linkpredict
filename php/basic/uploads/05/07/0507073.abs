Title: More on a holographic dual of QCD
Authors: Tadakatsu Sakai and Shigeki Sugimoto
Abstract: We investigate the interactions among the pion, vector mesons and external gauge fields in the holographic dual of massless QCD proposed in a previous paper, hep-th/0412141, on the basis of probe D8-branes embedded in a D4-brane background in type IIA string theory. We obtain the coupling constants by performing both analytic and numerical calculations, and compare them with experimental data. It is found that the vector meson dominance in the pion form factor as well as in the Wess-Zumino-Witten term holds in an intriguing manner. We also study the \omega to \pi\gamma and \omega to 3\pi decay amplitudes. It is shown that the interactions relevant to these decay amplitudes have the same structure as that proposed by Fujiwara et al. Various relations among the masses and the coupling constants of an infinite tower of mesons are derived. These relations play crucial roles in the analysis. We find that most of the results are consistent with experiments.
