Title: All-Multiplicity Amplitudes with Massive Scalars
Authors: Darren Forde and David A. Kosower
Abstract: We compute two infinite series of tree-level amplitudes with a massive scalar pair and an arbitrary number of gluons. We provide results for amplitudes where all gluons have identical helicity, and amplitudes with one gluon of opposite helicity. These amplitudes are useful for unitarity-based one-loop calculations in nonsupersymmetric gauge theories generally, and QCD in particular.
