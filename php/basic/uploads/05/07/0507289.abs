Title: Magnetic charges in local field theory
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Henning Samtleben and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: Novel Lagrangians are discussed in which (non-abelian) electric and magnetic gauge fields appear on a par. To ensure that these Lagrangians describe the correct number of degrees of freedom, tensor gauge fields are included with corresponding gauge symmetries. Non-abelian gauge symmetries that involve both the electric and the magnetic gauge fields can then be realized at the level of a single gauge invariant Lagrangian, without the need of performing duality transformations prior to introducing the gauge couplings. The approach adopted, which was initially developed for gaugings of maximal supergravity, is particularly suited for the study of flux compactifications.
