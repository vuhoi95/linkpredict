Title: Condensing Momentum Modes in 2-d 0A String Theory with Flux
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Diana Vaman
Abstract: We use a combination of conformal perturbation theory techniques and matrix model results to study the effects of perturbing by momentum modes two dimensional type 0A strings with non-vanishing Ramond-Ramond (RR) flux. In the limit of large RR flux (equivalently, mu=0) we find an explicit analytic form of the genus zero partition function in terms of the RR flux $q$ and the momentum modes coupling constant alpha. The analyticity of the partition function enables us to go beyond the perturbative regime and, for alpha>> q, obtain the partition function in a background corresponding to the momentum modes condensation. For momenta such that 0<p<2 we find no obstruction to condensing the momentum modes in the phase diagram of the partition function.
