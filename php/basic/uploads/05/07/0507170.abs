Title: One-Loop NMHV Amplitudes involving Gluinos and Scalars in N=4 Gauge  Theory
Authors: Steven J. Bidder and Warren B. Perkins and Kasper Risager
Abstract: We use Supersymmetric Ward Identities and quadruple cuts to generate n-pt NMHV amplitudes involving gluinos and adjoint scalars from purely gluonic amplitudes. We present a set of factors that can be used to generate one-loop NMHV amplitudes involving gluinos or adjoint scalars in N=4 Super Yang-Mills from the corresponding purely gluonic amplitude.
