Title: Recursion Relations for Gauge Theory Amplitudes with Massive Vector  Bosons and Fermions
Authors: S. D. Badger and E. W. N. Glover and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We apply the on-shell tree-level recursion relations of Britto, Cachazo, Feng and Witten to a variety of processes involving internal and external massive particles with spin. We show how to construct multi-vector boson currents where one or more off-shell vector bosons couples to a quark pair and number of gluons. We give compact results for single vector boson currents with up to six partons and double vector boson currents with up to four partons for all helicity combinations. We also provide expressions for single vector boson currents with a quark pair and an arbitrary number of gluons for some specific helicity configurations. Finally, we show how to generalise the recursion relations to handle massive particles with spin on internal lines using $gg \to t\bar t$ as an example.
