Title: Nonperturbative approach to(Wiener) functional integral with $Ï†^4$  interaction
Authors: Juraj Bohacik and Peter Presnajder
Abstract: We propose the another, in principe nonperturbative, method of the evaluation of the Wiener functional integral for $\phi^4$ term in the action. All infinite summations in the results are proven to be convergent. We finf the "generalized" Gelfand -- Yaglom differential equation implying the functional integral in the continuum limit.
