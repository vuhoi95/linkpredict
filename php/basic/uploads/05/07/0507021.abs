Title: Quantization on Curves
Authors: Christian Fronsdal and Maxim Kontsevich
Abstract: Deformation quantization on varieties with singularities offers perspectives that are not found on manifolds. Essential deformations are classified by the Harrison component of Hochschild cohomology, that vanishes on smooth manifolds and reflects information about singularities. The Harrison 2-cochains are symmetric and are interpreted in terms of abelian $*$-products. This paper begins a study of abelian quantization on plane curves over $\Crm$, being algebraic varieties of the form R2/I where I is a polynomial in two variables; that is, abelian deformations of the coordinate algebra C[x,y]/(I). To understand the connection between the singularities of a variety and cohomology we determine the algebraic Hochschild (co-)homology and its Barr-Gerstenhaber-Schack decomposition. Homology is the same for all plane curves C[x,y]/(I), but the cohomology depends on the local algebra of the singularity of I at the origin.
