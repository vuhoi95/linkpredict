Title: An "Accidental" Symmetry Operator for the Dirac Equation in the Coulomb  Potential
Authors: Tamari T. Khachidze and Anzor A. Khelashvili
Abstract: On the basis of the generalization of the theorem about K-odd operators (K is the Dirac's operator), certain linear combination is constructed, which appears to commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian for Coulomb field. This operator coincides with the Johnson and Lippmann operator and is intimately connected to the familiar Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. Our approach guarantees not only derivation of Johnson-Lippmann operator, but simultaneously commutativity with the Dirac Hamiltonian follows.
