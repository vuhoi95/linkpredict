Title: The Accelerated expansion of the Universe as a crossover phenomenon
Authors: A. Bonanno and G. Esposito and C. Rubano and P. Scudellaro
Abstract: We show that the accelerated expansion of the Universe can be viewed as a crossover phenomenon where the Newton constant and the Cosmological constant are actually scaling operators, dynamically evolving in the attraction basin of a non-Gaussian infrared fixed point, whose existence has been recently discussed. By linearization of the renormalized flow it is possible to evaluate the critical exponents, and it turns out that the approach to the fixed point is ruled by a marginal and a relevant direction. A smooth transition between the standard Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) cosmology and the observed accelerated expansion is then obtained, so that $\Omega_M \approx \Omega_\Lambda$ at late times.
