Abstract: Nonperturbative effects in c<1 noncritical string theory are studied using the two-matrix model. Such effects are known to have the form fixed by the string equations but the numerical coefficients have not been known so far. Using the method proposed recently, we show that it is possible to determine the coefficients for (p,q) string theory. We find that they are indeed finite in the double scaling limit and universal in the sense that they do not depend on the detailed structure of the potential of the two-matrix model.
