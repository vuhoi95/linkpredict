Title: Interpolating between low and high energy QCD via a 5D Yang-Mills model
Authors: Johannes Hirn and Veronica Sanz
Abstract: We describe the Goldstone bosons of massless QCD together with an infinite number of spin-1 mesons. The field content of the model is SU(Nf)xSU(Nf) Yang-Mills in a compact extra-dimension. Electroweak interactions reside on one brane. Breaking of chiral symmetry occurs due to the boundary conditions on the other brane, away from our world, and is therefore spontaneous. Our implementation of the holographic recipe maintains chiral symmetry explicit throughout. For intermediate energies, we extract resonance couplings. These satisfy sum rules due to the 5D nature of the model. These sum rules imply, when taking the high energy limit, that perturbative QCD constraints are satisfied. We also illustrate how the 5D model implies a definite prescription for handling infinite sums over 4D resonances. Taking the low energy limit, we recover the chiral expansion and the corresponding non-local order parameters. All local order parameters are introduced separately.
