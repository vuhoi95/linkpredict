Title: Higher-derivative gauge field terms in the M-theory action
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Jan Plefka and Steffen Stern
Abstract: We use superparticle vertex operator correlators in the light-cone gauge to determine the (DF)^2 R^2 and (DF)^4 terms in the M-theory effective action. Our results, when compactified on a circle, reproduce terms in the type-IIA string effective action obtained through string amplitude calculations.
