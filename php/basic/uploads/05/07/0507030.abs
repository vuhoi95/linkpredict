Title: On $Îº$-Deformation and UV/IR Mixing
Authors: Harald Grosse and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: We examine the UV/IR mixing property on a $\kappa$-deformed Euclidean space for a real scalar $\phi^4$ theory. All contributions to the tadpole diagram are explicitly calculated. UV/IR mixing is present, though in a different dressing than in the case of the canonical deformation.
