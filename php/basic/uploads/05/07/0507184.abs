Title: Probing Cosmic Acceleration Beyond the Equation of State: Distinguishing  between Dark Energy and Modified Gravity Models
Authors: Mustapha Ishak and Amol Upadhye and David N. Spergel
Abstract: If general relativity is the correct theory of physics on large scales, then there is a differential equation that relates the Hubble expansion function, inferred from measurements of angular diameter distance and luminosity distance, to the growth rate of large scale structure. For a dark energy fluid without couplings or an unusual sound speed, deviations from this consistency relationship could be the signature of modified gravity on cosmological scales. We propose a procedure based on this consistency relation in order to distinguish between some dark energy models and modified gravity models. The procedure uses different combinations of cosmological observations and is able to find inconsistencies when present. As an example, we apply the procedure to a universe described by a recently proposed 5-dimensional modified gravity model. We show that this leads to an inconsistency within the dark energy parameter space detectable by future experiments.
