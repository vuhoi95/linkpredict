Title: Brane decay of a (4+n)-dimensional rotating black hole: spin-0 particles
Authors: G. Duffy and C. Harris and P. Kanti and E. Winstanley
Abstract: In this work, we study the `scalar channel' of the emission of Hawking radiation from a (4+n)-dimensional, rotating black hole on the brane. We numerically solve both the radial and angular part of the equation of motion for the scalar field, and determine the exact values of the absorption probability and of the spheroidal harmonics, respectively. With these, we calculate the particle, energy and angular momentum emission rates, as well as the angular variation in the flux and power spectra -- a distinctive feature of emission during the spin-down phase of the life of the produced black hole. Our analysis is free from any approximations, with our results being valid for arbitrarily large values of the energy of the emitted particle, angular momentum of the black hole and dimensionality of spacetime. We finally compute the total emissivities for the number of particles, energy and angular momentum and compare their relative behaviour for different values of the parameters of the theory.
