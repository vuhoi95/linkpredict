Title: Special holonomy sigma models with boundaries
Authors: P. S. Howe and U. Lindstrom and V. Stojevic
Abstract: A study of (1,1) supersymmetric two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with boundary on special holonomy target spaces is presented. In particular, the consistency of the boundary conditions under the various symmetries is studied. Models both with and without torsion are discussed.
