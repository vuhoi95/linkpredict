Title: Gluonic phase in neutral two-flavor dense QCD
Authors: E. V. Gorbar and Michio Hashimoto and V. A. Miransky
Abstract: In the Ginzburg-Landau approach, we describe a new phase in neutral two-flavor quark matter in which gluonic degrees of freedom play a crucial role. We call it a gluonic phase. In this phase gluonic dynamics cure a chromomagnetic instability in the 2SC solution and lead to spontaneous breakdown of the color gauge symmetry, the electromagnetic U(1), and the rotational SO(3). In other words, the gluonic phase describes an anisotropic medium in which the color and electric superconductivities coexist. Because most of the initial symmetries in this system are spontaneously broken, its dynamics is very rich.
