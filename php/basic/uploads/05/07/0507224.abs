Title: Conifold geometries, topological strings and multi-matrix models
Authors: G. Bonelli and L. Bonora and A. Ricco
Abstract: We study open B-model representing D-branes on 2-cycles of local Calabi--Yau geometries. To this end we work out a reduction technique linking D-branes partition functions and multi-matrix models in the case of conifold geometries so that the matrix potential is related to the complex moduli of the conifold. We study the geometric engineering of the multi-matrix models and focus on two-matrix models with bilinear couplings. We show how to solve this models in an exact way, without resorting to the customary saddle point/large N approximation. The method consists of solving the quantum equations of motion and using the flow equations of the underlying integrable hierarchy to derive explicit expressions for correlators. Finally we show how to incorporate in this formalism the description of several group of D-branes wrapped around different cycles.
