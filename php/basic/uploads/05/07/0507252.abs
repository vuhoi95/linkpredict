Title: Notes On The S-Matrix Of Bosonic And Topological Non-Critical Strings
Authors: Shin Nakamura and Vasilis Niarchos
Abstract: We show that the equivalence between the c=1 non-critical bosonic string and the N=2 topologically twisted coset SL(2)/U(1) at level one can be checked very naturally on the level of tree-level scattering amplitudes with the use of the Stoyanovsky-Ribault-Teschner map, which recasts $H_3^+$ correlation functions in terms of Liouville field theory amplitudes. This observation can be applied equally well to the topologically twisted SL(2)/U(1) coset at level n>1, which has been argued recently to be equivalent with a c<1 non-critical bosonic string whose matter part is defined by a time-like linear dilaton CFT.
