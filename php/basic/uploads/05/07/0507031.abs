Title: Oscillator quantization of the massive scalar particle dynamics on AdS  spacetime
Authors: Harald Dorn and George Jorjadze
Abstract: The set of trajectories for massive spinless particles on $AdS_{N+1}$ spacetime is described by the dynamical integrals related to the isometry group SO(2,N). The space of dynamical integrals is mapped one to one to the phase space of the $N$-dimensional oscillator. Quantizing the system canonically, the classical expressions for the symmetry generators are deformed in a consistent way to preserve the $so(2,N)$ commutation relations. This quantization thus yields new explicit realizations of the spin zero positive energy UIR's of SO(2,N) for generic $N$. The representations as usual can be characterized by their minimal energy $\alpha$ and are valid in the whole range of $\alpha$ allowed by unitarity.
