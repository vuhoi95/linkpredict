Abstract: It has been shown that certain W algebras can be linearized by the inclusion of a spin-1 current. This Provides a way of obtaining new realizations of the W algebras. In this paper, we investigate the new ghost field realizations of the W(2,s)(s=3,4) algebras, making use of the fact that these two algebras can be linearized. We then construct the nilpotent BRST charges of the spinor non-critical W(2,s) strings with these new realizations.
