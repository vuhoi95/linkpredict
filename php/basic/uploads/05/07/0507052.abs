Abstract: The effects of the Gribov copies on the gluon and ghost propagators are investigated in SU(2) Euclidean Yang-Mills theory quantized in the maximal Abelian gauge. The diagonal component of the gluon propagator displays the characteristic Gribov type behavior. The off-diagonal component of the gluon propagator is found to be of the Yukawa type, with a dynamical mass originating from the dimension two condensate <A^2>, which is also taken into account. Finally, the off-diagonal ghost propagator exhibits infrared enhancement.
