Title: Dualisation of the Symmetric Space Sigma Model with Couplings
Authors: Tekin Dereli and Nejat T. Yilmaz
Abstract: The first-order formulation of the G/K symmetric space sigma model of the scalar cosets of the supergravity theories is discussed when there is coupling of (m-1)-form matter fields. The Lie superalgebra which enables the dualized coset formulation is constructed for a general scalar coset G/K with matter coupling where G is a non-compact real form of a semi-simple Lie group and K is its maximal compact subgroup.
