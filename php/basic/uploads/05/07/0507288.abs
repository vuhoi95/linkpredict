Title: On supersymmetry algebra based on a spinor-vector generator
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We study the unitary representation of supersymmetry (SUSY) algebra based on a spinor-vector generator for both massless and massive cases. A systematic linearization of nonlinear realization for the SUSY algebra is also discussed in the superspace formalism with a spinor-vector Grassmann coordinate.
