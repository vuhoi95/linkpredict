Title: Gravitational collapse disturbs the dS/CFT correspondence?
Authors: Yukinori Iwashita and Hirotaka Yoshino and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We study the gravitational collapse in five-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime and discuss the existence of the conformal boundaries at future timelike infinity from the perspective of the dS/CFT correspondence. We investigate the motion of a spherical dust shell and the black hole area bounds. The latter includes the analysis of the trapping horizon and the initial data with spindle-shaped matter distribution. In all above analyses we find the evidences that guarantee the existence of the conformal boundaries at future timelike infinity which are essential to apply the dS/CFT correspondence.
