Title: New Spinor Field Realizations of the Non-Critical $W_{3}$ String
Authors: Li-Jie Zhang and Yu-Xiao Liu and Ji-Rong Ren
Abstract: We investigate the new spinor field realizations of the $W_{3}$ algebra, making use of the fact that the $W_{3}$ algebra can be linearized by the addition of a spin-1 current. We then use these new realizations to build the nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora--Tyutin (BRST) charges of the spinor non-critical $W_{3}$ string.
