Title: On the Anomalies and Schwinger Terms in Noncommutative Gauge Theories
Authors: F. Ardalan and H. Arfaei and N. Sadooghi
Abstract: Invariant (nonplanar) anomaly of noncommutative QED is reexamined. It is found that just as in ordinary gauge theory UV regularization is needed to discover anomalies, in noncommutative case, in addition, an IR regularization is also required to exhibit existence of invariant anomaly. Thus resolving the controversy in the value of invariant anomaly, an expression for the unintergrated anomaly is found. Schwinger terms of the current algebra of the theory are derived.
