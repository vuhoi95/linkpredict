Title: Bouncing Cosmology in Three Dimensions

Abstract: We consider a dynamical two-brane in a four dimensional black hole background with scalar hair. At high temperature this black hole goes through a phase transition by radiating away the scalar. The end phase is a topological adS-Schwarzschild black hole. We argue here that for a sufficiently low temperature, the brane motion in this geometry is non-singular. This results in a universe which passes over from a contracting phase to an expanding one without reaching a singularity.
