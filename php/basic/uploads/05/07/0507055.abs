Title: Infrared Divergences in dS/CFT
Authors: T. Banks and L. Mannelli and W. Fischler
Abstract: dS/CFT gives a perturbatively gauge invariant definition of particle masses in de Sitter (dS) space. We show, in a toy model in which the graviton is replaced with a minimally coupled massless scalar field, that loop corrections to these masses are infrared (IR) divergent. We argue that this implies anomalous dependence of masses on the cosmological constant, in a true theory of quantum gravity. This is in accord with the hypothesis of Cosmological SUSY Breaking (CSB).
