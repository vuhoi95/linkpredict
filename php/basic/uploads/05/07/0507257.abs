Title: Reheating the Universe after String Theory Inflation
Authors: Lev Kofman and Piljin Yi
Abstract: In String theory realizations of inflation, the end point of inflation is often brane-anti brane annihilation. We consider the processes of reheating of the Standard Model universe after brane inflation. We identify the channels of inflaton energy decay, cascading from tachyon annihilation through massive closed string loops, KK modes, and brane displacement moduli to the lighter standard model particles. Cosmological data constrains scenarios by putting stringent limits on the fraction of reheating energy deposited in gravitons and nonstandard sector massive relics. We estimate the energy deposited into various light degrees of freedom in the open and closed string sectors, the timing of reheating, and the reheating temperature. Production of gravitons is significantly suppressed in warped inflation. However, we predict a residual gravitational radiation background at the level $\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-8}$ of the present cosmological energy density. We also extend our analysis to multiple throat scenarios. A viable reheating would be possible in a single throat or in a certain subclass of multiple throat scenarios of the KKLMMT type inflation model, but overproduction of massive KK modes poses a serious problem. The problem is quite severe if some inner manifold comes with approximate isometries (angular KK modes) or if there exists a throat of modest length other than the standard model throat, possibly associated with some hidden sector (low-lying KK modes).
