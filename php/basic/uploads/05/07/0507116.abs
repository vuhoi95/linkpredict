Title: Constraints from the Detection of Cosmic Topology on the Generalized  Chaplygin Gas
Authors: M. Makler and B. Mota and M. J. Reboucas
Abstract: Despite our present-day inability to predict the topology of the universe one may expect that we should be able to detect it in the near future, given the increasing accuracy in the astro-cosmological observations. Motivated by this, we examine to what extent a possible detection of a non-trivial topology of a low curvature (Omega_0 ~ 1) universe, suggested by a diverse set of current observations, may be used to place constraints on the matter content of the universe, focusing our attention on the generalized Chaplgygin gas (GCG) model, which unifies dark matter and dark energy in a single matter component. We show that besides constraining the GCG free parameters, the detection of a nontrivial topology also allows to set bounds on the total density parameter Omega_0. We also study the combination of the bounds from the topology detection with the limits that arise from current data on 194 SNIa, and show that the determination of a given nontrivial topology sets complementary bounds on the GCG parameters (and on Omega_0) to those obtained from the SNIa data.
