Title: SUSY Phenomenology of KKLT Flux Compactifications
Authors: Adam Falkowski and Oleg Lebedev and Yann Mambrini
Abstract: We study SUSY phenomenology of the KKLT (Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi) scenario of string theory compactifications with fluxes. This setup leads to a specific pattern of soft masses and distinct phenomenological properties. In particular, it avoids the cosmological gravitino/moduli problems. Remarkably, the model allows for the correct abundance of SUSY dark matter consistently with all experimental constraints including the bound on the Higgs mass, b-->s gamma, etc. This occurs for both small and large tan beta, and requires the SUSY spectrum above 1 TeV.
