Title: On harmonic measure of critical curves
Authors: E. Bettelheim and I. Rushkin and I. A. Gruzberg and P. Wiegmann
Abstract: Fractal geometry of critical curves appearing in 2D critical systems is characterized by their harmonic measure. For systems described by conformal field theories with central charge $c\leqslant 1$, scaling exponents of harmonic measure have been computed by B. Duplantier [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84}, 1363 (2000)] by relating the problem to boundary two-dimensional gravity. We present a simple argument that allows us to connect harmonic measure of critical curves to operators obtained by fusion of primary fields, and compute characteristics of fractal geometry by means of regular methods of conformal field theory. The method is not limited to theories with $c\leqslant 1$.
