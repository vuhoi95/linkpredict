Title: Alternative Algebraic Structures from Bi-Hamiltonian Quantum Systems
Authors: G. Marmo and G. Scolarici and A. Simoni and F. Ventriglia
Abstract: We discuss the alternative algebraic structures on the manifold of quantum states arising from alternative Hermitian structures associated with quantum bi-Hamiltonian systems. We also consider the consequences at the level of the Heisenberg picture in terms of deformations of the associative product on the space of observables.
