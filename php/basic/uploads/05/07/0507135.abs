Title: Non Relativistic Dp Branes
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Filippo Passerini and Toni Ramirez and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We construct a kappa-symmetric and diffeomorphism-invariant non-relativistic Dp-brane action as a non-relativistic limit of a relativistic Dp-brane action in flat space. In a suitable gauge the world-volume theory is given by a supersymmetric free field theory in flat spacetime in p+1 dimensions of bosons, fermions and gauge fields.
