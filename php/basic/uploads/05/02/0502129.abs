Title: Landau Levels Analog to Electric Dipole
Authors: L. R. Ribeiro and Claudio Furtado and J. R. Nascimento
Abstract: In this letter we study the quantum dyamics of a neutral particle in the presence of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate in a specific field-dipole configuration that we have a quantization similar to the Landau Levels. We investigate this quantization motivated by the recent analysis of Landau-Aharonov-Casher(LAC) quantization of Ericsson and Sj\"oqvist[Phys Rev. A {\bf 65} 013607 (2001)]. The energy eigenfuction and eigenvalues are obtained.
