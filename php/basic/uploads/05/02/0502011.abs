Authors: Jiliang Jing and Qiyuan Pan
Abstract: The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Dirac field perturbations of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in an asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. We find that both the real and imaginary parts of the fundamental quasinormal frequencies for large black holes are the linear functions of the Hawking temperature, and the slope of the lines for the real parts decreases while that for the magnitude of the imaginary parts increases as the black hole charge increases. According to the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, the fact shows that different charge presents different time scale in three-dimensional CFT. Another interesting result is that the quasinormal frequencies become evenly spaced for high overtone number, and in the spacing expressions the real part decreases while the magnitude of the imaginary part increases as the charge increases. We also study the relation between quasinormal frequencies and angular quantum number and find that the real part increases while the magnitude of the imaginary part decreases as the angular quantum number increases.
