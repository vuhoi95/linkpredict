Title: Manybody treatment of white dwarf and neutron stars on the brane
Authors: Mofazzal Azam and M. Sami
Abstract: Brane-World models suggest modification of Newton's law of gravity on the 3-brane at submillimeter scales. The brane-world induced corrections are in higher powers of inverse distance and appear as additional terms with the Newtonian potential. The average inter-particle distance in white dwarf and neutron stars are $10^{-10} cms$ and $10^{-13} cms$ respectively, and therefore, the effect of submillimeter corrections needs to be investigated. We show, by carrying out simple manybody calculations, that the mass and mass-radius relationship of the white dwarf and neutron stars are not effected by submillimeter corrections. However, our analysis shows that the correction terms in the effective theory give rise to force akin to surface tension in normal liquids.
