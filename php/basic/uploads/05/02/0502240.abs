Authors: L. F. Alday and G. Arutyunov and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We explore integrability properties of superstring equations of motion in AdS_5 x S^5. We impose light-cone kappa-symmetry and reparametrization gauges and construct a Lax representation for the corresponding Hamiltonian dynamics on subspace of physical superstring degrees of freedom. We present some explicit results for the corresponding conserved charges by consistently reducing the dynamics to AdS_3 x S^3 and AdS_3 x S^1 subsectors containing both bosonic and fermionic fields.
