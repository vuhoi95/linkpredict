Title: Unruh Effect in the General Light-Front Frame
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel and Silvana Perez
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of Unruh effect in a massless scalar field theory quantized on the light-front in the general light-front frame. We determine the uniformly accelerating coordinates in such a frame and through a direct transformation show that the propagator of the theory has a thermal character in the uniformly accelerating coordinate system with a temperature given by Tolman's law. We also carry out a systematic analysis of this phenomenon from the Hilbert space point of view and show that the vacuum of this theory appears as a thermal vacuum to a Rindler observer with the same temperature as given by Tolman's law.
