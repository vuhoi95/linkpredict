Title: D-terms and F-terms from D7-brane fluxes
Authors: Hans Jockers and Jan Louis
Abstract: Using a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the fermionic part of the D-brane action we compute D- and F-terms of the N=1 effective action for generic Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications in the presence of a space-time filling D7-brane. We include non-trivial background fluxes for the D7-brane U(1) field strength on the internal four-cycle wrapped by the brane. First the four-dimensional fermionic spectrum arising from the D7-brane is derived and then the D- and F-terms are obtained by computing appropriate couplings of these fermionic fields. For specific examples we examine the resulting flux-induced scalar potentials and comment on their relevance in string cosmology.
