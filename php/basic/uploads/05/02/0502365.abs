Title: Computation of dynamical correlation functions of Heisenberg chains in a  field
Authors: J. -S. Caux and J. -M. Maillet
Abstract: We compute the momentum- and frequency-dependent longitudinal spin structure factor for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 $XXZ$ Heisenberg spin chain in a magnetic field, using exact determinant representations for form factors on the lattice. Multiparticle contributions are computed numerically throughout the Brillouin zone, yielding saturation of the sum rule to high precision.
