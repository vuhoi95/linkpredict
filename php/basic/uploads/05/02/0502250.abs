Title: Strings with a confining core in a Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: Biswanath Layek and Ananta P. Mishra and Ajit M. Srivastava
Abstract: We consider the intersection of N different interfaces interpolating between different $Z_N$ vacua of an SU(N) gauge theory using the Polyakov loop order parameter. Topological arguments show that at such a string-like junction, the order parameter should vanish, implying that the core of this string (i.e. the junction region of all the interfaces) is in the confining phase. Using the effective potential for the Polyakov loop proposed by Pisarski for QCD, we use numerical minimization technique and estimate the energy per unit length of the core of this string to be about 2.7 GeV/fm at a temperature about twice the critical temperature. For the parameters used, the interface tension is obtained to be about 7 GeV/fm$^2$. Lattice simulation of pure gauge theories should be able to investigate properties of these strings. For QCD with quarks, it has been discussed in the literature that this $Z_N$ symmetry may still be meaningful, with quark contributions leading to explicit breaking of this $Z_N$ symmetry. With this interpretation, such {\it QGP} strings may play important role in the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma phase and in the dynamics of quark-hadron transition.
