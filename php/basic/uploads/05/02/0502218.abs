Title: Twistor cosmology and quantum space-time
Authors: Dorje C. Brody and Lane. P. Hughston
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a model of a quantum space-time in which the global symmetries of space-time are unified in a coherent manner with the internal symmetries associated with the state space of quantum-mechanics. If we take into account the fact that these distinct families of symmetries should in some sense merge and become essentially indistinguishable in the unified regime, our framework may provide an approximate description of or elementary model for the structure of the universe at early times.
