Title: Nutty dyons
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We argue that the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory presents nontrivial solutions with a NUT charge. These solutions approach asymptotically the Taub-NUT spacetime and generalize the known dyon black hole configurations. The main properties of the solutions and the differences with respect to the asymptotically flat case are discussed. We find that a nonabelian magnetic monopole placed in the field of gravitational dyon necessarily acquires an electric field, while the magnetic charge may take arbitrary values.
