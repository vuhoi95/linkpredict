Title: Asymptotic Freedom and Infrared slavery in PT-symmetric Quantum  Electrodynamics
Authors: R. Acharya and P. Narayana Swamy
Abstract: We establish that there is no finite PT-symmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and as a consequence the Callan-Symanzik function $\beta(\alpha)<0$ for all $\alpha$ greater than zero: PT-symmetric QED exhibits both asymptotic freedom and infrared slavery.
