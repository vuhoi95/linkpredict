Title: Thin-shell wormholes in dilaton gravity
Authors: Ernesto F. Eiroa and Claudio Simeone
Abstract: In this work we construct charged thin-shell Lorentzian wormholes in dilaton gravity. The exotic matter required for the construction is localized in the shell and the energy conditions are satisfied outside the shell. The total amount of exotic matter is calculated and its dependence with the parameters of the model is analysed.
