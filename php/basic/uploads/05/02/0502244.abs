Title: Generation of Large-Scale Magnetic Fields from Dilaton Inflation in  Noncommutative Spacetime
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and J. Yokoyama
Abstract: Generation of large-scale magnetic fields is studied in dilaton electromagnetism in noncommutative inflationary cosmology, taking into account the effects of the spacetime uncertainty principle motivated by string theory. We show that it is possible to generate large-scale magnetic fields with sufficient strength to account for the observed fields in galaxies and clusters of galaxies through only adiabatic compression without dynamo amplification mechanism in models of power-law inflation based on spacetime noncommutativity without introducing a huge hierarchy between the dilaton's potential and its coupling to the electromagnetic fields.
