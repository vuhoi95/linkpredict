Title: A tight constraint on some varying speed of light theories
Authors: Ahmad Shariati and Nosratollah Jafari
Abstract: We argue that if the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, \cem, is different from the limiting velocity for massive particles, \cst, then, a proton moving with velocity $\cem < v < \cst$ would radiate Cherenkov radiation. Because we have seen protons with energy $\sim 10^{19}$ eV coming from a distance of order more than 1 Mpc, we can put a constraint on $\Delta := (\cst - \cem)/\cst$: $\Delta < 10^{-27}$.
