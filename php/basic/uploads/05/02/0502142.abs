Title: The Casimir Effect in the Presence of a Minimal Length
Authors: Ulrich Harbach and Sabine Hossenfelder
Abstract: Large extra dimensions lower the Planck scale to values soon accessible. Not only is the Planck scale the energy scale at which effects of modified gravity become important. The Planck length also acts as a minimal length in nature, providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff and a limit to the possible resolution of spacetime. In this paper we examine the influence of the minimal length on the Casimir energy between two plates.
