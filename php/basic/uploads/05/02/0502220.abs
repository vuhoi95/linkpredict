Title: "Massive" Higher Spin Multiplets and Holography
Authors: M. Bianchi and V. Didenko
Abstract: We review the extrapolation of the single-particle string spectrum on AdS(5)xS(5) to the Higher Spin enhancement point and the successful comparison of the resulting spectrum with the one of single-trace gauge-invariant operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also describe how to decompose the common spectrum in terms of massless and massive representations of the relevant Higher Spin symmetry group. Based on the lecture delivered by M. Bianchi at the First Solvay Conference on Higher-Spin Gauge Theories held in Bruxelles, on May 12-14, 2004.
