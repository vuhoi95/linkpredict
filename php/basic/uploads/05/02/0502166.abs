Title: Pulsar kicks via spin-1 color superconductivity
Authors: Andreas Schmitt and Igor A. Shovkovy and Qun Wang
Abstract: We propose a new neutrino propulsion mechanism for neutron stars which can lead to strong velocity kicks, needed to explain the observed bimodal velocity distribution of pulsars. The spatial asymmetry in the neutrino emission is naturally provided by a stellar core containing spin-1 color-superconducting quark matter in the A phase. The neutrino propulsion mechanism switches on when the stellar core temperature drops below the transition temperature of this phase.
