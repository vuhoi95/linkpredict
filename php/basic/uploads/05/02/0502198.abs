Title: Gauge (in)dependence and UV/IR mixing
Authors: M. Attems and D. N. Blaschke and S. Hohenegger and M. Schweda and S. Stricker
Abstract: The gauge independence in connection with the UV/IR-mixing is discussed with the help of the non-commutative U(1)-gauge field model proposed by A. A. Slavnov with two different gauges: the covariant gauge fixing defined via a gauge parameter \alpha and the non-standard axial-gauge depending on a fixed gauge direction n^\mu.
