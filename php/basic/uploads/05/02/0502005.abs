Title: Toward Realistic Intersecting D-Brane Models
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Mirjam Cvetic and Paul Langacker and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We provide a pedagogical introduction to a recently studied class of phenomenologically interesting string models, known as Intersecting D-Brane Models. The gauge fields of the Standard-Model are localized on D-branes wrapping certain compact cycles on an underlying geometry, whose intersections can give rise to chiral fermions. We address the basic issues and also provide an overview of the recent activity in this field. This article is intended to serve non-experts with explanations of the fundamental aspects, and also to provide some orientation for both experts and non-experts in this active field of string phenomenology.
