Title: Exotic Baryons in Two-Dimensional QCD
Authors: John Ellis and Yitzhak Frishman
Abstract: Two-dimensional QCD has often been used as a laboratory for studying the full four-dimensional theory, providing, for example, an explicit realization of baryons as solitons. We review aspects of conventional baryons in two-dimensional QCD, including the classical and quantum contributions to their masses. We then discuss the spectrum of exotic baryons in two-dimensional QCD, commenting on the solitonic radius inferred from the excitation spectrum as well as the two-dimensional version of the Goldberger-Treiman relation relating meson couplings to current matrix elements. Two-dimensional QCD provides strong overall support to the chiral-soliton picture for the structure of normal and exotic baryons in four dimensions.
