Title: Matching quantum strings to quantum spins: one-loop vs. finite-size  corrections
Authors: N. Beisert and A. A. Tseytlin and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We compare quantum corrections to semiclassical spinning strings in AdS(5)xS(5) to one-loop anomalous dimensions in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter are computed using the reduced (Landau-Lifshitz) sigma model and with the help of the Bethe ansatz. The results of all three approaches are in remarkable agreement with each other. As a byproduct we establish the relationship between linear instabilities in the Landau-Lifshitz model and analyticity properties of the Bethe ansatz.
