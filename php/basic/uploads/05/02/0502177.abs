Title: Inflating with the QCD Axion
Authors: Katherine Freese and James T. Liu and Douglas Spolyar
Abstract: We show that the QCD axion can drive inflation via a series of tunneling events. For axion models with a softly broken $Z_N$ symmetry, the axion potential has a series of $N$ local minima and may be modeled by a tilted cosine. Chain inflation results along this tilted cosine: the field tunnels from an initial minimum near the top of the potential through a series of ever lower minima to the bottom. This results in sufficient inflation and reheating. QCD axions, potentially detectable in current searches, may thus simultaneously solve problems in particle physics and provide inflation.
