Title: Expansion of the universe from a 5D vacuum within a nonperturbative  scalar field formalism
Authors: Alfredo Raya Montano and Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the quantum scalar field responsible for inflation in different epochs of the evolution of the universe by using a recently introduced nonperturbative formalism from a 5D apparent vacuum.
