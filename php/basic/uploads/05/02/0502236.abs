Title: Fermion Representation Of The Rolling Tachyon Boundary Conformal Field  Theory
Authors: Taejin Lee and Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: A free fermion representation of the rolling tachyon boundary conformal field theory is constructed. The representation is used to obtain an explicit, compact, exact expression for the boundary state. We use the boundary state to compute the disc and cylinder amplitudes for the half-S-brane.
