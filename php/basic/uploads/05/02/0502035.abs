Title: Accelerated Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson Metric in D-Dimensions
Authors: Metin Gurses and Ozgur Sarioglu
Abstract: A conformally flat accelerated charge metric is found in an arbitrary dimension $D$. It is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-null fluid with a cosmological constant in $D \ge 4$ dimensions. When the acceleration is zero our solution reduces to the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson metric. We show that the charge loses its energy, for all dimensions, due to the acceleration.
