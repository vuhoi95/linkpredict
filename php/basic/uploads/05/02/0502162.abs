Title: S-branes and (Anti-)Bubbles in (A)dS Space
Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Gregory C. Jones
Abstract: We describe the construction of new locally asymptotically (A)dS geometries with relevance for the AdS/CFT and dS/CFT correspondences. Our approach is to obtain new solutions by analytically continuing black hole solutions. A basic consideration of the method of continuation indicates that these solutions come in three classes: S-branes, bubbles and anti-bubbles. A generalization to spinning or twisted solutions can yield spacetimes with complicated horizon structures. Interestingly enough, several of these spacetimes are nonsingular.
