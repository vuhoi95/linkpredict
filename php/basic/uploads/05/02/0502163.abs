Title: An application of neutrix calculus to quantum field theory
Authors: Y. Jack Ng and H. van Dam
Abstract: Neutrices are additive groups of negligible functions that do not contain any constants except 0. Their calculus was developed by van der Corput and Hadamard in connection with asymptotic series and divergent integrals. We apply neutrix calculus to quantum field theory, obtaining finite renormalizations in the loop calculations. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we recover all the usual physically observable results. One possible advantage of the neutrix framework is that effective field theories can be accommodated. Quantum gravity theories appear to be more manageable.
