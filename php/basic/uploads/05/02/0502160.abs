Title: Tree Level Recursion Relations In General Relativity
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and Peter Svrcek
Abstract: Recently, tree-level recursion relations for scattering amplitudes of gluons in Yang-Mills theory have been derived. In this note we propose a generalization of the recursion relations to tree-level scattering amplitudes of gravitons. We use the relations to derive new simple formulae for all amplitudes up to six gravitons. In particular, we present an explicit formula for the six graviton non-MHV amplitude. We prove the relations for MHV and next-to-MHV n-graviton amplitudes and for all eight-graviton amplitudes.
