Title: Loop Equations in Abelian Gauge Theories
Authors: Cayetano Di Bartolo and Lorenzo Leal and Francisco Pe√±a
Abstract: The equations obeyed by the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop of Abelian gauge theories are considered from the point of view of the loop-space. An approximative scheme for studying these loop-equations for lattice Maxwell theory is presented. The approximation leads to a partial difference equation in the area and length variables of the loop, and certain physically motivated ansatz is seen to reproduce the mean field results from a geometrical perspective.
