Title: Quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman black holes: coupling of  electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations
Authors: Emanuele Berti and Kostas D. Kokkotas
Abstract: We compute numerically the quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman black holes in the scalar case, for which the perturbation equations are separable. Then we study different approximations to decouple electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of the Kerr-Newman metric, computing the corresponding quasinormal modes. Our results suggest that the Teukolsky-like equation derived by Dudley and Finley gives a good approximation to the dynamics of a rotating charged black hole for Q<M/2. Though insufficient to deal with Kerr-Newman based models of elementary particles, the Dudley-Finley equation should be adequate for astrophysical applications.
