Title: Drinfeld Twists and Symmetric Bethe Vectors of Supersymmetric Fermion  Models
Authors: Shao-You Zhao and Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We construct the Drinfeld twists (factorizing $F$-matrices) of the $gl(m|n)$-invariant fermion model. Completely symmetric representation of the pseudo-particle creation operators of the model are obtained in the basis provided by the $F$-matrix (the $F$-basis). We resolve the hierarchy of the nested Bethe vectors in the $F$-basis for the $gl(m|n)$ supersymmetric model.
