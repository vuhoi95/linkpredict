Title: The Darboux Transformation and Exactly Solvable Cosmological Models
Authors: A. V. Yurov and S. D. Vereshchagin
Abstract: We present a simple and effective method for constructing exactly solvable cosmological models containing inflation with exit. This method does not involve any parameter fitting. We discuss the problems arising with solutions that violate the weak energy condition.
