Title: N=1 reductions of N=2 supergravity in the presence of tensor multiplets
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. Trigiante and S. Vaula'
Abstract: We consider consistent truncations of N=2 supergravites in the presence of tensor multiplets (dual to hypermultiplets) as they occur in type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau orientifolds. We analyze in detail the scalar potentials encompassing these reductions when fluxes are turned on and study vacua of the N=1 phases.
