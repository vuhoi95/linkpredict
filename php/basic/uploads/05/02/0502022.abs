Title: Supersymmetry in gauge theories with extra dimensions
Authors: C. S. Lim and Tomoaki Nagasawa and Makoto Sakamoto and Hidenori Sonoda
Abstract: We show that a quantum-mechanical N=2 supersymmetry is hidden in 4d mass spectrum of any gauge invariant theories with extra dimensions. The N=2 supercharges are explicitly constructed in terms of differential forms. The analysis can be extended to extra dimensions with boundaries, and for a single extra dimension we clarify a possible set of boundary conditions consistent with 5d gauge invariance, although some of the boundary conditions break 4d gauge symmetries.
