Title: On Type II Strings in Two Dimensions
Authors: Harald Ita and Harald Nieder and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider type IIA/B strings in two-dimensions and their projection with respect to the nilpotent space-time supercharge. Based on the ground ring structure, we propose a duality between perturbed type II strings and the topological B-model on deformed Calabi-Yau singularities. Depending on the type II spectra, one has either the conifold or the suspended pinch point geometry. Using the corresponding quiver gauge theory, obtained by D-branes wrapping in the resolved suspended pinch point geometry, we propose the all orders perturbative partition function.
