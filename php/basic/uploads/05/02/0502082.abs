Title: Dark Energy: Vacuum Fluctuations, the Effective Phantom Phase, and  Holography

Abstract: We aim at the construction of dark energy models without exotic matter but with a phantom-like equation of state (an effective phantom phase). The first model we consider is decaying vacuum cosmology where the fluctuations of the vacuum are taken into account. In this case, the phantom cosmology (with an effective, observational $\omega$ being less than -1) emerges even for the case of a real dark energy with a physical equation of state parameter $\omega$ larger than -1. The second proposal is a generalized holographic model, which is produced by the presence of an infrared cutoff. It also leads to an effective phantom phase, which is not a transient one as in the first model. However, we show that quantum effects are able to prevent its evolution towards a Big Rip singularity.
