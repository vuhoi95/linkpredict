Title: Improved Stability for Pulsating Multi-Spin String Solitons
Authors: A. Khan and A. L. Larsen
Abstract: We derive and analyse, analytically and numerically, the equations for perturbations around the pulsating two-spin string soliton in AdS(5) x S(5).We show that the pulsation in S(5) indeed improves the stability properties of the two-spin string soliton in AdS(5), in the sense that the more pulsation we have, the higher spin we can allow and still have stability.
