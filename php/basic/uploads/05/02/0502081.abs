Title: Gravitational collapse in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter/de Sitter  backgrounds
Authors: T. Arun Madhav and Rituparno Goswami and Pankaj S. Joshi
Abstract: We study here the gravitational collapse of a matter cloud with a non-vanishing tangential pressure in the presence of a non-zero cosmological term. Conditions for bounce and singularity formation are derived for the model. It is also shown that when the tangential pressures vanish, the bounce and singularity conditions reduce to that of the dust case studied earlier. The collapsing interior is matched with an exterior which is asymptotically de Sitter or anti de Sitter, depending on the sign of cosmological constant. The junction conditions for matching the cloud to exterior are specified. The effect of the cosmological term on apparent horizons is studied in some detail, and the nature of central singularity is analyzed. We also discuss here the visibility of the singularity and implications for the cosmic censorship conjecture.
