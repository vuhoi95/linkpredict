Title: Constraining cosmic superstrings with dilaton emission
Authors: E. Babichev and M. Kachelriess
Abstract: Brane inflation predicts the production of cosmic superstrings with tension 10^{-12}<G\mu<10^{-7}. Superstring theory predicts also the existence of a dilaton with a mass that is at most of the order of the gravitino mass. We show that the emission of dilatons imposes severe constraints on the allowed evolution of a cosmic superstring network. In particular, the detection of gravitational wave burst from cosmic superstrings by LIGO is only possible if the typical length of string loops is much smaller than usually assumed.
