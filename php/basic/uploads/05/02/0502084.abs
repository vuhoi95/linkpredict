Title: N=1/2 quiver gauge theories from open strings with R-R fluxes
Authors: Marco Billo and Marialuisa Frau and Fabio Lonegro and Alberto Lerda
Abstract: We consider a four dimensional N=1 gauge theory with bifundamental matter and a superpotential, defined on stacks of fractional branes. By turning on a flux for the R-R graviphoton field strength and computing open string amplitudes with insertions of R-R closed string vertices, we introduce a non-anticommutative deformation and obtain the N=1/2 version of the theory. We also comment on the appearance of a new structure in the effective Lagrangian.
