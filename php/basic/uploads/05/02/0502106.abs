Title: Supersymmetry and the Lorentz Fine Tuning Problem
Authors: Pankaj Jain and John P. Ralston
Abstract: If physics at the Planck scale requires new conceptions of space-time, then generic renormalizable field theories predict observable violations of Lorentz invariance in the low energy sector. The little recognized ``Lorentz Fine Tuning Problem'' comes from logarithmic loop corrections which are not suppressed to the enormous extent commonly assumed. Fine-tuning of parameters at the Planck scale is one possible but unpalatable solution. Here we show that violation of Lorentz invariance is highly suppressed in a supersymmetric theory, the Wess-Zumino model. We conjecture that supersymmetry may be further motivated by yet another fine tuning problem of ordinary quantum field theories.
