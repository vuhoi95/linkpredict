Title: Fluctuating annihilation cross sections and the generation of density  perturbations
Authors: Christian W. Bauer and Michael L. Graesser and Michael P. Salem
Abstract: Fluctuations in the mass and decay rate of a heavy particle which for some period dominates the energy density of the universe are known to lead to adiabatic density perturbations. We show that generically the annihilation cross section of the same particle also receives fluctuations, which leads to entropy perturbations at freeze-out. If the particle comes to dominate the energy density of the universe and subsequently decays, this leads to an additional source of adiabatic density perturbations. On the other hand, non-adiabatic density perturbations result when the particle does not decay but contributes to the observed dark matter.
