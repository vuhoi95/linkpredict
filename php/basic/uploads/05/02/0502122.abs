Title: Operator product expansion coefficient functions in terms of composite  operators only. Nonsinglet case
Authors: A. V. Kisselev and V. A. Petrov
Abstract: A new method for calculating the coefficient functions of the operator product expansion is proposed which does not depend explicitly on elementary fields. Coefficient functions are defined entirely in terms of composite operators. The method is illustrated in the case of QCD nonsinglet operators.
