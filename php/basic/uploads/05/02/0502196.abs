Title: N=1 Super Yang-Mills Domain Walls via The Extended Veneziano  Yankielowicz Theory
Authors: P. Merlatti and F. Sannino and G. Vallone and F. Vian
Abstract: We investigate the vacuum structure of pure SU(N) N=1 super Yang-Mills. The theory is expected to possess N vacua with associated domain walls. We show that the newly extended version of the low energy effective Lagrangian for super Yang-Mills supports the BPS domain wall solutions associated with any two vacua aligned with the origin of the moduli space. For the two color theory the domain wall analysis is complete. We also find new non BPS domain wall solutions connecting any two vacua of the underling SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory not necessarely aligned. When two vacua are aligned with the origin of the moduli space these solutions are the BPS ones. We also discuss the generic BPS domain wall solutions connecting any two vacua within the extended Veneziano-Yankielowicz theory.
