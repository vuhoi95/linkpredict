Title: Deformed vortices in (4+1)-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We study vortex-type solutions in a (4+1)-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-SU(2) model. Assuming all fields to be independent on the extra coordinate, these solutions correspond in a four dimensional picture to axially symmetric multimonopoles, respectively monopole-antimonopole solutions. By boosting the five dimensional purely magnetic solutions we find new configurations which in four dimensions represents rotating regular nonabelian solutions with an additional electric charge.
