Title: New supersymmetric partners for the associated Lame potentials
Authors: David J Fernandez C and Asish Ganguly
Abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for some families of associated Lame potentials with arbitrary energy through a suitable ansatz, which may be appropriately extended for other such a families. The formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is used to generate new exactly solvable potentials.
