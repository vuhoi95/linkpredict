Title: Integrability and the Kerr-(A)dS black hole in five dimensions
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti
Abstract: In this note we prove that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a particle in the five dimensional Kerr-(A)dS black hole is separable, for arbitrary rotation parameters. As a result we find an irreducible Killing tensor. We also consider the Klein-Gordon equation in this background and show that this is also separable. Finally we comment on extensions and implications of these results.
