Abstract: We consider the generic nonanticommutative model of chiral-antichiral superfields on ${\cal N}={1\over 2}$ superspace. The model is formulated in terms of an arbitrary K\"ahlerian potential, chiral and antichiral superpotentials and can include the nonanticommutative supersymmetric sigma-model as a partial case. We study a component structure of the model and derive the component Lagrangian in an explicit form with all auxiliary fields contributions. We show that the infinite series in the classical action for generic nonanticommutative model of chiral-antichiral superfields in D=4 dimensions can be resumed in a compact expression which can be written as a deformation of standard Zumino's lagrangian and chiral superpotential. Problem of eliminating the auxiliary fields in the generic model is discussed and the first perturbative correction to the effective scalar potential is obtained.
