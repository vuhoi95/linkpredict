Title: Fidelity and Wilson loop for quarks in confinement region
Authors: V. I. Kuvshinov and P. V. Buividovich
Abstract: Connection between the stability of quantum motion in random fields and quark confinement in QCD is investigated. The analogy between the fidelity and the Wilson loop is conjectured, and the fidelity decay rates for different types of quark motion are expressed in terms of the parameters which are commonly used in phenomenological and lattice QCD.
