Title: Cosmology of Antisymmetric Tensor Field in D-brane Universe
Authors: Eung Jin Chun and Hang Bae Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We analyze homogeneous, anisotropic cosmology driven by a self-interacting ``massive'' antisymmetric tensor field $B_{\mu\nu}$ which is present in string theories with D-branes. Time-dependent magnetic $B$ field existing in the early universe can lead to the Bianchi type I universe. Evolutions of such a tensor field are solved exactly or numerically in the universe dominated by vacuum energy, radiation, and $B$ field itself. The matter-like behavior of the $B$ field (dubbed as ``$B$-matter'') ensures that the anisotropy disappears at late time and thus becomes unobservable in a reasonable cosmological scenario. Such a feature should be contrasted to the cosmology of the conventional massless antisymmetric tensor field.
