Title: BPS Electromagnetic Waves on Giant Gravitons
Authors: Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We find new 1/8-BPS giant graviton solutions in $AdS_5 \times S^5$, carrying three angular momenta along $S^5$, and investigate their properties. Especially, we show that nonzero worldvolume gauge fields are admitted preserving supersymmetry. These gauge field modes can be viewed as electromagnetic waves along the compact D3 brane, whose Poynting vector contributes to the BPS angular momenta. We also analyze the (nearly-)spherical giant gravitons with worldvolume gauge fields in detail. Expressing the $S^3$ in Hopf fibration ($S^1$ fibred over $S^2$), the wave propagates along the $S^1$ fiber.
