Title: Compact Formulas for Tree Amplitudes of Six Partons
Authors: Mingxing Luo and Congkao Wen
Abstract: Compact results are obtained for tree-level non-MHV amplitudes of six fermions and of four fermions and two gluons, by using extended BCF/BCFW rules. Combining with previous results, complete set of tree amplitudes of six partons are now available in compact forms.
