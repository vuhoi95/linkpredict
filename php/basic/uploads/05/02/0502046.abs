Title: Plane waves from double extended spacetimes
Authors: S. L. Cacciatori and G. Ortenzi and S. Penati
Abstract: We study exact string backgrounds (WZW models) generated by nonsemisimple algebras which are obtained as double extensions of generic D--dimensional semisimple algebras. We prove that a suitable change of coordinates always exists which reduces these backgrounds to be the product of the nontrivial background associated to the original algebra and two dimensional Minkowski. However, under suitable contraction, the algebra reduces to a Nappi--Witten algebra and the corresponding spacetime geometry, no more factorized, can be interpreted as the Penrose limit of the original background. For both configurations we construct D--brane solutions and prove that {\em all} the branes survive the Penrose limit. Therefore, the limit procedure can be used to extract informations about Nappi--Witten plane wave backgrounds in arbitrary dimensions.
