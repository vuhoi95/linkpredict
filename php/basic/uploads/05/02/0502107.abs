Title: SuperHiggs Mechanism in String Theory
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Ioannis Giannakis
Abstract: We exhibit the superHiggs effect in heterotic string theory by turning on a background NS-NS field and deforming the BRST operator consistent with superconformal invariance. The NS-NS field spontaneously breaks spacetime supersymmetry. We show how the gravitini and the physical dilatini gain mass by eating the would-be Goldstone fermions.
