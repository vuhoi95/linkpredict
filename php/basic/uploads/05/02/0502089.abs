Title: Dual Vector Multiplet Coupled to Dual N=1 Supergravity in 10D
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We couple in superspace a `dual' vector multiplet (C_{m_1... m_7}, \l^\alpha) to the dual version of N=1 supergravity (e_m{}^a, \psi_m{}^\alpha, M_{m_1... m_6}, \chi_\a,\Phi) in ten-dimensions. Our new 7-form field C has its 8-form field strength H dual to the 2-form field strength F of the conventional vector multiplet. We have found that the H-Bianchi identity must have the form N\wedge F, where N is the 7-form field strength in dual supergravity. We also see why only the dual version of supergravity couples to the dual vector multiplet consistently. The potential anomaly for the dual vector multiplet can be cancelled for the particular gauge group U(1)^{496} by the Green-Schwarz mechanism. As a by-product, we also give the globally supersymmetric Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld interactions for the dual vector multiplet for the first time.
