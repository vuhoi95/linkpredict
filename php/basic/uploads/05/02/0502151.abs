Title: Phenomenology of a Fluxed MSSM
Authors: B. C. Allanach and A. Brignole and L. E. Ibanez
Abstract: We analyze the phenomenology of a set of minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) soft terms inspired by flux-induced supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking in Type IIB string orientifolds. The scheme is extremely constrained with essentially only two free mass parameters: a parameter M, which sets the scale of soft terms, and the mu parameter. After imposing consistent radiative electro-weak symmetry breaking (EWSB) the model depends upon one mass parameter (say, M). In spite of being so constrained one finds consistency with EWSB conditions. We demonstrate that those conditions have two solutions for mu<0, and none for mu>0. The parameter tan beta results as a prediction and is approximately 3-5 for one solution, and 25-40 for the other, depending upon M and the top mass. We examine further constraints on the model coming from b->s gamma, the muon g-2, Higgs mass limits and WMAP constraints on dark matter. The MSSM spectrum is predicted in terms of the single free parameter M. The low tan beta branch is consistent with a relatively light spectrum although it is compatible with standard cosmology only if the lightest neutralino is unstable. The high tan beta branch is compatible with all phenomenological constraints, but has quite a heavy spectrum. We argue that the fine-tuning associated to this heavy spectrum would be substantially ameliorated if an additional relationship mu=-2M were present in the underlying theory.
