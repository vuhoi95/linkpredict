Title: Fidelity, quantum computations and Wilson loop
Authors: V. I. Kuvshinov and P. V. Buividovich
Abstract: General properties of quantum systems which interact with stochastic environment are studied with a strong emphasis on the role of physical symmetries. The similarity between the fidelity which is used to characterize the stability of such a systems and the Wilson loop in QCD is demonstrated, and the fidelity decay rates are derived. The consequences of existence of the symmetry group on the statistical properties of the system are analyzed for various physical systems - a simple quantum mechanical system, holonomic quantum computer and Yang-Mills fields.
