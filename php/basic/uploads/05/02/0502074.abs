Title: Relationship between Hawking Radiation and Gravitational Anomalies
Authors: Sean P. Robinson and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We show that in order to avoid a breakdown of general covariance at the quantum level the total flux in each outgoing partial wave of a quantum field in a black hole background must be equal to that of a (1+1)-dimensional blackbody at the Hawking temperature.
