Title: Nonrelativistic anyons in external electromagnetic field
Authors: Peter A. Horvathy and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: The first-order, infinite-component field equations we proposed before for non-relativistic anyons (identified with particles in the plane with noncommuting coordinates) are generalized to accommodate arbitrary background electromagnetic fields. Consistent coupling of the underlying classical system to arbitrary fields is introduced; at a critical value of the magnetic field, the particle follows a Hall-like law of motion. The corresponding quantized system reveals a hidden nonlocality if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous. In the quantum Landau problem spectral as well as state structure (finite vs. infinite) asymmetry is found. The bound and scattering states, separated by the critical magnetic field phase, behave as further, distinct phases.
