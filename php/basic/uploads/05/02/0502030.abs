Title: A note on dilaton gravity with non-smooth potentials
Authors: Christian G. Boehmer and Piotr Bronowski
Abstract: Recent interest in brane world models motivates the investigation of generic first order dilaton gravity actions, with potentials having some non-smoothness. We consider two different types of \delta-like contributions in the action and analyse their effects on the solutions. Furthermore a second source of non-smoothness arises due to the remaining ambiguities in the solutions in the separated smooth patches, after fixing all other constants by matching and asymptotic conditions. If moreover staticity is assumed, we explicitly construct exact solutions. With the methods described, for example models with point like sources or brane world models (where the second source of non-smoothness becomes crucial), can now be treated as non-smooth dilaton gravity theories.
