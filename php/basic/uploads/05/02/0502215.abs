Title: Quantum Relaxation of the Cosmological Constant
Authors: R. Jackiw and Carlos Nunez and S. -Y. Pi
Abstract: We describe a mechanism that drives the Cosmological Constant to zero value. This mechanism is based on the quantum triviality of $\lambda \phi^4$ field theory and works in $AdS$ space. Some subtleties of the model are discussed.
