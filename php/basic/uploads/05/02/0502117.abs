Title: Noncommutative Instantons in 4k Dimensions
Authors: Tatiana A. Ivanova and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We consider Ward's generalized self-duality equations for U(2r) Yang-Mills theory on R^{4k} and their Moyal deformation under self-dual noncommutativity. Employing an extended ADHM construction we find two kinds of explicit solutions, which generalize the 't Hooft and BPST instantons from R^4 to noncommutative R^{4k}. The BPST-type configurations appear to be new even in the commutative case.
