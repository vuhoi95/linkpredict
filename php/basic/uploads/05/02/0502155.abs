Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a heterotic standard model and discussed its basic properties. This vacuum has the spectrum of the MSSM with one additional pair of Higgs-Higgs conjugate fields and a small number of uncharged moduli. In this paper, the requisite vector bundles are formulated; specifically, stable, holomorphic bundles with structure group SU(N) on smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds with Z_3 x Z_3 fundamental group. A method for computing bundle cohomology is presented and used to evaluate the cohomology groups of the standard model bundles. It is shown how to determine the Z_3 x Z_3 action on these groups. Finally, using an explicit method of "doublet-triplet splitting", the low-energy particle spectrum is computed.
