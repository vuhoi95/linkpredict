Title: Constrained generalized supersymmetries and superparticles with  tensorial central charges. A classification
Authors: Zhanna Kuznetsova and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: We classify the admissible types of constraint (hermitian, holomorphic, with reality conditions on the bosonic sectors, etc.) for generalized supersymmetries in the presence of complex spinors. We further point out which constrained generalized supersymmetries admit a dual formulation. For both real and complex spinors generalized supersymmetries are constructed and classified as dimensional reductions of supersymmetries from {\em oxidized} space-times (i.e. the maximal space-times associated to $n$-component Clifford irreps). We apply these results to sistematically construct a class of models describing superparticles in presence of bosonic tensorial central charges, deriving the consistency conditions for the existence of the action, as well as the constrained equations of motion. Examples of these models (which, in their twistorial formulation, describe towers of higher-spin particles) were first introduced by Rudychev and Sezgin (for real spinors) and later by Bandos and Lukierski (for complex spinors).
