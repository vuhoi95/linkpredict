Abstract: In this work we examine noncommutativity of position coordinates in classical symplectic mechanics and its quantisation. In coordinates $\{q^i,p_k\}$ the canonical symplectic two-form is $\omega_0=dq^i\wedge dp_i$. It is well known in symplectic mechanics {\bf\cite{Souriau,Abraham,Guillemin}} that the interaction of a charged particle with a magnetic field can be described in a Hamiltonian formalism without a choice of a potential. This is done by means of a modified symplectic two-form $\omega=\omega_0-e\F$, where $e$ is the charge and the (time-independent) magnetic field $\F$ is closed: $\dif\F=0$. With this symplectic structure, the canonical momentum variables acquire non-vanishing Poisson brackets: $\{p_k,p_l\} = e F_{kl}(q)$. Similarly a closed two-form in $p$-space $\G$ may be introduced. Such a {\it dual magnetic field} $\G$ interacts with the particle's {\it dual charge} $r$. A new modified symplectic two-form $\omega=\omega_0-e\F+r\G$ is then defined. Now, both $p$- and $q$-variables will cease to Poisson commute and upon quantisation they become noncommuting operators. In the particular case of a linear phase space ${\bf R}^{2N}$, it makes sense to consider constant $\F$ and $\G$ fields. It is then possible to define, by a linear transformation, global Darboux coordinates: $\{\xi^i,\pi_k\}= {\delta^i}_k$. These can then be quantised in the usual way $[\hat{\xi}^i,\hat{\pi}_k]=i\hbar {\delta^i}_k$. The case of a quadratic potential is examined with some detail when $N$ equals 2 and 3.
