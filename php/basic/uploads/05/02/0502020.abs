Title: Constrained Perturbative Expansion of the DGP Model
Authors: Chad Middleton and George Siopsis
Abstract: We address the vDVZ discontinuity of the 5D DGP model which consists of a 3-brane residing in a flat, infinite-volume bulk. Following a suggestion by Gabadadze [hep-th/0403161], we implement a constrained perturbative expansion parametrized by brane gauge parameters. We explore the parameter space and show that the DGP solution exhibiting the vDVZ discontinuity corresponds to a set of measure zero.
