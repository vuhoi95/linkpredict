Title: Notes on Five-dimensional Kerr Black Holes
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: The geometry of five-dimensional Kerr black holes is discussed based on geodesics and Weyl curvatures. Kerr-Star space, Star-Kerr space and Kruskal space are naturally introduced by using special null geodesics. We show that the geodesics of AdS Kerr black hole are integrable, which generalizes the result of Frolov and Stojkovic. We also show that five-dimensional AdS Kerr black holes are isospectrum deformations of Ricci-flat Kerr black holes in the sense that the eigenvalues of the Weyl curvature are preserved.
