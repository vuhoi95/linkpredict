Title: The Complete Spectrum of the $W_N$ String
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and S. Schrans and K. W. Xu
Abstract: We obtain the complete physical spectrum of the $W_N$ string, for arbitrary $N$. The $W_N$ constraints freeze $N-2$ coordinates, while the remaining coordinates appear in the currents only {\it via} their energy-momentum tensor. The spectrum is then effectively described by a set of ordinary Virasoro-like string theories, but with a non-critical value for the central charge and a discrete set of non-standard values for the spin-2 intercepts. In particular, the physical spectrum of the $W_N$ string includes the usual massless states of the Virasoro string. By looking at the norms of low-lying states, we find strong indications that all the $W_N$ strings are unitary.
