Title: Poisson bracket algebra for chiral group elements in the WZNW model
Authors: G. Bimonte and P. Salomonson and A. Simoni and A. Stern
Abstract: We examine the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model on a circle and compute the Poisson bracket algebra for left and right moving chiral group elements. Our computations apply for arbitrary groups and boundary conditions, the latter being characterized by the monodromy matrix. Unlike in previous treatments, they do not require specifying a particular parametrization of the group valued fields in terms of angles spanning the group. We do however find it necessary to make a gauge choice, as the chiral group elements are not gauge invariant observables. (On the other hand, the quadratic form of the Poisson brackets may be defined independent of a gauge fixing.) Gauge invariant observables can be formed from the monodromy matrix and these observables are seen to commute in the quantum theory.
