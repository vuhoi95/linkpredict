Title: Are Textures Natural?
Authors: Marc Kamionkowski and John March-Russell
Abstract: We make the simple observation that, because of global symmetry violating higher-dimension operators expected to be induced by Planck-scale physics, textures are generically much too short-lived to be of use for large-scale structure formation.
