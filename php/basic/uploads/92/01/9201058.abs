Title: The Secret Chern-Simons Action for the Hot Gluon Plasma
Authors: R. Efraty and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We show that the generating functional for hard thermal loops with external gluons in QCD is essentially given by the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge theory. This action, determined essentially by gauge invariance arguments, also gives an efficient way of obtaining the hard thermal loop contributions without the more involved calculation of Feynman diagrams.
