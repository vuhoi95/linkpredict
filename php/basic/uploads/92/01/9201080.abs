Abstract: In the spirit of the quantum Hamiltonian reduction we establish a relation between the chiral $n$-point functions, as well as the equations governing them, of the $A_1^{(1)}$ WZNW conformal theory and the corresponding Virasoro minimal models. The WZNW correlators are described as solutions of the Knizhnik - Zamolodchikov equations with rational levels and isospins. The technical tool exploited are certain relations in twisted cohomology. The results extend to arbitrary level $k+2 \neq 0$ and isospin values of the type $J=j-j'(k+2)$, $ \ 2j, 2j' \in Z\!\!\!Z_+$.
