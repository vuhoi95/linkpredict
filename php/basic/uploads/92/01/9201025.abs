Title: Current Algebra of Classical Non-Linear Sigma Models
Authors: M. Forger and J. Laartz and U. Schaeper
Abstract: The current algebra of classical non-linear sigma models on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds is analyzed. It is found that introducing, in addition to the Noether current $j_\mu$ associated with the global symmetry of the theory, a composite scalar field $j$, the algebra closes under Poisson brackets.
