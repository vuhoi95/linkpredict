Title: Separation of variables for the classical and quantum Neumann model
Authors: O. Babelon and M. Talon
Abstract: The method of separation of variables is shown to apply to both the classical and quantum Neumann model. In the classical case this nicely yields the linearization of the flow on the Jacobian of the spectral curve. In the quantum case the Schr\"odinger equation separates into one--dimensional equations belonging to the class of generalized Lam\'e differential equations.
