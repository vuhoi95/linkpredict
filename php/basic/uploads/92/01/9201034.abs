Title: Spectrum of Two-Dimensional (Super)Gravity
Authors: Katsumi Itoh and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: We review the BRST analysis of the system of a (super)conformal matter coupled to 2D (super)gravity. The spectrum and its operator realization are reported. In particular, the operators associated with the states of nonzero ghost number are given. We also discuss the ground ring structure of the super-Liouville coupled to ${\hat c}=1$ matter. In appendices, hermiticities, states for $c<1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity and the proof for the spectrum are discussed.
