Title: Fusion and singular vectors in A1{(1)} highest weight cyclic modules
Authors: M. Bauer and N. Sochen
Abstract: We show how the interplay between the fusion formalism of conformal field theory and the Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation leads to explicit formulae for the singular vectors in the highest weight representations of A1{(1)}.
