Title: Gauge Transformations in String Field Theory and canonical  Transformation in String Theory
Authors: J. Maharana and S. mukherji
Abstract: We study how canonical transfomations in first quantized string theory can be understood as gauge transformations in string field theory. We establish this fact by working out some examples. As a by product, we could identify some of the fields appearing in string field theory with their counterparts in the $\sigma$-model.
