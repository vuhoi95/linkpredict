Title: The Asymptotics of the Correlations Functions in $(1+1)d$ Quantum Field  Theory From Finite Size Effects in Conformal Theories
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Zabrodin
Abstract: Using the finite-size effects the scaling dimensions and correlation functions of the main operators in continuous and lattice models of 1d spinless Bose-gas with pairwise interaction of rather general form are obtained. The long-wave properties of these systems can be described by the Gaussian model with central charge $c=1$. The disorder operators of the extended Gaussian model are found to correspond to some non-local operators in the {\it XXZ} Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Just the same approach is applicable to fermionic systems. Scaling dimensions of operators and correlation functions in the systems of interacting Fermi-particles are obtained. We present a universal treatment for $1d$ systems of different kinds which is independent of the exact integrability and gives universal expressions for critical exponents through the thermodynamic characteristics of the system.
