Title: Duality-Invariant Gaugino Condensation and One-Loop Corrected Kahler  Potentials in String Theory
Authors: Dieter Lüst and Carlos Muñoz
Abstract: The duality-invariant gaugino condensation with or without massive matter fields is re-analysed, taking into account the dependence of the string threshold corrections on the moduli fields and recent results concerning one-loop corrected K\"ahler potentials. The scalar potential of the theory for a generic superpotential is also calculated.
