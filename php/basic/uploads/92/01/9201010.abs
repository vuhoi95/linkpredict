Title: From Virasoro Constraints in Kontsevich's Model to $\cal W$-constraints  in 2-matrix Models
Authors: A. Marshakov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: The Ward identities in Kontsevich-like 1-matrix models are used to prove at the level of discrete matrix models the suggestion of Gava and Narain, which relates the degree of potential in asymmetric 2-matrix model to the form of $\cal W$-constraints imposed on its partition function.
