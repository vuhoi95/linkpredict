Title: A Generalized Construction of Mirror Manifolds
Authors: P. Berglund and T. HÃ¼bsch
Abstract: We generalize the known method for explicit construction of mirror pairs of $(2,2)$-superconformal field theories, using the formalism of Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. Geometrically, these theories are realized as Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. This generalization makes it possible to construct the mirror partners of many manifolds for which the mirror was not previously known.
