Title: An Algorithm to Generate Classical Solutions for String Effective Action
Authors: S. Kar and S. Khastgir and A. Kumar
Abstract: It is shown explicitly, that a number of solutions for the background field equations of the string effective action in space-time dimension D can be generated from any known lower dimensional solution, when background fields have only time dependence. An application of the result to the two dimensional charged black hole is presented. The case of background with more general coordinate dependence is also discussed.
