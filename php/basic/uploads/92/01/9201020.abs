Title: The Superparticle and the Lorentz Group
Authors: A. S. Galperin and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: We present a unified group-theoretical framework for superparticle theories. This explains the origin of the ``twistor-like'' variables that have been used in trading the superparticle's $\kappa$-symmetry for worldline supersymmetry. We show that these twistor-like variables naturally parametrise the coset space ${\cal G}/{\cal H}$, where $\cal G$ is the Lorentz group $SO^\uparrow(1,d-1)$ and $\cal H$ is its maximal subgroup. This space is a compact manifold, the sphere $S^{d-2}$. Our group-theoretical construction gives the proper covariantisation of a fixed light-cone frame and clarifies the relation between target-space and worldline supersymmetries.
