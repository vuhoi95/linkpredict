Title: A continuum string model for $D>1$
Authors: M. Martellini and M. Spreafico and K. Yoshida
Abstract: The non critical string (2D gravity coupled to the matter with central charge $D$) is quantized taking care of both diffeomorphism and Weyl symmetries. In incorporating the gauge fixing with respect to the Weyl symmetry, through the condition $R_g=const$, one modifies the classical result of Distler and Kawai. In particular one obtains the real string tension for an arbitrary value of central charge $D$.
