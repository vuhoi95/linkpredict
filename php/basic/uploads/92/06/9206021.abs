Title: Numerical Study of c>1 Matter Coupled to Quantum Gravity
Authors: Simon M. Catterall and John B. Kogut and Ray L. Renken
Abstract: We present the results of a numerical simulation aimed at understanding the nature of the `c = 1 barrier' in two dimensional quantum gravity. We study multiple Ising models living on dynamical $\phi^3$ graphs and analyse the behaviour of moments of the graph loop distribution. We notice a universality at work as the average properties of typical graphs from the ensemble are determined only by the central charge. We further argue that the qualitative nature of these results can be understood from considering the effect of fluctuations about a mean field solution in the Ising sector.
