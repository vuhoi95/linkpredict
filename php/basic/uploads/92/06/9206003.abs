Title: From Form Factors to Correlation Functions: The Ising Model
Authors: Olivier Babelon and Denis Bernard
Abstract: Using exact expressions for the Ising form factors, we give a new very simple proof that the spin-spin and disorder-disorder correlation functions are governed by the Painlev\'e III non linear differential equation. We also show that the generating function of the correlation functions of the descendents of the spin and disorder operators is a $N$-soliton, $N\to\infty$, $\tau$-function of the sinh-Gordon hierarchy. We discuss a relation of our approach to isomonodromy deformation problems, as well as further possible generalizations.
