Title: The 2-Dimensional Quantum Euclidean Algebra
Authors: Peter Schupp and Paul Watts and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: The algebra dual to Woronowicz's deformation of the 2-\-di\-men\-sion\-al Euclidean group is constructed. The same algebra is obtained from $SU_{q}(2)$ via contraction on both the group and algebra levels.
