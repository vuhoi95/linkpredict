Title: Spectra in Conformal Field Theories from the Rogers Dilogarithm
Authors: Atsuo Kuniba and Tomoki Nakanishi
Abstract: We propose a system of functional relations having a universal form connected to the $U_q(X^{(1)}_r)$ Bethe ansatz equation. Based on the analysis of it, we conjecture a new sum formula for the Rogers dilogarithm function in terms of the scaling dimensions of the $X^{(1)}_r$ parafermion conformal field theory.
