Title: Unitary Matrix Models and 2D Quantum Gravity (Virasoro constraints  modified)
Authors: S. Dalley and C. V. Johnson and T. R. Morris and A. Watterstam
Abstract: The KdV and modified KdV integrable hierarchies are shown to be different descriptions of the same 2D gravitational system -- open-closed string theory. Non-perturbative solutions of the multi-critical unitary matrix models map to non-singular solutions of the `renormalisation group' equation for the string susceptibility, $[\tilde{P},Q]=Q$. We also demonstrate that the large N solutions of unitary matrix integrals in external fields, studied by Gross and Newman, equal the non-singular pure closed-string solutions of $[\tilde{P},Q]=Q$.
