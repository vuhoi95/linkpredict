Title: S-matrices for Perturbed N=2 Superconformal Field Theory from quantum  groups
Authors: A. LeClair and D. Nemeschansky and N. P. Warner
Abstract: S-matrices for integrable perturbations of $N=2$ superconformal field theories are studied. The models we consider correspond to perturbations of the coset theory $G_k \times H_{g-h} /H_{k+g-h} $. The perturbed models are closely related to $\hat G$-affine Toda theories with a background charge tuned to $H$. Using the quantum group restriction of the affine Toda theories we derive the S-matrix.
