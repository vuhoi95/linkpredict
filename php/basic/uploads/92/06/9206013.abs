Title: Quantum and super-quantum group related to the Alexander-Conway  polynomial
Authors: Shahn Majid and M. J Rodriguez-Plaza
Abstract: We describe the quasitriangular structure (universal $R$-matrix) on the non-standard quantum group $U_q(H_1,H_2,X^\pm)$ associated to the Alexander-Conway matrix solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that this Hopf algebra is connected with the super-Hopf algebra $U_qgl(1|1)$ by a general process of superization.
