Title: Thermal Field Theory and Infinite Statistics
Authors: T. Altherr and T. Grandou
Abstract: We construct a quantum thermal field theory for scalar particles in the case of infinite statistics. The extension is provided by working out the Fock space realization of a "quantum algebra", and by identifying the hamiltonian as the energy operator. We examine the perturbative behavior of this theory and in particular the possible extension of the KLN theorem, and argue that it appears as a stable structure in a quantum field theory context.
