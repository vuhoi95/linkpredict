Title: Symmetries between Untwisted and Twisted Strings on Asymmetric Orbifolds
Authors: Y. Imamura and M. Sakamoto and T. Sasada and M. Tabuse
Abstract: We study symmetries between untwisted and twisted strings on asymmetric orbifolds. We present a list of asymmetric orbifold models to possess intertwining currents which convert untwisted string states to twisted ones, and vice versa. We also present a list of heterotic strings on asymmetric orbifolds with supersymmetry between untwisted and twisted string states. Some of properties inherent in asymmetric orbifolds, which are not shared by symmetric orbifolds, are pointed out.
