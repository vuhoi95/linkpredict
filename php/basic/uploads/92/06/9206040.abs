Title: Higher Dimensional Classical W-Algebras
Authors: Fernando Martinez-Moras and Eduardo Ramos
Abstract: Classical $W$-algebras in higher dimensions are constructed. This is achieved by generalizing the classical Gel'fand-Dickey brackets to the commutative limit of the ring of classical pseudodifferential operators in arbitrary dimension. These $W$-algebras are the Poisson structures associated with a higher dimensional version of the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya hierarchy (dispersionless KP-hierarchy). The two dimensional case is worked out explicitly and it is shown that the role of Diff$S(1)$ is taken by the algebra of generators of local diffeomorphisms in two dimensions.
