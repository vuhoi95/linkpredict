Title: A Closed, Expanding Universe in String Theory
Authors: Chiara R. Nappi and Edward Witten
Abstract: We present a conformal field theory -- obtained from a gauged WZW model -- that describes a closed, inhomogeneous expanding and recollapsing universe in $3+1$ dimensions. A possible violation of cosmic censorship is avoided because the universe recollapses just when a naked singularity was about to form. The model has been chosen to have $c=4$ (or $\widehat c=4$ in the supersymmetric case), just like four dimensional Minkowski space.
