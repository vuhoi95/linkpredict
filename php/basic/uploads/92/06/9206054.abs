Title: On the amplitudes for non-critical n=2 supuerstrings
Authors: E. Abdalla and M. C. B. Abdalla and D. Dalmazi
Abstract: We compute correlation functions in $N=2$ non critical superstrings on the sphere. Our calculations are restrained to the ($s=0$) bulk amplitudes. We show that the four point function factorizes as a consequence of the non-critical kinematics, but differently from the $N=0,1$ cases no extra discrete state appears in the $\hat c\to 1^-$ limit.
