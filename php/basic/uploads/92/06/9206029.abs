Title: Differential Geometry on Linear Quantum Groups
Authors: Peter Schupp and Paul Watts and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: An exterior derivative, inner derivation, and Lie derivative are introduced on the quantum group $GL_{q}(N)$. $SL_{q}(N)$ is then found by constructing matrices with determinant unity, and the induced calculus is found.
