Title: On Correlation Functions for Non-critical Strings with c<1 but d>1
Authors: H. Dorn and H. -J. Otto
Abstract: We construct a Goulian-Li-type continuation in the number of insertions of the cosmological constant operator which is no longer restricted to one dimensional target space. The method is applied to the calculation of the three-point and a special four-point correlation function. Various aspects of the emerging analytical structure are discussed.
