Title: Quantum Liouville Theory On The Riemann Sphere With $n>3$ Punctures
Authors: Jin-Min Shen and Zheng-Mao Sheng and Zhong-Hau Wang
Abstract: We have studied the quantum Liouville theory on the Riemann sphere with n>3 punctures. While considering the theory on the Riemann surfaces with n=4 punctures, the quantum theory near an arbitrary but fixed puncture can be obtained via canonical quantization and an extra symmetry is explored. While considering more than four distinguished punctures, we have found the exchange relations of the monodromy parameters from which we can get a reasonable quantum theory.
