Title: Analysis of Running Coupling Constant Unification in String Theory
Authors: Mary K. Gaillard and Rulin Xiu
Abstract: We use recently obtained 2-loop string coupling constants to analyze a class of string models based on orbifold compactification. Assuming weak coupling at the string scale and single-scale unification leads to restrictions on the spectrum of massive (between the string scale and the weak scale) matter supermultiplets and/or on the Kac-Moody algebra level.
