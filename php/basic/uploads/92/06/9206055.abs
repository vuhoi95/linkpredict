Title: Classical and Quantum Production of Cornucopions At Energies Below  $10^{18}$ GeV
Authors: T. Banks and M. O'Loughlin
Abstract: We argue that the paradoxes associated with infinitely degenerate states, which plague relic particle scenarios for the endpoint of black hole evaporation, may be absent when the relics are horned particles. Most of our arguments are based on simple observations about the classical geometry of extremal dilaton black holes, but at a crucial point we are forced to speculate about classical solutions to string theory in which the infinite coupling singularity of the extremal dilaton solution is shielded by a condensate of massless modes propagating in its infinite horn. We use the nonsingular $c=1$ solution of (1+1) dimensional string theory as a crude model for the properties of the condensate. We also present a brief discussion of more general relic scenarios based on large relics of low mass.
