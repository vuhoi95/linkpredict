Title: One-loop divergences in two-dimensional Maxwell-dilaton quantum gravity
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: Two-dimensional Maxwell-dilaton quantum gravity, which covers a large family of the actions for two-dimensional gravity (in particular, string-inspired models) is investigated. Charged black holes which appear in the theory are briefly discussed. The one-loop divergences in the linear covariant gauges are calculated. It is shown that for some choices of the dilaton potential and dilaton-Maxwell coupling, the theory is one-loop multiplicatively renormalizable (or even finite). A comparison with the divergences structure of four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity is given.
