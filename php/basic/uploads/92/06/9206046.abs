Title: Integrable Systems for Particles with Internal Degrees of Freedom
Authors: Joseph A. Minahan and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We show that a class of models for particles with internal degrees of freedom are integrable. These systems are basically generalizations of the models of Calogero and Sutherland. The proofs of integrability are based on a recently developed exchange operator formalism. We calculate the wave-functions for the Calogero-like models and find the ground-state wave-function for a Calogero-like model in a position dependent magnetic field. This last model might have some relevance for matrix models of open strings.
