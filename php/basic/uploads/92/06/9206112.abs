Title: G_2^1 Affine Toda Field Theory: A Numerical Test of Exact S-Matrix  results
Authors: G. Watts and R Weston
Abstract: We present the results of a Monte--Carlo simulation of the $G_2^{(1)}$ Affine Toda field theory action in two dimensions. We measured the ratio of the masses of the two fundamental particles as a function of the coupling constant. Our results strongly support the conjectured duality with the $D_4^{(3)}$ theory, and are consistent with the mass formula of Delius et al.
