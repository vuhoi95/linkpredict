Title: Uniqueness of the Axionic Kerr Black Hole
Authors: Rue-Ron Hsu and Green Huang and Wei-Fu Lin
Abstract: Under the axisymmetry and under the invarance of simultaneous inversion of time and azimuthal angle, we show that the axionic Kerr black hole is the ${\it unique}$ stationary solution of the minimal coupling theory of gravity and the Kalb-Ramond field, which has a regular event horizon, is asymptotically flat and has a finite axion field strength at event horizon.
