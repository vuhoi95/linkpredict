Title: Dilaton-Axion hair for slowly rotating Kerr black holes
Authors: S. Mignemi and N. R. Stewart
Abstract: Campbell et al. demonstrated the existence of axion ``hair'' for Kerr black holes due to the non-trivial Lorentz Chern-Simons term and calculated it explicitly for the case of slow rotation. Here we consider the dilaton coupling to the axion field strength, consistent with low energy string theory and calculate the dilaton ``hair'' arising from this specific axion source.
