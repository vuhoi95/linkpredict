Title: Self-Dual Supergravity Theories in 2+2 Dimensions
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and E. Sezgin
Abstract: Starting from the new minimal multiplet of supergravity in $2+2$ dimensions, we construct two types of self-dual supergravity theories. One of them involves a self-duality condition on the Riemann curvature and implies the equations of motion following from the Hilbert-Einstein type supergravity action. The other one involves a self-duality condition on a {\it torsionful} Riemann curvature with the torsion given by the field-strength of an antisymmetric tensor field, and implies the equations of motion that follow from an $R^2$-type action.
