Title: Induced QCD at Large N
Authors: V. A. Kazakov and A. A. Migdal
Abstract: We propose and study at large N a new lattice gauge model , in which the Yang-Mills interaction is induced by the heavy scalar field in adjoint representation. At any dimension of space and any $ N $ the gauge fields can be integrated out yielding an effective field theory for the gauge invariant scalar field, corresponding to eigenvalues of the initial matrix field. This field develops the vacuum average, the fluctuations of which describe the elementary excitations of our gauge theory. At $N= \infty $ we find two phases of the model, with asymptotic freedom corresponding to the strong coupling phase (if there are no phase transitions at some critical $N$). We could not solve the model in this phase, but in the weak coupling phase we have derived exact nonlinear integral equations for the vacuum average and for the scalar excitation spectrum. Presumably the strong coupling equations can be derived by the same method.
