Title: String Theory, Black Holes, and SL(2,R) Current Algebra
Authors: Shyamoli Chaudhuri and Joseph D. Lykken
Abstract: We analyse in detail the $SL(2,R)$ black hole by extending standard techniques of Kac-Moody current algebra to the non-compact case. We construct the elements of the ground ring and exhibit W-infinity type structure in the fusion algebra of the discrete states. As a consequence, we can identify some of the exactly marginal deformations of the black hole. We show that these deformations alter not only the spacetime metric but also turn on non-trivial backgrounds for the tachyon and all of the massive modes of the string.
