Title: Target Space Interpretation of New Moduli in 2D String Theory
Authors: Swapna Mahapatra and Sudipta Mukherji and Anirvan M. Sengupta
Abstract: We analyze the new states that have recently been discovered in 2D string theory by E. Witten and B. Zwiebach. Since the Liouville direction is uncompactified, we show that the deformations by the new ghost number two states generate equivalent classical solutions of the string fields. We argue that the new ghost number one states are responsible for generating transformations which relate such equivalent solutions. We also discuss the possible interpretation of higher ghost number states of those kinds.
