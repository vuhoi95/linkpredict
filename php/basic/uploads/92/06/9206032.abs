Title: su(3)k fusion coefficients
Authors: L. Begin and P. Mathieu and M. A. Walton
Abstract: A closed and explicit formula for all $\su{(3)}_k$ fusion coefficients is presented which, in the limit $k \rightarrow \infty$, turns into a simple and compact expression for the $su(3)$ tensor product coefficients. The derivation is based on a new diagrammatic method which gives directly both tensor product and fusion coefficients.
