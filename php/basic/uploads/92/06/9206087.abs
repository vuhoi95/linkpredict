Title: Charged Dilatonic Black Hole and Hawking Radiation in Two Dimensions
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Ichiro Oda
Abstract: We consider Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger's (CGHS) two dimensional dilatonic gravity with electromagnetic interactions. This model can be also solved classically. Among the solutions describing static black holes, there exist extremal solutions which have zero temperatures. In the extremal solutions, the space-time metric is not singular. We also obtain the solutions describing charged matter (chiral fermions) collapsing into black holes. Through the collapsing, not only future horizon but past horizon is also shifted. The quantum corrections including chiral anomaly are also discussed. In a way similar to CGHS model, the curvature singularity also appeared, except extremal case, when the matter collapsing. The screening effects due to the chiral anomaly have a tendency to cloak the singularity
