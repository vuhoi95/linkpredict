Title: Gravitation \& Cosmology in $(1+1)$-dimensional Dilaton Gravity
Authors: R. B. Mann and S. F. Ross
Abstract: The properties of a string-inspired two-dimensional theory of gravity are studied. The post-Newtonian and weak-field approximations, `stellar' structure and cosmological solutions of this theory are developed. Some qualitative similarities to general relativity are found, but there are important differences.
