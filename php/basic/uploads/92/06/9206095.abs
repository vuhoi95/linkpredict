Title: Induced QCD and Hidden Local ZN Symmetry
Authors: Ian I Kogan and Gordon W Semenoff and Nathan Weiss
Abstract: We show that a lattice model for induced lattice QCD which was recently proposed by Kazakov and Migdal has a $Z_N$ gauge symmetry which, in the strong coupling phase, results in a local confinement where only color singlets are allowed to propagate along links and all Wilson loops for non-singlets average to zero. We argue that, if this model is to give QCD in its continuum limit, it must have a phase transition. We give arguments to support presence of such a phase transition.
