Title: Charged Vortex Dynamics in Ginzburg-Landau Theory of the Fractional  Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Theodore J. Allen and Andrew J. Bordner
Abstract: We write a Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian for a charged order parameter interacting with a background electromagnetic field in 2+1 dimensions. Using the method of Lund we derive a collective coordinate action for vortex defects in the order parameter and demonstrate that the vortices are charged. We examine the classical dynamics of the vortices and then quantize their motion, demonstrating that their peculiar classical motion is a result of the fact that the quantum motion takes place in the lowest Landau level. The classical and quantum motion in two dimensional regions with boundaries is also investigated. The quantum theory is not invariant under magnetic translations. Magnetic translations add total time derivative terms to the collective action, but no extra constants of the motion result.
