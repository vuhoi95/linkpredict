Title: Higher-Rank Supersymmetric Models and Topological Field Theory
Authors: Toshiya Kawai and Taku Uchino and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we investigate the operator aspect of higher-rank supersymmetric model which is introduced as a Lie theoretic extension of the $N=2$ minimal model with the simplest case $su(2)$ corresponding to the $N=2$ minimal model. In particular we identify the analogs of chirality conditions and chiral ring. In the second part we construct a class of topological conformal field theories starting with this higher-rank supersymmetric model. We show the BRST-exactness of the twisted stress-energy tensor, find out physical observables and discuss how to make their correlation functions. It is emphasized that in the case of $su(2)$ the topological field theory constructed in this paper is distinct from the one obtained by twisting the $N=2$ minimal model through the usual procedure.
