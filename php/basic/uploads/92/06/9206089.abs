Title: Relating Weyl and diffeomorphism anomalies on super Riemann surfaces
Authors: Jean-Pierre Ader and Francois Gieres and Yves Noirot
Abstract: Starting from the Wess-Zumino action associated to the super Weyl anomaly, we determine the local counterterm which allows to pass from this anomaly to the chirally split superdiffeomorphism anomaly (as defined on a compact super Riemann surface without boundary). The counterterm involves the graded extension of the Verlinde functional and the results can be applied to the study of holomorphic factorization of partition functions in superconformal field theory.
