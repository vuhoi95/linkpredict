Title: A Comment on the Relationship Between Differential and Dimensional  Renormalization
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Nuria Rius
Abstract: We show that there is a very simple relationship between differential and dimensional renormalization of low-order Feynman graphs in renormalizable massless quantum field theories. The beauty of the differential approach is that it achieves the same finite results as dimensional renormalization without the need to modify the space time dimension.
