Title: Singular Contractions of W-algebras
Authors: C. M. Hull and L. Palacios
Abstract: Many $W$-algebras (e.g. the $W_N$ algebras) are consistent for all values of the central charge except for a discrete set of exceptional values. We show that such algebras can be contracted to new consistent degenerate algebras at these exceptional values of the central charge.
