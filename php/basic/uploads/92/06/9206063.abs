Title: G/G Models and W_N strings
Authors: O. Aharony and J. Sonnenschein and S. Yankielowicz
Abstract: We derive the BRST cohomology of the G/G topological model for the case of A^{(1)}_{N-1} . It is shown that at level k={p/q}-N the latter describes the (p,q) W_N minimal model coupled to $W_N$ gravity (plus some extra ``topological sectors").
