Title: Scattering States and Symmetries in the Matrix Model and Two Dimensional  String Theory
Authors: A. Jevicki and J. P. Rodrigues and A. J. van Tonder
Abstract: We study the correspondence between the linear matrix model and the interacting nonlinear string theory. Starting from the simple matrix harmonic oscillator states, we derive in a direct way scattering amplitudes of 2-dimensional strings, exhibiting the nonlinear equation generating arbitrary N-point tree amplitudes. An even closer connection between the matrix model and the conformal string theory is seen in studies of the symmetry algebra of the system.
