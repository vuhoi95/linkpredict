Title: New classical r-matrices from integrable non-linear sigma models
Authors: J. Laartz and M. Bordemann and M. Forger and U. Sch√§per
Abstract: Non linear sigma models on Riemannian symmetric spaces constitute the most general class of classical non-linear sigma models which are known to be integrable. Using the current algebra structure of these models their canonical structure is analysed and it is shown that their non ultralocal fundamental Poisson bracket relation is governed by a field dependent non antisymmetric r-matrix obeying a dynamical Yang Baxter equation.
