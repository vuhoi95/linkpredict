Title: Deformation of the Wakimoto construction
Authors: A. Abada and A. H. bougourzi and M. A. El Gradechi
Abstract: We present the extension of the Wakimoto construction to the $su(2)_k$ quantum current algebra and its associated $Z_k$ quantum parafermion algebra. This construction is achieved in terms of various deformations of three classical free boson fields. We also give the vertex operators corresponding to the quantum spin-$j$ representation.
