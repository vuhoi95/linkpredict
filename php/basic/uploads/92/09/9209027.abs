Title: Two dimensional baryons in the large N limit
Authors: P. F. Bedaque and I. Horvath and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We propose a bilocal field theory for mesons in two dimensions obtained as a kind of non local bosonization of two dimensional QCD. Its semi-classical expansion is equivalent to the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD. Using an ansatz we reduce the classical equation of motion of this theory in the baryon number one sector to a relativistic Hartree equation and solve it numerically. This (non topological) soliton is identified with the baryon.
