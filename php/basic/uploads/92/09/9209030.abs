Title: Representations of $N=1$ Extended Superconformal Algebras with Two  Generators
Authors: W. Eholzer and A. Honecker and R. Huebel
Abstract: In this paper we consider the representation theory of N=1 Super-W-algebras with two generators for conformal dimension of the additional superprimary field between two and six. In the superminimal case our results coincide with the expectation from the ADE-classification. For the parabolic algebras we find a finite number of highest weight representations and an effective central charge $\tilde c = 3/2$. Furthermore we show that most of the exceptional algebras lead to new rational models with $\tilde c > 3/2$. The remaining exceptional cases show a new `mixed' structure. Besides a continuous branch of representations discrete values of the highest weight exist, too.
