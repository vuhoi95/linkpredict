Title: Dilaton Black Holes Near the Horizon
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Amanda Peet
Abstract: Generic $U(1)^2$ 4-d black holes with unbroken $N=1$ supersymmetry are shown to tend to a Robinson-Bertotti type geometry with a linear dilaton and doubling of unbroken supersymmetries near the horizon. Purely magnetic dilatonic black holes, which have unbroken $N=2$ supersymmetry, behave near the horizon as a 2-d linear dilaton vacuum $\otimes \, S^2$. This geometry is invariant under 8 supersymmetries, i.e. half of the original $N=4$ supersymmetries are unbroken. The supersymmetric positivity bound, which requires the mass of the 4-d dilaton black holes to be greater than or equal to the central charge, corresponds to positivity of mass for a class of stringy 2-d black holes.
