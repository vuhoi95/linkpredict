Title: Exact String Solutions in 2+1-Dimensional De Sitter Spacetime
Authors: H. J. de Vega and A. V. Mikhailov and N. Sanchez
Abstract: Exact and explicit string solutions in de Sitter spacetime are found. (Here, the string equations reduce to a sinh-Gordon model). A new feature without flat spacetime analogy appears: starting with a single world-sheet, several (here two) strings emerge. One string is stable and the other (unstable) grows as the universe grows. Their invariant size and energy either grow as the expansion factor or tend to constant. Moreover, strings can expand (contract) for large (small) universe radius with a different rate than the universe.
