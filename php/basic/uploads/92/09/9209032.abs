Title: Pair Creation of Open Strings in an Electric Field
Authors: C. Bachas and M. Porrati
Abstract: We calculate exactly the rate of pair production of open bosonic and supersymmetric strings in a constant electric field. The rate agrees with Schwinger's classic result in the weak-field limit, but diverges when the electric field approaches some critical value of the order of the string tension. (Phyzzx file)
