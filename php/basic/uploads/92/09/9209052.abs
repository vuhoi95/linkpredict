Title: Boosting Away Singularities from Conformal String Backgrounds
Authors: M. Gasperini and J. Maharana and G. Veneziano
Abstract: Generalizing our previous work, we show how $O(d,d)$ transformations can be used to "boost away" in new dimensions the physical singularities that occur generically in cosmological and/or black-hole string backgrounds. As an example, we show how a recent model by Nappi and Witten can be made singularity-free via $O(3,3)$ boosts involving a fifth dimension.
