Title: Domain Walls in $N=1$ Supergravity
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Stephen Griffies
Abstract: We discuss a study of domain walls in $N=1, d=4$ supergravity. The walls saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound of wall energy per unit area thus proving stability of the classical solution. They interpolate between two vacua whose cosmological constant is non-positive and in general different. The matter configuration and induced geometry are static. We discuss the field theoretic realization of these walls and classify three canonical configurations with examples. The space-time induced by a wall interpolating between the Minkowski (topology $\Re^{4}$) and anti-de~Sitter (topology $S^{1}(time) \times \Re^{3}(space)$) vacua is discussed. (Comments in chapter 6 on AdS-Minkowski wall induced space-time have been slightly changed)
