Title: Quantum Mechanics with Explicit Time Dependence
Authors: John Rogers and Donald Spector
Abstract: We investigate quantum mechanical Hamiltonians with explicit time dependence. We find a class of models in which an analogue of the time independent \S equation exists. Among the models in this class is a new exactly soluble model, the harmonic oscillator with frequency inversely proportional to time.
