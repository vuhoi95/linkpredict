Title: Super Self-Duality as Analyticity in Harmonic Superspace
Authors: Ch. Devchand and V. Ogievetsky
Abstract: A twistor correspondence for the self-duality equations for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is developed. Their solutions are shown to be encoded in analytic harmonic superfields satisfying appropriate generalised Cauchy-Riemann conditions. An action principle yielding these conditions is presented.
