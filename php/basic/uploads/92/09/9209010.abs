Title: Factorization and Discrete States in C=1 Superliouville Theory
Authors: G. Aldazabal and M. Bonini and J. M. Maldacena
Abstract: We study the discrete state structure of $\hat c=1$ superconformal matter coupled to 2-D supergravity. Factorization properties of scattering amplitudes are used to identify these states and to construct the corresponding vertex operators. For both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors these states are shown to be organized in SU(2) multiplets. The algebra generated by the discrete states is computed in the limit of null cosmological constant.
