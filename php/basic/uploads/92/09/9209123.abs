Title: (SUPER) W Algebras from Non Abelian (SUPER) Toda Theories
Authors: L. Frappat and E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba
Abstract: A classification of (super) $W$ algebras arising from non Abelian Toda and super Toda theories is presented. This classification is based on the $Sl(2)$ or $OSp(1|2)$ sub(super)algebras of the simple Lie (super)algebra underlying the model. This allows to compute the conformal spin content of each $W$ (super)algebra. {\em Based on two lectures given by L. Frappat and E. Ragoucy at the\\ XIX International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics\\ Salamanca (Spain), June 29 - July 4, 1992}
