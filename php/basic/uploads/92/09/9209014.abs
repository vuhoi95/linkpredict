Title: The Microcanonical Functional Integral. I. The Gravitational Field
Authors: J. David Brown and James W. York
Abstract: The gravitational field in a spatially finite region is described as a microcanonical system. The density of states $\nu$ is expressed formally as a functional integral over Lorentzian metrics and is a functional of the geometrical boundary data that are fixed in the corresponding action. These boundary data are the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy and angular momentum of the system. When the boundary data are chosen such that the system is described semiclassically by {\it any} real stationary axisymmetric black hole, then in this same approximation $\ln\nu$ is shown to equal 1/4 the area of the black hole event horizon. The canonical and grand canonical partition functions are obtained by integral transforms of $\nu$ that lead to "imaginary time" functional integrals. A general form of the first law of thermodynamics for stationary black holes is derived. For the simpler case of nonrelativistic mechanics, the density of states is expressed as a real-time functional integral and then used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional integral for the canonical partition function.
