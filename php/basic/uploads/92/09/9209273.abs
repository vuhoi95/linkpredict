Title: Feynman Parametrization and the Degenerate Electron Gas
Authors: Paulo F. Bedaque and Ashok Das
Abstract: We give an alternate derivation of Weldon's formula for combining products of factors with non identical analytic behavior. While such a formula would appear to be useful in finite temperature calculations, we give an example of a zero temperature calculation, namely, the degenerate electron gas, to justify the result.
