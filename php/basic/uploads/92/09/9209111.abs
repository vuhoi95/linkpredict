Title: Discrete States in the $W_3$ String
Authors: C. N. Pope and E. Sezgin and K. S. Stelle and X. J. Wang
Abstract: We construct the low-lying discrete states of the two-scalar $W_3$ string. This includes states that correspond to the analogues of the ground ring generators of the ordinary two-dimensional string. These give rise to infinite towers of discrete states at higher levels.
