Title: On subdivision invariant actions for random surfaces
Authors: B. Durhuus and T. Jonsson
Abstract: We consider a subdivision invariant action for dynamically triangulated random surfaces that was recently proposed (R.V. Ambartzumian et. al., Phys. Lett. B 275 (1992) 99) and show that it is unphysical: The grand canonical partition function is infinite for all values of the coupling constants. We conjecture that adding the area action to the action of Ambartzumian et. al. leads to a well-behaved theory.
