Title: Quaternionic Superconformal Field Theory
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Christian Preitschopf
Abstract: We develop a superfield formalism for N=4 superconformal two-dimensional field theory. A list is presented of minimal free superfields, i.e. of multiplets containing four bosons and four fermions. We show that the super-Poincar\'e algebra of the six-dimensional superstring in the light-cone gauge is essentially equivalent to a local N=4 superconformal symmetry, and outline the construction of octonionic superconformal field theory.
