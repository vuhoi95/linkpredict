Authors: C. Burdik and L. Cerny and O. Navratil
Abstract: We give explicit expression of recurrency formulae of canonical realization for quantum enveloping algebras $U_{q}(sl(n+1,C))$. In these formulas the generators of the algebra $U_{q}(sl(n+1,C))$ are expressed by means of n-canonical q-boson pairs one auxiliary representation of the algebra $U_{q}(gl(n,C))$.
