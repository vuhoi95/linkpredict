Title: Twistor-Like Type II Superstring and Bosonic String
Authors: V. Chikalov and A. Pashnev
Abstract: The superfield formulation of type II Green-Schwarz superstring with n= (1,0) worldsheet supersymmetry is constructed. It is shown that the inclusion of the second spinor coordinate in the target superspase leads to the possibility of the reparametrization invariant description of the superstring in the absence of any field from the two dimensional supergravity multiplet. The twistor-like action of Chern-Simons type for bosonic string in D=3,4,6,10 is obtained from the component form of the superstring action.
