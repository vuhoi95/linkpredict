Title: On the Continuum Limit of the Conformal Matrix Models
Authors: A. Mironov and S. Pakuliak
Abstract: The double scaling limit of a new class of the multi-matrix models proposed in \cite{MMM91}, which possess the $W$-symmetry at the discrete level, is investigated in details. These models are demonstrated to fall into the same universality class as the standard multi-matrix models. In particular, the transformation of the W-algebra at the discrete level into the continuum one of the paper \cite{FKN91a} is proposed, the corresponding partition functions being compared. All calculations are demonstrated in full in the first non-trivial case of $W^{(3)}$-constraints.
