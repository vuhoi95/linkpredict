Title: Quasilocal Energy and Conserved Charges Derived from the Gravitational  Action
Authors: J. David Brown and James W. York
Abstract: The quasilocal energy of gravitational and matter fields in a spatially bounded region is obtained by employing a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the action functional. First, a surface stress-energy-momentum tensor is defined by the functional derivative of the action with respect to the three-metric on ${}^3B$, the history of the system's boundary. Energy density, momentum density, and spatial stress are defined by projecting the surface stress tensor normally and tangentially to a family of spacelike two-surfaces that foliate ${}^3B$. The integral of the energy density over such a two-surface $B$ is the quasilocal energy associated with a spacelike three-surface $\Sigma$ whose intersection with ${}^3B$ is the boundary $B$. The resulting expression for quasilocal energy is given in terms of the total mean curvature of the spatial boundary $B$ as a surface embedded in $\Sigma$. The quasilocal energy is also the value of the Hamiltonian that generates unit magnitude proper time translations on ${}^3B$ in the direction orthogonal to $B$. Conserved charges such as angular momentum are defined using the surface stress tensor and Killing vector fields on ${}^3B$. For spacetimes that are asymptotically flat in spacelike directions, the quasilocal energy and angular momentum defined here agree with the results of Arnowitt-Deser-Misner in the limit that the boundary tends to spatial infinity. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, it is shown that the quasilocal energy has the correct Newtonian limit, and includes a negative contribution due to gravitational binding.
