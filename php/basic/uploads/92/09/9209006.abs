Title: R-Matrix Formulation of KP Hierarchies and their Gauge Equivalence
Authors: H. Aratyn and E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva and I. Vaysburd
Abstract: The Adler-Kostant-Symes $R$-bracket scheme is applied to the algebra of pseudo-differential operators to relate the three integrable hierarchies: KP and its two modifications, known as nonstandard integrable models. All three hierarchies are shown to be equivalent and connection is established in the form of a symplectic gauge transformation. This construction results in a new representation of the W-infinity algebras in terms of 4 bosonic fields.
