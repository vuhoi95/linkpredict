Title: Introduction to sh Lie algebras for physicists
Authors: Tom Lada and Jim Stasheff
Abstract: Closed string field theory leads to a generalization of Lie algebra which arose naturally within mathematics in the study of deformations of algebraic structures. It also appeared in work on higher spin particles \cite{BBvD}. Representation theoretic analogs arose in the mathematical analysis of the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to constrained Hamiltonians. A major goal of this paper is to see the relevant formulas, especially in closed string field theory, as a generalization of those for a differential graded Lie algebra, hopefully describing the mathematical essentials in terms accessible to {\it physicists}.
