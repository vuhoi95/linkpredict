Title: Hidden Isometry in a Chiral Gauged WZW Model
Authors: Supriya Kar and Alok Kumar and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: It is shown that the asymmetric chiral gauging of the WZW models give rise to consistent string backgrounds. The target space structure of the ${[{SL(2,\Re)/ {SO(1,1)}}]}_L \bigotimes {[{SL(2,\Re)/U(1)}]}_R$ model is analyzed and the presence of a hidden isometry in this background is demonstrated. A nonlinear coordinate transformation is obtained which transforms the asymmetric model to the symmetric one, analyzed recently by two of the present authors.
