Title: Invariants of 2+1 Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. E. Nelson and T. Regge
Abstract: In [1,2] we established and discussed the algebra of observables for 2+1 gravity at both the classical and quantum level. Here our treatment broadens and extends previous results to any genus $g$ with a systematic discussion of the centre of the algebra. The reduction of the number of independent observables to $6g-6 (g > 1)$ is treated in detail with a precise classification for $g = 1$ and $g = 2$.
