Title: Intrinsic Vertex Regularization and Renormalization in $Ï†^4$ Field  Theory
Authors: Zhong-Hua Wang and Han-Ying Guo
Abstract: Based upon the intrinsic relation between the divergent lower point functions and the convergent higher point ones in the renormalizable quantum field theories, we propose a new method for regularization and renormalization in QFT. As an example, we renormalize the $\phi^{4}$ theory at the one loop order by means of this method.
