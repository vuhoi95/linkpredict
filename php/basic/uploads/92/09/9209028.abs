Title: The radial gauge propagators in quantum gravity
Authors: P. Menotti and G. Modanese and D. Seminara
Abstract: We give a general procedure for extracting the propagators in gauge theories in presence of a sharp gauge fixing and we apply it to derive the propagators in quantum gravity in the radial gauge, both in the first and in the second order formalism in any space-time dimension. In the three dimensional case such propagators vanish except for singular collinear contributions, in agreement with the absence of propagating gravitons.
