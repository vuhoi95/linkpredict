Title: Stringy Instantons
Authors: Ram Brustein and Burt Ovrut
Abstract: A canonical Lorentz invariant field theory extension of collective field theory of d=1 matrix models is presented. We show that the low density, discrete, sector of collective field theory includes single eigenvalue Euclidean instantons which tunnel between different vacua of the extended theory. These "stringy" instantons induce non-perturbative effective operators of strength $e^{-{1/g}}$. The relationship of the world sheet description of string theory and Liouville theory to the effective space-time theory is explained.
