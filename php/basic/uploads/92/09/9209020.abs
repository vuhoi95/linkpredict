Title: The Phase Diagram of Fluid Random Surfaces with Extrinsic Curvature
Authors: Mark Bowick and Paul Coddington and Leping Han and Geoffrey Harris and Enzo Marinari
Abstract: We present the results of a large-scale simulation of a Dynamically Triangulated Random Surface with extrinsic curvature embedded in three-dimensional flat space. We measure a variety of local observables and use a finite size scaling analysis to characterize as much as possible the regime of crossover from crumpled to smooth surfaces.
