Title: Algebraic Structures Related to Reflection Equations
Authors: P. P. Kulish and E. K. Sklyanin
Abstract: Quadratic algebras related to the reflection equations are introduced. They are quantum group comodule algebras. The quantum group $F_q(GL(2))$ is taken as the example. The properties of the algebras (center, representations, realizations, real forms, fusion procedure etc) as well as the generalizations are discussed.
