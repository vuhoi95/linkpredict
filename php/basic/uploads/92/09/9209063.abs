Title: Differential cross-sections and escape plots for low energy $SU(2)$ BPS  magnetic monopole dynamics
Authors: M. Temple-Raston and D. Alexander
Abstract: We compute the low-energy classical differential scattering cross-section for BPS $SU(2)$ magnetic monopoles using the geodesic approximation to the actual dynamics and 16K parallel processors on a CM2. Numerical experiments suggest that the quantum BPS magnetic monopole differential cross-section is well-approximated by the classical BPS magnetic monopole differential cross-section. In particular, the expected quantum interference effects for bosons at scattering angle $\theta=\pi/2$ (CoM frame) are contradicted numerically. We argue that this is due to the topology of the classical configuration space for these solitons. We also study the scattering and bounded classical motions of BPS dyons and their global structure in phase space by constructing `escape plots'. The escape plots contain a surprising amount of structure, and suggest that the classical dynamics of two BPS $SU(2)$ magnetic monopoles is chaotic and that there are closed and bounded two dyon motions with isolated energies.
