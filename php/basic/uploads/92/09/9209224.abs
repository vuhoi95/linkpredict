Title: Grand Unification in Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and G. Felder and J. Fr√∂hlich
Abstract: The formalism of non-commutative geometry of A. Connes is used to construct models in particle physics. The physical space-time is taken to be a product of a continuous four-manifold by a discrete set of points. The treatment of Connes is modified in such a way that the basic algebra is defined over the space of matrices, and the breaking mechanism is planted in the Dirac operator. This mechanism is then applied to three examples. In the first example the discrete space consists of two points, and the two algebras are taken respectively to be those of $2\times 2$ and $1\times 1$ matrices. With the Dirac operator containing the vacuum breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)$ to $U(1)$, the model is shown to correspond to the standard model. In the second example the discrete space has three points, two of the algebras are identical and consist of $5\times 5$ complex matrices, and the third algebra consists of functions. With an appropriate Dirac operator this model is almost identical to the minimal $SU(5)$ model of Georgi and Glashow. The third and final example is the left-right symmetric model $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}.$
