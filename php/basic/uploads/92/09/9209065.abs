Title: Realisations of $W_3$ Symmetry
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and H. J. Boonstra and M. de Roo
Abstract: We perform a systematic investigation of free-scalar realisations of the Za\-mo\-lod\-chi\-kov $W_3$ algebra in which the operator product of two spin-three generators contains a non-zero operator of spin four which has vanishing norm. This generalises earlier work where such an operator was required to be absent. By allowing this spin-four null operator we obtain several realisations of the $W_3$ algebra both in terms of two scalars as well as in terms of an arbitrary number $n$ of free scalars. Our analysis is complete for the case of two-scalar realisations.
