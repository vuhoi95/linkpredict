Abstract: Invariant polynomials for torus links are obtained in the framework of the Chern-Simons topological gauge theory. The polynomials are computed as vacuum expectation values on the three-sphere of Wilson line operators representing the Verlinde algebra of the corresponding rational conformal field theory. In the case of the $SU(2)$ gauge theory our results provide explicit expressions for the Jones polynomial as well as for the polynomials associated to the $N$-state ($N>2$) vertex models (Akutsu-Wadati polynomials). By means of the Chern-Simons coset construction, the minimal unitary models are analyzed, showing that the corresponding link invariants factorize into two $SU(2)$ polynomials. A method to obtain skein rules from the Chern-Simons knot operators is developed. This procedure yields the eigenvalues of the braiding matrix of the corresponding conformal field theory.
