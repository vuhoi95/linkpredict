Title: The l-State Boson Algebra as a Non-Standard Quantum Double and its  Universal R-Matrix for Yang-Baxer Equation
Authors: Wei Li and Chang-Pu Sun and Mo-Lin Ge
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new quantum double by endowing the l-state bosonalgebra with a non-trivial Hopf algebra structure,which is not a q-deformation of the Lie algebra or superalgebra.The universal R-matrix for the Yang-Baxter equation associated with this new quantum group structure is obtained explicitly.By building the representations of this quantum double,we get some R-matrices ,which can result in new representations of the braid group.
