Title: A new Proposal for a Quasielectron Trial Wavefunction for the FQHE on a  Disk
Authors: Marcus Kasner and Walter Apel
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a new quasielectron trial wavefunction for $N$ interacting electrons in two dimensions moving in a strong magnetic field in a disk geometry. Requiring that the trial wavefunction exhibits the correct filling factor of a quasielectron wavefunction, we obtain $N+1$ angular momentum eigenfunctions. The expectation values of the energy are calculated and compared with the data of an exact numerical diagonalization.
