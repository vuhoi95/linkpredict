Title: 4d Simplicial Quantum Gravity with a Non-Trivial Measure
Authors: Bernd Bruegmann and E. Marinari
Abstract: We study 4d simplicial quantum gravity in the dynamical triangulation approach with a non-trivial class of measures. We find that the measure contribution plays an important role, influencing the phase diagram and the nature of the (possible) critical theory. We discuss how the lattice theory could be used to fix the quantum measure in a non-ambiguous way.
