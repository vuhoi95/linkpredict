Title: The Supersymmetric Effective Action of the Heterotic String in Ten  Dimensions
Authors: M. de Roo and H. Suelmann and A. Wiedemann
Abstract: We construct the supersymmetric completion of quartic $R+R^4$-actions in the ten-dimensional effective action of the heterotic string. Two invariants, of which the bosonic parts are known from one-loop string amplitude calculations, are obtained. One of these invariants can be generalized to an $R+F^2+F^4$-invariant for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled to supergravity. Supersymmetry requires the presence of $B\wedge R\wedge R\wedge R\wedge R$-terms, ($B\wedge F\wedge F\wedge F\wedge F$ for Yang-Mills) which correspond to counterterms in the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation. Within the context of our calculation the $\zeta(3)R^4$-term from the tree-level string effective action does not allow supersymmetrization.
