Title: On the KP Hierarchy, $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ Algebra, and Conformal  SL(2,R)/U(1) Model --- The Classical and Quantum Cases
Authors: Feng Yu and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: We give a unified description of our recent results on the the inter-relationship between the integrable infinite KP hierarchy, nonlinear $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ current algebra and conformal noncompact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model both at the classical and quantum levels. In particular, we present the construction of a quantum version of the KP hierarchy by deforming the second KP Hamiltonian structure through quantizing the $SL(2,R)_k/U(1)$ model and constructing an infinite set of commuting quantum $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ charges (at least at $k$=1).
