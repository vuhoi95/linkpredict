Title: Natural Supergravity Inflation
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Burt A. Ovrut
Abstract: We show that a single uncharged chiral superfield, canonically coupled to \mbox{$N=1$} supergravity with vanishing superpotential, naturally drives inflation in the early universe for a class of simple Kahler potentials. Inflation occurs due to the one-loop generation of a Kahler anomaly proportional to $\R^2$. The coefficient of this $\R^2$ term is of the correct magnitude to describe all aspects of an inflationary cosmology, including sufficient amplitude perturbations and reheating. Higher order terms proportional to $\R^n$ for $n \geq 3$ are naturally suppressed relative to the $\R^2$ term and, hence, do not destabilize the theory.
