Title: Cauchy Horizons, Thermodynamics and Closed Time-like Curves in Planar  Supersymmetric Space-times
Authors: M. Cvetiƒç and R. Davis and S. Griffies and H. H. Soleng
Abstract: We study geodesically complete, singularity free space-times induced by supersymmetric planar domain walls interpolating between Minkowski and anti-de Sitter ($AdS_4$) vacua. A geodesically complete space-time without closed time-like curves includes an infinite number of semi-infinite Minkowski space-times, separated from each other by a region of $AdS_4$ space-time. These space-times are closely related to the extreme Reissner Nordstr\" om (RN) black hole, exhibiting Cauchy horizons with zero Hawking temperature, but in contrast to the RN black hole there is no entropy. Another geodesically complete extension with closed time-like curves involves space-times connecting a finite number of semi-infinite Minkowski space-times.
