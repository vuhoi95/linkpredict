Title: Supersymmetry and the Nonlocal Yangian Deformation Symmetry
Authors: T. Curtright and C. Zachos
Abstract: In the quantized two-dimensional non-linear supersymmetric $\sigma$-model, the supercurrent supermultiplet, which contains the energy-momentum tensor, is transformed by the nonlocal symmetry of the model into the isospin current supermultiplet. This effect incorporates supersymmetry into the known infinite-dimensional Yangian deformation symmetry of plain $\sigma$-models, leads to precisely the same nontrivial extension of the two-dimensional super-Poincar\'e group as found previously for the Poincar\'e group, and thus determines the theory's mass spectrum. A generalization to all higher-order nonlocal charges is conjectured such that their generating function, the so-called ``master charge'', has a definite Lorentz spin which depends on the spectral parameter.
