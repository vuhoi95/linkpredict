Title: Yang-Baxter Equation for $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ Broken ${\Bf Z}_N $ Models
Authors: Yas-hiro Quano and Akira Fujii
Abstract: We construct a factorized representation of the $\frak g \frak l _n$-Sklyanin algebra from the vertex-face correspondence. Using this representation, we obtain a new solvable model which gives an $\frak s \frak l _n$-generalization of the broken $\bz _N $ model. We further prove the Yang-Baxter equation for this model.
