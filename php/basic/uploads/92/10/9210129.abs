Title: Construction of Modular Branching Functions from Bethe's Equations in  the 3-State Potts Chain
Authors: Rinat Kedem and Barry M. Mccoy
Abstract: We use the single particle excitation energies and the completeness rules of the 3-state anti-ferromagnetic Potts chain, which have been obtained from Bethe's equation, to compute the modular invariant partition function. This provides a fermionic construction for the branching functions of the $D_4$ representation of $Z_4$ parafermions which complements the previous bosonic constructions. It is found that there are oscillations in some of the correlations and a new connection with the field theory of the Lee-Yang edge is presented.
