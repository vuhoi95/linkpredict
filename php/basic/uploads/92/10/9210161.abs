Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the study of the existence and the properties of electron-electron bound states in QED$_3$. A detailed analysis of the infrared structure of the perturbative series of the theory is presented. We start by analyzing the two-point Green's function, in the Bloch-Nordsieck approximation. The theory appears to be plagued by severe infrared divergencies, which nevertheless disappear when vacuum-polarization effects are non-perturbatively taken into account. The dynamical induction of a Chern-Simons term is at the root of this mechanism. {}From the inspection of the electron-electron non-relativistic potential it then follows that equally charged fermions may either repel or attract and, moreover, that bound states do in fact exist in the theory. We calculate numerically the binding energies and average radius of the bound states. We find an accidental quasi-degeneracy of the ground state of the system, between the lowest-energy $l=-3$ and $l=-5$ states, which could be related to a radio-frequency resonance in high-$T_c$ superconductors.
