Abstract: A novel representation ---in terms of a Laurent series--- for the free energy of string theory at non-zero temperature is constructed. The examples of open bosonic, open supersymmetric and closed bosonic strings are studied in detail. In all these cases the Laurent series representation for the free energy is obtained explicitly. It is shown that the Hagedorn temperature arises in this formalism as the convergence condition (specifically, the radius of convergence) of the corresponding Laurent series. Some prospects for further applications are also discussed. In particular, an attempt to describe string theory above the Hagedorn temperature ---via Borel analytical continuation of the Laurent series representation--- is provided.
