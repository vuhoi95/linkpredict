Title: On the Landau-Ginzburg description of $(A_1^{(1)})^{\oplus N}$  invariants
Authors: JÃ¼rgen Fuchs and Maximilian Kreuzer
Abstract: We search for a \Lg\ interpretation of non-diagonal modular invariants of tensor products of minimal $n=2$ superconformal models, looking in particular at automorphism invariants and at some exceptional cases. For the former we find a simple description as \lgo s, which reproduce the correct chiral rings as well as the spectra of various Gepner--type models and orbifolds thereof. On the other hand, we are able to prove for one of the exceptional cases that this conformal field theory cannot be described by an orbifold of a \Lg\ model with respect to a manifest linear symmetry of its potential.
