Title: Isospectral flow in Loop Algebras and Quasiperiodic Solutions of the  Sine-Gordon Equation
Authors: J. Harnad and M. -A. Wisse
Abstract: The sine-Gordon equation is considered in the hamiltonian framework provided by the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem. The phase space, a finite dimensional coadjoint orbit in the dual space $\grg^*$ of a loop algebra $\grg$, is parametrized by a finite dimensional symplectic vector space $W$ embedded into $\grg^*$ by a moment map. Real quasiperiodic solutions are computed in terms of theta functions using a Liouville generating function which generates a canonical transformation to linear coordinates on the Jacobi variety of a suitable hyperelliptic curve.
