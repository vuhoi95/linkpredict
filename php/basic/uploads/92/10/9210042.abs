Title: The Braided Heisenberg Group
Authors: W. K. Baskerville and S. Majid
Abstract: We compute the braided groups and braided matrices $B(R)$ for the solution $R$ of the Yang-Baxter equation associated to the quantum Heisenberg group. We also show that a particular extension of the quantum Heisenberg group is dual to the Heisenberg universal enveloping algebra $U_{q}(h)$, and use this result to derive an action of $U_{q}(h)$ on the braided groups. We then demonstrate the various covariance properties using the braided Heisenberg group as an explicit example. In addition, the braided Heisenberg group is found to be self-dual. Finally, we discuss a physical application to a system of n braided harmonic oscillators. An isomorphism is found between the n-fold braided and unbraided tensor products, and the usual `free' time evolution is shown to be equivalent to an action of a primitive generator of $U_{q}(h)$ on the braided tensor product.
