Title: Driving Operators Relevant: A Feature of Chern-Simons Interaction
Authors: Wei Chen and Miao Li
Abstract: By computing anomalous dimensions of gauge invariant composite operators $(\bar\psi\psi)^n$ and $(\phi^*\phi)^n$ in Chern-Simons fermion and boson models, we address that Chern-Simons interactions make these operators more relevant or less irrelevant in the low energy region. We obtain a critical Chern-Simons fermion coupling, ${1\over \kappa_c^2} = {6\over 19}$, for a phase transition at which the leading irrelevant four-fermion operator $(\bar\psi\psi)^2$ becomes marginal, and a critical Chern-Simons boson coupling, ${1\over \kappa_c^2} = {6\over 34}$, for a similar phase transition for the leading irrelevant operator $(\phi^*\phi)^4$. We see this phenomenon also in the $1/N$ expansion.
