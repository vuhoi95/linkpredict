Title: Characters for Coset Conformal Field Theories
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Keith G. Joshi
Abstract: We solve the Kac-Moody branching equation to obtain explicit formulae for the characters of coset conformal field theories and then apply these to specific examples to determine the integer shift of the conformal weights of primary fields. We also present an example of coset conformal field theory which cannot be described by the identification current method.
