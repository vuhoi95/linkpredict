Title: Finite Unified Models
Authors: D. Kapetanakis and M. Mondragon and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: We present phenomenologically viable $SU(5)$ unified models which are finite to all orders before the spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the case of two models with three families the top quark mass is predicted to be 178.8 GeV.
