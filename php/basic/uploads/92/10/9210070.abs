Title: On the Quantization of Reducible Gauge Systems
Authors: R. Ferraro and M. Henneaux and M. Puchin
Abstract: Reducible gauge theories with constraints linear in the momenta are quantized. The equivalence of the reduced phase space quantization, Dirac quantization and BRST quantization is established. The ghosts of ghosts are found to play a crucial role in the equivalence proof.
