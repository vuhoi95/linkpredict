Title: Classical R-matrix structure for the Calogero model
Authors: J. Avan and M. Talon
Abstract: A classical R-matrix structure is described for the Lax representation of the integrable n-particle chains of Calogero-Olshanetski-Perelo\-mov. This R-matrix is dynamical, non antisymmetric and non-invertible. It immediately triggers the integrability of the Type I, II and III potentials, and the algebraic structures associated with the Type V potential.
