Title: Chern-Simons Theory on the Torus
Authors: F. Falceto and K. Gaw»©dzki
Abstract: We compute explicitly the Schr\"odinger picture space of states of SU(2) Chern-Simons theory on $T^2\times R$ in the presence of temporal Wilson lines. Relation with Friedan-Shenker bundle of conformal field theory and the existence of a projective flat connection on this bundle is discussed. Talk given by the first author at the XIX International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Salamanca (Spain), June 29-July 4, 1992
