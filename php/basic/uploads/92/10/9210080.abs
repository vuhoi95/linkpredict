Title: On The Hamiltonian Structures and The Reductions of The KP Hierarchy
Authors: Didier A Depireux and Jeremy Schiff
Abstract: Recent work on a free field realization of the Hamiltonian structures of the classical KP hierarchy and of its flows is reviewed. It is shown that it corresponds to a reduction of KP to the NLS system.
