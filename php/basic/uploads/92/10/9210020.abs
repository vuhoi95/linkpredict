Title: Intermittency Studies in Directed Bond Percolation
Authors: Malte Henkel and Robert Peschanski
Abstract: The self-similar cluster fluctuations of directed bond percolation at the percolation threshold are studied using techniques borrowed from inter\-mit\-ten\-cy-related analysis in multi-particle production. Numerical simulations based on the factorial moments for large $1+1$-dimensional lattices allow to handle statistical and boundary effects and show the existence of weak but definite intermittency patterns. The extracted fractal dimensions are in agreement with scaling arguments leading to a new relation linking the intermittency indices to the critical exponents and the fractal dimension of directed percolation clusters.
