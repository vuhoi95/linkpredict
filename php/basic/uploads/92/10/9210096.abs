Title: Non-linear Field Theory of a Frustrated Heisenberg Spin Chain
Authors: Sumathi Rao and Diptiman Sen
Abstract: We derive a continuum field theory for the Majumdar-Ghosh model in the large-$S$ limit, where the field takes values in the manifold of the $SO(3)$ group. No topological term is induced in the action and the cases for integer spin and half-integer spin appear to be indistinguishable. A one-loop $\beta -$function calculation indicates that the theory flows towards a strong coupling (disordered) phase at long distances. This is verified in the large-$N$ limit, where all excitations are shown to be massive. (Three figures not included)
