Title: A Conformal Affine Toda Model of 2D Black Holes: A Quantum Study of the  Evaporation End-Point
Authors: F. Belgiorno and A. S. Cattaneo and M. Martellini and F. Fucito
Abstract: In this paper we reformulate the dilaton-gravity theory of Callan \etal\ as a new effective conformal field theory which turns out to be a generalization of the so-called $SL_2$-conformal affine Toda (CAT) theory studied some times ago by Babelon and Bonora. We quantize this model, thus keeping in account the dilaton-gravity quantum effects. We then implement a Renormalization Group analysis to study the black hole thermodynamics and the final state of the Hawking evaporation.
