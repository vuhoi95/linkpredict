Title: The Wave Function of the Universe by the New Euclidean Path-integral  Approach in Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Atushi Ishikawa and Haruhiko Ueda
Abstract: The wave function of the universe is evaluated by using the Euclidean path integral approach. As is well known, the real Euclidean path integral diverges because the Einstein-Hilbert action is not positive definite. In order to obtain a finite wave function, we propose a new regularization method and calculate the wave function of the Friedmann- Robertson-Walker type minisuperspace model. We then consider a homogeneous but anisotropic type minisuperspace model, which is known as the Bianch type I model. The physical meaning of the wave function by this new regularization method is also examined.
