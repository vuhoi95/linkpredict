Title: On Paragrassmann Differential Calculus
Authors: A. T. Filippov and A. P. Isaev and A. B. Kurdikov
Abstract: Explicit general constructions of paragrassmann calculus with one and many variables are given. Relations of the paragrassmann calculus to quantum groups are outlined and possible physics applications are briefly discussed. This paper is the same as the original 9210075 except added Appendix and minor changes in Acknowledgements and References. IMPORTANT NOTE: This paper bears the same title as the Dubna preprint E5-92-392 but is NOT identical to it, containing new results, extended discussions, and references.
