Title: Darboux Coordinates and Liouville-Arnold Integration in Loop Algebras
Authors: M. R. Adams and J. Harnad and J. Hurtubise
Abstract: Darboux coordinates are constructed on rational coadjoint orbits of the positive frequency part $\wt{\frak{g}}^+$ of loop algebras. These are given by the values of the spectral parameters at the divisors corresponding to eigenvector line bundles over the associated spectral curves, defined within a given matrix representation. A Liouville generating function is obtained in completely separated form and shown, through the Liouville-Arnold integration method, to lead to the Abel map linearization of all Hamiltonian flows induced by the spectral invariants. Serre duality is used to define a natural symplectic structure on the space of line bundles of suitable degree over a permissible class of spectral curves, and this is shown to be equivalent to the Kostant-Kirillov symplectic structure on rational coadjoint orbits. The general construction is given for $\frak{g}=\frak{gl}(r)$ or $\frak{sl}(r)$, with reductions to orbits of subalgebras determined as invariant fixed point sets under involutive automorphisms. The case $\frak{g=sl}(2)$ is shown to reproduce the classical integration methods for finite dimensional systems defined on quadrics, as well as the quasi-periodic solutions of the cubically nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. For $\frak{g=sl}(3)$, the method is applied to the computation of quasi-periodic solutions of the two component coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.
