Title: Regularization and Renormalization of Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: G. Giavarini and C. P. Martin and F. Ruiz Ruiz
Abstract: We analyze some features of the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons theory (CST) in the Landau gauge. In this gauge the theory is known to be perturbatively finite. We consider the renormalization scheme in which the renormalized parameter $k$ equals the bare or classical one and show that it constitutes a natural parametrization for the quantum theory. The reason is that, although in this renormalization scheme the value of the Green functions depends on the regularization used, comparison among different regularization methods shows that the observables (Wilson loops) are the same function of the shifted monodromy parameter $k+c_v$ for all BRS invariant regulators used so far for CST. We also discuss a particular BRS invariant regularization prescription in which CST is perturbatively defined as the large mass limit of dimensionally regularized topologically massive Yang-Mills theory. With this regularization prescription the radiative corrections induced by two-loop contributions do not entail observable consequences since they can be reabsorbed by a finite rescaling of the fields only. This very mechanism is conjectured to take place at higher perturbative orders.
