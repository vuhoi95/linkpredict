Title: Supersymmetric Soluble Systems Embedded in Supersymmetric Self--Dual  Yang--Mills Theory
Authors: S. J. Gates, Jr. and H. Nishino
Abstract: We perform dimensional reductions of recently constructed self-dual $~N=2$~ {\it supersymmetric} Yang-Mills theory in $~2+2\-$dimensions into two-dimensions. We show that the universal equations obtained in these dimensional reductions can embed supersymmetric exactly soluble systems, such as $~N=1$~ and $~N=2$~ supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equations, $~N=1$~ supersymmetric Liouville theory or supersymmetric Toda theory. This is the first supporting evidence for the conjecture that the $~2+2\-$dimensional self-dual {\it supersymmetric} Yang-Mills theory generates {\it supersymmetric} soluble systems in lower-dimensions.
