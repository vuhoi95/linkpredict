Title: On the KP Hierarchy, $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ Algebra, and Conformal  SL(2,R)/U(1) Model: I. The Classical Case
Authors: Feng Yu and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: In this paper we study the inter-relationship between the integrable KP hierarchy, nonlinear $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ algebra and conformal noncompact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model at the classical level. We first derive explicitly the Possion brackets of the second Hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy, then use it to define the $\hat{W}_{1+\infty}$ algebra and its reduction $\hat{W}_{\infty}$. Then we show that the latter is realized in the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model as a hidden current algebra, through a free field realization of $\hat{W}_{\infty}$, in closed form for all higher-spin currents, in terms of two bosons. An immediate consequence is the existence of an infinite number of KP flows in the coset model, which preserve the $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ current algebra.
