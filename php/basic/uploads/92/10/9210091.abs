Authors: O. N. Khudaverdian and A. P. Nersessian
Abstract: Supergeneralization of $\DC P(N)$ provided by even and odd K\"ahlerian structures from Hamiltonian reduction are construct.Operator $ \Delta$ which used in Batalin-- Vilkovisky quantization formalism and mechanics which are bi-Hamiltonian under corresponding even and odd Poisson brackets are considered.
