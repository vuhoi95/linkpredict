Title: The $D\to 2$ Limit of General Relativity
Authors: R. B. Mann and S. F. Ross
Abstract: A method for taking the $D\to 2$ limit of D-dimensional general relativity is constructed, yielding a two-dimensional theory which couples gravitation to conserved stress-energy. We show how this theory is related to those obtained via an alternative dimensional reduction approach.
