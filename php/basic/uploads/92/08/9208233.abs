Title: The Cosmological Kibble Mechanism in the Laboratory: String Formation in  Liquid Crystals
Authors: M. J. Bowick and L. Chandar and E. A. Schiff and A. M. Srivastava
Abstract: We have observed the production of strings (disclination lines and loops) via the Kibble mechanism of domain (bubble) formation in the isotropic to nematic phase transition of a sample of uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. The probablity of string formation per bubble is measured to be $0.33 \pm 0.01$. This is in good agreement with the theoretical value $1/ \pi$ expected in two dimensions for the order parameter space $S^2/{\bf Z}_2$ of a simple uniaxial nematic liquid crystal.
