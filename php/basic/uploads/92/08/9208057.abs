Title: Affine Toda Solitons and Automorphisms of Dynkin Diagrams
Authors: Niall MacKay and William McGhee
Abstract: Using Hirota's method, solitons are constructed for affine Toda field theories based on the simply-laced affine algebras. By considering automorphisms of the simply-laced Dynkin diagrams, solutions to the remaining algebras, twisted as well as untwisted, are deduced.
