Title: Putting String/Fivebrane Duality to the Test
Authors: J. A. Dixon and M. J. Duff and J. C. Plefka
Abstract: According to string/fivebrane duality, the Green-Schwarz factorization of the $D=10$ spacetime anomaly polynomial $I_{12}$ into $X_4\, X_8$ means that just as $X_4$ is the anomaly polynomial of the $d=2$ string worldsheet so $X_8$ should be the anomaly polynomial of the $d=6$ fivebrane worldvolume. To test this idea we perform a fivebrane calculation of $X_8$ and find perfect agreement with the string one--loop result.
