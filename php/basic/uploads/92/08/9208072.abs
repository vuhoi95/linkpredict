Title: Superconformally covariant operators and super W algebras
Authors: Francois Gieres and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We study superdifferential operators of order $2n+1$ which are covariant with respect to superconformal changes of coordinates on a compact super Riemann surface. We show that all such operators arise from super M\"obius covariant ones. A canonical matrix representation is presented and applications to classical super W algebras are discussed.
