Title: Structure of the space of states in RSOS models
Authors: Michio Jimbo and Tetsuji Miwa and Yasuhiro Ohta
Abstract: The restricted solid-on-solid models in the anti-ferromagnetic regime is studied in the framework of quantum affine algebras. Following the line developed recently for vertex models, a representation theoretical picture is presented for the structure of the space of states. The local operators and the creation/annihilation operators of quasi-particles are defined using vertex operators, and their commutation relations are calculated.
