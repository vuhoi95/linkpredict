Title: One-loop Vilkovisky-DeWitt Counterterms for 2D Gravity plus Scalar Field  Theory
Authors: R. Kantowski and Caren Marzban
Abstract: The divergent part of the one-loop off-shell effective action is computed for a single scalar field coupled to the Ricci curvature of 2D gravity ($c \phi R$), and self interacting by an arbitrary potential term $V(\phi)$. The Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action is used to compute gauge-fixing independent results. In our background field/covariant gauge we find that the Liouville theory is finite on shell. Off-shell, we find a large class of renormalizable potentials which include the Liouville potential. We also find that for backgrounds satisfying $R=0$, the Liouville theory is finite off shell, as well.
