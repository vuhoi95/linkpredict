Title: A Proposal for Strings at D>1
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and J. L. F. Barbon and C. Crnkovic
Abstract: Using the reduced formulation on large-N Quantum Field Theories we study strings in space-time dimensions higher that one. We present results on possible string susceptibilities, macroscopic loop operators, 1/N -corrections and other general properties of the model.
