Abstract: We introduce {\it conformal multi-matrix models} (CMM) as an alternative to conventional multi-matrix model description of two-dimensional gravity interacting with $c < 1$ matter. We define CMM as solutions to (discrete) extended Virasoro constraints. We argue that the so defined alternatives of multi-matrix models represent the same universality classes in continuum limit, while at the discrete level they provide explicit solutions to the multi-component KP hierarchy and by definition satisfy the discrete $W$-constraints. We prove that discrete CMM coincide with the $(p,q)$-series of 2d gravity models in a {\it well}-{\it defined} continuum limit, thus demonstrating that they provide a proper generalization of Hermitian one-matrix model.
