Title: Bicovariant differential geometry of the quantum group GL_q(3)
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Leonardo Castellani
Abstract: We construct a bicovariant differential calculus on the quantum group $GL_q(3)$, and discuss its restriction to $[SU(3) \otimes U(1)]_q$. The $q$-algebra of Lie derivatives is found, as well as the Cartan-Maurer equations. All the quantities characterizing the non-commutative geometry of $GL_q(3)$ are given explicitly.
