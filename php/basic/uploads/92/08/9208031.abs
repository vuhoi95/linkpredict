Title: The partition function of 2d string theory
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and G. Moore and R. Plesser
Abstract: We derive a compact and explicit expression for the generating functional of all correlation functions of tachyon operators in 2D string theory. This expression makes manifest relations of the $c=1$ system to KP flow and $W_{1+\infty}$ constraints. Moreover we derive a Kontsevich-Penner integral representation of this generating functional.
