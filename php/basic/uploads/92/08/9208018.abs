Title: Gravity Theories with Lightlike Sources in D=3
Authors: S. Deser and A. Steif
Abstract: Spacetimes generated by a lightlike particle source for topologically massive gravity and its limits - Einstein gravity and the pure gravitational Chern-Simons model - are obtained both by solving the field equations and by infinite boosts of static metrics. The resulting geometries are the first known solutions of topologically massive gravity that are asymptotically flat and generated by compact matter sources. Explicit metrics describing various multiphoton solutions are also derived. For Einstein gravity, we also construct such solutions by null boost identifications of Minkowski space and thereby obtain limits on the energies of the sources.
