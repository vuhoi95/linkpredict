Title: Superconformal Affine Liouville Theory
Authors: F. Toppan and Y. -Z. Zhang
Abstract: We present a superconformally invariant and integrable model based on the twisted affine Kac-Moody superalgebra $\hat{osp(2|2)}^{(2)}$ which is the supersymmetrization of the purely bosonic conformal affine Liouville theory recently proposed by Babelon and Bonora. Our model reduces to the super-Liouville or to the super sinh-Gordon theories under certain limit conditions and can be obtained, via hamiltonian reduction, from a superspace WZNW model with values in the corresponding affine KM supergroup. The reconstruction formulae for classical solutions are given. The classical $r$-matrices in the homogeneous grading and the exchange algebras are worked out.
