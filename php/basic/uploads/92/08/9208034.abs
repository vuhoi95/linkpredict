Title: Einstein Gravity in 2+1 Dimensions from a Gauge Model with Symmetry  Breaking
Authors: R. Brooks and D. Cangemi and M. Crescimanno
Abstract: Einstein Gravity in 2+1 dimensions arises as a consequence of the equations of motion of a gauge model in an external metric. Newton's constant appears as an order parameter of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. Matter is coupled in a straightforward way.
