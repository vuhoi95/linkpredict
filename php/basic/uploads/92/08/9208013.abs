Title: On the quantum KP hierarchy and its relation to the non-linear  Schr√∂dinger equation
Authors: M. D. Freeman and P. West
Abstract: We establish a relation between the classical non-linear Schr\"odinger equation and the KP hierarchy, and we extend this relation to the quantum case by defining a quantum KP hierarchy. We present evidence that an integrable hierarchy of equations is obtained by quantizing the first Hamiltonian structure of the KdV equation. The connection between infinite-dimensional algebras and integrable models is discussed.
