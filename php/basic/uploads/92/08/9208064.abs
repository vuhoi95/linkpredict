Title: Genus Zero Correlation Functions in c<1 String Theory
Authors: S. Govindarajan and T. Jayaraman and V. John
Abstract: We compute N-point correlation functions of pure vertex operator states(DK states) for minimal models coupled to gravity. We obtain agreement with the matrix model results on analytically continuing in the numbers of cosmological constant operators and matter screening operators. We illustrate this for the cases of the $(2k-1,2)$ and $(p+1,p)$ models.
