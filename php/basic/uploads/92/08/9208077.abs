Title: The Topography of $\W_\infty$-Type Algebras
Authors: J. M. Figueroa-O'Farrill and J. Mas and E. Ramos
Abstract: We chart out the landscape of $\Winfty$-type algebras using $\Wkpq$---a recently discovered one-parameter deformation of $\W_{\rm KP}$. We relate all hitherto known $\Winfty$-type algebras to $\Wkpq$ and its reductions, contractions, and/or truncations at special values of the parameter.
