Title: Thermodynamics of Two-Dimensional Black-Holes
Authors: Chiara R. Nappi and Andrea Pasquinucci
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of a general class of two dimensional dilatonic black-holes. A simple prescription is given that allows us to compute the mass, entropy and thermodynamic potentials, with results in agreement with those obtained by other methods, when available.
