Title: Massive Analogue of Ashtekar-CJD Action
Authors: K. Kamimura and T. Fukuyama
Abstract: The action of Ashtekar gravity have been found by Cappovilla, Jacobson and Dell. It does not depend on the metric nor the signature of the space-time. The action has a similar structure as that of a massless relativistic particle. The former is naturally generalized by adding a term analogous to a mass term of the relativistic particle. The new action possesses a constant parameter regarded as a kind of a cosmological constant. It is interesting to find a covariant Einstein equation from the action. In order to do it we will examine how the geometrical quantities are determined from the non-metric action and how the Einstein equation follows from it.
