Title: Strings in Discrete and Continuous Target Spaces: A Comparison
Authors: Ivan K. Kostov and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We find the precise relationship between the loop gas method and the matrix quantum mechanics approach to two-dimensional string theory. The two systems are distinguished by different target spaces ($\Z$ and $\R$, respectively) as far as {\it observables} are concerned. We argue that target space loop correlators should coincide in the two models and demonstrate this for a number of examples. As a consequence some interesting generic observations about the structure of two-dimensional string theory may be made: Restricting to a discrete target space leads to {\it factorization} of amplitudes and thus to very simple sewing rules. It is also demonstrated that the restriction to the discrete target space still allows to calculate the correlation functions of tachyon operators in the unrestricted theory.
