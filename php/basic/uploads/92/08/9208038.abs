Title: Modular Groups for Twisted Narain Models
Authors: J. Erler and M. Spalinski
Abstract: We demonstrate how to find modular discrete symmetry groups for $Z_N$ orbifolds. The $Z_7$ orbifold is treated in detail as a non-trivial example of a $(2,2)$ orbifold model. We give the generators of the modular group for this case which, surprisingly, does not contain $\sltz^3$ as had been speculated. The treatment models with discrete Wilson lines is also discussed. We consider examples which demonstrate that discrete Wilson lines affect the modular group in a non-trivial manner. In particular, we show that it is possible for a Wilson line to break $SL(2,{\bf Z})$.
