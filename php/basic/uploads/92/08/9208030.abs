Abstract: We solve a class of branched polymer models coupled to spin systems and show that they have no phase transition and are either always magnetized or never magnetized depending on the branching weights. By comparing these results with numerical simulations of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields with central charge $c$ we provide evidence that for $c$ sufficiently large ($c\geq 12$) these models are effectively described by branched polymers. Moreover, the numerical results indicate a remarkable universality in the influence on the geometry of surfaces due to the interaction with matter. For spin systems this influence only depends on the total central charge.
