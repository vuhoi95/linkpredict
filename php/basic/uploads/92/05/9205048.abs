Title: Higher derivative quantum gravity with torsion in the conformally  Self-Dual Limit
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The path integral for higher-derivative quantum gravity with torsion is considered. Applying the methods of two-dimensional quantum gravity, this path integral is analyzed in the limit of conformally self-dual metrics. A scaling law for fixed-volume geometry is obtained.
