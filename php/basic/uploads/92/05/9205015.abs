Title: Conformal Symmetry and Central Charges in 4 Dimensions
Authors: I. Antoniadis and P. O. Mazur and E. Mottola
Abstract: The trace anomaly of matter in curved space generates an effective action for the conformal factor of the metric tensor in $D=4$ dimensions, analogous to the Polyakov action for $D=2$. We compute the contributions of the reparameterization ghosts to the central charges for $D=4$, as well as the quantum contribution of the conformal factor itself. The ghost contribution satisfies the necessary Wess-Zumino consistency condition only if combined with the spin-2 modes, whose contributions to the trace anomaly we also discuss.
