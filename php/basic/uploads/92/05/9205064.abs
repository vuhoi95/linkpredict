Title: The Quantum Double in Integrable Quantum Field Theory
Authors: D. Bernard and A. LeClair
Abstract: Various aspects of recent works on affine quantum group symmetry of integrable 2d quantum field theory are reviewed and further clarified. A geometrical meaning is given to the quantum double, and other properties of quantum groups. Multiplicative presentations of the Yangian double are analyzed.
