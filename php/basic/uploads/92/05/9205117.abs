Title: An Infinite Number of Commuting Quantum $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ Charges in  the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ Coset Model
Authors: Feng Yu and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: The conformal non-compact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model in two dimensions has been recently shown to embody a nonlinear $\hat{W}_\infty$ current algebra, consisting of currents of spin $\geq 2$ including the energy-momentum tensor. In this letter we explicitly construct an infinite set of commuting quantum $\hat{W}_\infty$ charges in the model with $k=1$. These commuting quantum charges generate a set of infinitely many compatible flows (quantum KP flows), which maintain the nonlinear $\hat{W}_\infty$ current algebra invariant.
