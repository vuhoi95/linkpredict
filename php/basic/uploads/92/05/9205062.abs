Title: Four Dimensional Stringy Black Membrane
Authors: Supriya K. Kar and S. Pratik Khastgir and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: An exact conformal field theory describing a four dimensional singular string background is obtained by chiral gauging a $U(1)$ subgroup along with translations in $R$ of an $SL(2,R)\times R$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. It is shown that the target space-time describes a four dimensional black membrane. Furthermore various duality transformed solutions are constructed. These are also shown to correspond to various forms of four dimensional black membranes.
