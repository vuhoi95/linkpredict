Title: Constant Solutions of Reflection Equations and Quantum Groups
Authors: P. P. Kulish and R. Sasaki and C. Schwiebert
Abstract: To the Yang-Baxter equation an additional relation can be added. This is the reflection equation which appears in various places, with or without spectral parameter. For example, in factorizable scattering on a half-line, integrable lattice models with non-periodic boundary conditions, non-commutative differential geometry on quantum groups, etc. We study two forms of spectral parameter independent reflection equations, chosen by the requirement that their solutions be comodules with respect to the quantum group coaction leaving invariant the reflection equations. For a variety of known solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation we give the constant solutions of the reflection equations. Various quadratic algebras defined by the reflection equations are also given explicitly.
