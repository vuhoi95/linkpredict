Title: High Temperature Partition Function of the Rigid String
Authors: Joseph Polchinski and Zhu Yang
Abstract: We find that the high temperature limit of the free energy per unit length for the rigid string agrees dimensionally with that of the QCD string (unlike the Nambu-Goto string). The sign, and in fact the phase, do not agree. While this may be a clue to a string theory of QCD, we note that the problem of the fourth derivative action makes it impossible for the rigid string to be a correct description.
