Title: Quantum-Mechanical Scattering of Charged Black Holes
Authors: Jennie Traschen and Robert Ferrel
Abstract: We describe the quantum mechanical scattering of slowly moving maximally charged black holes. Our technique is to develop a canonical quantization procedure on the parameter space of possible static classical solutions. With this, we compute the capture cross sections for the scattering of two black holes. Finally, we discuss how quantization on this parameter space relates to quantization of the degrees of freedom of the gravitational field.
