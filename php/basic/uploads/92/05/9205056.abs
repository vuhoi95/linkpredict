Title: Global KdV Flows and Stable 2D Quantum Gravity
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson and Tim R. Morris and Anders WÃ¤tterstam
Abstract: The string equation for the $[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation of non--perturbatively stable 2D quantum gravity coupled to the $(2m-1,2)$ models is studied. Global KdV flows between the appropriate solutions are considered as deformations of two compatible linear problems. It is demonstrated that the necessary conditions for such flows to exist are satisfied. A numerical study reveals such flows between the pole--free solutions of pure gravity ($m=2$), the Lee--Yang edge model ($m=3$) and topological gravity ($m=1$). We conjecture that this is the case for all of the $m$--critical models. As the $m=1$ solution is unique these global flows define a {\sl unique} solution for each $m$--critical model.
