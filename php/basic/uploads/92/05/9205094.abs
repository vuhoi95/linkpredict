Title: Running Gauge Couplings and Thresholds in the Type II Superstring
Authors: L. Dolan and James T. Liu
Abstract: A distinctive feature of string unification is the possibility of unification by a non-simply-laced group. This occurs most naturally in four dimensional type~II string models where the gauge symmetry is realized by Kac-Moody algebras at different levels. We investigate the running coupling constants and the one-loop thresholds for such general models. As a specific case, we examine a $\rm SU(3)\times U(1)\times U(1)$ model and find that the threshold corrections lead to a small $6\%$ increase in the unification scale.
