Title: Self-Dual Chern-Simons Higgs Systems with an N=3 Extended Supersymmetry
Authors: Hsien-Chung Kao and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We construct and study an N=3 supersymmetric Chern-Simons Higgs theory. This theory is the maximally supersymmetric one containing the self-dual models with a single gauge field and no gravity.
