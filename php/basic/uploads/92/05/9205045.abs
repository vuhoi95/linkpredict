Title: Supersymmetric, Integrable Toda Field Theories: The B(1,1) Model
Authors: Silvia Penati and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional supersymmetric Toda theory based on the Lie superalgebra $B(1,1) \equiv Osp(3|2)$ and construct its quantum W-currents. We also investigate the fermionic affinization of this model: we show that despite the non-unitary form of the Lagrangian the $B^{(1)}(1,1)$ theory has a real particle mass spectrum which is not renormalized at one-loop. We construct the first higher--spin conserved current, prove its conservation to all-loop order, compute one-loop corrections to the corresponding charge and check consistency between charge and mass renormalization.
