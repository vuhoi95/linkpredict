Title: Induced (N,0) supergravity as a constrained Osp(N,2) WZWN model and its  effective action
Authors: G. W. Delius and M. T. Grisaru and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: A chiral $(N,0) $ supergravity theory in d=2 dimensions for any $N$ and its induced action can be obtained by constraining the currents of an Osp(N$|$2) WZWN model. The underlying symmetry algebras are the nonlinear SO(N) superconformal algebras of Knizhnik and Bershadsky. The case $N=3$ is worked out in detail. We show that by adding quantum corrections to the classical transformation rules, the gauge algebra on gauge fields and currents closes. Integrability conditions on Ward identities are derived. The effective action is computed at one loop. It is finite, and can be obtained from the induced action by rescaling the central charge and fields by finite Z factors.
