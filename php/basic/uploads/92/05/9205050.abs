Title: Effective potential and stability of the rigid membrane
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The calculation of the effective potential for fixed-end and toroidal rigid $p$-branes is performed in the one-loop as well as in the $1/d$ approximations. The analysis of the involved zeta-functions (of inhomogeneous Epstein type) which appear in the process of regularization is done in full detail. Assymptotic formulas (allowing only for exponentially decreasing errors of order $\leq 10^{-3}$) are found which carry all the dependences on the basic parameters of the theory explicitly. The behaviour of the effective potential (specified to the membrane case $p=2$) is investigated, and the extrema of this effective potential are obtained.
