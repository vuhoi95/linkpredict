Title: Classical Isomorphisms for Quantum Groups
Authors: Vidyut Jain and Oleg Ogievetsky
Abstract: The expressions for the $\hat{R}$--matrices for the quantum groups SO$_{q^2}$(5) and SO$_q$(6) in terms of the $\hat{R}$--matrices for Sp$_q$(2) and SL$_q$(4) are found, and the local isomorphisms of the corresponding quantum groups are established.
