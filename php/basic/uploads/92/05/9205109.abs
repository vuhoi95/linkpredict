Title: On Integrable Quantum Group Invariant Antiferromagnets
Authors: R. Cuerno and G. Sierra and C. Gomez
Abstract: A new open spin chain hamiltonian is introduced. It is both integrable (Sklyanin`s type $K$ matrices are used to achieve this) and invariant under ${\cal U}_{\epsilon}(sl(2))$ transformations in nilpotent irreps for $\epsilon^3=1$. Some considerations on the centralizer of nilpotent representations and its representation theory are also presented.
