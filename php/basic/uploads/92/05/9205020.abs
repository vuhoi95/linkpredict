Title: Divergences of Discrete States Amplitudes and Effective Lagrangian in 2D  String Theory
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and A. P. Zubarev
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for discrete states in 2D string theory are considered. Pole divergences of tree-level amplitudes are extracted and residues are interpreted as renormalized amplitudes for discrete states. An effective Lagrangian generating renormalized amplitudes for open string is written and corresponding Ward identities are presented. A relation of this Lagrangian with homotopy Lie algebra is discussed.
