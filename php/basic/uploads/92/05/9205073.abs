Title: Non-perturbative 2d quantum gravity and hamiltonians unbounded from  below
Authors: J. Ambjorn and C. F. Kristjansen
Abstract: We show how the stochastic stabilization provides both the weak coupling genus expansion and a strong coupling expansion of 2d quantum gravity. The double scaling limit is described by a hamiltonian which is unbounded from below, but which has a discrete spectrum.
