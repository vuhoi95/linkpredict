Title: c = 1 conformal field theory and the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Christopher Ting and C. H. Lai
Abstract: We examine the application of $c=1$ conformal field theory to the description of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It is found that the Gaussian model together with an appropriate boundary condition for the order parameter furnishes an effective theory for the Laughlin type FQHE. The plateau formation condition corresponds to taking the {\em chiral} portion of the theory.
