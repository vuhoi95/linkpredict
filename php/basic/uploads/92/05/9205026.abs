Title: Lorentz invariance of effective strings
Authors: J. D. Cohn and Vipul Periwal
Abstract: Starting from a Poincar\'e invariant field theory of a real scalar field with interactions governed by a double-well potential in 2+1 dimensions, the Lorentz representation induced on the collective coordinates describing low-energy excitations about an effective string background is derived. In this representation, Lorentz transformations are given in terms of an infinite series, in powers of derivatives along the worldsheet. Transformations that act on the direction transverse to the string worldsheet involve a universal dimension $-1$ term. As a consequence, Lorentz invariance holds in this theory of long effective strings due to cancellations in the action between irrelevant terms and the dimension two term that describes free massless scalar fields in two dimensions.
