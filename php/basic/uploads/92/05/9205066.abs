Title: Topological 2-form Gravity in Four Dimensions
Authors: H. Y. Lee and A. Nakamichi and T. Ueno
Abstract: A kind of topological field theory is proposed as a candidate to describe the global structure of the 2-form Einstein gravity with or without a cosmological constant. Indeed in the former case, we show that a quantum state in the candidate gives an exact solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The BRST quantization based on the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism is carried out for this topological version of the 2-form Einstein gravity.
