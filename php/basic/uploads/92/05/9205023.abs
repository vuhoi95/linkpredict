Title: Stability Analysis of a Stringy Black Hole
Authors: Rue-Ron Hsu and Green Huang and Wei-Fu Lin and Chin-Rong Lee
Abstract: We investigate the stability of charged black holes in two-dimensional heterotic string theories that were recently discussed by McGuidan, Nappi and Yost. In the framework of small time-dependent perturbation, we find that these black holes are linearly stable.
