Title: A Proposal for $D>1$ Strings?
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and J. L. F. Barbon
Abstract: Using the reduced formulation of large-N Quantum Field Theories we study strings in space-time dimensions higher than one. Some preliminary results concerning the possible string susceptibilities and general properties of the model are presented.
