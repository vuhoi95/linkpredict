Title: Novel Symmetry of Non-Einsteinian Gravity in Two Dimensions
Authors: H. Grosse and W. Kummer and P. Pre≈°najder and D. J. Schwarz
Abstract: The integrability of $R^2$-gravity with torsion in two dimensions is traced to an ultralocal dynamical symmetry of constraints and momenta in Hamiltonian phase space. It may be interpreted as a quadratically deformed $iso(2,1)$-algebra with the deformation consisting of the Casimir operators of the undeformed algebra. The locally conserved quantity encountered in the explicit solution is identified as an element of the centre of this algebra. Specific contractions of the algebra are related to specific limits of the explicit solutions of this model.
