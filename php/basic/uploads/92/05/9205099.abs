Title: Chern-Simons Forms, Mickelsson-Faddeev Algebras and the P-Branes
Authors: J. A. Dixon and M. J. Duff
Abstract: In string theory, nilpotence of the BRS operator $\d$ for the string functional relates the Chern-Simons term in the gauge-invariant antisymmetric tensor field strength to the central term in the Kac-Moody algebra. We generalize these ideas to p-branes with odd p and find that the Kac-Moody algebra for the string becomes the Mickelsson-Faddeev algebra for the p-brane.
