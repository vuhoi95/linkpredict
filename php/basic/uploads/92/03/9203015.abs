Title: Chiral Current Algebras in Three--Dimensional Bf--Theory with Boundary
Authors: Nicola Maggiore and Paolo Provero
Abstract: We consider the three--dimensional BF--model with planar boundary in the axial gauge. We find two--dimensional conserved chiral currents living on the boundary and satisfying Kac--Moody algebras.
