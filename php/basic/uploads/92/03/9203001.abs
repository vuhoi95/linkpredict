Title: Topological Phases of the Heterotic String
Authors: Jack Morse and Rolf Schimmrigk
Abstract: We analyze the phase structure of topological Calabi--Yau manifolds defined on the moduli space of instantons. We show in this framework that topological vacua describe new phases of the Heterotic String theory in which the flat directions corresponding to complex deformations are lifted. We also briefly discuss the phase structure of non--K\"ahler manifolds.
