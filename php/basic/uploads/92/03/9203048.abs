Title: Quantum Galilei Group as Symmetry of Magnons
Authors: F. Bonechi and E. Celeghini and R. Giachetti and E. Sorace and M. Tarlini
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum groups are shown to be an effective algebraic tool in the study of integrable systems and to provide solutions equivalent to the Bethe ansatz. The method is illustrated on the 1D Heisenberg ferromagnet whose symmetry is shown to be the quantum Galilei group Gamma_q(1) here introduced. Both the single magnon and the s=1/2 bound states of n-magnons are completely described by the algebra.
