Title: Eikonal Quantum Gravity and Planckian Scattering
Authors: Dan Kabat and Miguel Ortiz
Abstract: Various approaches to high energy forward scattering in quantum gravity are compared using the eikonal approximation. The massless limit of the eikonal is shown to be equivalent to other approximations for the same process, specifically the semiclassical calculation due to G. 't Hooft and the topological field theory due to H. and E. Verlinde. This comparison clarifies these previous results, as it is seen that the amplitude arises purely from a linearised gravitational interaction. The interpretation of poles in the scattering amplitude is also clarified.
