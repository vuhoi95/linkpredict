Title: Gauge Invariant Formulations of Lineal Gravity
Authors: Daniel Cangemi and Roman Jackiw
Abstract: It is shown that the currently studied ``string-inspired'' model for gravity on a line can be formulated as a gauge invariant theory based on the Poincar\'e group with central extension -- a formulation that complements and simplifies H.~Verlinde's construction based on the unextended Poincar\'e group.
