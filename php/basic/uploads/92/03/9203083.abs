Title: Rotating Dilaton Black Holes
Authors: James H. Horne and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: It is shown that an arbitrarily small amount of angular momentum can qualitatively change the properties of extremal charged black holes coupled to a dilaton. In addition, the gyromagnetic ratio of these black holes is computed and an exact rotating black string solution is presented.
