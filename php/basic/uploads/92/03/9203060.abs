Title: Classical Scattering in $1+1$ Dimensional String Theory
Authors: G. Moore and R. Plesser
Abstract: We find the general solution to Polchinski's classical scattering equations for $1+1$ dimensional string theory. This allows efficient computation of scattering amplitudes in the standard Liouville $\times$ $c=1$ background. Moreover, the solution leads to a mapping from a large class of time-dependent collective field theory backgrounds to corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Finally, we derive recursion relations between tachyon amplitudes. These may be summarized by an infinite set of nonlinear PDE's for the partition function in an arbitrary time-dependent background.
