Title: Nonlocal Yang-Mills
Authors: Gary Kleppe and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We present a very simple and explicit procedure for nonlocalizing the action of any theory which can be formulated perturbatively. When the resulting nonlocal field theory is quantized using the functional formalism --- with unit measure factor --- its Green's functions are finite to all orders. The construction also ensures perturbative unitarity to all orders for scalars with nonderivative interactions, however, decoupling is lost at one loop when vector and tensor quanta are present. Decoupling can be restored (again, to all orders) if a suitable measure factor exists. We compute the required measure factor for pure Yang-Mills at order $g^2$ and then use it to evaluate the vacuum polarization at one loop. A peculiar feature of our regularization scheme is that the on-shell tree amplitudes are completely unaffected. This implies that the nonlocal field theory can be viewed as a highly noncanonical quantization of the original, local field equations.
