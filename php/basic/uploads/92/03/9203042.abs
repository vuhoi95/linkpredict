Title: Quantum Black Holes
Authors: B. Birnir and S. B. Giddings and J. A. Harvey and A. Strominger
Abstract: Static solutions of large-$N$ quantum dilaton gravity in $1+1$ dimensions are analyzed and found to exhibit some unusual behavior. As expected from previous work, infinite-mass solutions are found describing a black hole in equilibrium with a bath of Hawking radiation. Surprisingly, the finite mass solutions are found to approach zero coupling both at the horizon and spatial infinity, with a ``bounce'' off of strong coupling in between. Several new zero mass solutions -- candidate quantum vacua -- are also described.
