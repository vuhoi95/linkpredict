Title: The Sub-leading Magnetic Deformation of the Tricritical Ising Model in  2D as RSOS Restriction of the Izergin-Korepin Model
Authors: F. Colomo and A. Koubek and G. Mussardo
Abstract: We compute the $S$-matrix of the Tricritical Ising Model perturbed by the subleading magnetic operator using Smirnov's RSOS reduction of the Izergin-Korepin model. We discuss some features of the scattering theory we obtain, in particular a non trivial implementation of crossing-symmetry, interesting connections between the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitudes, the possibility of introducing generalized statistics, and the monodromy properties of the OPE of the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory.
