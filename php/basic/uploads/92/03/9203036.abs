Title: On the quantization of the N=2 supersymmetric non linear sigma model
Authors: G. Aldazabal and J. M. Maldacena
Abstract: A method for quantizing the bidimensional N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma model is developed. This method is both covariant under coordinate transformations (concerning the order relevant for calculations) and explicitly N=2 supersymmetric. The OPE of the supercurrent is computed accordingly, including also the dilaton. By imposing the N=2 superconformal algebra the equations for the metric and dilaton are obtained. In particular, they imply that the dilaton is a constant.
