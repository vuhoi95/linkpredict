Title: Nonlocal regularisation and two-dimensional induced actions
Authors: F. De Jonghe and R. Siebelink and W. Troost
Abstract: We present an invariant regularisation scheme to compute two dimensional induced gauge theory actions, that is local in Polyakov's variables, but nonlocal in the original gauge potentials. Our method sheds light on the locality of this induced action, and leads to a straightforward proof that the $\varepsilon$-anomaly in $W_3$-gravity is completely given by the one loop term.
