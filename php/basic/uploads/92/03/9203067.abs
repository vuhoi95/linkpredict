Title: Applications of W-algebras to BF theories, QCD and 4D Gravity
Authors: Ralph Lano and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: We are able to show that BF theories naturally emerge from the coadjoint orbits of $W_2$ and $w_\infty$ algebras which includes a Kac-Moody sector. Since QCD strings can be identified with a BF theory, we are able to show a relationship between the orbits and monopole-string solutions of QCD. Furthermore, we observe that when 4D gravitation is cast into a BF form through the use of Ashtekar variables, we are able to get order $\hbar$ contributions to gravity which can be associated with the $W_2$ anomaly. We comment on the relationship to gravitational monopoles.
