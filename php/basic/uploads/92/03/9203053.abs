Title: Combinatorial and topological phase structure of non-perturbative  n-dimensional quantum gravity
Authors: M. Carfora and M. Martellini and A. Marzuoli
Abstract: We provide a non-perturbative geometrical characterization of the partition function of $n$-dimensional quantum gravity based on a coarse classification of riemannian geometries. We show that, under natural geometrical constraints, the theory admits a continuum limit with a non-trivial phase structure parametrized by the homotopy types of the class of manifolds considered. The results obtained qualitatively coincide, when specialized to dimension two, with those of two-dimensional quantum gravity models based on random triangulations of surfaces.
