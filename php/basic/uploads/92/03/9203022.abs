Title: Stable Non--Perturbative Minimal Models Coupled to 2D Quantum Gravity
Authors: Clifford Johnson and Tim Morris and Bill Spence
Abstract: A generalisation of the non--perturbatively stable solutions of string equations which respect the KdV flows, obtained recently for the $(2m-1,2)$ conformal minimal models coupled to two--dimensional quantum gravity, is presented for the $(p,q)$ models. These string equations are the most general string equations compatible with the $q$--th generalised KdV flows. They exhibit a close relationship with the bi-hamiltonian structure in these hierarchies. The Ising model is studied as a particular example, for which a real non-singular numerical solution to the string susceptibility is presented.
