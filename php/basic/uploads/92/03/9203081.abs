Authors: S. V. Ketov and S. J. Gates, Jr. and H. Nishino
Abstract: The properties of Dirac gamma matrices in a four-dimensional space-time with the $(2,2)$ signature are studied. The basic spinors are classified, and the existence of Majorana-Weyl spinors is noted. Supersymmetry in $2 + 2$ dimensions is discussed, and the existence of the {\it real chiral} scalar supermultiplet is discovered. Supersymmetric {\it self-dual} Yang-Mills theories and {\it self-dual} supergravity model in $2 + 2$ dimensions, that are apparently relevant to integrable systems, are formulated for the first time.
