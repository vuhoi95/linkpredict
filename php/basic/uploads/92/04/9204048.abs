Title: Intersections forms and the geometry of lattice Chern-Simons theory
Authors: David Eliezer and Gordon Semenoff
Abstract: We show that it is possible to formulate Abelian Chern-Simons theory on a lattice as a topological field theory. We discuss the relationship between gauge invariance of the Chern-Simons lattice action and the topological interpretation of the canonical structure. We show that these theories are exactly solvable and have the same degrees of freedom as the analogous continuum theories.
