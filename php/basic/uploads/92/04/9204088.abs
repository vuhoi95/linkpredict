Title: Analysis of All Dimensionful Parameters Relevant in Gravitational  Dressing of Conformal Theories
Authors: H. Dorn and H. -J. Otto
Abstract: Starting from a covariant and background independent definition of normal ordered vertex operators we give an alternative derivation of the KPZ relation between conformal dimensions and their gravitational dressed partners. With our method we are able to study for arbitrary genus the dependence of N-point functions on all dimensionful parameters. Implications for the interpretation of gravitational dressed dimensions are discussed.
