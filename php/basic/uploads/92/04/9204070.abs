Title: Gravitational and Schwinger model anomalies: how far can the analogy go?
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci
Abstract: We describe the most general treatment of all anomalies both for chiral and massless Dirac fermions, in two-dimensional gravity. It is shown that for this purpose two regularization dependent parameters are present in the effective action. Analogy to the \sc\ model is displayed corresponding to a specific choice of the second parameter, thus showing that the gravitational model contains \a\ relations having no analogy in the \sc\ model.
