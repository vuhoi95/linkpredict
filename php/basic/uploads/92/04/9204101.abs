Title: Self-Dual Chern-Simons Solitons in (2+1)-Dimensional Einstein Gravity
Authors: Daniel Cangemi and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: We consider here a generalization of the Abelian Higgs model in curved space, by adding a Chern--Simons term. The static equations are self-dual provided we choose a suitable potential. The solutions give a self-dual Maxwell--Chern--Simons soliton that possesses a mass and a spin.
