Title: String Effective Actions and Cosmological Stability of Scalar Potentials
Authors: Juan Garcia-Bellido and Mariano Quiros
Abstract: The cosmology of the string effective action, including one loop string threshold corrections, is analyzed for static compactifications. The stability of the minima of a general supersymmetry breaking potential is studied in the presence of radiation. In particular, it is shown that the radiation bath makes the minima with negative cosmological constant unstable.
