Title: Non-Renormalization Properties of the Chern-Simons Action Coupled to  Matter
Authors: Alberto Blasi and Nicola Maggiore and Silvio P. Sorella
Abstract: We analyze an abelian gauge model in 3 dimensions which includes massless scalar matter fields. By controlling the trace anomalies with a local dilatation Ward identity, we show that, in perturbation theory and within the BPHZL scheme, the Chern-Simons term has no radiative corrections. This implies, in particular, the vanishing of the corresponding $\beta$ function in the renormalization group equation.
