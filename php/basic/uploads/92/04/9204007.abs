Title: Anomalous Transformation in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: H. Itoyama and B. Razzaghe-Ashrafi
Abstract: An ``anomalous'' supersymmetry transformation of the gaugino axial current is given in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The contact term is computed to one-loop order by a gauge-invariant point-splitting procedure. We reexamine the supercurrent anomaly in this method.
