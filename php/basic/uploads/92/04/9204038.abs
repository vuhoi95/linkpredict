Title: On Realisations of W Algebras
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: It has been known for some time that $W$ algebras can be realised in terms of an energy-momentum tensor together with additional free scalar fields. Some recent results have shown that more general realisations are also possible. In this paper, we consider a wide class of realisations that may be obtained from the Miura transformation, related to the existence of canonical subalgebras of the Lie algebras on which the $W$ algebras are based. We give explicit formulae for all realisations of this kind, and discuss their applications in $W$-string theory.
