Title: Berry's Phase and Euclidean Path Integral
Authors: Taro Kashiwa and Shuji Nima and Seiji Sakoda
Abstract: A method for finding Berry's phase is proposed under the Euclidean path integral formalism. It is characterized by picking up the imaginary part from the resultant exponent. Discussion is made on the generalized harmonic oscillator which is shown being so universal in a single degree case. The spin model expressed by creation and annihilation operators is also discussed. A systematic way of expansion in the adiabatic approximation is presented in every example.
