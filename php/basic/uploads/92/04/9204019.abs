Title: An alternative approach to KP hierarchy in matrix models
Authors: L. Bonora and C. S. Xiong
Abstract: We show that there exists an alternative procedure in order to extract differential hierarchies, such as the KdV hierarchy, from one--matrix models, without taking a continuum limit. To prove this we introduce the Toda lattice and reformulate it in operator form. We then consider the reduction to the systems appropriate for one--matrix model.
