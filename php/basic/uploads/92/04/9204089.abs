Title: Paragrassmann Analysis and Quantum Groups
Authors: A. T. Filippov and A. P. Isaev and A. B. Kurdikov
Abstract: Paragrassmann algebras with one and many paragrassmann variables are considered from the algebraic point of view without using the Green ansatz. Operators of differentiation with respect to paragrassmann variables and a covariant para-super-derivative are introduced giving a natural generalization of the Grassmann calculus to a paragrassmann one. Deep relations between paragrassmann algebras and quantum groups with deformation parameters being roots of unity are established.
