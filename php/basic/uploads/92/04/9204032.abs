Title: On the Stability of a Stringy Black Hole
Authors: A. Carlini and F. Fucito and M. Martellini
Abstract: We study the stability under perturbations of a charged four dimensional stringy black hole arising from gauging a previously studied WZW model. We find that the black hole is stable only in the extremal case $Q=M$.
