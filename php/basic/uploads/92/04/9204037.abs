Authors: S. Stieberger and D. Jungnickel and J. Lauer and M. Spalinski
Abstract: The three point correlation functions with twist fields are determined for bosonic $Z_N$ orbifolds. Both the choice of the modular background (compatible with the twist) and of the (higher) twisted sectors involved are fully general. We point out a necessary restriction on the set of instantons contributing to twist field correlation functions not obtained in previous calculations. Our results show that the theory is target space duality invariant.
