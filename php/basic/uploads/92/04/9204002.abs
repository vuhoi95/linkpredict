Title: Classical and Quantum Considerations of Two-dimensional Gravity
Authors: T. T. Burwick and A. H. Chamseddine
Abstract: The two-dimensional theory of gravity describing a graviton-dilaton system is considered. The graviton-dilaton coupling can be fixed such that the quantum theory remains free of the conformal anomaly for any conformal dimension of the coupled matter system, even if the dilaton does not appear as Lagrange multiplier. Interaction terms are introduced and the system is analyzed and solutions are given at the classical level and at the quantum level by using canonical quantization.
