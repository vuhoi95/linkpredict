Title: Scattering of Open and Closed Strings in 1+1 Dimensions
Authors: M. Bershadsky and D. Kutasov
Abstract: The ground ring structure of 1+1 dimensional string theory leads to an infinite set of non linear recursion relations among the `bulk' scattering amplitudes of open and closed tachyons on the disk, which fix them uniquely. The relations are generated by the action of the ring on the tachyon modules; associativity of this action determines all structure constants. This algebraic structure may allow one to relate the continuum picture to a matrix model.
