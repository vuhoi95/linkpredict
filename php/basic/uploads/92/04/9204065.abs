Title: Field-Antifield formalism for Anomalous Gauge Theories
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Jordi Par√≠s
Abstract: An extension of the Field-Antifield formalism to treat anomalous gauge theories with a closed, irreducible classical gauge algebra is proposed. Introducing extra degrees of freedom, we construct the gauge transformations for these new fields, the Wess-Zumino term and the corresponding measure.
