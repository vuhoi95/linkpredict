Title: BRST-Fixed Points and Topological Conformal Symmetry
Authors: Toshio Nakatsu and Yuji Sugawara
Abstract: We study the twisted version of the supersymmetric $G/T=SU(n)/U(1)^{\otimes(n-1)} gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. By studying its fixed points under BRST transformation this model is shown to be reduced to a simple topological field theory, that is, the topological matter system in the K.Li's theory of 2 dimensional gravity for the case of $n=2$, and its generalization for $n \geq 3$.
