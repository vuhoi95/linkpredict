Title: Lattice Analogues of $N=2$ Superconformal Models via Quantum Group  Truncation
Authors: Z. Maassarani and D. Nemeschansky and N. P. Warner
Abstract: We obtain lattice models whose continuum limits correspond to $N=2$ superconformal coset models. This is done by taking the well known vertex model whose continuum limit is the $G \times G/G$ conformal field theory, and twisting the transfer matrix and modifying the quantum group truncation. We find that the natural order parameters of the new models are precisely the chiral primary fields. The integrable perturbations of the conformal field theory limit also have natural counterparts in the lattice formulation, and these can be incorporated into an affine quantum group structure. The topological, twisted $N=2$ superconformal models also have lattice analogues, and these emerge as an intermediate part of our analysis.
