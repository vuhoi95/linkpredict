Title: "Peireles Substitution" and Chern-Simons Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Roman Jackiw
Abstract: An elementary derivation is given for the ``Peierles substitution'' used in projecting dynamics in a strong magnetic field onto the lowest Landau level. The projection of wavefunctions and the ordering prescription for the projected Hamiltonian is explained.
