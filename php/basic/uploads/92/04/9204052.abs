Title: Correlation functions from two-dimensional string Ward identities
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Andrea Pasquinucci
Abstract: We rederive the $w_\infty$ Ward identities, starting from the existence of trivial linearized gauge invariances, and using the method of canceled propagators in the operator formalism. Recursion relations for certain classes of correlation functions are derived, and these correlation function are calculated exactly. We clarify the relation of these results with another derivation of the Ward identities, which relies directly on charge conservation. We also emphasize the importance of the kinematics of canceled propagators in ensuring that the Ward identities are non-trivial. Finally, we sketch an extension of Ward identities to open strings.
