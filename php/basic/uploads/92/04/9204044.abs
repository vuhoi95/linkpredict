Title: Perturbation Theory for Antisymmetric Tensor Fields in Four Dimensions
Authors: Nicola Maggiore and Silvio P. Sorella
Abstract: Perturbation theory for a class of topological field theories containing antisymmetric tensor fields is considered. These models are characterized by a supersymmetric structure which allows to establish their perturbative finiteness.
