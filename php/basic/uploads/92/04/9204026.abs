Title: Dilaton Gravity and No-Hair Theorem in Two Dimensions
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Chiara Nappi
Abstract: We study a general class of two-dimensional theories of the dilaton-gravity type inspired by string theory and show that they admit charged multiple-horizon black holes. These solutions are proved to satisfy scalar no-hair theorems.
