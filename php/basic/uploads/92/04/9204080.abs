Title: Scattering in Soliton Models and the Bosonic Exchange description
Authors: Claudio Coriano' and Rajesh R. Parwani and Hidenaga Yamagishi and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We argue that the description of meson-nucleon dynamics based on the boson-exchange approach, is compatible with the description of the nucleon as a soliton in the nonrelativistic limit. Our arguments are based on an analysis of the meson-soliton form factor and the exact meson-soliton and soliton-soliton scattering amplitudes in the Sine-Gordon model.
