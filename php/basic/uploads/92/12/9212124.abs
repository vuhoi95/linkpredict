Title: Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Spin Chains
Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We review how to obtain the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ring in an external magnetic field. We review how to solve these equations for low temperature and small field, and calculate the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.
