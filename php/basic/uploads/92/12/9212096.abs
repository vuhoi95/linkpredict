Title: Spectral Zeta Functions for Spherical Aharonov-Bohm Quantum Bags
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. Leseduarte and A. Romeo
Abstract: We study the sum $\ds\zeta_H(s)=\sum_j E_j^{-s}$ over the eigenvalues $E_j$ of the Schrdinger equation in a spherical domain with Dirichlet walls, threaded by a line of magnetic flux. Rather than using Green's function techniques, we tackle the mathematically nontrivial problem of finding exact sum rules for the zeros of Bessel functions $J_{\nu}$, which are extremely helpful when seeking numerical approximations to ground state energies. These results are particularly valuable if $\nu$ is neither an integer nor half an odd one.
