Title: Conformal dynamics of quantum gravity with torsion
Authors: I. Antoniadis and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The trace anomaly induced dynamics of the conformal factor is investigated in four-dimensional quantum gravity with torsion. The constraints for the coupling constants of torsion matter interaction are obtained in the infrared stable fixed point of the effective scalar theory.
