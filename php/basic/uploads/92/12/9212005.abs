Title: Linearisation of Universal Field Equations
Authors: David B. Fairlie and Jan Govaerts
Abstract: The Universal Field Equations, recently constructed as examples of higher dimensional dynamical systems which admit an infinity of inequivalent Lagrangians are shown to be linearised by a Legendre transformation. This establishes the conjecture that these equations describe integrable systems. While this construction is implicit in general, there exists a large class of solutions for which an explicit form may be written.
