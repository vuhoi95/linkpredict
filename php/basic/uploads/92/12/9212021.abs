Title: Test of Conformal Invariance in One-Dimensional Quantum Liquid with  Long-Range Interaction
Authors: Rudolf A. RÃ¶mer and Bill Sutherland
Abstract: We numerically study the momentum distribution of one-dimensional Bose and Fermi systems with long-range interaction $g/r^2$ for the ``special'' values $g= -\frac{1}{2}, 0, 4$, singled out by random matrix theory. The critical exponents are shown to be independent of density and in excellent agreement with estimates obtained from $c=1$ conformal finite-size scaling analysis.
