Title: Mean Field Approach to the Giant Wormhole Problem
Authors: A. Gamba and I. Kolokolov and M. Martellini
Abstract: We introduce a gaussian probability density for the space-time distribution of wormholes, thus taking effectively into account wormhole interaction. Using a mean-field approximation for the free energy, we show that giant wormholes are probabilistically suppressed in a homogenous isotropic ``large'' universe.
