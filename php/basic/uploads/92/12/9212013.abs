Title: Finite-Size Effects in the Interface of 3D Ising Model
Authors: M. Caselle and F. Gliozzi and S. Vinti
Abstract: The interface between domains of opposite magnetization in the 3D Ising model near the critical temperature displays universal finite-size effects which can be described in terms of a gaussian model of capillary waves. It turns out that these finite-size corrections depend rather strongly on the shape of the lattice. This prediction, which has no adjustable parameters, is tested and accurately verified for various lattice shapes by means of numerical simulations with a cluster algorithm. This supports also a long-standing conjecture on the finite-size effects in Wilson loops of Lattice Gauge Theories.
