Title: Determinants of Laplacians, the Ray-Singer Torsion on Lens Spaces and  the Riemann zeta function
Authors: Charles Nash and Denjoe O' Connor
Abstract: We obtain explicit expressions for the determinants of the Laplacians on zero and one forms for an infinite class of three dimensional lens spaces $L(p,q)$. These expressions can be combined to obtain the Ray-Singer torsion of these lens spaces. As a consequence we obtain an infinite class of formulae for the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(3)$. The value of these determinants (and the torsion) grows as the size of the fundamental group of the lens space increases and this is also computed. The triviality of the torsion for just the three lens spaces $L(6,1)$, $L(10,3)$ and $L(12,5)$ is also noted. (postscript figures available as a compressed tar file)
