Title: The Crumpling Transition Revisited
Authors: M. Baig and D. Espriu
Abstract: The ``crumpling" transition, between rigid and crumpled surfaces, has been object of much discussion over the past years. The common lore is that such transition should be of second order. However, some lattice versions of the rigidity term on fixed connectivity surfaces seem to suggest that the transition is of higher order instead. While some models exhibit what appear to be lattice artifacts, others are really indistiguishable from models where second order transitions have been reported and yet appear to have third order transitions.
