Title: Lattice Topological Field Theory in Two Dimensions
Authors: M. Fukuma and S. Hosono and H. Kawai
Abstract: The lattice definition of a two-dimensional topological field theory (TFT) is given generically, and the exact solution is obtained explicitly. In particular, the set of all lattice topological field theories is shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all associative algebras $R$, and the physical Hilbert space is identified with the center $Z(R)$ of the associative algebra $R$. Perturbations of TFT's are also considered in this approach, showing that the form of topological perturbations is automatically determined, and that all TFT's are obtained from one TFT by such perturbations. Several examples are presented, including twisted $N=2$ minimal topological matter and the case where $R$ is a group ring.
