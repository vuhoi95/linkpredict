Title: On the SO(N) symmetry of the chiral SU(N) Yang--Mills model
Authors: S. A. Frolov and A. A. Slavnov and C. Sochichiu
Abstract: The posibility of quantizing the anomalous $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills model preserving the symmetry under the orthogonal subgroup is indicated. The corresponding Wess--Zumino action (1-cocycle) possesses the additional $SO(N)$ symmetry and can be expressed in terms of chiral fields taking values in the homogeneous space $SU(N)/SO(N)$. The modified anomaly and the constraints commutator (2-cocycle) are calculated.
