Title: The 3d Ising Model represented as Random Surfaces
Authors: J. Ambjorn and A Sedrakyan and G. Thorleifsson
Abstract: We consider a random surface representation of the three-dimensional Ising model.The model exhibit scaling behaviour and a new critical index $\k$ which relates $\g_{string}$ for the bosonic string to the exponent $\a$ of the specific heat of the 3d Ising model is introduced. We try to determine $\k$ by numerical simulations.
