Title: Renormalization of Crumpled Manifolds
Authors: F. David and B. Duplantier and E. Guitter
Abstract: We consider a model of D-dimensional tethered manifold interacting by excluded volume in R^d with a single point. By use of intrinsic distance geometry, we first provide a rigorous definition of the analytic continuation of its perturbative expansion for arbitrary D, 0 < D < 2. We then construct explicitly a renormalization operation, ensuring renormalizability to all orders. This is the first example of mathematical construction and renormalization for an interacting extended object with continuous internal dimension, encompassing field theory.
