Title: General treatment of anomalies in (1,0) and (1,1) two-dimensional  super-gravity
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the interplay among (~super-~)coordinate, Weyl and \l\ anomaly both in chiral and non-chiral super-gravity represented by $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ two-dimensional models. It is shown that for this purpose two regularization dependent parameters are needed in the effective action. We discuss in {\it full generality} the regularization ambiguities of the induced effective action and recover the corresponding general form of the anomalous Ward Identities. Finally, we explain the difference between chiral and non-chiral super-gravity models in terms of the free parameters and establish relation between these two models by projecting $(1,1)$ into $(1,0)$ super-symmetry.
