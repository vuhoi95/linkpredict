Title: Chern-Simons Theory and the Quark-Gluon Plasma
Authors: Ravit Efraty and V. P. Nair
Abstract: The generating functional for hard thermal loops in QCD is important in setting up a resummed perturbation theory, so that all terms of a given order in the coupling constant can be consistently taken into account. It is also the functional which leads to a gauge invariant description of Debye screening and plasma waves in the quark-gluon plasma. We have recently shown that this functional is closely related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge theory. In this paper, this relationship is explored and explained in more detail, along with some generalizations.
