Title: The Kazakov-Migdal Model as a High Temperature Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: M. Caselle and A. D'Adda and S. Panzeri
Abstract: We show that the Kazakov-Migdal (K-M) induced gauge model in $d$ dimensions describes the high temperature limit of ordinary lattice gauge theories in $d+1$ dimensions. The matter fields are related to the Polyakov loops, while the spatial gauge variables become the gauge fields of the K-M model. This interpretation of the K-M model is in agreement with some recent results in high temperature lattice QCD.
