Title: A Generating Function for Fatgraphs
Authors: P. Di Francesco and C. Itzykson
Abstract: We study a generating function for the sum over fatgraphs with specified valences of vertices and faces, inversely weighted by the order of their symmetry group. A compact expression is found for general (i.e. non necessarily connected) fatgraphs. This expression admits a matrix integral representation which enables to perform semi--classical computations, leading in particular to a closed formula corresponding to (genus zero, connected) trees.
