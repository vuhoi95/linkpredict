Title: Spectra of Conformal Turbulence
Authors: Gregory Falkovich and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: A set of different conformal solutions corresponding to a constant flux of squared vorticity is considered. Requiring constant fluxes of all inviscid vorticity invariants (higher powers of the vorticity), we come to the conclusion that the general turbulence spectrum should be given by Kraichnan's expression $E(k)\propto k\sp{-3}$. This spectrum, in particular, can be obtained as a limit of some subsequences of the conformal solutions.
