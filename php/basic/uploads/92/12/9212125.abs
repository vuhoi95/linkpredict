Abstract: We formulate the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations for the closed (periodic boundary conditions) $A^{(2)}_2$ quantum spin chain in an external magnetic field, in the (noncritical) regime where the anisotropy parameter $\eta$ is real. In the limit $\eta \to 0$, we recover the TBA equations of the antiferromagnetic su(3)-invariant chain in the fundamental representation. We solve these equations for low temperature and small field, and calculate the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.
