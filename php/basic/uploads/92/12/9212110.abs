Title: Three Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory as a Theory of Knots and Links III  : Compact Semi-simple Group
Authors: P. Rama Devi and T. R. Govindarajan and R. K. Kaul
Abstract: Chern-Simons field theory based on a compact non-abelian gauge group is studied as a theory of knots and links in three dimensions. A method to obtain the invariants for links made from braids of upto four strands is developed. This generalizes our earlier work on $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory.
