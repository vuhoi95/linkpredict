Title: The Quantum Deformed Dirac Equation from the k-Poincare` Algebra
Authors: Anatol Nowicki and Emanuele Sorace and Marco Tarlini
Abstract: In this letter we derive a deformed Dirac equation invariant under the k-Poincare` quantum algebra. A peculiar feature is that the square of the k-Dirac operator is related to the second Casimir (the k-deformed squared Pauli-Lubanski vector). The ``spinorial'' realization of the k-Poincare` is obtained by a contraction of the coproduct of the real form of SO_q(3,2) using the 4-dimensional representation which results to be, up some scalar factors, the same of the undeformed algebra in terms of the usual gamma matrices.
