Title: 12j-symbols and four-dimensional quantum gravity
Authors: Mauro Carfora and Maurizio Martellini and Annalisa Marzuoli
Abstract: We propose a model which represents a four-dimensional version of Ponzano and Regge's three-dimensional euclidean quantum gravity. In particular we show that the exponential of the euclidean Einstein-Regge action for a $4d$-discretized block is given, in the semiclassical limit, by a gaussian integral of a suitable $12j$-symbol. Possible developments of this result are discussed.
