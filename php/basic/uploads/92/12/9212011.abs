Abstract: We examine some properties of the filled Wilson loop observables in the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD. We show that they have a natural interpretation in a modification of the original model in which the $Z_N$ gauge symmetry is broken explicitly by a Wilson kinetic term for the gauge fields. We argue that there are two large N limits of this theory, one leads to ordinary Wilson lattice gauge theory coupled to a dynamical scalar field and the other leads to a version of the Kazakov-Migdal model in which the large N solution found by Migdal can still be used. We discuss the properties of the string theory which emerges.
