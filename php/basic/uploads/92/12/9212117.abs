Title: The Interacting $W_3$ String
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and S. Schrans and X. J. Wang
Abstract: We present a procedure for computing gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes in the $W_3$ string, and use it to calculate three-point and four-point functions. We show that non-vanishing scattering amplitudes necessarily involve external physical states with excitations of ghosts as well as matter fields. The crossing properties of the four-point functions are studied, and it is shown that the duality of the Virasoro string amplitudes generalises in the $W_3$ string, with different sets of intermediate states being exchanged in different channels. We also exhibit a relation between the scattering amplitudes of the $W_3$ string and the fusion rules of the Ising model.
