Title: The Polyakov action on the supertorus
Authors: Jean-Pierre Ader and Hamid Kachkachi
Abstract: A consistent method for obtaining a well-defined Polyakov action on the supertorus is presented. This method uses the covariantization of derivative operators and enables us to construct a Polyakov action which is globally defined.
