Title: Stringy Sphalerons and Non-Abelian Black Holes
Authors: E. E. Donets and D. V. Gal'Tsov
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat particle-like and black hole solutions are constructed within the SU(2) sector of 4-dimensional heterotic string effective action. They separate topologically distinct Yang-Mills vacua and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Mills spha- lerons and non-abelian black holes discussed recently. New solutions possess quantized values of the dilaton charge.
