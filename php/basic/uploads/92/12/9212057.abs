Title: CPT Violation in String-Modified Quantum Mechanics and the Neutral Kaon  System
Authors: J. Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We show that $CPT$ is in general violated in a non-quantum-mechanical way in the effective low-energy theory derived from string theory, as a result of apparent world-sheet charge non-conservation induced by stringy monopoles corresponding to target-space black hole configurations. This modification of quantum mechanics does not violate energy conservation. The magnitude of this effective spontaneous violation of $CPT$ may not be be far from the present experimental sensitivity in the neutral kaon system. We demonstrate that our previously proposed stringy modifications to the quantum-mechanical description of the neutral kaon system violate $CPT$, although in a different way from that assumed in phenomenological analyses within conventional quantum mechanics. We constrain the novel $CPT$-violating parameters using available data on $K_L \rightarrow 2\pi$, $K_S \rightarrow 3\pi ^0$ and semileptonic $K_{L,S}$ decay asymmetries. We demonstrate that these data and an approximate treatment of interference effects in $K \rightarrow 2\pi $ decays are consistent with a {\it non-vanishing} amount of $CPT$ violation at a level accessible to a new round of experiments, and further data and/or analysis are required to exclude the extreme possibility that they dominate over $CP$ violation. Could non-quantum-field theoretical and non-quantum-mechanical $CPT$ violation usher in the long-awaited era of string phenomenology?}
