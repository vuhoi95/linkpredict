Title: Challenges for Superstring Cosmology
Authors: Ram Brustein and Paul Steinhardt
Abstract: We consider whether current notions about superstring theory below the Planck scale are compatible with cosmology. We find that the anticipated form for the dilaton interaction creates a serious roadblock for inflation and makes it unlikely that the universe ever reaches a state with zero cosmological constant and time-independent gravitational constant.
