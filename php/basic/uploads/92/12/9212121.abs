Title: Physical nonlinear aspects of classical and quantum q-oscillators
Authors: V. I. Man'ko G. Marmo and S. Solimeno and F. Zaccaria
Abstract: The classical limit of quantum q-oscillators suggests an interpretation of the deformation as a way to introduce non linearity. Guided by this idea, we considered q-fields, the partition fumction, and compute a consequence on specific heat and second order correlation function of the q-oscillator which may serve for experimental checks for the non linearity.
