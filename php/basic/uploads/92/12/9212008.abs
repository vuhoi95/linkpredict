Title: Extending the Barnes-Rivers Operators to D=3 Topological Gravity
Authors: C. Pinheiro and G. O. Pires
Abstract: The spin-projector operators for symmetric rank-2 tensors are reassessed in connection with the issue of topologically massive gravity. The original proposal by Barnes and Rivers is generalised to account for D-dimensional Einstein gravity and 3-dimensional Chern-Simons massive gravitation.
