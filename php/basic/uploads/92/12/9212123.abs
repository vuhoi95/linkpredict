Title: On a Solitonic Specialisation for the General Solutions of Some  Two-Dimensional Completely Integrable Systems
Authors: David I. Olive and Mikhail V. Saveliev and Jonathan W. R. Underwood
Abstract: Following a prescription of \cite{4} for a solitonic specialization of the general solutions to the (abelian) periodic Toda field theories, we discuss a construction of the soliton solutions for a wide class of two-dimensional completely integrable systems arising in the framework of the group-algebraic approach, including the \lq\lq non-abelian" version of the affine Toda theory.
