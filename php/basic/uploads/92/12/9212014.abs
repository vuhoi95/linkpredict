Title: Monte Carlo Simulations of 2-Dimensional Quantum Gravity Coupled to $c =  1$ Matter
Authors: T. Filk and M. Marcu and B. Scheffold
Abstract: We present results of a high precision Monte Carlo simulation of dynamically triangulated random surfaces (up to $\approx$ 34,000 triangles) coupled to one scalar field ($c=1$). The mean square extent has been measured for different actions to test the universality of the leading term as a function of the size of the surfaces. Furthermore, the integrated 2-point correlation function for vertex operators is compared with conformal field theory and matrix model predictions.
