Title: One Loop Counterterms in 2D Dilaton-Maxwell Quantum Gravity
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. Naftulin and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The renormalization structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity is investigated, in a covariant gauge. One-loop divergences of the effective action are calculated. All the surface divergent terms are taken into account, thus completing previous one-loop calculations of the theory. It is shown that the on-shell effective action contains only surface divergences. The off-shell renormalizability of the theory is discussed and classes of renormalizable dilaton and Maxwell potentials are found.
