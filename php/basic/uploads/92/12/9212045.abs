Title: Superstring Threshold Corrections to Yukawa Couplings
Authors: I. Antoniadis and E. Gava and K. S. Narain and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: A general method of computing string corrections to the K\"ahler metric and Yukawa couplings is developed at the one-loop level for a general compactification of the heterotic superstring theory. It also provides a direct determination of the so-called Green-Schwarz term. The matter metric has an infrared divergent part which reproduces the field-theoretical anomalous dimensions, and a moduli-dependent part which gives rise to threshold corrections in the physical Yukawa couplings. Explicit expressions are derived for symmetric orbifold compactifications.
