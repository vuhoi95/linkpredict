Title: Magnetically Charged Black Holes and their Stability
Authors: Peter C. Aichelburg and Piotr Bizon
Abstract: We study magnetically charged black holes in the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in the limit of infinitely strong coupling of the Higgs field. Using mixed analytical and numerical methods we give a complete description of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions, both abelian and nonabelian. In particular, we find a new class of extremal nonabelian solutions. We show that all nonabelian solutions are stable against linear radial perturbations. The implications of our results for the semiclassical evolution of magnetically charged black holes are discussed.
