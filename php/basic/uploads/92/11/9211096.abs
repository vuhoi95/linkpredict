Title: On possible generalizations of field--antifield formalism
Authors: I. A. Batalin and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: A generalized version is proposed for the field-antifield formalism. The antibracket operation is defined in arbitrary field-antifield coordinates. The antisymplectic definitions are given for first- and second-class constraints. In the case of second-class constraints the Dirac's antibracket operation is defined. The quantum master equation as well as the hypergauge fixing procedure are formulated in a coordinate-invariant way. The general hypergauge functions are shown to be antisymplectic first-class constraints whose Jacobian matrix determinant is constant on the constraint surface. The BRST-type generalized transformations are defined and the functional integral is shown to be independent of the hypergauge variations admitted. In the case of reduced phase space the Dirac's antibrackets are used instead of the ordinary ones.
