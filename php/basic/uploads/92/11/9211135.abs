Title: Quantum Gravity and Black Hole Dynamics in 1+1 Dimensions
Authors: K. Hamada and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: We study the quantum theory of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity, which is an interesting toy model of the black hole dynamics. The functional measures are explicitly evaluated and the physical state conditions corresponding to the Hamiltonian and the momentum constraints are derived. It is pointed out that the constraints form the Virasoro algebra without central charge. In ADM formalism the measures are very ambiguous, but in our formalism they are explicitly defined. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM formalism come out. A singularity appears at $\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $, where $\kappa =(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number of matter fields. Behind the singularity the quantum mechanical region $\kappa > \df^2 >0 $ extends, where the sign of the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian constraint changes. If $\kappa <0 $, the singularity disappears. We discuss the quantum dynamics of black hole and then give a suggestion for the resolution of the information loss paradox. We also argue the quantization of the spherically symmetric gravitational system in 3+1 dimensions. In appendix the differences between the other quantum dilaton gravities and ours are clarified and our status is stressed.
