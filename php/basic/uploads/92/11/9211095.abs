Title: Dilaton Quantum Cosmology in Two Dimensions
Authors: F. D. Mazzitelli and J. G. Russo
Abstract: We consider a renormalizable two-dimensional model of dilaton gravity coupled to a set of conformal fields as a toy model for quantum cosmology. We discuss the cosmological solutions of the model and study the effect of including the backreaction due to quantum corrections. As a result, when the matter density is below some threshold new singularities form in a weak coupling region, which suggests that they will not be removed in the full quantum theory. We also solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Depending on the quantum state of the Universe, the singularities may appear in a quantum region where the wave function is not oscillatory, i.e., when there is not a well defined notion of classical spacetime.
