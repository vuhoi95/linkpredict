Title: Fusion and the Neveu-Schwarz Singular Vectors
Authors: L. Benoit and Y. Saint-Aubin
Abstract: Bauer, Di Francesco, Itzykson and Zuber proposed recently an algorithm to construct all singular vectors of the Virasoro algebra. It is based on the decoupling of (already known) singular fields in the fusion process. We show how to extend their algorithm to the Neveu-Schwarz superalgebra.
