Title: Canonical Quantization of Non-Einsteinian Gravity and the Problem of  Time
Authors: Peter Schaller and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: For a 1+1 dimensional theory of gravity with torsion different approaches to the formulation of a quantum theory are presented. They are shown to lead to the same finite dimensional quantum system. Conceptual questions of quantum gravity like e.g.\ the problem of time are discussed in this framework.
