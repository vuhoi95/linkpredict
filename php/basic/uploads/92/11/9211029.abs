Title: Operator Formulation of q-Deformed Dual String Model
Authors: M. Chaichian and J. F. Gomes and P. Kulish
Abstract: We present an operator formulation of the q-deformed dual string model amplitude using an infinite set of q-harmonic oscillators. The formalism attains the crossing symmetry and factorization and allows to express the general n-point function as a factorized product of vertices and propagators.
