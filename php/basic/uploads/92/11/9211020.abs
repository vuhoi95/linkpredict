Title: Hamiltonian Approach to $2D$ Supergravity
Authors: J. Gamboa and C. Ramirez
Abstract: We study $2D$ supergravity in a covariant and gauge independent way. The theory is obtained from $2D$ bosonic gravity following the square root method and the diffeomorphism superalgebra is explicitly computed. We argue that our approach could be a procedure for introducing nontrivial physics in quantum $2D$ (super)gravity.
