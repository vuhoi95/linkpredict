Title: Dilogarithm Identities in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: W. Nahm and A. Recknagel and M. Terhoeven
Abstract: Dilogarithm identities for the central charges and conformal dimensions exist for at least large classes of rational conformally invariant quantum field theories in two dimensions. In many cases, proofs are not yet known but the numerical and structural evidence is convincing. In particular, close relations exist to fusion rules and partition identities. We describe some examples and ideas, and present some conjectures useful for the classification of conformal theories. The mathematical structures seem to be dual to Thurston's program for the classification of 3-manifolds.
