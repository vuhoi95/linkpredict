Title: Discretization of the Superparticle Path Integral
Authors: J. Grundberg and U. Lindstrom and H. Nordstrom
Abstract: Requiring that the path integral has the global symmetries of the classical action and obeys the natural composition property of path integrals, and also that the discretized action has the correct naive continuum limit, we find a viable discretization of the (D=3,N=2) superparticle action.
