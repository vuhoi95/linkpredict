Title: A brief history of hidden quantum symmetries in Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Cesar Gomez and German Sierra
Abstract: We review briefly a stream of ideas concerning the role of quantum groups as hidden symmetries in conformal field theories, paying particular attention to the field theoretical representations of quantum groups based on Coulomb gas methods. An extensive bibliography is also included.
