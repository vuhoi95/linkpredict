Title: Wormholes and symmetries of string effective action
Authors: S. Pratik Khastgir and Jnanadeva Maharana
Abstract: The dimensional reduction technique is adopted to derive string effective action. Wormhole solutions corresponding to space-time geometries $R^1\times S^1\times S^2$ and $R^1\times S^3$ are presented. The duality and SL(2,R) symmetries are implemented to generate new wormhole solutions.
