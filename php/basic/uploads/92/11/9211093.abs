Title: GLq(N)-Covariant Quantum Algebras and Covariant Differential Calculus
Authors: A. P. Isaev and P. N. Pyatov
Abstract: We consider GLq(N)-covariant quantum algebras with generators satisfying quadratic polynomial relations. We show that, up to some inessential arbitrariness, there are only two kinds of such quantum algebras, namely, the algebras with q-deformed commutation and q-deformed anticommutation relations. The connection with the bicovariant differential calculus on the linear quantum groups is disscussed.
