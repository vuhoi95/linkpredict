Title: Conformal Symmetry and Universal Properties of Quantum Hall States
Authors: A. Cappelli and G. V. Dunne and C. A. Trugenberger and G. R. Zemba
Abstract: The low-lying excitations of a quantum Hall state on a disk geometry are edge excitations. Their dynamics is governed by a conformal field theory on the cylinder defined by the disk boundary and the time variable. We give a simple and detailed derivation of this conformal field theory for integer filling, starting from the microscopic dynamics of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-relativistic electrons in Landau levels. This construction can be generalized to describe Laughlin's fractional Hall states via chiral bosonization, thereby making contact with the effective Chern-Simons theory approach. The conformal field theory dictates the finite-size effects in the energy spectrum. An experimental or numerical verification of these universal effects would provide a further confirmation of Laughlin's theory of incompressible quantum fluids.
