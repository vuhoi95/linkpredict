Title: On Classification of N=2 Supersymmetric Theories, (e-mail uncorrupted  version)
Authors: S. Cecotti and C. Vafa
Abstract: We find a relation between the spectrum of solitons of massive $N=2$ quantum field theories in $d=2$ and the scaling dimensions of chiral fields at the conformal point. The condition that the scaling dimensions be real imposes restrictions on the soliton numbers and leads to a classification program for symmetric $N=2$ conformal theories and their massive deformations in terms of a suitable generalization of Dynkin diagrams (which coincides with the A--D--E Dynkin diagrams for minimal models). The Landau-Ginzburg theories are a proper subset of this classification. In the particular case of LG theories we relate the soliton numbers with intersection of vanishing cycles of the corresponding singularity; the relation between soliton numbers and the scaling dimensions in this particular case is a well known application of Picard-Lefschetz theory.
