Title: Fusion potentials I
Authors: P. Di Francesco and J. -B. Zuber
Abstract: We reconsider the conjecture by Gepner that the fusion ring of a rational conformal field theory is isomorphic to a ring of polynomials in $n$ variables quotiented by an ideal of constraints that derive from a potential. We show that in a variety of cases, this is indeed true with {\it one-variable} polynomials.
