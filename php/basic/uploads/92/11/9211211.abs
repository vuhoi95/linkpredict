Title: Self-consistent Improvement of the Finite Temperature Effective  Potential
Authors: G. Amelino-Camelia and S. -Y. Pi
Abstract: We present a self-consistent calculation of the finite temperature effective potential for $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, using the composite operator effective potential in which an infinite series of the leading diagrams is summed up. Our calculation establishes the proper form of the leading correction to the perturbative one-loop effective potential.
