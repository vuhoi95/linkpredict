Title: The Non-perturbative Canonical Quantization of the N=1 Supergravity
Authors: Takashi Sano and Jun'ichi Shiraishi
Abstract: The non-perturbative canonical quantization of the N=1 supergravity with the non-zero cosmological constant is studied using the Ashtekar formalism. A semi-classical wave function is obtained and it has the form of the exponential of the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the Chern-Simons functional. The N=1 supergravity in the Robertson-Walker universe is also examined and some analytic solutions are obtained. (We omit all graphs in the following LaTex file.)
