Title: Line Bundles Over Families of (SUPER) Riemann Surfaces. I: The  Non-Graded Case
Authors: U. Bruzzo and J. A. Dominguez Perez
Abstract: A first step towards a systematic theory of relative line bundles over SUSY-curves is presented. In this paper we deal with the case of relative line bundles over families of ordinary Riemann surfaces. Generalizations of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and of the flatness theorem for line bundles are discussed.
