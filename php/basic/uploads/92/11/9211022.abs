Title: How Do Fermions Behave on a Random Lattice?
Authors: C J Griffin and T D Kieu
Abstract: Comparing random lattice, naive and Wilson fermions in two dimensional abelian background gauge field, we show that the doublers suppressed in the free field case are revived for random lattices in the continuum limit unless gauge interactions are implemented in a non--invariant way.
