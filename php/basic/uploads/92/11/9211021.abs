Title: Dilaton Contributions to the Cosmic Gravitational Wave Background
Authors: M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini
Abstract: We consider the cosmological amplification of a metric perturbation propagating in a higher-dimensional Brans-Dicke background, including a non trivial dilaton evolution. We discuss the properties of the spectral energy density of the produced gravitons (as well as of the associated squeezing parameter), and we show that the present observational bounds on the graviton spectrum provide significant information on the dynamical evolution of the early universe.
