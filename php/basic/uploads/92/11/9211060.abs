Title: On Macroscopic Energy Gap for $q$-Quantum Mechanical Systems
Authors: Ctirad Klimčík and Eliza Klimčík
Abstract: The q-deformed harmonic oscillator within the framework of the recently introduced Schwenk-Wess $q$-Heisenberg algebra is considered. It is shown, that for "physical" values $q\sim1$, the gap between the energy levels decreases with growing energy. Comparing with the other (real) $q$-deformations of the harmonic oscillator, where the gap instead increases, indicates that the formation of the macroscopic energy gap in the Schwenk-Wess $q$-Quantum Mechanics may be avoided.
