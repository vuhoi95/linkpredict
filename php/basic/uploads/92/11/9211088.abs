Abstract: There is a constrained-WZNW--Toda theory for any simple Lie algebra equipped with an integral gradation. It is explained how the different approaches to these dynamical systems are related by gauge transformations. Combining Gauss decompositions in relevent gauges, we unify formulae already derived, and explictly determine the holomorphic expansion of the conformally reduced WZNW solutions - whose restriction gives the solutions of the Toda equations. The same takes place also for semi-integral gradations. Most of our conclusions are also applicable to the affine Toda theories.
