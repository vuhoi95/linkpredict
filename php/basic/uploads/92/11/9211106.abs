Title: Electromagnetic Interaction of Anyons in Non-Relativistic Quantum Field  Theory
Authors: J. L. Cortes and J. Gamboa and L. Velazquez
Abstract: The non-relativistic quantum field theoretic lagrangian which describes an anyon system in the presence of an electromagnetic field is identified. A non-minimal magnetic coupling to the Chern-Simons statistical field as well as to the electromagnetic field together with a direct coupling between between both fields are the non-trivial ingredients of the lagrangian obtained from the non-relativistic limit of the fermionic relativistic formulation. The results, an electromagnetic gyromagnetic ratio 2 for any spin together with a non-trivial dynamical spin dependent contact interaction between anyons as well as the spin dependence of the electromagnetic effective action, agree with the quantum mechanical formulation.
