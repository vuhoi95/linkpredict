Title: Dynamical supersymmetry breaking with a large internal dimension
Authors: I. Antoniadis and C. Muñoz and M. Quirós
Abstract: Supersymmetry breaking in string perturbation theory predicts the existence of a new dimension at the TeV scale. The simplest realization of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model in the context of this mechanism has two important consequences: (i) A natural solution to the $\mu$-problem; (ii) The absence of quadratic divergences in the cosmological constant, which leads to a dynamical determination of the supersymmetry breaking and electroweak scale. We present an explicit example in which the whole particle spectrum is given as a function of the top quark mass. A generic prediction of this mechanism is the existence of Kaluza-Klein excitations for gauge bosons and higgses. In particular the first excitation of the photon could be accessible to future accelerators and give a clear signal of the proposed mechanism.
