Title: Wormhole Cosmology and the Horizon Problem
Authors: David Hochberg and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: We construct an explicit class of dynamic lorentzian wormholes connecting Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetimes. These wormholes can allow two-way transmission of signals between spatially separated regions of spacetime and could permit such regions to come into thermal contact. The cosmology of a network of early Universe wormholes is discussed.
