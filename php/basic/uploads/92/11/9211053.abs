Title: Form Factors for Integrable Lagrangian Field Theories, the Sinh-Gordon  Model
Authors: A. Fring and G. Mussardo and P. Simonetti
Abstract: Using Watson's and the recursive equations satisfied by matrix elements of local operators in two-dimensional integrable models, we compute the form factors of the elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ of Sinh-Gordon theory. Form factors of operators with higher spin or with different asymptotic behaviour can easily be deduced from them. The value of the correlation functions are saturated by the form factors with lowest number of particle terms. This is illustrated by an application of the form factors of the trace of $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ to the sum rule of the $c$-theorem.
