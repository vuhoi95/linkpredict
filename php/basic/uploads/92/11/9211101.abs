Title: Î´-expansion and self-consistent calculation
Authors: Paulo F. Bedaque and Ashok Das
Abstract: We compare results from $\delta$--expansion, in simple theories, with self--consistent calculations as well as calculations involving the principle of minimal sensitivity. We show that the latter methods give relatively more accurate results order by order.
