Title: Nonperturbative Conditions for Local Weyl Invariance on a Curved World  Sheet
Authors: Jens Schnittger and Ulrich Ellwanger
Abstract: We investigate Weyl anomalies on a curved world sheet to second order in a weak field expansion. Using a local version of the exact renormalization group equations, we obtain nonperturbative results for the tachyon/graviton/dilaton system. We discuss the elimination of redundant operators, which play a crucial role for the emergence of target space covariance. Performing the operator product expansion on a curved world sheet allows us to obtain the nonperturbative contributions to the dilaton $\beta$ function. We find the $\beta$ functions, after suitable field redefinitions, to be related to a target space effective action through a $\kappa$ function involving derivatives. Also we can establish a nonperturbative Curci-Paffuti relation including the tachyon $\beta$ function.
