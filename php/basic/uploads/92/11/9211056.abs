Title: Magnetic Monopoles in String Theory
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Jeffrey A. Harvey and James T. Liu
Abstract: Magnetic monopole solutions to heterotic string theory are discussed in toroidal compactifications to four spacetime dimensions. Particular emphasis is placed on the relation to previously studied fivebrane solutions in ten dimensions and on the possibility of constructing exact monopole solutions related to symmetric fivebranes.
