Title: The Algebra of Differential Operators on the Circle and $\Wkpq$
Authors: J. M. Figueroa-O'Farrill and E. Ramos
Abstract: Radul has recently introduced a map from the Lie algebra of differential operators on the circle to $\W_n$. In this note we extend this map to $\Wkpq$, a recently introduced one-parameter deformation of $\Wkp$---the second hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy. We use this to give a short proof that $\W_\infty$ is the symmetry algebra of additional symmetries of the KP equation. (The replaced version clears up some minor points and corrects some notational glitches. Get this one!)
