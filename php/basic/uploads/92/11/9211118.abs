Title: Low-Energy Dynamics of String Solitons
Authors: Andrew G. Felce and T. M. Samols
Abstract: The dynamics of a class of fivebrane string solitons is considered in the moduli space approximation. The metric on moduli space is found to be flat. This implies that at low energies the solitons do not interact, and their scattering is trivial. The range of validity of the approximation is also briefly discussed.
