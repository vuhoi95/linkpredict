Title: The Phase Structure of Strings with Extrinsic Curvature
Authors: Mark Bowick and Paul Coddington and Leping Han and Geoff Harris and Enzo Marinari
Abstract: We examine a model of non-self-avoiding, fluctuating surfaces as a candidate continuum string theory of surfaces in three dimensions. This model describes Dynamically Triangulated Random Surfaces embedded in three dimensions with an extrinsic curvature dependent action. We analyze, using Monte Carlo simulations, the dramatic crossover behaviour of several observables which characterize the geometry of these surfaces. We then critically discuss whether our observations are indicative of a phase transition.
