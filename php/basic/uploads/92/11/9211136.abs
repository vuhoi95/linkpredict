Authors: F. Belgiorno and A. S. Cattaneo and F. Fucito and M. Martellini
Abstract: The discovery of black-hole evaporation represented in many respects a revolutionary event in scientific world; as such, in giving answers to open questions, it gave rise to new problems part of which are still not resolved. Here we want to make a brief review of such problems and examine some possible solutions.
