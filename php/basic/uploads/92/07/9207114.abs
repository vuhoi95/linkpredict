Title: Smooth Bosonization II: The Massive Case
Authors: P. H. Damgaard and H. B. Nielsen and R. Sollacher
Abstract: The (1+1)-dimensional bosonization relations for fermionic mass terms are derived by choosing a specific gauge in an enlarged gauge-invariant theory containing both fermionic and bosonic fields. The fermionic part of the generating functional subject to the gauge constraint can be cast into the form of a strongly coupled Schwinger model, which can be solved exactly. The resulting bosonic theory coupled to the scalar sources then exhibits directly the bosonic counterparts of the fermionic scalar and pseudoscalar mass densities.
