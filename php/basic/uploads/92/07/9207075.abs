Title: R-matrix Approach to Quantum Superalgebras su_{q}(m|n)
Authors: D. Chang and I. Phillips and Lev Rozansky
Abstract: Quantum superalgebras $su_{q}(m\mid n)$ are studied in the framework of $R$-matrix formalism. Explicit parametrization of $L^{(+)}$ and $L^{(-)}$ matrices in terms of $su_{q}(m\mid n)$ generators are presented. We also show that quantum deformation of nonsimple superalgebra $su(n\mid n)$ requires its extension to $u(n\mid n)$.
