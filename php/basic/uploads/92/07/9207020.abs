Title: Higher Genus Correlators for the Complex Matrix Model
Authors: J. Ambjorn and C. F. Kristjansen and Y. M. Makeenko
Abstract: We describe an iterative scheme which allows us to calculate any multi-loop correlator for the complex matrix model to any genus using only the first in the chain of loop equations. The method works for a completely general potential and the results contain no explicit reference to the couplings. The genus $g$ contribution to the $m$--loop correlator depends on a finite number of parameters, namely at most $4g-2+m$. We find the generating functional explicitly up to genus three. We show as well that the model is equivalent to an external field problem for the complex matrix model with a logarithmic potential.
