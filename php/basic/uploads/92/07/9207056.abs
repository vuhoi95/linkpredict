Title: Einstein manifolds in Ashtekar variables: explicit examples
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Chopin Soo
Abstract: We show that all solutions to the vacuum Einstein field equations may be mapped to instanton configurations of the Ashtekar variables. These solutions are characterized by properties of the moduli space of the instantons. We exhibit explicit forms of these configurations for several well-known solutions, and indicate a systematic way to get new ones. Some interesting examples of these new solutions are described.
