Authors: R. Blumenhagen and W. Eholzer and A. Honecker and R. Huebel
Abstract: In this paper we consider extensions of the super Virasoro algebra by one and two super primary fields. Using a non-explicitly covariant approach we compute all SW-algebras with one generator of dimension up to 7 in addition to the super Virasoro field. In complete analogy to W-algebras with two generators most results can be classified using the representation theory of the super Virasoro algebra. Furthermore, we find that the SW(3/2, 11/2)-algebra can be realized as a subalgebra of SW(3/2, 5/2) at c = 10/7. We also construct some new SW-algebras with three generators, namely SW(3/2, 3/2, 5/2), SW(3/2, 2, 2) and SW(3/2, 2, 5/2).
