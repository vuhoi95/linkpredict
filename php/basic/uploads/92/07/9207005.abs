Title: Space-Time Symmetries of Quantized Tensionless Strings
Authors: J. Isberg and U. Lindstr√∂m and B. Sundborg
Abstract: The tensionless limit of the free bosonic string is space-time conformally symmetric classically. Requiring invariance of the quantum theory in the light cone gauge tests the reparametrization symmetry needed to fix this gauge. The full conformal symmetry gives stronger constraints than the Poincar\'e subalgebra. We find that the symmetry may be preserved in any space-time dimension, but only if the spectrum is drastically reduced (part of this reduction is natural in a zero tension limit of the ordinary string spectrum). The quantum states are required to be symmetric ({\it i.e.} singlets) under space-time diffeomorphisms, except for the centre of mass wave function.
