Title: Duality in Non-Trivially Compactified Heterotic Strings
Authors: M. A. R. Osorio and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We study the implications of duality symmetry on the analyticity properties of the partition function as it depends upon the compactification length. In order to obtain non-trivial compactifications, we give a physical prescription to get the Helmholtz free energy for any heterotic string supersymmetric or not. After proving that the free energy is always invariant under the duality transformation $R\rightarrow \alpha^{'}/(4R)$ and getting the zero temperature theory whose partition function corresponds to the Helmholtz potential, we show that the self-dual point $R_{0}=\sqrt{\alpha^{'}}/2$ is a generic singularity as the Hagedorn one. The main difference between these two critical compactification radii is that the term producing the singularity at the self-dual point is finite for any $R \neq R_{0}$. We see that this behavior at $R_{0}$ actually implies a loss of degrees of freedom below that point.
