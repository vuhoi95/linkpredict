Title: Thermal Reservoir coupled to External Field and Quantum Dissipation
Authors: Fabrizio Illuminati and Marco Patriarca
Abstract: In the framework of the Caldeira-Leggett model of dissipative quantum mechanics, we investigate the effects of the interaction of the thermal reservoir with an external field. In particular, we discuss how the interaction modifies the conservative dynamics of the central particle, and the mechanism of dissipation. We briefly comment on possible observable consequencies.
