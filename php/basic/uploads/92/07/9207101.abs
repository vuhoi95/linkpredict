Title: Quantum sl_n Toda field theories
Authors: L. Bonora and V. Bonservizi
Abstract: We quantize $sl_n$ Toda field theories in a periodic lattice. We find the quantum exchange algebra in the diagonal monodromy (Bloch wave) basis in the case of the defining representation. In the $sl_3$ case we extend the analysis also to the second fundamental representation. We clarify, in particular, the relation of Jimbo and Rosso's quantum $R$ matrix with the quantum $R$ matrix in the Bloch wave basis.
