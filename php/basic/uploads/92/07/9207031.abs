Title: Commuting quantities and exceptional W-algebras
Authors: M. D. Freeman and K. Hornfeck and P. West
Abstract: Sets of commuting charges constructed from the current of a U(1) Kac-Moody algebra are found. There exists a set S_n of such charges for each positive integer n > 1; the corresponding value of the central charge in the Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is c = 13-6n-6/n. The charges in each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional W-algebra.
