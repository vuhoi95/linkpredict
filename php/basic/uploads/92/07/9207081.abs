Title: Quasi-classical limit of KP hierarchy, W-symmetries and free fermions
Authors: Kanehisa Takasaki and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: This paper deals with the dispersionless KP hierarchy from the point of view of quasi-classical limit. Its Lax formalism, W-infinity symmetries and general solutions are shown to be reproduced from their counterparts in the KP hierarchy in the limit of $\hbar \to 0$. Free fermions and bosonized vertex operators play a key role in the description of W-infinity symmetries and general solutions, which is technically very similar to a recent free fermion formalism of $c=1$ matrix models.
