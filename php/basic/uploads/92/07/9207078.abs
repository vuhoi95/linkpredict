Title: BRST cohomology ring in 2D gravity coupled to minimal models
Authors: H. Kanno and M. H. Sarmadi
Abstract: The ring structure of Lian-Zuckerman states for $(q,p)$ minimal models coupled to gravity is shown to be ${\cal R}={\cal R}_0\otimes {\bf C} [w,w^{-1}]$ where ${\cal R}_0$ is the ring of ghost number zero operators generated by two elements and $w$ is an operator of ghost number $-1$. Some examples are discussed in detail. For these models the currents are also discussed and their algebra is shown to contain the Virasoro algebra.
