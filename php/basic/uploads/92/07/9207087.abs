Title: The Gravitational Field of String Matter When the Dilaton is Massive
Authors: M. Fabbrichesi and R. Iengo
Abstract: We study numerically the gravitational field of a star made of massive and neutral string states for the case in which the dilaton is massive. The solution exhibits very simple scaling properties in the dilaton mass. There is no horizon and the singularity is surrounded by a halo (the physical size of which is inversely proportional to the dilaton mass) where the scalar curvature is very large and proportional to the square of the dilaton mass.
