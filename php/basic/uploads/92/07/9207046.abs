Title: One-Loop Renormalization in Two-Dimensional Matter-Dilaton Quantum  Gravity and Charged Black Holes
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The quantum properties of two-dimensional matter-dilaton gravity ---which includes a large family of actions for two-dimensional gravity (in particular, string-inspired models)--- are investigated. The one-loop divergences in linear covariant gauges are calculated and the structure of the one-loop renormalization is studied. The explicit forms of the dilaton potential, dilaton-Maxwell, and dilaton-scalar couplings for which the theory is one-loop multiplicatively renormalizable are found. A comparison with the one-loop renormalization structure of four-dimensional gravity-matter theory is given. Charged multiple-horizon black holes which appear in the model are also considered.
