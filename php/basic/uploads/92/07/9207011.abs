Abstract: We apply the method of coadjoint orbits of \winf-algebra to the problem of non-relativistic fermions in one dimension. This leads to a geometric formulation of the quantum theory in terms of the quantum phase space distribution of the fermi fluid. The action has an infinite series expansion in the string coupling, which to leading order reduces to the previously discussed geometric action for the classical fermi fluid based on the group $w_\infty$ of area-preserving diffeomorphisms. We briefly discuss the strong coupling limit of the string theory which, unlike the weak coupling regime, does not seem to admit of a two dimensional space-time picture. Our methods are equally applicable to interacting fermions in one dimension.
