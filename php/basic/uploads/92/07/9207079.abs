Title: Dilatonic Black Holes, Naked Singularities and Strings
Authors: P. H. Cox and B. Harms and Y. Leblanc
Abstract: We extend a previous calculation which treated Schwarschild black hole horizons as quantum mechanical objects to the case of a charged, dilaton black hole. We show that for a unique value of the dilaton parameter `a', which is determined by the condition of unitarity of the S matrix, black holes transform at the extremal limit into strings.
