Title: Double Scaling Limit of the Supervirasoro Constraints
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and K. Becker and M. Becker and R. Emparan and J. Manes
Abstract: This paper supersedes the preprint Superloop Equations in the Double Scaling Limit, CERN-TH-6575. It is an improved version with corrections in the derivation of the continuum limit, a clarification of the doubling of degrees of freedom for even potentials, and with a heuristic argument showing that the part of the free energy independent of fermion couplings in our model satisfies the KdV Hierarchy.
