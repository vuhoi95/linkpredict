Title: Supersymmetric Black Holes from Toda Theories
Authors: Fran√ßois Delduc and Jean-Loup Gervais and Mikhail Saveliev
Abstract: On the example of nonabelian Toda type theory associated with the Lie superalgebra $osp(2|4)$ we show that this integrable dynamical system is relevant to a black hole background metric in the corresponding target space. In the even sector the model under consideration reduces to the exactly solvable conformal theory (nonabelian $B_2$ Toda system) in the presence of a black hole recently proposed in the article "Black holes from non-abelian Toda theories" by the last two authors (hep-th 9203039).
