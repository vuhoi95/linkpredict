Title: A BRST Operator for non-critical W-Strings
Authors: M. Bershadsky and W. Lerche and D. Nemeschansky and N. P. Warner
Abstract: We construct the BRST operator for non-critical $W_3$-strings and discuss the tachyon-like spectrum. For $N$-punctured spheres with $N \leq 5$ we briefly describe a formal definition of the integral over $W_3$-moduli space.
