Title: A New Solution of the Supersymmetric TJ Model by Means of the Quantum  Inverse Scattering Method
Authors: Fabian H. L. Essler and Vladimir E. Korepin
Abstract: We construct the enveloping fundamental spin model of the t-J hamiltonian using the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method (QISM), and present all three possible Algebraic Bethe Ans\"atze. Two of the solutions have been previously obtained in the framework of Coordinate Space Bethe Ansatz by Sutherland and by Schlottmann and Lai, whereas the third solution is new. The formulation of the model in terms of the QISM enables us to derive explicit expressions for higher conservation laws.
