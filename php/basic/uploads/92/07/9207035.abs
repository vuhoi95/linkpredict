Title: The Phase Diagram of the $N=2$ Kazakov-Migdal Model
Authors: Andreas Gocksch and Yue Shen
Abstract: We have determined the phase diagram of the simplest version of a lattice model introduced in the recent work of Kazakov and Migdal. If $m_0$ and $\lambda$ are the bare mass and self coupling of the scalar field in the model respectively, we find a line of first order phase transitions in the ($m_0, \lambda$) plane ending in a critical point where $\lambda$ is nonzero. Kazakov and Migdal speculate that their model of scalar field theory could induce QCD. Our work indicates that for $N=2$ there is no continuum limit for the Kazakov-Migdal model except at the critical end point. Whether or not a nontrivial continuum limit exists in the vicinity of the critical point requires careful study of the renormalization group properties of the model.
