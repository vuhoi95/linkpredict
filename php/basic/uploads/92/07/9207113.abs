Title: Gravitino one-loop contribution to Planckian Scattering
Authors: A. Bellini and M. Ademollo and M. Ciafaloni
Abstract: Corrections to the semiclassical approximation in nearly forward Planckian energy collisions are here reconsidered. Starting from the one-loop superstring amplitude, we are able to disentangle the first subleading high-energy contribution at large impact parameters, and we thus directly compute the one-loop correction to the superstring eikonal. We finally argue, on the basis of analyticity and unitarity, that gravitinos do not contribute at all to the large distance two-loop ACV correction, which thus acquires a universal ``classical'' interpretation.
