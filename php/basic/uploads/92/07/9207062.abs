Title: A Note on N=2 Superstrings
Authors: J. R. Bienkowska and H. Lu
Abstract: In this note we investigate the generalised critical $N=2$ superstrings in $(1,2p)$ spacetime signature. We calculate the four-point functions for the tachyon operators of these theories. In contrast to the usual $N=2$ superstring in $(2,2)$ spacetime, the four-point functions do not vanish. The exchanged particles of the four-point function are included in the physical spectrum of the corresponding theory and have vanishing fermion charge.
