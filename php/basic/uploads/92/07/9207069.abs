Title: A New Family of Diagonal Ade-Related Scattering Theories
Authors: F. Ravanini and R. Tateo and A. Valleriani
Abstract: We propose the factorizable S-matrices of the massive excitations of the non-unitary minimal model $M_{2,11}$ perturbed by the operator $\Phi_{1,4}$. The massive excitations and the whole set of two particle S-matrices of the theory is simply related to the $E_8$ unitary minimal scattering theory. The counting argument and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) are applied to this scattering theory in order to support this interpretation. Generalizing this result, we describe a new family of NON UNITARY and DIAGONAL $ADE$-related scattering theories. A further generalization suggests the magnonic TBA for a large class of non-unitary $\G\otimes\G/\G$ coset models ($\G=A_{odd},D_n,E_{6,7,8}$) perturbed by $\Phi_{id,id,adj}$, described by non-diagonal S-matrices.
