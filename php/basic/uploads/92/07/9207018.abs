Title: Quantum Conserved Currents in Supersymmetric Toda Theories
Authors: Alessandro Gualzetti and Silvia Penati and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We consider $N=1$ supersymmetric Toda theories which admit a fermionic untwisted affine extension, i.e. the systems based on the $A(n,n)$, $D(n+1,n)$ and $B(n,n)$ superalgebras. We construct the superspace Miura trasformations which allow to determine the W-supercurrents of the conformal theories and we compute their renormalized expressions. The analysis of the renormalization and conservation of higher-spin currents is then performed for the corresponding supersymmetric massive theories. We establish the quantum integrability of these models and show that although their Lagrangian is not hermitian, the masses of the fundamental particles are real, a property which is maintained by one-loop corrections. The spectrum is actually much richer, since the theories admit solitons. The existence of quantum conserved higher-spin charges implies that elastic, factorized S-matrices can be constructed.
