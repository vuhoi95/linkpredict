Title: Testing Quantum Mechanics in the Neutral Kaon System
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: The neutral kaon system is a sensitive probe of quantum mechanics. We revive a parametrization of non-quantum-mechanical effects that is motivated by considerations of the nature of space-time foam, and show how it can be constrained by new measurements of $K_L \rightarrow 2\pi$ and $K_{L,S}$ semileptonic decays at LEAR or a $\phi$ factory.
