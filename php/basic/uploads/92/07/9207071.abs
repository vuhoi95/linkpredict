Title: Ward Identities for Affine-Virasoro Correlators
Authors: M. B. Halpern and N. A. Obers
Abstract: Generalizing the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, we derive a hierarchy of non-linear Ward identities for affine-Virasoro correlators. The hierarchy follows from null states of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type and the assumption of factorization, whose consistency we verify at an abstract level. Solution of the equations requires concrete factorization ans\"atze, which may vary over affine-Virasoro space. As a first example, we solve the non-linear equations for the coset constructions, using a matrix factorization. The resulting coset correlators satisfy first-order linear partial differential equations whose solutions are the coset blocks defined by Douglas.
