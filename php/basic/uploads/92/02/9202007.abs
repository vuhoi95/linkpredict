Title: Construction of the K=8 Fractional Superconformal Algebras
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and James M. Grochocinski and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: We construct the K=8 fractional superconformal algebras. There are two such extended Virasoro algebras, one of which was constructed earlier, involving a fractional spin (equivalently, conformal dimension) 6/5 current. The new algebra involves two additional fractional spin currents with spin 13/5. Both algebras are non-local and satisfy non-abelian braiding relations. The construction of the algebras uses the isomorphism between the Z_8 parafermion theory and the tensor product of two tricritical Ising models. For the special value of the central charge c=52/55, corresponding to the eighth member of the unitary minimal series, the 13/5 currents of the new algebra decouple, while two spin 23/5 currents (level-2 current algebra descendants of the 13/5 currents) emerge. In addition, it is shown that the K=8 algebra involving the spin 13/5 currents at central charge c=12/5 is the appropriate algebra for the construction of the K=8 (four-dimensional) fractional superstring.
