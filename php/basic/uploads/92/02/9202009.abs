Title: String Theories on the Asymmetric Orbifolds with Twist-Untwist  Intertwining Currents
Authors: Y. Imamura and M. Sakamoto and T. Sasada and M. Tabuse
Abstract: We give various examples of asymmetric orbifold models to possess intertwining currents which convert untwisted string states to twisted ones, and vice versa, and see that such asymmetric orbifold models are severely restricted. The existence of the intertwining currents leads to the enhancement of symmetries in asymmetric orbifold models.
