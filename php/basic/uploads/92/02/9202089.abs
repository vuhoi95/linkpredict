Abstract: We consider the correlation functions of the tachyon vertex operator of the super Liouville theory coupled to matter fields in the super Coulomb gas formulation, on world sheets with spherical topology. After integrating over the zero mode and assuming that the $s$ parameter takes an integer value, we subsequently continue it to an arbitrary real number and compute the correlators in a closed form. We also included an arbitrary number of screening charges and, as a result, after renormalizing them, as well as the external legs and the cosmological constant, the form of the final amplitudes do not modify. The result is remarkably parallel to the bosonic case. For completeness, we discussed the calculation of bosonic correlators including arbitrary screening charges.
