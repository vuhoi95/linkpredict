Title: The General Class of String Theories on Orbifolds
Authors: Makoto Sakamoto and Masayoshi Tabuse
Abstract: We investigate the following three consistency conditions for constructing string theories on orbifolds: i) the invariance of the energy-momentum tensors under twist operators, ii) the duality of amplitudes and iii) modular invariance of partition functions. It is shown that this investigation makes it possible to obtain the general class of consistent orbifold models, which includes a new class of orbifold models.
