Title: Non-Abelian Monopoles Coupled to Gravity
Authors: B. S. Balakrishna and Kameshwar C. Wali
Abstract: A static configuration of point charges held together by the gravitational attraction is known to be given by the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution in the Einstein-Maxwell theory. We consider a generalization of this solution to non-Abelian monopoles of the Yang-Mills Higgs system coupled to gravity. The solution is governed by an analog of the Bogomol'nyi equations that had played a central role in the analysis of non-Abelian monopoles.
