Title: Self Duality and Quantization
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin
Abstract: Quantum theory of the free Maxwell field in Minkowski space is constructed using a representation in which the self dual connection is diagonal. Quantum states are now holomorphic functionals of self dual connections and a decomposition of fields into positive and negative frequency parts is unnecessary. The construction requires the introduction of new mathematical techniques involving ``holomorphic distributions''. The method extends also to linear gravitons in Minkowski space. The fact that one can recover the entire Fock space --with particles of both helicities-- from self dual connections alone provides independent support for a non-perturbative, canonical quantization program for full general relativity based on self dual variables.
