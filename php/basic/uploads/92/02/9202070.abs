Title: Duality in Quantum Toda theory and W-algebras
Authors: H. G. Kausch and G. M. T. Watts
Abstract: We consider Quantum Toda theory associated to a general Lie algebra. We prove that the conserved quantities in both conformal and affine Toda theories exhibit duality interchanging the Dynkin diagram and its dual, and inverting the coupling constant. As an example we discuss the conformal Toda theories based on $B_2,B_3$ and $G_2$ and the related affine theories.
