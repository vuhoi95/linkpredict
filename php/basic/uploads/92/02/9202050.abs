Title: The Marinari-Parisi Model and Collective Field Theory
Authors: J. D. Cohn and H. Dykstra
Abstract: We derive the supersymmetric collective field theory for the Marinari-Parisi model. For a specific choice of the superpotential, to leading order we find a one parameter family of ground states which can be connected via instantons. At this level of analysis the instanton size implied by the underlying matrix model does not appear.
