Title: Picture Changing Operators in Closed Fermionic String Field Theory
Authors: R. Saroja and A. Sen
Abstract: We discuss appropriate arrangement of picture changing operators required to construct gauge invariant interaction vertices involving Neveu-Schwarz states in heterotic and closed superstring field theory. The operators required for this purpose are shown to satisfy a set of descent equations.
