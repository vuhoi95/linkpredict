Title: A Topological Model for Two Dimensional Gravity Coupled to Matter
Authors: L. F. Cugliandolo and F. A. Schaposnik and H. Vucetich
Abstract: Starting from a topological gauge theory in two dimensions with symmetry groups $ISO(2,1)$, $SO(2,1)$ and $SO(1,2)$ we construct a model for gravity with non-trivial coupling to matter. We discuss the equations of motion which are connected to those of previous related models but incorporate matter content. We also discuss the resulting quantum theory and finally present explicit formul\ae $\;$ for topological invariants.
