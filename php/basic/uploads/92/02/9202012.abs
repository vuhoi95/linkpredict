Title: One-Dimensional Fermions as Two-Dimensional Droplets Via Chern-Simons  Theory
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Dimitra Karabali and B. Sakita
Abstract: Based on the observation that a particle motion in one dimension maps to a two-dimensional motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field, constrained in the lowest Landau level, we formulate a system of one-dimen- sional nonrelativistic fermions by using a Chern-Simons field theory in 2+1 dimensions. Using a hydrodynamical formulation we obtain a two-dimensional droplet picture of one-dimensional fermions. The dynamics involved is that of the boundary between a uniform density of particles and vortices. We use the sharp boundary approximation. In the case of well separated boundaries we derive the one-dimensional collective field Hamiltonian. Symmetries of the theory are also discussed as properties of curves in two dimensions.
