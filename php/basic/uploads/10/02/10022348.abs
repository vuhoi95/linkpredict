Title: Spectral Measures and Generating Series for Nimrep Graphs in Subfactor  Theory II: SU(3)
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: We complete the computation of spectral measures for SU(3) nimrep graphs arising in subfactor theory, namely the SU(3) ADE graphs associated with SU(3) modular invariants and the McKay graphs of finite subgroups of SU(3). For the SU(2) graphs the spectral measures distill onto very special subsets of the semicircle/circle, whilst for the SU(3) graphs the spectral measures distill onto very special subsets of the discoid/torus. The theory of nimreps allows us to compute these measures precisely. We have previously determined spectral measures for some nimrep graphs arising in subfactor theory, particularly those associated with all SU(2) modular invariants, all subgroups of SU(2), the torus, SU(3), and some SU(3) graphs.
