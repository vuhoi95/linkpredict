Title: Fate of non-Fermi liquid behavior in QED$_{3}$ at finite chemical  potential
Authors: Jing-Rong Wang and Guo-Zhu Liu
Abstract: The damping rate of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit non-Fermi liquid behavior, $\propto \epsilon^{1/2}$, due to gauge field at zero temperature and zero chemical potential. We study the fate of this behavior at finite chemical potential. We fist calculate explicitly the temporal and spatial components of vacuum polarization functions. The analytical expressions imply that the temporal component of gauge field develops a static screening length at finite chemical potential while the transverse component remains long-ranged owing to gauge invariance. We then calculate the fermion damping rate and show that the temporal gauge field leads to normal Fermi liquid behavior but the transverse gauge field leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior $\propto \epsilon^{2/3}$ at zero temperature. This energy-dependence is more regular than $\propto \epsilon^{1/2}$ and does not change as chemical potential varies.
