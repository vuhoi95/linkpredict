Title: Massless and Massive Gauge-Invariant Fields in the Theory of  Relativistic Wave Equations
Authors: V. A. Pletyukhov and V. I. Strazhev
Abstract: In this work consideration is given to massless and massive gauge-invariant spin 0 and spin 1 fields (particles) within the scope of a theory of the generalized relativistic wave equations with an extended set of the Lorentz group representations. The results obtained may be useful as regards the application of a relativistic wave-equation theory in modern field models.
