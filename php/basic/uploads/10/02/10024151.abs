Title: Running Gluon Mass from Landau Gauge Lattice QCD Propagator
Authors: O. Oliveira and P. Bicudo
Abstract: The interpretation of the Landau gauge lattice gluon propagator as a massive type bosonic propagator is investigated. Three different scenarios are discussed: i) an infrared constant gluon mass; ii) an ultraviolet constant gluon mass; iii) a momentum dependent mass. We find that the infrared data can be associated with a massive propagator up to momenta $\sim 500$ MeV, with a constant gluon mass of 723(11) MeV, if one excludes the zero momentum gluon propagator from the analysis, or 648(7) MeV, if the zero momentum gluon propagator is included in the data sets. The ultraviolet lattice data is not compatible with a massive type propagator with a constant mass. The scenario of a momentum dependent gluon mass gives a decreasing mass with the momentum, which vanishes in the deep ultraviolet region. Furthermore, we show that the functional forms used to describe the decoupling like solution of the Dyson-Schwinger equations are compatible with the lattice data with similar mass scales.
