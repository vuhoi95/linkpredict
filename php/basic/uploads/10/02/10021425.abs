Title: Nonlocal Modification of Newtonian Gravity
Authors: Hans-Joachim Blome and Carmen Chicone and Friedrich W. Hehl and Bahram Mashhoon
Abstract: The Newtonian regime of a recent nonlocal extension of general relativity (GR) is investigated. Nonlocality is introduced via a scalar "constitutive" kernel in a special case of the translational gauge theory of gravitation, namely, the teleparallel equivalent of GR. In this theory, the nonlocal aspect of gravity simulates dark matter. A nonlocal and nonlinear generalization of Poisson's equation of Newtonian gravitation is presented. The implications of nonlocality for the gravitational physics in the solar system are briefly studied.
