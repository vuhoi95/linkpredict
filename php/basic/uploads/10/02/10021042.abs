Title: Poles of Integrale Tritronquee and Anharmonic Oscillators. Asymptotic  localization from WKB analysis
Authors: Davide Masoero and Vera De Benedetti
Abstract: Poles of integrale tritronquee are in bijection with cubic oscillators that admit the simultaneous solutions of two quantization conditions. We show that the poles lie near the solutions of a pair of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions (the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Boutroux system): the distance between a pole and the corresponding solution of the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Boutroux system vanishes asymptotically.
