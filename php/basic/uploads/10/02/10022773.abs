Title: Sub-classical fields and polarization in electrodynamics
Authors: Mathieu Planat and Janos Polonyi
Abstract: Expectation values of the electromagnetic field and the electric current are introduced at space-time resolution which belongs to the quantum domain. These allow us to approach some key features of classical electrodynamics from the underlying QED. One is the emergence of the radiation field in the retarded solution of the Maxwell equation, derived from an action principle. Another question discussed is the systematic derivation of the polarizability of a charge system. Furthermore, the decoherence and the consistency of the photon field is established by a perturbative calculation of the reduced density matrix for the electromagnetic field within the Closed Time Path formalism.
