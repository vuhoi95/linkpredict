Title: Monopoles, abelian projection, and gauge invariance
Authors: Claudio Bonati and Adriano Di Giacomo and Luca Lepori and Fabrizio Pucci
Abstract: A direct connection is proved between the Non-Abelian Bianchi Identities(NABI), and the abelian Bianchi identities for the 't Hooft tensor. As a consequence the existence of a non-zero magnetic current is related to the violation of the NABI's and is a gauge-invariant property. The construction allows to show that not all abelian projections can be used to expose monopoles in lattice configurations: each field configuration with non-zero magnetic charge identifies its natural projection, up to gauge transformations which tend to unity at large distances. It is shown that the so-called maximal-abelian gauge is a legitimate choice. It is also proved, starting from the NABI, that monopole condensation is a physical gauge invariant phenomenon, independent of the choice of the abelian projection.
