Title: String scattering in flat space and a scaling limit of Yang-Mills  correlators
Authors: Takuya Okuda and Joao Penedones
Abstract: We use the flat space limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence to derive a simple relation between the 2 to 2 scattering amplitude of massless string states in type IIB superstring theory on ten-dimensional Minkowski space and a scaling limit of the N=4 super Yang-Mills four point functions. We conjecture that this relation holds non-perturbatively and at arbitrarily high energy.
