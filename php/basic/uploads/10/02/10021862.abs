Title: Gauge Symmetry Breaking in Matrix Models
Authors: Harald Grosse and Fedele Lizzi and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We argue that some features of the standard model, in particular the fermion assignment and symmetry breaking, can be obtained in matrix model which describes noncommutative gauge theory as well as gravity in an emergent way. The mechanism is based on the presence of some extra (matrix) dimensions. These extra dimensions are different from the usual ones which give to a noncommutative geometry of the Gronewold-Moyal type, and are reminiscent of the Connes-Lott model, although the action is very different.
