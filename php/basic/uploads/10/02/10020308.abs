Title: Projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity in a nutshell
Authors: Silke Weinfurtner and Thomas P. Sotiriou and Matt Visser
Abstract: Approximately one year ago Horava proposed a power-counting renormalizable theory of gravity which abandons local Lorentz invariance. The proposal has been received with growing interest and resulted in various different versions of Horava-Lifshitz gravity theories, involving a colourful potpourri of new terminology. In this proceedings contribution we first motivate and briefly overview the various different approaches, clarifying their differences and similarities. We then focus on a model referred to as projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity and summarize the key results regarding its viability.
