Title: High energy improved scalar quantum field theory from noncommutative  geometry without UV/IR-mixing
Authors: Alexander Schenkel and Christoph F. Uhlemann
Abstract: We consider an interacting scalar quantum field theory on noncommutative Euclidean space. We implement a family of noncommutative deformations, which -- in contrast to the well known Moyal-Weyl deformation -- lead to a theory with modified kinetic term, while all local potentials are unaffected by the deformation. We show that our models, in particular, include propagators with anisotropic scaling z=2 in the ultraviolet (UV). For a \Phi^4-theory on our noncommutative space we obtain an improved UV behaviour at the one-loop level and the absence of UV/IR-mixing and of the Landau pole.
