Title: Entanglement and corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
Authors: Saurya Das and S. Shankaranarayanan and Sourav Sur
Abstract: In this talk, we focus on the corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by associating it with the entanglement between degrees of freedom inside and outside the horizon. Using numerical techniques, we show that the corrections proportional to fractional power of area result when the field is in a superposition of ground and excited states. We explain this result by identifying that the degrees of freedom contributing to such corrections are different from those contributing to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
