Title: On Finite Noncommutativity in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Miklos LÃ¥ngvik and Ali Zahabi
Abstract: We consider various modifications of the Weyl-Moyal star-product, in order to obtain a finite range of nonlocality. The basic requirements are to preserve the commutation relations of the coordinates as well as the associativity of the new product. We show that a modification of the differential representation of the Weyl-Moyal star-product by an exponential function of derivatives will not lead to a finite range of nonlocality. We also modify the integral kernel of the star-product introducing a Gaussian damping, but find a nonassociative product which remains infinitely nonlocal. We are therefore led to propose that the Weyl-Moyal product should be modified by a cutoff like function, in order to remove the infinite nonlocality of the product. We provide such a product, but it appears that one has to abandon the possibility of analytic calculation with the new product.
