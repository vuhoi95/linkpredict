Title: An axiomatic formulation of the Montevideo interpretation of quantum  mechanics
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Luis Pedro Garcia-Pintos and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We make a first attempt to axiomatically formulate the Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this interpretation environmental decoherence is supplemented with loss of coherence due to the use of realistic clocks to measure time to solve the measurement problem. The resulting formulation is framed entirely in terms of quantum objects without having to invoke the existence of measurable classical quantities like the time in ordinary quantum mechanics. The formulation eliminates any privileged role to the measurement process giving an objective definition of when an event occurs in a system.
