Title: Extremal black holes, attractor equations, and harmonic functions
Authors: T Mohaupt and K Waite
Abstract: We review the construction of multi-centered black hole solutions through dimensional reduction over time. This method does not rely on Killing spinor equations or gradient flow equations, but on solving the second order field equations in terms of harmonic functions. The black hole attractor equations are obtained directly from the field equations.
