Title: Ultraviolet behavior in background independent quantum field theory
Authors: Viqar Husain and Andreas Kreienbuehl
Abstract: We describe a background independent quantization of the scalar field that provides an explicit realization of Fock-like states and associated operators in a polymer Hilbert space. The vacuum expectation values of the commutator and anti-commutator of the creation and annihilation operators become energy dependent, and exhibit a surprising transition to fermionic behavior at high energy. Furthermore the approach yields a modified dispersion relation with a leading correction proportional to the momentum cubed. These results suggests a fundamental change in the ultraviolet properties of quantum fields.
