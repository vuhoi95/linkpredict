Title: Light hidden-sector U(1)s in string compactifications
Authors: Mark Goodsell and Andreas Ringwald
Abstract: We review the case for light U(1) gauge bosons in the hidden-sector of heterotic and type II string compactifications, present estimates of the size of their kinetic mixing with the visible-sector hypercharge U(1), and discuss their possibly very interesting phenomenological consequences in particle physics and cosmology.
