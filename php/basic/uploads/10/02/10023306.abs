Title: Free Fermions Violate the Area Law For Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Robert C. Helling and Wolfgang Spitzer
Abstract: We show that the entanglement entropy associated to a region grows faster than the area of its boundary surface. This is done by proving a special case of a conjecture due to Widom that yields a surprisingly simple expression for the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy.
