Title: Canonical Structure of Higher Derivative Gravity in 3D
Authors: Ibrahim Gullu and Tahsin Cagri Sisman and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We give an explicitly gauge invariant canonical analysis of linearized quadratic gravity theories in three dimensions for both flat and de-Sitter backgrounds. In flat backgrounds, we also study the effects of gravitational Chern-Simons term, and include the sources, compute the weak field limit as well as scattering between spinning massive particles.
