Authors: Danilo T. Alves and Edney R. Granhen and Hector O. Silva and Mateus G. Lima
Abstract: We investigate the exact behavior of the energy density of a real massless scalar field inside a cavity with a single moving mirror executing a resonant oscillatory law of motion, satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite temperature. Our results are compared with those found in literature through analytical approximative methods.
