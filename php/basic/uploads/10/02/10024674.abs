Title: BCFW Recursion Relations and String Theory
Authors: Clifford Cheung and Donal O'Connell and Brian Wecht
Abstract: We demonstrate that all tree-level string theory amplitudes can be computed using the BCFW recursion relations. Our proof utilizes the pomeron vertex operator introduced by Brower, Polchinski, Strassler, and Tan. Surprisingly, we find that in a particular large complex momentum limit, the asymptotic expansion of massless string amplitudes is identical in form to that of the corresponding field theory amplitudes. This observation makes manifest the fact that field-theoretic Yang-Mills and graviton amplitudes obey KLT-like relations. Moreover, we conjecture that in this large momentum limit certain string theory and field theory amplitudes are identical, and provide evidence for this conjecture. Additionally, we find a new recursion relation which relates tachyon amplitudes to lower-point tachyon amplitudes.
