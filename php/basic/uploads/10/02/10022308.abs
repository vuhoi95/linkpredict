Title: Large N reduction on coset spaces
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Shinji Shimasaki and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: As an extension of our previous work concerning the large N reduction on group manifolds, we study the large N reduction on coset spaces. We show that large N field theories on coset spaces are described by certain corresponding matrix models. We also construct Chern-Simons-like theories on group manifolds and coset spaces, and give their reduced models.
