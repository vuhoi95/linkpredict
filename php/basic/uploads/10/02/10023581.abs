Title: Quantum corrections to the entropy of charged rotating black holes
Authors: M. Akbar and K. Saifullah
Abstract: Hawking radiation from a black hole can be viewed as quantum tunneling of particles through the event horizon. Using this approach we provide a general framework for studying corrections to the entropy of black holes beyond semiclassical approximations. Applying the properties of exact differentials for three variables to the first law thermodynamics, we study charged rotating black holes and explicitly work out the corrections to entropy and horizon area for the Kerr-Newman and charged rotating BTZ black holes. It is shown that the results for other geometries like the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild spacetimes follow easily.
