Title: Solitary Waves in Massive Nonlinear S^N-Sigma Models
Authors: A. Alonso Izquierdo and M. Á. González León and M. de la Torre Mayado
Abstract: The solitary waves of massive (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear S^N-sigma models are unveiled. It is shown that the solitary waves in these systems are in one-to-one correspondence with the separatrix trajectories in the repulsive N-dimensional Neumann mechanical problem. There are topological (heteroclinic trajectories) and non-topological (homoclinic trajectories) kinks. The stability of some embedded sine-Gordon kinks is discussed by means of the direct estimation of the spectra of the second-order fluctuation operators around them, whereas the instability of other topological and non-topological kinks is established applying the Morse index theorem.
