Title: Including a phase in the Bethe equations of the Hubbard model
Authors: V. Fomin and L. Frappat and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We compute the Bethe equations of generalized Hubbard models, and study their thermodynamical limit. We argue how they can be connected to the ones found in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, in particular with the so-called dressing phase problem. We also show how the models can be interpreted, in condensed matter physics, as integrable multi-leg Hubbard models.
