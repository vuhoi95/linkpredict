Title: A Note on Temperature and Energy of 4-dimensional Black Holes from  Entropic Force
Authors: Yu-Xiao Liu and Yong-Qiang Wang and Shao-Wen Wei
Abstract: We investigate the temperature and energy on holographic screens for 4-dimensional black holes with the entropic force idea proposed by Verlinde. We find that the "Unruh-Verlinde temperature" is equal to the Hawking temperature on the horizon and can be considered as a generalized Hawking temperature on the holographic screen outside the horizons. The energy on the holographic screen is not the black hole mass $M$ but the reduced mass $M_0$, which is related to the black hole parameters. With the replacement of the black hole mass $M$ by the reduced mass $M_0$, the entropic force can be written as $F=\frac{GmM_0}{r^2}$, which could be tested by experiments.
