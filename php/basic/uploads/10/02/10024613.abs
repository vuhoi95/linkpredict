Title: On correlation functions of operators dual to classical spinning string  states
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Piotr Surowka and Andrzej Wereszczynski
Abstract: We explore how to compute, classically at strong coupling, correlation functions of local operators corresponding to classical spinning string states. The picture we obtain is of `fattened' Witten diagrams, the evaluation of which turns out to be surprisingly subtle and requires a modification of the naive classical action due to a necessary projection onto appropriate wave functions. We examine string solutions which compute the simplest case of a two-point function and reproduce the right scaling with the anomalous dimensions corresponding to the energies of the associated spinning string solutions. We also describe, under some simplifying assumptions, how the spacetime dependence of a conformal three-point correlation function arises in this setup.
