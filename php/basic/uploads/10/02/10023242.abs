Title: Nearly-Kaehler dimensional reduction of the heterotic string
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and George Zoupanos
Abstract: The effective action in four dimensions resulting from the ten-dimensional N=1 heterotic supergravity coupled to N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills upon dimensional reduction over nearly-Kaehler manifolds is discussed. Nearly-Kaehler manifolds are an interesting class of manifolds admitting an SU(3)-structure and in six dimensions all homogeneous nearly-Kaehler manifolds are included in the class of the corresponding non-symmetric coset spaces plus a group manifold. Therefore it is natural to apply the Coset Space Dimensional Reduction scheme using these coset spaces as internal manifolds in order to determine the four-dimensional theory.
