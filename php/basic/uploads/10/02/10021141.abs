Abstract: Evolution of a background space-time metric and sub-horizon matter density perturbations in the Universe is numerically analyzed in viable $f(R)$ models of present dark energy and cosmic acceleration. It is found that viable models generically exhibit recent crossing of the phantom boundary $w_{\rm DE}=-1$. Furthermore, it is shown that, as a consequence of the anomalous growth of density perturbations during the end of the matter-dominated stage, their growth index evolves non-monotonically with time and may even become negative temporarily.
