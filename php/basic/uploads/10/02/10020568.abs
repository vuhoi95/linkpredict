Title: Families of Conformal Fixed Points of N=2 Chern-Simons-Matter Theories
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We argue that a large class of N=2 Chern-Simons-matter theories in three dimensions have a continuous family of exact IR fixed points described by suitable quartic superpotentials, based on holomorphy. The entire family exists in the perturbative regime. A nontrivial check is performed by computing the 4-loop beta function of the quartic couplings, in the 't Hooft limit, with a large number of flavors. We find that the 4-loop beta function can only deform the family of 2-loop fixed points, and does not change the dimension of this family. We further present an explicit computation of a perturbative correction to the Zamolodchikov metric on this space of three-dimensional superconformal field theories.
