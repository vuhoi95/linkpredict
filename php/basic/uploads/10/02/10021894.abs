Title: On Instanton Effects in F-theory
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Andres Collinucci and Benjamin Jurke
Abstract: We revisit the issue of M5-brane instanton corrections to the superpotential in F-theory compactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Elaborating on concrete geometries, we compare the instanton zero modes for non-perturbative F-theory models with the zero modes in their perturbative Sen limit. The fermionic matter zero modes localized on the intersection of the instanton with the space-time filling D7-branes show up in a geometric way in F-theory. Methods for their computation are developed and, not surprisingly, exceptional gauge group structures do appear. Finally, quite intriguing geometrical aspects of the one-loop determinant are discussed.
