Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger equation in Lobachevsky and Riemann 4-spaces has been solved in the presence of external magnetic field that is an analog of a uniform magnetic field in the flat space. Generalized Landau levels have been found, modified by the presence of the space curvature. In Lobachevsky4-model the energy spectrum contains discrete and continuous parts, the number of bound states is finite; in Riemann 4-model all energy spectrum is discrete. Generalized Landau levels are determined by three parameters, the magnitude of the magnetic field $B$, the curvature radius $\rho$ and the magnetic quantum number $m$. It has been shown that in presence of an additional external electric field the energy spectrum in the Riemann model can be also obtained analytically.
