Title: Quantum Non-Gravity and Stellar Collapse
Authors: C. Barcelo and L. J. Garay and G. Jannes
Abstract: Observational indications combined with analyses of analogue and emergent gravity in condensed matter systems support the possibility that there might be two distinct energy scales related to quantum gravity: the scale that sets the onset of quantum gravitational effects $E_B$ (related to the Planck scale) and the much higher scale $E_L$ signalling the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. We suggest a natural interpretation for these two scales: $E_L$ is the energy scale below which a special relativistic spacetime emerges, $E_B$ is the scale below which this spacetime geometry becomes curved. This implies that the first `quantum' gravitational effect around $E_B$ could simply be that gravity is progressively switched off, leaving an effective Minkowski quantum field theory up to much higher energies of the order of $E_L$. This scenario may have important consequences for gravitational collapse, inasmuch as it opens up new possibilities for the final state of stellar collapse other than an evaporating black hole.
