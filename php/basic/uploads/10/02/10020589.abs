Title: Hilbert Spaces from Path Integrals
Authors: Fay Dowker and Steven Johnston and Rafael D. Sorkin
Abstract: It is shown that a Hilbert space can be constructed for a quantum system starting from a framework in which histories are fundamental. The Decoherence Functional provides the inner product on this "History Hilbert space". It is also shown that the History Hilbert space is the standard Hilbert space in the case of non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
