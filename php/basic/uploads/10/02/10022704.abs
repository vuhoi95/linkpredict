Title: Renormalization Of High-Energy Lorentz Violating Four Fermion Models
Authors: Damiano Anselmi and Emilio Ciuffoli
Abstract: We study the one-loop renormalization of high-energy Lorentz violating four fermion models. We derive general formulas and then consider a number of specific models. We study the conditions for asymptotic freedom and give a practical method to determine the asymptotic-freedom domain. We also point out that in some models the RG flow contains "rational" Zimmermann trajectories that might hide new symmetries.
