Title: PSU(2,2|4) Character of Quasiclassical AdS/CFT
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Vladimir Kazakov and Zengo Tsuboi
Abstract: We solve the recently proposed T- and Y-systems (Hirota equation) for the exact spectrum of AdS/CFT in the strong coupling scaling limit for an arbitrary quasiclassical string state. The corresponding T-functions appear to be super-characters of the SU(2,2|4) group in unitary representations with a highest weight, with the classical AdS5xS5 superstring monodromy matrix as the group element. We propose a concise first Weyl-type formula for these characters and show that they correctly reproduce the results of quasiclassical one-loop quantization in all sectors of the superstring, under some natural assumptions. We also speculate about possible relation between the T-functions and the quantum monodromy matrix.
