Title: Holographic phase transition in a non-critical holographic model
Authors: Sheng-liang Cui and Yi-hong Gao and Wei-shui Xu
Abstract: We consider a holographic model constructed from the intersecting brane configuration D4-$\bar{\rm{D4}}$/D4 in noncritical string theory. We study the chiral phase diagram of this holographic QCD-like model with a finite baryon chemical potential through the supergravity dual approximation.
