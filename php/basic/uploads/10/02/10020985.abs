Title: A New Global Embedding Approach to Study Hawking and Unruh Effects
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: A new type of global embedding of curved space-times in higher dimensional flat ones is introduced to present a unified description of Hawking and Unruh effects. Our analysis simplifies as well as generalises the conventional embedding approach.
