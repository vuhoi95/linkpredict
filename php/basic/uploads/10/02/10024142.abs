Title: 5-loop Konishi from linearized TBA and the XXX magnet
Authors: Janos Balog and Arpad Hegedus
Abstract: Using the linearized TBA equations recently obtained in [arXiv:1002.1711] we show analytically that the 5-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator agrees with the result obtained previously from the generalized Luscher formulae. The proof is based on the relation between this linear system and the XXX model TBA equations.
