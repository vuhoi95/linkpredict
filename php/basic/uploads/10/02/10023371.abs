Title: Genus two partition functions of chiral conformal field theories
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Christoph A. Keller and Roberto Volpato
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the genus two vacuum amplitudes of chiral self-dual conformal field theories is performed. It is explained that the existence of a modular invariant genus two partition function implies infinitely many relations among the structure constants of the theory. All of these relations are shown to be a consequence of the associativity of the OPE, as well as the modular covariance properties of the torus one-point functions. Using these techniques we prove that for the proposed extremal conformal field theories at c=24k a consistent genus two vacuum amplitude exists for all k, but that this does not actually check the consistency of these theories beyond what is already testable at genus one.
