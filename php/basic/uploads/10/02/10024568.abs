Title: Gravity as Quantum Entanglement Force
Authors: Jae-Weon Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jungjai Lee
Abstract: We conjecture that the total quantum entanglement of matter and vacuum in the universe tends to increase with time, like entropy, and that an effective force is associated with this tendency. We also suggest that gravity and dark energy are types of quantum entanglement forces, similar to Verlinde's entropic force, and give holographic dark energy with an equation of state comparable to current observational data. This connection between quantum entanglement and gravity could give some new insights into the origins of gravity, dark energy, and the arrow of time.
