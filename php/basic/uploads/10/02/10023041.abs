Title: A relation between the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and the standard model
Authors: Bogusław Broda and Michał Szanecki
Abstract: It has been shown that Sakharov's induced, from the fields entering the standard model, Barbero-Immirzi parameter assumes, in the framework of euclidean formalism, the UV cutoff-independent value, 1/9. The calculus uses the Schwinger's proper-time formalism, the Seeley-DeWitt heat-kernel expansion, and it is akin to the derivation of the ABJ chiral anomaly in space-time with torsion.
