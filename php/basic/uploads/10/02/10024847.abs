Title: A note on the existence of soliton solutions in the Chern-Simons-CP(1)  model
Authors: Lucas Sourrouille and Alvaro Caso and Gustavo S Lozano
Abstract: We study a gauged Chern-Simons-CP(1) system. We show that contrary to previous claims the model in the absences of a potential term cannot support finite size soliton solution in $R^2$.
