Title: Spacetime Noncommutativity in Models with Warped Extradimensions
Authors: Thorsten Ohl and Alexander Schenkel and Christoph F. Uhlemann
Abstract: We construct consistent noncommutative (NC) deformations of the Randall-Sundrum spacetime that solve the NC Einstein equations with a non-trivial Poisson tensor depending on the fifth coordinate. In a class of these deformations where the Poisson tensor is exponentially localized on one of the branes (the NC-brane), we study the effects on bulk particles in terms of Lorentz-violating operators induced by NC-brane interactions. We sketch two models in which massive bulk particles mediate NC effects to an almost-commutative SM-brane, such that observables at high energy colliders are enhanced with respect to low energy and astrophysical observables.
