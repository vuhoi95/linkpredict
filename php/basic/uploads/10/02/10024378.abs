Title: An Extended Kerr-Schild Ansatz
Authors: Benjamin Ett and David Kastor
Abstract: We present an analysis of the vacuum Einstein equations for a recently proposed extension of the Kerr-Schild ansatz that includes a spacelike vector field as well as the usual Kerr-Schild null vector. We show that many, although not all, of the simplifications that occur in the Kerr-Schild case continue to hold for the extended ansatz. In particular, we find a simple set of sufficient conditions on the vectors such that the vacuum field equations truncate beyond quadratic order in an expansion around a general vacuum background solution. We extend our analysis to the electrovac case with a related ansatz for the gauge field.
