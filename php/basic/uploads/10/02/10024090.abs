Title: NS5-branes, holography and CFT deformations
Authors: A. Fotopoulos and P. M. Petropoulos and N. Prezas and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: A few supergravity solutions representing configurations of NS5-branes admit exact conformal field theory (CFT) description. Deformations of these solutions should be described by exactly marginal operators of the corresponding theories. We briefly review the essentials of these constructions and present, as a new case, the operators responsible for turning on angular momentum.
