Title: Thermodynamics of Photon Gas with an Invariant Energy Scale
Authors: Sudipta Das and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: Quantum Gravity framework motivates us to find new theories in which an observer independent finite energy upper bound (preferably Planck Energy) exists. We have studied the modifications in the thermodynamical properties of a photon gas in such a scenario where we have an invariant energy scale. We show that the density of states and the entropy in such a framework are less than the corresponding quantities in Einstein's Special Relativity (SR) theory. This result can be interpreted as a consequence of the deformed Lorentz symmetry present in the particular model we have considered.
