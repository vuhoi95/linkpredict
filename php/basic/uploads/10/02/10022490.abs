Title: Renormalization of the Yang-Mills theory in the ambiguity-free gauge
Authors: A. Quadri and A. A. Slavnov
Abstract: The renormalization procedure for the Yang-Mills theory in the gauge free of the Gribov ambiguity is constructed. It is shown that all the ultraviolet infinities may be removed by renormalization of the parameters entering the classical Lagrangian and the local redefinition of the fields.
