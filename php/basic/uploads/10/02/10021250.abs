Title: The Aharonov-Bohm effect in conical space
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and N. D. Vlasii
Abstract: Conical space emerges inevitably as an outer space of any topological defect of the vortex type. Quantum-mechanical scattering of a nonrelativistic particle by a vortex centred in conical space is considered, and effects of the transverse size of the vortex are taken into account. Paradoxical peculiarities of scattering in the short-wavelength limit are discussed.
