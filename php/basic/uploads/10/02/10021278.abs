Title: Unexpected Delta-Function Term in the Radial Schrodinger Equation
Authors: Anzor A. Khelashvili and Teimuraz P. Nadareishvili
Abstract: Careful exploration of the idea that equation for radial wave function must be compatible with the full Schrodinger equation shows appearance of the delta-function while reduction of full Schrodinger equation in spherical coordinates. Elimination of this extra term produces a boundary condition for the radial wave function, which is the same both for regular and singular potentials.
