Title: Low-energy U(1) x USp(2M) gauge theory from simple high-energy gauge  group
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Kenichi Konishi
Abstract: We give an explicit example of the embedding of a near BPS low-energy (U(1) x USp(2M))/Z_2 gauge theory into a high-energy theory with a simple gauge group and adjoint matter content. This system possesses degenerate monopoles arising from the high-energy symmetry breaking as well as non-Abelian vortices due to the symmetry breaking at low energies. These solitons of different codimensions are related by the exact homotopy sequences.
