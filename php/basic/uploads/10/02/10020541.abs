Title: Gravity with de Sitter and Unitary Tangent Groups
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: Einstein Gravity can be formulated as a gauge theory with the tangent space respecting the Lorentz symmetry. In this paper we show that the dimension of the tangent space can be larger than the dimension of the manifold and by requiring the invariance of the theory with respect to 5d Lorentz group (de Sitter group) Einstein theory is reproduced unambiguously. The other possibility is to have unitary symmetry on a complex tangent space of the same dimension as the manifold. In this case the resultant theory is Einstein-Strauss Hermitian gravity. The tangent group is important for matter couplings. We show that in the de Sitter case the 4 dimensional space time vector and scalar are naturally unified by a hidden symmetry being components of a 5d vector in the tangent space. With a de Sitter tangent group spinors can exist only when they are made complex or taken in doublets in a way similar to N=2 supersymmetry.
