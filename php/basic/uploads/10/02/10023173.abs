Title: Testing gaussianity, homogeneity and isotropy with the cosmic microwave  background
Authors: L. Raul Abramo and Thiago S. Pereira
Abstract: We review the basic hypotheses which motivate the statistical framework used to analyze the cosmic microwave background, and how that framework can be enlarged as we relax those hypotheses. In particular, we try to separate as much as possible the questions of gaussianity, homogeneity and isotropy from each other. We focus both on isotropic estimators of non-gaussianity as well as statistically anisotropic estimators of gaussianity, giving particular emphasis on their signatures and the enhanced "cosmic variances" that become increasingly important as our putative Universe becomes less symmetric. After reviewing the formalism behind some simple model-independent tests, we discuss how these tests can be applied to CMB data when searching for large scale "anomalies"
