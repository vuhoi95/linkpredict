Title: Moore-Read Fractional Quantum Hall wavefunctions and SU(2) quiver gauge  theories
Authors: Raoul Santachiara and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: We identify Moore-Read wavefunctions, describing non-abelian statistics in fractional quantum Hall systems, with the instanton partition of N=2 superconformal quiver gauge theories at suitable values of masses and \Omega-background parameters. This is obtained by extending to rational conformal field theories the SU(2) gauge quiver/Liouville field theory duality recently found by Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa. A direct link between the Moore-Read Hall $n$-body wavefunctions and Z_n-equivariant Donaldson polynomials is pointed out.
