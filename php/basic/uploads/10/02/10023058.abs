Title: Pair Production of small Black Holes in Heterotic String Theories
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Luca Lopez
Abstract: We study pair production of small BPS BH's in heterotic strings compactified on tori and in the FHSV model. After recalling the identification of small BH's in the perturbative BPS spectrum, we compute the tree-level amplitudes for processes initiated by massless vector bosons or gravitons. We then analyze the resulting cross sections in terms of energy and angular distributions. Finally, we briefly comment on scenari with large extra dimensions and on generalizations of our results to non-BPS, non-extremal and rotating BH's.
