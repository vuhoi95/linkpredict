Title: Comments on Non-Fermi Liquids in the Presence of a Condensate
Authors: Pallab Basu and Jianyang He and Anindya Mukherjee and Moshe Rozali and Hsien-Hang Shieh
Abstract: We study the effects of a scalar condensate on a class of 2+1 dimensional non- Fermi liquids by introducing fermionic probes in the corresponding asymptotically AdS4 black hole backgrounds. For the range of parameters and couplings we consider we find gapless fermionic excitations whose properties are model-dependent.
