Title: Three-generation Models from E_8 Magnetized Extra Dimensional Theory
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Ryosuke Maruyama and Masaki Murata and Hiroshi Ohki and Manabu Sakai
Abstract: We study 10D super Yang-Mills E8 theory on the 6D torus compactification with magnetic fluxes. We study systematically the possibilities for realizing 4D supersymmetric standard models with three generations of quarks and leptons. We also study quark mass matrices.
