Title: Glassy Phase Transition and Stability in Black Holes
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sujoy Kumar Modak and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics, confined to the semi-classical regime, cannot address the thermodynamic stability of a black hole in flat space. Here we show that inclusion of correction beyond the semi-classical approximation makes a black hole thermodynamically stable. This stability is reached through a phase transition. By using Ehrenfest's scheme we further prove that this is a glassy phase transition with a Prigogine-Defay ratio close to 3. This value is well placed within the desired bound (2 to 5) for a glassy phase transition. Thus our analysis indicates a very close connection between the phase transition phenomena of a black hole and glass forming systems. Finally, we discuss the robustness of our results by considering different normalisations for the correction term.
