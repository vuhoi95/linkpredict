Title: Monopole Solutions of the Massive SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs Theory
Authors: Rosy Teh and Khai-Ming Wong and Pin-Wai Koh
Abstract: Monopoles in topologically massive gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions with a Chern-Simon mass term have been studied by Pisarski some years ago. He investigated the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs model with an additional Chern-Simon mass term in the action. Pisarski argued that there is a monopole solution that is regular everywhere, but found that it does not possess finite action. There were no exact or numerical solutions being presented by Pisarski. Hence it is our purpose to further investigate this solution in more detail. We obtained numerical regular solutions that smoothly interpolates between the behavior at small and large distances for different values of Chern-Simon term strength and for several fixed values of Higgs field strength.
