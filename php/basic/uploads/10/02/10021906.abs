Title: Gravity dual D3-braneworld and Open/Closed string duality
Authors: Supriya Kar and K. Priyabrat Pandey and Abhishek K. Singh and Sunita Singh
Abstract: A covariantly constant dynamical two-form is exploited on a $D_3$-brane to obtain its gravity dual action, governing an $S^3$ deformed $AdS_5$ black hole, in a type IIB string theory on $S^1\times K3$. We invoke the Kaluza-Klein compactification to work out the open/closed string duality. Interestingly, the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is obtained on the "non-Reimannian" braneworld.
