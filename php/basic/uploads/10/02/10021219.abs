Title: Exploring the bulk of tidal charged micro-black holes
Authors: R. Casadio and O. Micu
Abstract: We study the bulk corresponding to tidal charged brane-world black holes. We employ a propagating algorithm which makes use of the three-dimensional multipole expansion and analytically yields the metric elements as functions of the five-dimensional coordinates and of the ADM mass, tidal charge and brane tension. Since the projected brane equations cannot determine how the charge depends on the mass, our main purpose is to select the combinations of these parameters for which black holes of microscopic size possess a regular bulk. Our results could in particular be relevant for a better understanding of TeV-scale black holes.
