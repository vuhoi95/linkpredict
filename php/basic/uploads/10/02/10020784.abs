Title: Solutions in IR modified Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Taekyung Kim and Chong Oh Lee
Abstract: In order to allow the asymptotically flat, we consider Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity theory with a soft violation of the detailed balance condition and obtain various solutions. In particular, we find that such theory coupled to a global monopole leads to a solution representing a space with deficit solid angle, which is well matched with genuine feature of GR.
