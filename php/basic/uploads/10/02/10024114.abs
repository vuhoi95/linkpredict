Title: The Szeg√∂ Kernel on a Sewn Riemann Surface
Authors: Michael P. Tuite and Alexander Zuevsky
Abstract: We describe the Szeg\"o kernel on a higher genus Riemann surface in terms of Szeg\"o kernel data coming from lower genus surfaces via two explicit sewing procedures where either two Riemann surfaces are sewn together or a handle is sewn to a Riemann surface. We consider in detail the examples of the Szeg\"o kernel on a genus two Riemann surface formed by either sewing together two punctured tori or by sewing a twice-punctured torus to itself. We also consider the modular properties of the Szeg\"o kernel in these cases.
