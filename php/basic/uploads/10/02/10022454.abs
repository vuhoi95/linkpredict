Title: Entropic Law of Force, Emergent Gravity and the Uncertainty Principle
Authors: M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: The entropic formulation of the inertia and the gravity relies on quantum, geometrical and informational arguments. The fact that the results are completly classical is missleading. In this paper we argue that the entropic formulation provides new insights into the quantum nature of the inertia and the gravity. We use the entropic postulate to determine the quantum uncertainty in the law of inertia and in the law of gravity in the Newtonian Mechanics, the Special Relativity and in the General Relativity. These results are obtained by considering the most general quantum property of the matter represented by the Uncertainty Principle and by postulating an expression for the uncertainty of the entropy such that: i) it is the simplest quantum generalization of the postulate of the variation of the entropy and ii) it reduces to the variation of the entropy in the absence of the uncertainty.
