Title: Phenomenological Analysis of $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ Elastic Scattering  Based on Theoretical Bounds in High-Energy Physics
Authors: S. D. Campos and V. A. Okorokov
Abstract: Considering the Froissart-Martin bound, Jin-Martin-Cornille bound and the optical theorem, we propose a novel parametrization for the total cross-section of proton-proton and antiproton-proton elastic scattering data. Using derivative dispersion relations we obtain the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude and thus the $\rho$ parameter. Simultaneous fits to $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ are performed allowing very good statistical descriptions of the available data. Furthermore, predictions to $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ at energies not used in the fit procedures are presented. For $\sigma_{tot}$ we obtain predictions at RHIC, LHC and future HC energies.
