Title: Generalized Gribov-Lipatov Reciprocity and AdS/CFT
Authors: M. Beccaria and V. Forini and G. Macorini
Abstract: Planar N=4 SYM theory and QCD share the gluon sector, suggesting the investigation of Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity in the supersymmetric theory. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence links N=4 SYM and superstring dynamics on AdS5xS5, reciprocity is also expected to show up in the quantum corrected energies of certain classical string configurations dual to gauge theory twist-operators. We review recent results confirming this picture and revisiting the old idea of Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity as a modern theoretical tool useful for the study of open problems in AdS/CFT.
