Title: Holographic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions
Authors: Kristan Jensen and Andreas Karch and Dam T. Son and Ethan G. Thompson
Abstract: We find the first example of a quantum Berenzinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in two spatial dimensions via holography. This transition occurs in the D3/D5 system at nonzero density and magnetic field. At any nonzero temperature, the BKT scaling is destroyed and the transition becomes second order with mean-field exponents. We go on to conjecture about the generality of quantum BKT transitions in two spatial dimensions.
