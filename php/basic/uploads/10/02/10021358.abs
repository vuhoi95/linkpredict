Title: Direct construction of a cubic selfinteraction for higher spin gauge  fields
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Karapet Mkrtchyan and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: Using Noether's procedure we directly construct a complete cubic selfinteraction for the case of spin s=4 in a flat background and discuss the cubic selfinteraction for general spin s with s derivatives in the same background. The leading term of the latter interaction together with the leading gauge transformation of first field order are presented.
