Title: The Transition Amplitude for 2T Physics
Authors: Joao E. Frederico and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We present the transition amplitude for a particle moving in a space with two times and D space dimensions having a Sp(2,R) local symmetry and an SO(D,2) rigid symmetry. It was obtained from the BRST-BFV quantization with a unique gauge choice. We show that by constraining the initial and final points of this amplitude to lie on some hypersurface of the D+2 space the resulting amplitude reproduces well known systems in lower dimensions. This provides an alternative physical interpretation for two times physics which is derived in a single framework.
