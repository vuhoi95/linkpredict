Title: Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory With Boundary
Authors: A. Blasi and N. Maggiore and N. Magnoli and S. Storace
Abstract: The Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory with planar boundary is considered. The boundary is introduced according to Symanzik's basic principles of locality and separability. A method of investigation is proposed, which, avoiding the straight computation of correlators, is appealing for situations where the computation of propagators, modified by the boundary, becomes quite complex. For MCS theory, the outcome is that a unique solution exists, in the form of chiral conserved currents, satisfying a Kac-Moody algebra, whose central charge does not depend on the Maxwell term.
