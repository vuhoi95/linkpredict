Title: Scalar Kinks in Warped Extra Dimensions
Authors: Manuel Toharia and Mark Trodden and Eric J. West
Abstract: We study the existence and stability of static kink-like configurations of a 5D scalar field, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, along the extra dimension of a warped braneworld. In the presence of gravity such configurations fail to stabilize the size of the extra dimension, leading us to consider additional scalar fields with the role of stabilization. We numerically identify multiple nontrivial solutions for a given 5D action, made possible by the nonlinear nature of the background equations, which we find is enhanced in the presence of gravity. Finally, we take a first step towards addressing the question of the stability of such configurations by deriving the full perturbative equations for the gravitationally coupled multi-field system.
