Title: A-models in three and four dimensions
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Ketan Vyas
Abstract: We introduce and study a new 3d Topological Field Theory which can be associated to any compact real manifold X. This TFT is analogous to the 2d A-model and reduces to it upon compactification on an interval with suitable boundary conditions. It plays a role in 3d mirror symmetry as well as in the physical approach to the geometric Langlands duality. A similar TFT can be defined in four dimensions.
