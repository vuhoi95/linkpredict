Title: Warped embeddings between Einstein manifolds
Authors: Huan-Xiong Yang and Liu Zhao
Abstract: Warped embeddings from a lower dimensional Einstein manifold into a higher dimensional one are analyzed. Explicit solutions for the embedding metrics are obtained for all cases of codimension 1 embeddings and some of the codimension n>1 cases. Some of the interesting features of the embedding metrics are pointed out and potential applications of the embeddings are discussed.
