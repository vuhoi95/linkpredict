Title: The Omega Deformation, Branes, Integrability, and Liouville Theory
Authors: Nikita Nekrasov and Edward Witten
Abstract: We reformulate the Omega-deformation of four-dimensional gauge theory in a way that is valid away from fixed points of the associated group action. We use this reformulation together with the theory of coisotropic A-branes to explain recent results linking the Omega-deformation to integrable Hamiltonian systems in one direction and Liouville theory of two-dimensional conformal field theory in another direction.
