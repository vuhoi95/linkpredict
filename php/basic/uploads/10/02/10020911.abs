Title: Area spectra versus entropy spectra in black holes in topologically  massive gravity
Authors: Yongjoon Kwon and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We consider the area and entropy spectra of black holes in topologically massive gravity with gravitational Chern-Simons term. The examples we consider are the BTZ black hole and the warped AdS black hole. For the non-rotating BTZ black hole, the area and entropy spectra are equally spaced and independent of the coupling constant $\v$ of the Chern-Simons term. For the rotating BTZ black hole case, the spectra of the inner and outer horizon areas are not equally spaced in general and dependent of the coupling constant $\v$. However the entropy spectrum is equally spaced and independent of the coupling constant $\v$. For the warped AdS black holes for $\v >1$ by using the quasinormal modes obtained without imposing the boundary condition at radial infinity we find again that the entropy spectrum is equally spaced and independent of the coupling constant $\v$, while the spectra of the inner and outer horizon areas are not equally spaced and dependent of the coupling constant $\v$. Our result implies that the entropy spectrum has a universal behavior regardless of the presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term, and therefore it implies that the entropy is more `fundamental' than the horizon area.
