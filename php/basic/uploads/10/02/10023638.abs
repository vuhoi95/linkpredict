Title: 2d Wall-Crossing, R-twisting, and a Supersymmetric Index
Authors: Sergio Cecotti and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: Starting from N=2 supersymmetric theories in 2 dimensions, we formulate a novel time-dependent supersymmetric quantum theory where the R-charge is twisted along the time. The invariance of the supersymmetric index under variations of the action for these theories leads to two predictions: In the IR limit it predicts how the degeneracy of BPS states change as we cross the walls of marginal stability. On the other hand, its equivalence with the UV limit relates this to the spectrum of the U(1) R-charges of the Ramond ground states at the conformal point. This leads to a conceptually simple derivation of results previously derived using tt* geometry, now based on time-dependent supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
