Title: Short-distance and short-time structure of a unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Dam T. Son and Ethan G. Thompson
Abstract: We consider the operator product expansions for unitarity fermions. We compute the dynamic structure factor S(q,w) at large frequency and wavenumber away from the one-particle peak. The overall normalization of S(q,w) is determined by Tan's contact parameter, and the dependence on q and w is obtained in closed analytic form. We also find energy deposited into the system by small, rapid variations of the inverse scattering length.
