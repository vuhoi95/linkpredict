Title: A Warped Model of Dark Matter
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Benedict von Harling
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter in a warped extra dimension in which the dark sector mass scales are naturally generated without supersymmetry. The dark force, responsible for dark matter annihilating predominantly into leptons, is mediated by dark photons that naturally obtain a mass in the GeV range via a dilaton coupling. As well as solving the gauge hierarchy problem, our model predicts dark matter in the TeV range, including naturally tiny mass splittings between pseudo-Dirac states. By the AdS/CFT correspondence both the dark photon and dark matter are interpreted as composite states of the strongly-coupled dual 4d theory. Thus, in our model the dark sector emerges at the TeV scale from the dynamics of a new strong force.
