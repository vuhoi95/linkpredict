Title: Counting Orbifolds
Authors: John Davey and Amihay Hanany and Rak-Kyeong Seong
Abstract: We present several methods of counting the orbifolds C^D/Gamma. A correspondence between counting orbifold actions on C^D, brane tilings, and toric diagrams in D-1 dimensions is drawn. Barycentric coordinates and scaling mechanisms are introduced to characterize lattice simplices as toric diagrams. We count orbifolds of C^3, C^4, C^5, C^6 and C^7. Some remarks are made on closed form formulas for the partition function that counts distinct orbifold actions.
