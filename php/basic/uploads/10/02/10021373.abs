Title: Off-shell nilpotent finite BRST/anti-BRST transformations
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Sumit Kumar Rai and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We develop the off-shell nilpotent finite field dependent BRST transformations and show that for different choices of the finite field dependent parameter these connect the generating functionals corresponding to different effective theories. We also construct both on-shell and off-shell finite field dependent anti-BRST tranformations for Yang Mills theories and show that these transformations play the similar role in connecting different generating functionals of different effective theories. Analogous to the finite field dependent BRST transformations, the non-trivial Jacobians of the path integral measure which arise due to the finite field dependent anti-BRST transformations are responsible for the new results. We consider several explicit examples in each case to demonstrate the results.
