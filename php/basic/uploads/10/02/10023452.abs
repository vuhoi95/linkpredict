Title: Soft photon anomaly and gauge/string duality
Authors: Yoshitaka Hatta and Takahiro Ueda
Abstract: Motivated by the recent DELPHI report on the anomalous photon production in e^+e^- annihilation, we exactly calculate the inclusive cross section of soft photons in the strong coupling limit of N=4 super Yang-Mills. We find that the energy distribution is that of the Bremsstrahlung, while the angular distribution is spherical. Our result elucidates a new non-perturbative source of soft photons not associated with the final state hadronic Bremsstrahlung.
