Title: Rank Two ADHM Invariants and Wallcrossing
Authors: Wu-yen Chuang and Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Guang Pan
Abstract: Generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants corresponding to local D6-D2-D0 configurations are defined applying the formalism of Joyce and Song to ADHM sheaves on curves. A wallcrossing formula for invariants of D6-rank two is proven and shown to agree with the wallcrossing formula of Kontsevich and Soibelman. Using this result, the asymptotic D6-rank two invariants of (-1,-1) and (0,-2) local rational curves are computed in terms of the D6-rank one invariants.
