Title: Interacting holographic tachyon model of dark energy
Authors: Alberto Rozas-Fern√°ndez and David Brizuela and Norman Cruz
Abstract: We propose a holographic tachyon model of dark energy with interaction between the components of the dark sector. The correspondence between the tachyon field and the holographic dark energy densities allows the reconstruction of the potential and the dynamics of the tachyon scalar field in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We show that this model can describe the observed accelerated expansion of our universe with a parameter space given by the most recent observational results.
