Title: Higgs for Graviton: Simple and Elegant Solution
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: A Higgs mechanism for gravity is presented, where four scalars with global Lorentz symmetry are employed. We show that in the broken symmetry phase a graviton absorbs all scalars and become massive spin 2 particle with five degrees of freedom. The resulting theory is unitary and free of ghosts.
