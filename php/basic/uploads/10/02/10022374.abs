Abstract: We consider the gluon propagator $D(p^2)$ at various lattice sizes and spacings in the case of pure SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge theories using the Landau gauge fixing. We discuss a class of fits in the infrared region in order to (in)validate the tree level analytical prediction in terms of the (Refined) Gribov-Zwanziger framework. It turns out that an important role is played by the presence of the widely studied dimension two gluon condensate $\braket{A^2}$. Including this effect allows to obtain an acceptable fit up to 1 \'{a} 1.5 GeV, while corroborating the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger prediction for the gluon propagator. We also discuss the infinite volume extrapolation, leading to the estimate $D(0)=8.3\pm0.5\text{GeV}^{-2}$. As a byproduct, we can also provide the prediction $\braket{g^2 A^2}\approx 3\text{GeV}^2$ obtained at the renormalization scale $\mu=10\text{GeV}$.
