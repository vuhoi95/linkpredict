Title: On UV/IR Mixing via Seiberg-Witten Map for Noncommutative QED
Authors: Matti Raasakka and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: We consider quantum electrodynamics in noncommutative spacetime by deriving a $\theta$-exact Seiberg-Witten map with fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group as an expansion in the coupling constant. Accordingly, we demonstrate the persistence of UV/IR mixing in noncommutative QED with charged fermions via Seiberg-Witten map, extending the results of Schupp and You [1].
