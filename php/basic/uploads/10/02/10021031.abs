Title: F-Theory Grand Unification at the Colliders
Authors: Tianjun Li and James A. Maxin and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We predict the exact gaugino mass relation near the electroweak scale at one loop for gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in F-theory SU(5) and SO(10) models with U(1)_Y and U(1)_{B-L} fluxes, respectively. The gaugino mass relation introduced here differs from the typical gaugino mass relations studied thus far, and in general, should be preserved quite well at low energy. Therefore, these F-Theory models can be tested at the Large Hadron Collider and future International Linear Collider. We present two typical scenarios that satisfy all the latest experimental constraints and are consistent with the CDMS II experiment. In particular, the gaugino mass relation is indeed satisfied at two-loop level with only a very small deviation around the electroweak scale.
