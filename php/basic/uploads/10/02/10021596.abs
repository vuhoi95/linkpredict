Title: Energy loss and jet quenching parameter in a thermal non-relativistic,  non-commutative Yang-Mills plasma
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of a moving heavy quark through a hot non-relativistic, non-commutative Yang-Mills plasma. We discuss about the configuration of the static quark and obtain the quasi-normal modes. Also we find the diffusion constant for the moving heavy quark. The main goal of this study is calculating the jet-quenching parameter for the non-relativistic, non-commutative theory and comparing it with drag forces which recently obtained from the another independent work [1]
