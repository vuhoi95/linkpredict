Title: Investigation of restricted baby Skyrme models
Authors: C. Adam and T. Romanczukiewicz and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: A restriction of the baby Skyrme model consisting of the quartic and potential terms only is investigated in detail for a wide range of potentials. Further, its properties are compared with those of the corresponding full baby Skyrme models. We find that topological (charge) as well as geometrical (nucleus/shell shape) features of baby skyrmions are captured already by the soliton solutions of the restricted model. Further, we find a coincidence between the compact or non-compact nature of solitons in the restricted model, on the one hand, and the existence or non-existence of multi-skyrmions in the full baby Skyrme model, on the other hand.
