Title: The Yangian origin of the Grassmannian integral
Authors: J. M. Drummond and L. Ferro
Abstract: In this paper we analyse formulas which reproduce different contributions to scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory through a Grassmannian integral. Recently their Yangian invariance has been proved directly by using the explicit expression of the Yangian level-one generators. The specific cyclic structure of the form integrated over the Grassmannian enters in a crucial way in demonstrating the symmetry. Here we show that the Yangian symmetry fixes this structure uniquely.
