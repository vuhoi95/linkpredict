Authors: B. Charneski and M. Gomes and T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: In this work we present an analysis of the one-loop Slavnov-Taylor identities in noncommutative QED$_4$. The vectorial fermion-photon and the triple photon vertex functions were studied, with the conclusion that no anomalies arise.
