Title: A Solution of the Strong CP Problem Transforming the theta-angle to the  KM CP-violating Phase
Authors: J. Bordes and H. M. Chan and S. T. Tsou
Abstract: It is shown that in the scheme with a rotating fermion mass matrix (i.e. one with a scale-dependent orientation in generation space) suggested earlier for explaining fermion mixing and mass hierarchy, the theta-angle term in the QCD action of topological origin can be eliminated by chiral transformations, while giving still nonzero masses to all quarks. Instead, the effects of such transformations get transmitted by the rotation to the CKM matrix as the KM phase giving, for $\theta$ of order unity, a Jarlskog invariant typically of order $10^{-5}$ as experimentally observed. Strong and weak CP violations appear then as just two facets of the same phenomenon.
