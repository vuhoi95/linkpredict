Title: Analogues of D-branes in Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Kenichi Kasamatsu and Hiromitsu Takeuchi and Muneto Nitta and Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically that analogues of D-branes in string theory can be realized in rotating, phase-separated, two-component Bose-Einstein condensates and that they are observable using current experimental techniques. This study raises the possibility of simulating D-branes in the laboratory.
