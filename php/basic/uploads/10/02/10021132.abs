Title: Quantum gravitational corrections to the propagator in spacetimes with  constant curvature
Authors: Dawood Kothawala and S. Shankaranarayanan and L. Sriramkumar
Abstract: The existence of a minimal and fundamental length scale, say, the Planck length, is a characteristic feature of almost all the models of quantum gravity. The presence of the fundamental length is expected to lead to an improved ultra-violet behavior of the semi-classical propagators. The hypothesis of path integral duality provides a prescription to evaluate the modified propagator of a free, quantum scalar field in a given spacetime, taking into account the existence of the fundamental length in a locally Lorentz invariant manner. We use this prescription to compute the quantum gravitational modifications to the propagators in spacetimes with constant curvature, and show that: (i) the modified propagators are ultra-violet finite, and (ii) the modifications are non-perturbative in the Planck length. We discuss the implications of our results.
