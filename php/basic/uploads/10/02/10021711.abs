Title: Five-loop Konishi from the Mirror TBA
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov and Ryo Suzuki
Abstract: We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for the AdS_5 \times S^5 mirror model to derive the five-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator. We show numerically that the corresponding result perfectly agrees with the one recently obtained via the generalized Luscher formulae. This constitutes an important test of the AdS/CFT TBA system.
