Title: Heterotic Sigma Models with N=2 Space-Time Supersymmetry
Authors: Ilarion V. Melnikov and Ruben Minasian
Abstract: We study the non-linear sigma model realization of a heterotic vacuum with N=2 space-time supersymmetry. We examine the requirements of (0,2) + (0,4) world-sheet supersymmetry and show that a geometric vacuum must be described by a principal two-torus bundle over a K3 manifold.
