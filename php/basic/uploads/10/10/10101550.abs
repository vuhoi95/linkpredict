Title: The chiral magnetic effect in hydrodynamical approach
Authors: A. V. Sadofyev and M. V. Isachenkov
Abstract: In quark-gluon plasma nonzero chirality can be induced by the chiral anomaly. When a magnetic field is applied to a system with nonzero chirality an electromagnetic current is induced along the magnetic field. This phenomenon is called the chiral magnetic effect. In this paper appearance of the chiral magnetic effect in hydrodynamical approximation is shown. We consider a hydrodynamical model for chiral liquid with two independent currents of left and right handed particles in the presence of the chiral anomaly.
