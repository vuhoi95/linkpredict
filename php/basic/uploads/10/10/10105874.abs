Title: Dual Conformal Properties of Six-Dimensional Maximal Super Yang-Mills  Amplitudes
Authors: Tristan Dennen and Yu-tin Huang
Abstract: We demonstrate that the tree-level amplitudes of maximal super-Yang-Mills theory in six dimensions, when stripped of their overall momentum and supermomentum delta functions, are covariant with respect to the six-dimensional dual conformal group. Using the generalized unitarity method, we demonstrate that this property is also present for loop amplitudes. Since the six-dimensional amplitudes can be interpreted as massive four-dimensional ones, this implies that the six-dimensional symmetry is also present in the massively regulated four-dimensional maximal super-Yang-Mills amplitudes.
