Title: Generalized Unitarity and Six-Dimensional Helicity
Authors: Zvi Bern and John Joseph Carrasco and Tristan Dennen and Yu-tin Huang and Harald Ita
Abstract: We combine the unitarity method with the six-dimensional helicity formalism of Cheung and O'Connell to construct loop-level scattering amplitudes. As a first example, we construct dimensionally regularized QCD one-loop four-point amplitudes. As a nontrivial multiloop example, we confirm that the recently constructed four-loop four-point amplitude of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, including nonplanar contributions, is valid for dimensions less than or equal to six. We comment on the connection of our approach to the recently discussed Higgs infrared regulator and on dual conformal properties in six dimensions.
