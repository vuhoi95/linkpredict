Title: Type IIB Holographic Superfluid Flows
Authors: Daniel Arean and Matteo Bertolini and Chethan Krishnan and Tomas Prochazka
Abstract: We construct fully backreacted holographic superfluid flow solutions in a five-dimensional theory that arises as a consistent truncation of low energy type IIB string theory. We construct a black hole with scalar and vector hair in this theory, and study the phase diagram. As expected, the superfluid phase ceases to exist for high enough superfluid velocity, but we show that the phase transition between normal and superfluid phases is always second order. We also analyze the zero temperature limit of these solutions. Interestingly, we find evidence that the emergent IR conformal symmetry of the zero-temperature domain wall is broken at high enough velocity.
