Title: Bootstrapping Null Polygon Wilson Loops
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Juan Maldacena and Amit Sever and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We derive the two loop expressions for polygonal Wilson loops by starting from the one loop expressions and applying an operator product expansion. We do this for polygonal Wilson loops in R^{1,1} and find a result in agreement with previous computations. We also discuss the spectrum of excitations around flux tube that connects two null Wilson lines.
