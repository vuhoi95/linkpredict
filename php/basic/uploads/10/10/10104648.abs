Title: Parameter spaces of massive IIA solutions
Authors: Alessandro Tomasiello and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We find a new class of N=2 massive IIA solutions whose internal spaces are S^2 fibrations over S^2 x S^2. These solutions appear naturally as massive deformations of the type IIA reduction of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds in M-theory, including Q^{1,1,1} and Y^{p,k}, and play a role in the AdS4/CFT3 correspondence. We use this example to initiate a systematic study of the parameter space of massive solutions with fluxes. We define and study the natural parameter space of the solutions, which is a certain dense subset of R^3, whose boundaries correspond to orbifold or conifold singularities. On a codimension-one subset of the parameter space, where the Romans mass vanishes, it is possible to perform a lift to M-theory; extending earlier work, we produce a family A^{p,q,r} of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with cohomogeneity one and SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1) isometry. We also propose a Chern-Simons theory describing the duals of the massless and massive solutions.
