Abstract: In this work we consider $q-$form fields in a $p-$brane embedded in a $D=(p+2)$ space-time. The membrane is generated by a domain wall in a Randall-Sundrum-like scenario. We study conditions for localization of zero modes of these fields. The expression agrees and generalizes the one found for the zero, one, two and three-forms in a $3-$brane. By a generalization we mean that our expression is valid for any form in an arbitrary dimension with codimension one. We also point out that, even without the dilaton coupling, some form fields are localized in the membrane. The massive modes are considered and the resonances are calculated using a numerical method. We find that different spaces have identical resonance structures, which we call dual spaces of resonances(DSR).
