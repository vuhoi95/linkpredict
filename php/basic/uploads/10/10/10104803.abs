Title: Axions in the Landscape and String Theory
Authors: Michael Dine and Guido Festuccia and John Kehayias and Weitao Wu
Abstract: While axions seem ubiquitous in critical string theories, whether they might survive in any string theoretic description of nature is a difficult question. With some mild assumptions, one can frame the issues in the case that there is an approximate supersymmetry below the underlying string scale. The problem of axions is then closely tied to the question of how moduli are fixed. We consider, from this viewpoint, the possibility that supersymmetry is broken at an intermediate scale, as in "gravity mediation," at a low scale, as in gauge mediation, and at a very high scale, to model the possibility that there is no low energy supersymmetry. Putative mechanisms for moduli fixing can then be systematically classified, and at least for intermediate and high scale breaking, light axions appear plausible. In the course of this work, we are lead to consider aspects of moduli fixing and supersymmetry breaking, and we revisit the possibility of very large extra dimensions.
