Title: Emergent AdS_3 in the Zero Entropy Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Noriaki Ogawa and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We investigate the zero entropy limit of the near horizon geometries of D=4 and D=5 general extremal black holes with SL(2,R)xU(1)^{D-3} symmetry. We derive some conditions on the geometries from expectation of regularity. We then show that an AdS_3 structure emerges in a certain scaling limit, though the periodicity shrinks to zero. We present some examples to see the above concretely. We also comment on some implications to the Kerr/CFT correspondence.
