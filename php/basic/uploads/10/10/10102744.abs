Abstract: We have developed a concept of parallel existence of the ordinary (O) and hidden (H) worlds with a superstring-inspired E_6 unification, broken at the early stage of the Universe into SO(10) X U(1) - in the O-world, and SU(6)' X SU(2)' - in the H-world. As a result, we have obtained in the hidden world the low energy symmetry group G'_SM X SU(2)'_\theta, instead of the Standard Model group G_SM. The additional non-Abelian SU(2)'_\theta group with massless gauge fields, "thetons", is responsible for the dark energy. We present a baryogenesis mechanism with the B-L asymmetry produced by the conversion of ordinary leptons into particles of the hidden sector.
