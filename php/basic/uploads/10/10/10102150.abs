Title: New supersymmetric higher-derivative couplings: Full N=2 superspace does  not count!
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Stefanos Katmadas and Maaike van Zalk
Abstract: An extended class of N=2 locally supersymmetric invariants with higher-derivative couplings based on full superspace integrals, is constructed. These invariants may depend on unrestricted chiral supermultiplets, on vector supermultiplets and on the Weyl supermultiplet. Supersymmetry is realized off-shell. A non-renormalization theorem is proven according to which none of these invariants can contribute to the entropy and electric charges of BPS black holes. Some of these invariants may be relevant for topological string deformations.
