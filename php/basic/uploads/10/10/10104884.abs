Title: F-term Braneworld inflation in Light of Five-year WMAP observations
Authors: A. Bouaouda and R. Zarrouki and H. Chakir and M. Bennai
Abstract: We consider a supersymmetric hybrid inflation in the framework of the Randall-Sundrum type II Braneworld model. We drive an analytical expression for the scalar potential and find that the F-term dominates hybrid inflation process. We show that for some value of Brane tension we can eliminate the fine tuning problem related to coupling constant k of the potential: We also calculate all known spectrum inflation parameters and show that observational bounds from WMAP5, BAO and SN observations are satisfied.
