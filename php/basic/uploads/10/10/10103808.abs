Title: Dimensional reduction of the ABJM model
Authors: Horatiu Nastase and Constantinos Papageorgakis
Abstract: We dimensionally reduce the ABJM model, obtaining a two-dimensional theory that can be thought of as a 'master action'. This encodes information about both T- and S-duality, i.e. describes fundamental (F1) and D-strings (D1) in 9 and 10 dimensions. The Higgsed theory at large VEV and large k yields D1-brane actions in 9d and 10d, depending on which auxiliary fields are integrated out. For N=1 there is a map to a Green-Schwarz string wrapping a nontrivial circle in C^4/Z_k.
