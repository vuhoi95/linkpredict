Title: Note on Anomaly Cancellation on SO(32) heterotic 5-brane
Authors: Harunobu Imazato and Shun'ya Mizoguchi and Masaya Yata
Abstract: We show that the gauge, gravitational (tangent-bundle) and their mixed anomalies arising from the localized modes near a 5-brane in the SO(32) heterotic string theory cancel with the anomaly inflow from the bulk with the use of the Green-Schwarz mechanism on the brane, similarly to the E_8 x E_8 5-brane case. We also compare our result with Mourad's analysis performed in the small-instanton limit.
