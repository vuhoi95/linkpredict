Title: Jet Quenching Parameter via Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET)
Authors: Francesco D'Eramo and Hong Liu and Krishna Rajagopal
Abstract: We analyze the transverse momentum broadening in the absence of radiation of an energetic parton propagating through quark-gluon plasma via Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). We show that the probability for picking up transverse momentum k_\perp is given by the Fourier transform of the expectation value of two transversely separated light-like path-ordered Wilson lines. The subtleties about the ordering of operators do not change the \hat q value for the strongly coupled plasma of N=4 SYM theory.
