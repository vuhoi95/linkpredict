Title: Additional Light Waves in Hydrodynamics and Holography
Authors: A. Amariti and D. Forcella and A. Mariotti
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of additional light waves (ALWs), observed in crystal optics: two or more electromagnetic waves with the same polarization, but different refractive index, propagate simultaneously in a isotropic medium. We show that ALWs are common in relativistic hydrodynamics, and in particular in strongly coupled systems that admit a dual gravitational description, where the ALWs are dual to quasi normal modes in the AdS gravity. We study both the transverse and the longitudinal light wave propagation. In the longitudinal channel we find a transition between regimes with different number of excitonic resonances which resembles the transition to standard optics observed in crystals.
