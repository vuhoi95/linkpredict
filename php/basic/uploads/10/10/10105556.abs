Title: Equations of State in the Brans-Dicke cosmology
Authors: Hyung Won Lee and Kyoung Yee Kim and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We investigate the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory with the potential as cosmological model to explain the present accelerating universe. In this work, we consider the BD field as a perfect fluid with the energy density and pressure in the Jordan frame. Introducing the power-law potential and the interaction with the cold dark matter, we obtain the phantom divide which is confirmed by the native and effective equation of state. Also we can describe the metric $f(R)$ gravity with an appropriate potential, which shows a future crossing of phantom divide in viable $f(R)$ gravity models when employing the native and effective equations of state.
