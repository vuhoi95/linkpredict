Title: Generalized parton distributions in AdS/QCD
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt and Thomas Gutsche and Valery E. Lyubovitskij
Abstract: The nucleon helicity-independent generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of quarks are calculated in the zero skewness case, in the framework of the AdS/QCD model. The present approach is based on a matching procedure of sum rules relating the electromagnetic form factors to GPDs and AdS modes.
