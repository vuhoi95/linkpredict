Title: New 3-Brane Solutions in 5D Spacetime
Authors: Pavle Midodashvili and Levan Midodashvili
Abstract: In the article it is explicitly found new possible brane model solutions for the 5D spacetime physical set-up. These solutions require a ghost-like bulk scalar-field and the 3-brane at the origin of extra coordinate.
