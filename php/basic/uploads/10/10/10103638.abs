Title: Glueball masses from an infrared moment problem and nonperturbative  Landau gauge
Authors: D. Dudal and M. S. Guimaraes and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: We set up an infrared-based moment problem to obtain estimates of the masses of the scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor glueballs in Euclidean Yang-Mills theories using the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ) version of the Landau gauge, which takes into account nonperturbative physics related to gauge copies. Employing lattice input for the mass scales of the RGZ gluon propagator, the lowest order moment problem approximation gives the values m_{0++}\approx 1.96 GeV, m_{2++} \approx 2.04 GeV and m_{0-+}\approx 2.19 GeV in the SU(3) case, all within a 20% range of the corresponding lattice values. We also recover the mass hierarchy m_{0++}<m_{2++}<m_{0-+}.
