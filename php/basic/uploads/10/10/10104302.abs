Title: Standard Model Vacua for Two-dimensional Compactifications
Authors: Jonathan M. Arnold and Bartosz Fornal and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: We examine the structure of lower-dimensional standard model vacua for two-dimensional compactifications (on a 2D torus and on a 2D sphere). In the case of the torus we find a new standard model vacuum for a large range of neutrino masses consistent with experiment. Quantum effects play a crucial role in the existence of this vacuum. For the compactification on a sphere the classical terms dominate the effective potential for large radii and a stable vacuum is achieved only by introducing a large magnetic flux. We argue that there are no two-dimensional standard model vacua for compactifications on a surface of genus greater than one.
