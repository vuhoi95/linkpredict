Title: Particle Dynamics in Weakly Charged Extreme Kerr Throat
Authors: A. M. Al Zahrani and Valeri P. Frolov and Andrey A. Shoom
Abstract: We study dynamics of a test charged particle moving in a weakly charged extreme Kerr throat. Dynamical equations of the particle motion are solved in quadratures. We show explicitly that the Killing tensor of the Kerr spacetime becomes reducible in the extreme Kerr throat geometry. Special types of motion of particles and light are discussed.
