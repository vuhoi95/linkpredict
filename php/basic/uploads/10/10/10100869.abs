Title: On the equivalence of the Einstein-Hilbert and the Einstein-Palatini  formulations of general relativity for an arbitrary connection
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Josep M. Pons
Abstract: In the framework of the Einstein-Palatini formalism, even though the projective transformation connecting the arbitrary connection with the Levi Civita connection has been floating in the literature for a long time and perhaps the result was implicitly known in the affine gravity community, yet as far as we know Julia and Silva were the first to realise its gauge character. We rederive this result by using the Rosenfeld-Dirac-Bergmann approach to constrained Hamiltonian systems and do a comprehensive self contained analysis establishing the equivalence of the Einstein-Palatini and the metric formulations without having to impose the gauge choice that the connection is symmetric. We also make contact with the the Einstein-Cartan theory when the matter Lagrangian has fermions.
