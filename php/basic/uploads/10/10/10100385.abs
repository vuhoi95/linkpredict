Title: Interacting HDE and NADE in Brans-Dicke Chameleon Cosmology
Authors: Ahmad Sheykhi and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of one of us [1], we generalize this work to the case where the pressureless dark matter and the holographic dark energy do not conserve separately but interact with each other. We investigate the cosmological applications of interacting holographic dark energy in Brans-Dicke theory with chameleon scalar field which is non-minimally coupled to the matter field. We find out that in this model the phantom crossing can be constructed if the model parameters are chosen suitably. We also perform the study for the new agegraphic dark energy model and calculate some relevant cosmological parameters and their evolution.
