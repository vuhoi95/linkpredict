Title: A geometric approach to correlations and quark number susceptibilities
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Vinod Chandra and Bhupendra Nath Tiwari
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic geometry arising from the free energy for the 2- and 3-flavor finite temperature hot QCD near the critical temperature. We develop a geometric notion for QCD thermodynamics, relating it with the existing microscopic quantities, e.g. quark-number susceptibility, which appears naturally within an approximately self-consistent resummation of perturbative QCD. We further incorporate thermal fluctuations in the free energy, thus yielding the geometric properties of local and global chemical correlations. These investigations are perturbative in nature. Nevertheless, one could apply the same line of thought for the geometric realization of underlying quark susceptibilities, either in the fabric of lattice QCD or in that of non-perturbative QCD.
