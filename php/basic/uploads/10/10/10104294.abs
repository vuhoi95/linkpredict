Title: Reconstructing interacting new agegraphic polytropic gas model in  non-flat FRW universe
Authors: K. Karami and A. Abdolmaleki
Abstract: We study the correspondence between the interacting new agegraphic dark energy and the polytropic gas model of dark energy in the non-flat FRW universe. This correspondence allows to reconstruct the potential and the dynamics for the scalar field of the polytropic model, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe.
