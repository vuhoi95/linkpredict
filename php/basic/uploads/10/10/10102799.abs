Title: Exact renormalization group with optimal scale and its application to  cosmology
Authors: Benjamin Koch and Israel Ramirez
Abstract: Assuming an effective gravitational action with scale dependent coupling constants, a consistency condition for the local form of the cut-off scale is derived. The approach is applied to homogeneous cosmology and running couplings with an ultraviolet fixed point. Within the given approach this allows to derive bounds on the value of the fixed point.
