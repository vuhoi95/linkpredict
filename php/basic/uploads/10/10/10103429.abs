Authors: Bin Liu and Yun-Chuan Dai and Xian-Ru Hu and Jian-Bo Deng
Abstract: According to the formal holographic principle, a modification to the assumption of holographic principle in Verlinder's investigation of entropy force is obtained. A more precise relation between entropy and area in the holographic system is proposed. With the entropy corrections to the area-relation, we derivate Newton's laws and Einstein equation with a static spherically symmetric holographic screen. Furthermore we derived the correction terms to the modified Friedmann equation of the FRW universe starting from the holographic principle and the Debye model.
