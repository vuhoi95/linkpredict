Title: Non-Kahler heterotic rotations
Authors: Dario Martelli and James Sparks
Abstract: We study a supersymmetry-preserving solution-generating method in heterotic supergravity. In particular, we use this method to construct one-parameter non-Kahler deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds with a U(1) isometry, in which the complex structure remains invariant. We explain how to obtain corresponding solutions to heterotic string theory, up to first order in \alpha', by a modified form of the standard embedding. In the course of the paper we also show that Abelian heterotic supergravity embeds into type II supergravity, and note that the solution-generating method in this context is related to a dipole-type deformation when there is a field theory dual.
