Title: Resonant Trispectrum and a Dozen More Primordial N-point functions
Authors: Louis Leblond and Enrico Pajer
Abstract: We compute all N-point primordial curvature correlation functions from inflation at tree-level up to N of order ten or more depending on the choice of parameters. This is achieved for resonant inflationary models in which the inflaton potential has a periodic modulation on top of a slow-roll flat term. These models find a natural UV completion in string theory implementation of axion monodromy. Key to the success of our computation is the observation that gravitational interactions among the perturbations can be neglected, which we argue is justified for any model of inflation with parametrically large non-Gaussianity. We provide a comprehensive review and detailed derivations of known consistency relations for squeezed and collinear limits, and generalize them to any N-point function.
