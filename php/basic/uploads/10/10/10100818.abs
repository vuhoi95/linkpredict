Title: Diagrammar In Classical Scalar Field Theory
Authors: Enrico Cattaruzza and Ennio Gozzi and Antonio Francisco Neto
Abstract: In this paper we analyze perturbatively a g phi^4 classical field theory with and without temperature. In order to do that, we make use of a path-integral approach developed some time ago for classical theories. It turns out that the diagrams appearing at the classical level are many more than at the quantum level due to the presence of extra auxiliary fields in the classical formalism. We shall show that several of those diagrams cancel against each other due to a universal supersymmetry present in the classical path integral mentioned above. The same supersymmetry allows the introduction of super-fields and super-diagrams which considerably simplify the calculations and make the classical perturbative calculations almost "identical" formally to the quantum ones. Using the super-diagrams technique we develop the classical perturbation theory up to third order. We conclude the paper with a perturbative check of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
