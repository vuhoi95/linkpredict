Title: A Faddeev-Niemi Solution that Does Not Satisfy Gauss' Law
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Simone Giacomelli
Abstract: Faddeev and Niemi have proposed a reformulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in terms of a U(1) gauge theory with 8 off-shell degrees of freedom. We present a solution to Faddeev and Niemi's formulation which does not solve the SU(2) Yang-Mills Gauss constraints. This demonstrates that the proposed reformulation is inequivalent to Yang-Mills, but instead describes Yang-Mills coupled to a particular choice of external charge.
