Title: Uncovering the triple pomeron vertex from Wilson line formalism
Authors: G. A. Chirilli and L. Szymanowski and S. Wallon
Abstract: We compute the triple pomeron vertex from the Wilson line formalism, including both planar and non-planar contributions, and get perfect agreement with the result obtained in the Extended Generalized Logarithmic Approximation based on reggeon calculus.
