Title: Comments on Gaugino Mass and Landscape of Vacua
Authors: Yuichiro Nakai and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: In direct gauge mediation, gaugino masses often vanish at the leading order of supersymmetry breaking. Recently, this phenomenon is understood in connection with the global structure of vacua in O'Raifeartaigh-type models. In this note, we further explore a connection between gaugino masses and the landscape of vacua in more general situations, focusing on a few examples which demonstrate our idea. In particular, we present a calculable model with non-vanishing leading order gaugino masses on the lowest energy vacuum.
