Title: Spectrum of the Dirac Hamiltonian with the mass-hedgehog in arbitrary  dimension
Authors: Igor F. Herbut and Chi-Ken Lu
Abstract: It is shown that the square of the Dirac Hamiltonian with the isotropic mass-hedgehog potential in d dimensions is the number operator of fictitious bosons and fermions over d quantum states. This result allows one to obtain the complete spectrum and degeneracies of the Dirac Hamiltonian with the hedgehog mass configuration in any dimension. The result pertains to low-energy states in the core of a general superconducting or insulating vortex in graphene in two dimensions, and in the superconducting vortex at the topological - trivial insulator interface in three dimensions, for example. The spectrum in d=2 is also understood in terms of the underlying accidental SU(2) symmetry and the supersymmetry of the Hamiltonian.
