Title: Shear viscosity of a highly excited string and the black hole membrane  paradigm
Authors: Yuya Sasai and Ali Zahabi
Abstract: Black hole membrane paradigm states that a certain viscous membrane seems to be sitting on a stretched horizon of a black hole from the viewpoint of a distant observer. We show that the shear viscosity of the fictitious membrane can be reproduced by a highly excited string covering the stretched horizon except for a numerical coefficient.
