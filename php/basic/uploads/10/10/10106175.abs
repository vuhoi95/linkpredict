Title: Brane singularities and their avoidance
Authors: I. Antoniadis and S. Cotsakis and I. klaoudatou
Abstract: The singularity structure and the corresponding asymptotic behavior of a 3-brane coupled to a scalar field or to a perfect fluid in a five-dimensional bulk is analyzed in full generality using the method of asymptotic splittings. In the case of the scalar field, it is shown that the collapse singularity at a finite distance from the brane can be avoided only at the expense of making the brane world-volume positively or negatively curved. In the case where the bulk field content is parametrized by an analogue of perfect fluid with an arbitrary equation of state P=\gamma\rho between the `pressure' P and the `density' \rho, our results depend crucially on the constant fluid parameter \gamma: (i) For \gamma>-1/2, the flat brane solution suffers from a collapse singularity at finite distance, that disappears in the curved case. (ii) For \gamma<-1, the singularity cannot be avoided and it becomes of the big rip type for a flat brane. (iii) For -1<\gamma< or = -1/2, the surprising result is found that while the curved brane solution is singular, the flat brane is not, opening the possibility for a revival of the self-tuning proposal.
