Title: Higher-derivative gauge interactions of Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson theory  in N=1 superspace
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Shutaro Kobayashi
Abstract: We study the structure of the gauge sector of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory in the form proposed by van Raamsdonk, adapted to 3D, N=1 superspace. By using the novel Higgs mechanism proposed by Mukhi and Papageorgakis, we derive the manifestly N=1 supersymmetric higher-order terms (beyond the supersymmetric Yang-Mills action) that follow from the BLG theory in its expansion with respect to the inverse gauge coupling constant squared. We find that all those terms have at least one anti-commutator of the super-YM field strength superfields as a factor, and thus are reducible to the SYM terms with the higher (spacetime) derivatives.
