Title: Noncommutative QED+QCD and $Î²$-function for QED
Authors: M. M. Ettefaghi and M. Haghighat and R. Mohammadi
Abstract: QED based on $\theta$-unexpanded noncomutative space-time in contrast with the noncommutative QED based on $\theta$-expanded U(1) gauge theory via the Seiberg-Witten map, is one-loop renormalizable. Meanwhile it suffers from asymptotic freedom that is not in agreement with the experiment. We show that QED part of $U_\star(3)\times U_\star(1)$ gauge group as an appropriate gauge group for the noncommutative QED+QCD, is not only one-loop renormalizable but also has a $\beta$ function that can be positive, negative and even zero. In fact the $\beta$ function depends on the mixing parameter $\delta_{13}$ as a free parameter and it will be equal to its counterpart in the ordinary QED for $\delta_{13}=0.367\pi$.
