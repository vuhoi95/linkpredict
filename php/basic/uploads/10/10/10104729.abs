Title: Entropic Gravity, Phase-Space Noncommutativity and the Equivalence  Principle
Authors: Catarina Bastos and Orfeu Bertolami and Nuno Costa Dias and Jo√£o Nuno Prata
Abstract: We generalize E. Verlinde's entropic gravity reasoning to a phase-space noncommutativity set-up. This allow us to impose a bound on the product of the noncommutative parameters based on the Equivalence Principle. The key feature of our analysis is an effective Planck's constant that naturally arises when accounting for the noncommutative features of the phase-space.
