Title: Dirac Fermions in Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Abderrahim El Mouhafid
Abstract: We study a confined system of Dirac fermions in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field. Splitting the system into different regions, we determine their corresponding energy spectrum solutions. We underline their physical properties by considering the conservation energy where some interesting relations are obtained. These are used to discuss the reflexion and transmission coefficients for Dirac fermions and check the probability condition for different cases. We generalize the obtained results to a system with gap and make some analysis. After evaluating the current-carrying states, we analyze the Klein paradox and report interesting discussions.
