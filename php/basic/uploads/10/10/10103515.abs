Title: Classical and Quantum Mechanics with Poincare-Snyder Relativity
Authors: Otto C. W. Kong and Hung-Yi Lee
Abstract: The Poincar\'e-Snyder relativity was introduced in an earlier paper of ours as an extended form of Einstein relativity obtained by appropriate limiting setting of the full Quantum Relativity. The latter, with fundamental constants $\hbar$ and $G$ built into the symmetry, is supposed to be the relativity of quantum space-time. Studying the mechanics of Poincar\'e-Snyder relativity is an important means to get to confront the great challenge of constructing the dynamics of Quantum Relativity. The mechanics will also be of interest on its own, plausibly yielding prediction accessible to experiments. We write the straightforward canonical formulation here, and show that it yields sensible physics pictures. Besides the free particle case, we also give an explicit analysis of two particle collision as dictated by the formulation, as well as the case of a particle rebouncing from an insurmountable potential barrier in the time direction. The very interesting solution of particle-antiparticle creation and annihilation as interpreted in a the usual time evolution picture can be obtained, in the simple classical mechanics setting. We consider that a nontrivial success of the theory, giving confidence that the whole background approach is sensible and plausibly on the right track. We also sketch the quantum mechanics formulation, direct from the familiar canoincal quantization, matching to a relativity group geometric quantization formulation in a previous publication.
