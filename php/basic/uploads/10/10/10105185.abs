Title: The Fractionary Schr√∂dinger Equation, Green Functions and  Ultradistributions
Authors: A. L. De Paoli and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In this work, we generalize previous results about the Fractionary Schr\"{o}dinger Equation within the formalism of the theory of Tempered Ultradistributions. Several examples of the use of this theory are given. In particular we evaluate the Green's function for a free particle in the general case, for an arbitrary order of the derivative index.
