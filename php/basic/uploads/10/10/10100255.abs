Title: Stabilizing the Complex Structure in Heterotic Calabi-Yau Vacua
Authors: Lara B. Anderson and James Gray and Andre Lukas and Burt Ovrut
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the presence of gauge fields in heterotic Calabi-Yau compacitifications causes the stabilisation of some, or all, of the complex structure moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold while maintaining a Minkowski vacuum. Certain deformations of the Calabi-Yau complex structure, with all other moduli held fixed, can lead to the gauge bundle becoming non-holomorphic and, hence, non-supersymmetric. This leads to an F-term potential which stabilizes the corresponding complex structure moduli. We use 10- and 4-dimensional field theory arguments as well as a derivation based purely on algebraic geometry to show that this picture is indeed correct. An explicit example is presented in which a large subset of complex structure moduli is fixed. We demonstrate that this type of theory can serve as the hidden sector in heterotic vacua and can co-exist with realistic particle physics.
