Title: Closure of the algebra of constraints for a nonprojectable Hořava  model
Authors: Jorge Bellorín and Alvaro Restuccia
Abstract: We perform the Hamiltonian analysis for a nonprojectable Horava model whose potential is composed of R and R^2 terms. We show that Dirac's algorithm for the preservation of the constraints can be done in a closed way, hence the algebra of constraints for this model is consistent. The model has an extra, odd, scalar mode whose decoupling limit can be seen in a linear-order perturbative analysis on weakly varying backgrounds. Although our results for this model point in favor of the consistency of the Ho\v{r}ava theory, the validity of the full nonprojectable theory still remains unanswered.
