Title: Sum rules, plasma frequencies and Hall phenomenology in holographic  plasmas
Authors: Javier Mas and Jonathan P. Shock and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We study the AC optical and hall conductivities of Dp/Dq-branes intersections in the probe approximation and use sum-rules to study various associated transport coefficients. We determine that the presence of massive fundamental matter, as compared to massless fundamental matter described holographically by a theory with no dimensional defects, reduces the plasma frequency. We further show that this is not the case when the brane intersections include defects. We discuss in detail how to implement correctly the regularization of retarded Green's functions so that the dispersion relations are satisfied and the low energy behaviour of the system is physically realistic.
