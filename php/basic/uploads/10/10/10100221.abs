Title: On The Relativistic Classical Motion of a Radiating Spinning Particle in  a Magnetic Field
Authors: Arnab Kar and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We propose classical equations of motion for a charged particle with magnetic moment, taking radiation reaction into account. This generalizes the Landau-Lifshitz equations for the spinless case. In the special case of spin-polarized motion in a constant magnetic field (synchrotron motion) we verify that the particle does lose energy. Previous proposals did not predict dissipation of energy and also suffered from runaway solutions analogous to those of the Lorentz-Dirac equations of motion.
