Title: Klein tunneling in carbon nanostructures: a free particle dynamics in  disguise
Authors: Vit Jakubsky and Luis-Miguel Nieto and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: The absence of backscattering in metallic nanotubes as well as perfect Klein tunneling in potential barriers in graphene are the prominent electronic characteristics of carbon nanostructures. We show that the phenomena can be explained by a peculiar supersymmetry generated by a first order Hamiltonian and zero order supercharge operators. Like the supersymmetry associated with second order reflectionless finite-gap systems, it relates here the low-energy behavior of the charge carriers with the free particle dynamics.
