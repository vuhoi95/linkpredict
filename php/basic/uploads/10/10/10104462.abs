Title: Trapped Brane Features in DBI Inflation
Authors: Philippe Brax and Emeline Cluzel
Abstract: We consider DBI inflation with a quadratic potential and the effect of trapped branes on the inflationary fluctuations. When going through a trapped brane the effective potential of the inflaton receives a contribution whose effect is to induce a jump in the power spectrum of the inflaton perturbations. This feature appears in the power spectrum at a scale corresponding to the size of the sound horizon when the two branes cross each other.
