Abstract: We discuss statistics of vortices having zero-energy non-Abelian Majorana fermions inside them. Considering the system of multiple non-Abelian vortices, we derive a non-Abelian statistics that differs from the previously derived non-Abelian statistics. The new non-Abelian statistics presented here is given by a tensor product of two different groups, namely the non-Abelian statistics obeyed by the Abelian Majorana fermions and the Coxeter group. The Coxeter group is a symmetric group related to the symmetry of polytopes in a high-dimensional space. As the simplest example, we consider the case in which a vortex contains three Majorana fermions that are mixed with each other under the SO(3) transformations. We concretely present the representation of the Coxeter group in our case and its geometrical expressions in the high-dimensional Hilbert space constructed from non-Abelian Majorana fermions.
