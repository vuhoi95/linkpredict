Title: Kohn's Theorem, Larmor's Equivalence Principle and the Newton-Hooke  Group
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We consider non-relativistic electrons, each of the same charge to mass ratio, moving in an external magnetic field with an interaction potential depending only on the mutual separations, possibly confined by a harmonic trapping potential. We show that the system admits a "relativity group" which is a one-parameter family of deformations of the standard Galilei group to the Newton-Hooke group which is a Wigner-Inonu contraction of the de Sitter group. This allows a group-theoretic interpretation of Kohn's theorem and related results. Larmor's Theorem is used to show that the one-parameter family of deformations are all isomorphic. We study the "Eisenhart" or "lightlike" lift of the system, exhibiting it as a pp-wave. In the planar case, the Eisenhart lift is the Brdicka-Eardley-Nappi-Witten pp-wave solution of Einstein-Maxwell theory, which may also be regarded as a bi-invariant metric on the Cangemi-Jackiw group.
