Title: Non-Gaussianity from Compositeness
Authors: G. L. Alberghi and R. Casadio
Abstract: By assuming the field seeding the curvature perturbations $ \zeta $ is a dynamically arising condensate, we are able to derive the relation $ f_{NL} ^2 \simeq 10^8 H / M_c $ between the non-Gaussianity parameter $ f_{NL} $ and the ratio of the inflationary scale $ H $ to the cutoff scale $ M_c $ of the effective theory describing the condensate, thus relating the experimental bound on $ f_{NL} $ to a bound on $ M_c $.
