Title: The Momentum Kernel of Gauge and Gravity Theories
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Poul H. Damgaard and Thomas Sondergaard and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for factorizing an $n$-point closed string amplitude into open string amplitudes. Our results are phrased in terms of a momentum kernel which in the limit of infinite string tension reduces to the corresponding field theory kernel. The same momentum kernel encodes the monodromy relations which lead to the minimal basis of color-ordered amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory. There are interesting consequences of the momentum kernel pertaining to soft limits of amplitudes. We also comment on surprising links between gravity and certain combinations of kinematic and color factors in gauge theory.
