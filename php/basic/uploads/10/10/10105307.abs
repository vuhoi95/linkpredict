Title: Anisotropic Power-law Inflation
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda and Masa-aki Watanabe
Abstract: We study an inflationary scenario in supergravity model with a gauge kinetic function. We find exact anisotropic power-law inflationary solutions when both the potential function for an inflaton and the gauge kinetic function are exponential type. The dynamical system analysis tells us that the anisotropic power-law inflation is an attractor for a large parameter region.
