Title: The effect of curvature in thawing models
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Victor H. Cardenas and Ramon Herrera
Abstract: We study the evolution of spatial curvature for thawing class of dark energy models. We examine the evolution of the equation of state parameter, $w_\phi$, as a function of the scale factor $a$, for the case in which the scalar field $\phi$ evolve in nearly flat scalar potential. We show that all such models provide the corresponding approximate analytical expressions for $w_\phi(\Omega_\phi,\Omega_k)$ and $w_\phi(a)$. We present observational constraints on these models.
