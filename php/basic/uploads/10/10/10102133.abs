Title: Constraint structure and Hamiltonian treatment of Nappi-Witten model
Authors: Mehdi Dehghani and Ahmad Shirzad
Abstract: We investigate the Hamiltonian analysis of Nappi-Witten model (WZW action based on non semi simple gauge group) and find a time dependent non-commutativity by canonical quantization. Our procedure is based on constraint analysis of the model in two parts. A first class analysis is used for gauge fixing the original model following by a second class analysis in which the boundary condition are treated as Dirac constraints. We find the reduced phase space by imposing our second class constraints on the variables in an extended Fourier space.
