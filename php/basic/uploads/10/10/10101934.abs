Title: Role and Properties of Wilson Lines in Transverse-Momentum-Dependent  Parton Distribution Functions

Abstract: We summarize the renormalization-group properties of transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDF)s arguing that in the light-cone gauge the overlapping ultraviolet and rapidity divergences cannot be solely controlled by (dimensional) regularization, but necessitate their renormalization. In doing so, we show that at the one-loop order this additional divergence entails an anomalous dimension which can be attributed to a cusp in the gauge contour at light-cone infinity. Then, we present a recent analysis of TMD PDFs which incorporates in the gauge links the Pauli term $\sim F^{\mu\nu}[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu]$. This generalized treatment of gauge invariance is shown to be justified, in the sense that it does not modify the behavior of the leading-twist contribution, though it contributes to the anomalous dimension of that of twist-three. An important consequence of the inclusion of the spin-dependent Pauli term is the appearance of a constant phase---the same for the leading twist-two and subleading distribution functions---that ensues from the interaction of the Pauli term in the transverse gauge link with the gauge field accompanying the fermion. Remarkably, this phase has opposite sign for the Drell-Yan process as compared to the semi-inclusive DIS.
