Title: Scale Invariance as a Solution to the Cosmological Constant Problem
Authors: Pankaj Jain and Subhadip Mitra and Sukanta Panda and Naveen K. Singh
Abstract: We show that scale invariance provides a solution to the fine tuning problem of the cosmological constant. We construct a generalization of the standard model of particle physics which displays exact quantum scale invariance. The matter action is invariant under global scale transformations in arbitrary dimensions. However the gravitational action breaks scale invariance explicitly. The scale symmetry is broken spontaneously in the matter sector of the theory. We show that the contribution to the vacuum energy and hence the cosmological constant is identically zero from the matter sector within the full quantum theory. However the gravitational sector may give non-zero contributions to the cosmological constant at loop orders. No fine tuning may be required at loop orders since the matter sector gives zero contribution to the cosmological constant. We also show that we do not require full scale invariance in order to constrain the vacuum energy from the matter sector. We only require invariance under pseudoscale transformations. Using this idea and motivated by the concept of unimodular gravity we propose an alternative model. In this case also we show that matter sector gives exactly zero contribution to the vacuum energy.
