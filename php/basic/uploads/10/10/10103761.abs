Title: Yangian symmetry of the Y=0 maximal giant graviton
Authors: Niall MacKay and Vidas Regelskis
Abstract: We study the remnants of Yangian symmetry of AdS/CFT magnons reflecting from boundaries with no degrees of freedom. We present the generalized twisted boundary Yangian of open strings ending on boundaries which preserve only a subalgebra h of the bulk algebra g, where (g,h) is a symmetric pair. This is realized by open strings ending on the D3 brane known as the Y=0 maximal giant graviton in AdS_5 x S^5. We also consider the Yangian symmetry of the boundary which preserves an su(1|2) subalgebra only.
