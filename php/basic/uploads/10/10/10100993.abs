Abstract: Recently, Dymarsky, Kuperstein and Sonnenschein constructed an embedding of flavor D7- and anti-D7-branes in the Klebanov-Strassler geometry that breaks the supersymmetry of the background, yet is stable. In this article, we study in detail the spectrum of vector mesons in this new model of flavor chiral symmetry breaking and commence an analytical analysis of the scalar mesons in this setup.
