Title: Entangled states in quantum cosmology and the interpretation of Lambda
Authors: S. Capozziello and O. Luongo
Abstract: The cosmological constant $\Lambda$ can be achieved as the result of entangled and statistically correlated minisuperspace cosmological states, built up by using a minimal choice of observable quantities, i.e. $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{k}$, which assign the cosmic dynamics. In particular, we consider a cosmological model where two regions, corresponding to two correlated eras, are involved; the present universe description would be, in this way, given by a density matrix $\hat \rho$, corresponding to an entangled final state. Starting from this assumption, it is possible to infer some considerations on the cosmic thermodynamics by evaluating the Von Neumann entropy. The correlation between different regions by the entanglement phenomenon results in the existence of $\Lambda$ (in particular $\Omega_{\Lambda}$) which could be interpreted in the framework of the recent astrophysical observations. As a byproduct, this approach could provide a natural way to solve the so called coincidence problem.
