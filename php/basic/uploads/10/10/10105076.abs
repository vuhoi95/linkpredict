Title: BPS Monopoles and Open Spin Chains
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Theodora Ioannidou
Abstract: We construct SU(n+1) BPS spherically symmetric monopoles with minimal symmetry breaking by solving the full Weyl equation. In this context, we explore and discuss the existence of open spin chain-like part within the Weyl equation. For instance, in the SU(3) case the relevant spin chain is the 2-site spin 1/2 XXX chain with open boundary conditions. We exploit the existence of such a spin chain part in order to solve the full Weyl equation.
