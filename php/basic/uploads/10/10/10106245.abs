Title: A UV completion of scalar electrodynamics
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Xue-Yan Lin
Abstract: In previous works, we constructed UV-finite and unitary scalar field theories with an infinite spectrum of propagating modes for arbitrary polynomial interactions. In this paper, we introduce infinitely many massive vector fields into a U(1) gauge theory to construct a theory with UV-finiteness and unitarity.
