Title: Angular momentum at null infinity in five dimensions
Authors: Kentaro Tanabe and Norihiro Tanahashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: In this paper, using the Bondi coordinates, we discuss the angular momentum at null infinity in five dimensions and address the Poincare covariance of the Bondi mass and angular momentum. We also show the angular momentum loss/gain law due to gravitational waves. In four dimensions, the angular momentum at null infinity has the supertranslational ambiguity and then it is known that we cannot construct well-defined angular momentum there. On the other hand, we would stress that we can define angular momentum at null infinity without any ambiguity in higher dimensions. This is because of the non-existence of supertranslations in higher dimensions.
