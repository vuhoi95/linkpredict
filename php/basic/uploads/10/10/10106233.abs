Abstract: Seeking a possible explanation for recent data indicating a space-time variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio within the Milky Way, we consider a phenomenological model where the effective fermion masses depend on the local value of the Weyl tensor. We contrast the required values of the model's free parameters with bounds obtained from modern tests on the violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle and we find that these quantities are incompatible. This result indicates that the variation of nucleon and electron masses through a coupling with the Weyl tensor is not a viable model.
