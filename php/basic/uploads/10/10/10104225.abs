Title: Thermodynamic Geometric Stability of Quarkonia states
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Vinod Chandra and Bhupendra Nath Tiwari
Abstract: We compute exact thermodynamic geometric properties of the non-abelian quarkonium bound states from the consideration of one-loop strong coupling. From the general statistical principle, the intrinsic geometric nature of strongly coupled QCD is analyzed for the Columbic, rising and Regge rotating regimes. Without any approximation, we have obtained the non-linear mass effect for the Bloch-Nordsieck rotating strongly coupled quarkonia. For a range of physical parameters, we show in each cases that there exists a well-defined, non-degenerate, curved, intrinsic Riemannian manifold. As the gluons become softer and softer, we find in the limit of the Bloch-Nordsieck resummation that the strong coupling obtained from the Sudhakov form factor possesses exact local and global thermodynamic properties of the underlying mesons, kaons and $D_s$ particles.
