Title: Correlation functions for Galilean conformal invariant field theory
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: In this paper we consider non-relativistic-conformal group, then we calculate two point function for the fields that are Galilean conformal-invariant, then we show that the correlation function for Galilean conformal-invariant fields in $d=2$ are different from $d\neq2$. Our result in $d\neq2$ is different with previous results in \cite{3}.
