Title: Tunneling of Dirac particles from accelerating and rotating black holes
Authors: Usman A. Gillani and K. Saifullah
Abstract: Hawking radiation from black holes has been studied as a phenomenon of quantum tunneling of particles through their horizons. We have extended this approach to study the tunneling of Dirac particles from a large class of black holes which includes those with acceleration and rotation as well. We have calculated the tunneling probability of incoming and outgoing particles, and recovered the correct Hawking temperature by this method.
