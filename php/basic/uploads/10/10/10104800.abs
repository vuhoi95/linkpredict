Title: Holography for chiral scale-invariant models
Authors: R. N. Caldeira Costa and Marika Taylor
Abstract: Deformation of any d-dimensional conformal field theory by a constant null source for a vector operator of dimension (d + z -1) is exactly marginal with respect to anisotropic scale invariance, of dynamical exponent z. The holographic duals to such deformations are AdS plane waves, with z=2 being the Schrodinger geometry. In this paper we explore holography for such chiral scale-invariant models. The special case of z=0 can be realized with gravity coupled to a scalar, and is of particular interest since it is related to a Lifshitz theory with dynamical exponent two upon dimensional reduction. We show however that the corresponding reduction of the dual field theory is along a null circle, and thus the Lifshitz theory arises upon discrete light cone quantization of an anisotropic scale invariant field theory.
