Title: Holographic Q-picture of Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS Black Hole
Authors: Bin Chen and Chiang-Mei Chen and Bo Ning
Abstract: In this article, we show that a four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole could be described by two different holographic two-dimensional conformal field theories. The first description, in view of the angular momentum, has been well discussed in (arXiv:1006.0157). The other alternative dual picture, however, is somehow overlooked. This new description, in view of the charge, provides another holographic correspondence. This picture again is supported not only by the match of the macroscopic entropy with the counting of microscopic degrees of freedom via the Cardy formula and also by the agreement on the real-time correlator in the superradiant scattering.
