Title: A realist interpretation of quantum mechanics based on undecidability  due to gravity
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Luis Pedro Garcia-Pintos and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We summarize several recent developments suggesting that solving the problem of time in quantum gravity leads to a solution of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. This approach has been informally called "the Montevideo interpretation". In particular we discuss why definitions in this approach are not "for all practical purposes" (fapp) and how the problem of outcomes is resolved.
