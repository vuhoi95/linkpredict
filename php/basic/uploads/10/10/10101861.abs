Title: Spinning branes in Riemann-Cartan spacetime
Authors: Milovan Vasilic and Marko Vojinovic
Abstract: We use the conservation law of the stress-energy and spin tensors to study the motion of massive brane-like objects in Riemann-Cartan geometry. The world-sheet equations and boundary conditions are obtained in a manifestly covariant form. In the particle case, the resultant world-line equations turn out to exhibit a novel spin-curvature coupling. In particular, the spin of a zero-size particle does not couple to the background curvature. In the string case, the world-sheet dynamics is studied for some special choices of spin and torsion. As a result, the known coupling to the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric external field is obtained. Geometrically, the Kalb-Ramond field has been recognized as a part of the torsion itself, rather than the torsion potential.
