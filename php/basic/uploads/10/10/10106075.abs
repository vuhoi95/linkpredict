Title: Lifshitz-like Janus Solutions
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Hiroaki Tanaka
Abstract: We construct Lifshitz-like Janus solutions in the Einstein-scalar theory with cosmological constant in arbitrary dimensions. They are holographically dual to z=2 Lifshitz-like field theories with a defect. The four-dimensional solutions can be embedded into type IIB supergravity as dilatonic deformations of AdS_5 x Y^5 with three-form field strengths, where Y^5 is a five-dimensional Einstein manifold.
