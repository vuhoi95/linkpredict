Title: Multi-scalar field cosmology from SFT: an exactly solvable approximation
Authors: Federico Galli and Alexey S. Koshelev
Abstract: We consider the appearance of multiple scalar fields in SFT inspired non-local models with a single scalar field at late times. In this regime all the scalar fields are free. This system minimally coupled to gravity can be analyzed approximately or numerically. The main result of this note is the introduction of an exactly solvable model which obeys an exact solution in the cosmological context for the Friedmann equations and that reproduces the behavior expected from SFT in the asymptotic regime. Different applications of such a potential to multi-field cosmological models are discussed.
