Title: Axions Scattering From a Quadrupole Magnetic Field
Authors: Eduardo I. Guendelman and Shay Leizerovitch and Idan Shilon
Abstract: We study the 2D scattering of axions from an accelerator like quadrupole magnet using the eikonal approximation in order to learn whether or not such a setup could serve as a new possible method for detecting axions on terrestrial experiments. The eikonal approximation in 2D is introduced and explained. We also apply the eikonal approximation to two known cases in order to compare it with previous results, obtained using Born's approximation, and discuss its correctness.
