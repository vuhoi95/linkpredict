Title: Thermodynamics of accelerating and rotating black holes
Authors: Muhammad Bilal and K. Saifullah
Abstract: Thermodynamics of a large family of black holes from electrovacuum solutions of Einstein's equations is studied. This family includes rotating and non-accelerating black holes with NUT charge, and rotating and accelerating black holes. The surface gravity, Hawking temperature and the area laws for these black holes are presented. The first law of thermodynamics is also given. An interesting outcome of our analysis is the restriction obtained on the magnitude of acceleration for these black holes.
