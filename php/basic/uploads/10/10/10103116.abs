Title: Double-delta potentials: one dimensional scattering. The Casimir effect  and kink fluctuations
Authors: J. Mateos Guilarte and Jose M. Muñoz-Castañeda
Abstract: The path is explored between one-dimensional scattering through Dirac-$\delta$ walls and one-dimensional quantum field theories defined on a finite length interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is found that two $\delta$'s are related to the Casimir effect whereas two $\delta$'s plus the first transparent P$\ddot{\rm o}$sch-Teller well arise in the context of the sine-Gordon kink fluctuations, both phenomena subjected to Dirichlet boundary conditions. One or two delta wells will be also explored in order to describe absorbent plates, even though the wells lead to non unitary Quantum Field Theories.
