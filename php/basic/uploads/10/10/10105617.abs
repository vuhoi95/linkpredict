Title: Boundary finite size corrections for multiparticle states and planar  AdS/CFT
Authors: Zoltan Bajnok and Laszlo Palla
Abstract: We propose formulas for the L\"uscher type finite size energy correction of multiparticle states on the interval and evaluate them for the simplest case in the AdS/CFT setting. By this we determine the leading wrapping correction to the anomalous dimension of the simplest determinant type operator, which corresponds to a one particle state on the Y=0 brane.
