Title: Computing 1/N^2 corrections in AdS/CFT
Authors: James T. Liu and Ruben Minasian
Abstract: Stringy corrections in AdS/CFT generally fall into the category of either \alpha' effects or string loop effects, corresponding to 1/\lambda and 1/N corrections, respectively, in the dual field theory. While \alpha'^3R^4 corrections have been well studied, at least in the context of N=4 super-Yang-Mills, less is known about the 1/N^2 corrections arising from closed string loops. In this paper, we consider AdS_5 x SE_5 compactifications of the IIB string, and compute the closed string loop correction to the anomaly coefficients a and c in the dual field theory. For T^{1,1} reductions, we find the string loop correction to yield c-a=1/24, which is the contribution to c-a of a free N=2 hypermultiplet. We also comment on reductions to lower dimensional AdS theories as well as the nature of T-duality with higher derivatives.
