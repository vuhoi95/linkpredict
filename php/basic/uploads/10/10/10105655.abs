Title: A slice of AdS_5 as the large N limit of Seiberg duality
Authors: Steven Abel and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: A slice of AdS_5 is used to provide a 5D gravitational description of 4D strongly-coupled Seiberg dual gauge theories. An (electric) SU(N) gauge theory in the conformal window at large N is described by the 5D bulk, while its weakly coupled (magnetic) dual is confined to the IR brane. This framework can be used to construct an N = 1 MSSM on the IR brane, reminiscent of the original Randall-Sundrum model. In addition, we use our framework to study strongly-coupled scenarios of supersymmetry breaking mediated by gauge forces. This leads to a unified scenario that connects the extra-ordinary gauge mediation limit to the gaugino mediation limit in warped space.
