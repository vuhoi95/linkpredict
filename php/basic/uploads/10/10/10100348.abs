Title: Refined Wall-Crossing, Free Fermions and Crystal Melting
Authors: Haitao Liu and Jie Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we use an M-theory model to conjecture the refined reminiscence of the OSV formula connecting the refined topological string partition function with the refined BPS states partition function for the toric Calabi-Yau threefolds without any compact four cycles. Further, we show how to use the vertex operators in 2d free fermions to reproduce the refined BPS states partition function for the $\mathbb{C}^3$ case and the wall-crossing formulas of the refined BPS states partition function for the resolved conifold and $\mathcal{O}(-2)\oplus\mathcal{O}\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ cases.
