Authors: E. Bavarsad and M. Haghighat and R. Mohammadi
Abstract: The nucleon-nucleon scattering in a large magnetic background is considered to find its potential to change the neutrino emissivity of the neutron stars. For this purpose we consider the one-pion-exchange approximation to find the NN cross-section in a background field as large as $10^{15}\texttt{G}-10^{18}\texttt{G}$. We show that the NN cross-section in neutron stars with temperatures in the range 0.1-5 \texttt{MeV} can be changed up to the one order of magnitude with respect to the one in the absence of the magnetic field. In the limit of the soft neutrino emission the neutrino emissivity can be written in terms of the NN scattering amplitude therefore the large magnetic fields can dramatically change the neutrino emissivity of the neutron stars as well.
