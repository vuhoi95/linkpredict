Title: One-dimensional structures behind twisted and untwisted superYang-Mills  theory
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: We give a one-dimensional interpretation of the four-dimensional twisted N=1 superYang-Mills theory on a Kaehler manifold by performing an appropriate dimensional reduction. We prove the existence of a 6-generator superalgebra, which does not possess any invariant Lagrangian but contains two different subalgebras that determine the twisted and untwisted formulations of the N=1 superYang-Mills theory.
