Title: Q-balls with scalar charges
Authors: V. Rubakov and A. Levin
Abstract: We consider Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin Q-balls in a (3+1)-dimensional model with vanishing scalar potential of one of the fields. The Q-ball is stabilized by the gradient energy of this field and carries scalar charge, over and beyond the global charge. The latter property is inherent also in a model with the scalar potential that does not vanish in some finite field region near the origin.
