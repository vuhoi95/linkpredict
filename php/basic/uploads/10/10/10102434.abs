Title: Black Holes in Born-Infeld Extended New Massive Gravity
Authors: Ahmad Ghodsi and Davood Mahdavian Yekta
Abstract: In this paper we find different types of black holes for the Born-Infeld extended new massive gravity. Our solutions include (un)charged warped (A)dS black holes for four and six derivative expanded action. We also look at the black holes in unexpanded BI action. In each case we calculate the entropy, angular momentum and mass of the black holes. We also find the central charges for the CFT duals.
