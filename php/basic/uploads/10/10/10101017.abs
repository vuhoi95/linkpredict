Title: On Vector Meson Masses in a Holographic SQCD
Authors: Aldo L. Cotrone and Anatoly Dymarsky and Stanislav Kuperstein
Abstract: We study probe flavor branes supersymmetrically embedded in the Klebanov-Strassler background. The embedding is controlled by a single complex parameter mu related to the quark mass. We study the spectrum of the vector mesons as a function of mu and compare it with the experimental data. Assuming that the rho(2150) meson is a 3S mode we find a remarkable agreement with the masses of the lightest excited rho-mesons. Also, for a certain range of parameters our model exhibits an unusual behavior. The mesons built of the lighter quarks become more heavy than the ones built of the heavier quarks. We comment on a possible connection this phenomenon may have with the masses of the putative pure strange-anti strange mesons.
