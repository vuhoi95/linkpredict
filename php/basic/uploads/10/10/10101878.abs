Title: Completing the Web of $Z_3$ - Quotients of Complete Intersection  Calabi-Yau Manifolds
Authors: Philip Candelas and Andrei Constantin
Abstract: We complete the study of smooth $Z_3$-quotients of complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds by discussing the six new manifolds that admit free $Z_3$ actions that were discovered discovered recently by Braun. These manifolds were missed in an earlier work and complete the web of smooth $Z_3$-quotients in a nice way. We discuss the transitions between these manifolds and include also the other manifolds of the web. This leads to the conclusion that the web of $Z_3$-free quotients of complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds is connected by conifold transitions.
