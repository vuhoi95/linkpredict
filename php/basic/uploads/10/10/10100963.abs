Title: A Supersymmetric Lagrangian for Fermionic Fields with Mass Dimension One
Authors: Kai E. Wunderle and Rainer Dick
Abstract: We present the derivation of a supersymmetric model for fermionic fields with integer valued mass dimension based on a general superfield with one free spinor index. First, we demonstrate that it is impossible to formulate such a model based on a general scalar superfield. This is due to problems constructing a Lagrangian containing a kinetic term for the fermionic mass dimension one field, as well as problems deriving a consistent second quantisation. We then develop a formalism based on a general superfield with one free spinor index. We systematically derive all associated chiral and anti-chiral superfields up to third order in covariant derivatives. Using this formalism we are able to construct a supersymmetric on-shell Lagrangian that contains a kinetic term for the fermionic fields with mass dimension one. We then derive the corresponding on-shell supercurrent and succeed to formulate a consistent second quantisation for the component fields. Finally, we present our result for a supersymmetric Hamiltonian. As the Lagrangian is by construction supersymmetric and the Hamiltonian was derived from the Lagrangian using the supersymmetry algebra the Hamiltonian must be positive definite.
