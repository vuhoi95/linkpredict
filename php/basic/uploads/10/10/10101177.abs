Title: On stable higher spin states in Heterotic String Theories
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Luca Lopez and Robert Richter
Abstract: We study properties of 1/2 BPS Higher Spin states in heterotic compactifications with extended supersymmetry. We also analyze non BPS Higher Spin states and give explicit expressions for physical vertex operators of the first two massive levels. We then study on-shell tri-linear couplings of these Higher Spin states and confirm that BPS states with arbitrary spin cannot decay into lower spin states in perturbation theory. Finally, we consider scattering of vector bosons off higher spin BPS states and extract form factors and polarization effects in various limits.
