Title: Hamiltonian analysis of BHT massive gravity
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian structure of the Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend (BHT) massive gravity with a cosmological constant. In the space of coupling constants $(\Lambda_0,m^2)$, our canonical analysis reveals the special role of the condition $\Lambda_0/m^2\neq-1$. In this sector, the dimension of the physical phase space is found to be $N^*=4$, which corresponds to two Lagrangian degree of freedom. When applied to the AdS asymptotic region, the canonical approach yields the conserved charges of the BTZ black hole, and central charges of the asymptotic symmetry algebra.
