Title: a-Maximization in N=1 Supersymmetric Spin(10) Gauge Theories
Authors: Teruhiko Kawano and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: A summary is reported on our previous publications about four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Spin(10) gauge theory with chiral superfields in the spinor and vector representations in the non-Abelian Coulomb phase. Carrying out the method of a-maximization, we studied decoupling operators in the infrared and the renormalization flow of the theory. We also give a brief review on the non-Abelian Coulomb phase of the theory after recalling the unitarity bound and the a-maximization procedure in four-dimensional conformal field theory. This is a review article invited to International Journal of Modern Physics A.
