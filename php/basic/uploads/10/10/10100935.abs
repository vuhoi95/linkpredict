Abstract: In the two-Higgs-doublet model (THDM), generalized-CP transformations (phi_i--> X_{ij} phi_j^* where X is unitary) and unitary Higgs-family transformations (phi_i--> U_{ij} phi_j) have recently been examined in a series of papers. In terms of gauge-invariant bilinear functions of the Higgs fields phi_i, the Higgs-family transformations and the generalized-CP transformations possess a simple geometric description. Namely, these transformations correspond in the space of scalar-field bilinears to proper and improper rotations, respectively. In this formalism, recent results relating generalized CP transformations with Higgs-family transformations have a clear geometric interpretation.
