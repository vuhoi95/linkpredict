Title: New generalized nonspherical black hole solutions
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu and Maria J. Rodriguez
Abstract: We present numerical evidence for the existence of several types of static black hole solutions with a nonspherical event horizon topology in $d\geq 6$ spacetime dimensions. These asymptotically flat configurations are found for a specific metric ansatz and can be viewed as higher dimensional counterparts of the $d=5$ static black rings, dirings and black Saturn. Similar to that case, they are supported against collapse by conical singularities. The issue of rotating generalizations of these solutions is also considered.
