Title: A remark on the three approaches to 2D Quantum gravity
Authors: A. Belavin and M. Bershtein and G. Tarnopolsky
Abstract: The one-matrix model is considered. The generating function of the correlation numbers is defined in such a way that this function coincide with the generating function of the Liouville gravity. Using the Kontsevich theorem we explain that this generating function is an analytic continuation of the generating function of the Topological gravity. We check the topological recursion relations for the correlation functions in the $p$-critical Matrix model.
