Title: Four curious supergravities
Authors: M. J. Duff and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We consider four supergravities with 16+16, 32+32, 64+64, 128+128 degrees of freedom displaying some curious properties: (1) They exhibit minimal supersymmetry (N=1, 2, 2, 1) but maximal rank (r=7, 6, 4, 0) of the scalar coset in D=4, 5, 7, 11. (2) They couple naturally to supermembranes and admit these membranes as solutions. (3) Although the D=4, 5, 7 supergravities follow from truncating the maximally supersymmetric ones, there nevertheless exist M-theory compactifications with G2, SU(3), SU(2) holonomy having these supergravities as their massless sectors. (4) They reduce to N=1, 2, 4, 8 theories all with maximum rank 7 in D=4 which (5) correspond to 0, 1, 3, 7 lines of the Fano plane and hence admit a division algebra (R,C,H,O) interpretation consistent with the black-hole/qubit correspondence, (6) are generalized self-mirror and hence (7) have vanishing on-shell trace anomaly.
