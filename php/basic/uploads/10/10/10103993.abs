Title: Tilt and Running of Cosmological Observables in Generalized Single-Field  Inflation
Authors: Nicola Bartolo and Matteo Fasiello and Sabino Matarrese and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: Employing an effective field theory approach to inflationary perturbations, we analyze in detail the effect of curvature-generated Lagrangian operators on various observables, focusing on their running with scales. At quadratic order, we solve the equation of motion at next-to-leading leading order in a generalized slow-roll approximation for a very general theory of single-field inflation. We derive the resulting power spectrum, its tilt and running. We then focus on the contribution to the primordial non-Gaussianity amplitude f_{NL} sourced by a specific interaction term. We show that the running of f_{NL} can be substantially larger than what dictated by the slow-roll parameters.
