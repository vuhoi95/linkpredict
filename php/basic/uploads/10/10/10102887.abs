Title: Constraint structure of the three dimensional massive gravity
Authors: M. Sadegh and A. Shirzad
Abstract: Constraint analysis of the three-dimensional massive gravity, the so- called new massive gravity, is studied in the Palatini formalism. We show that amongst 6 components of the metric, 2 are dynamical, which is compatible with the existence of one vector massive graviton in the linearized theory (Fierz-Pauli theory).
