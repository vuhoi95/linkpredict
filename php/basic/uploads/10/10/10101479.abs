Title: Quark-Hadron Duality and Effective Continuum Thresholds in Dispersive  Sum Rules
Authors: Wolfgang Lucha and Dmitri Melikhov and Silvano Simula
Abstract: A novel procedure for extracting hadron characteristics from QCD sum rules, based on effective continuum thresholds (necessary for the implementation of quark-hadron duality) which may depend on the involved momenta and on the Borel parameter(s), enables us to quantify the uncertainties induced by the quark-hadron duality approximation and to achieve a significantly higher accuracy of our predictions for the properties of hadronic bound states.
