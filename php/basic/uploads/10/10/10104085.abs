Title: Discussion on Event Horizon and Quantum Ergosphere of Evaporating Black  Holes in a Tunnelling Framework
Authors: Jingyi Zhang and Zheng Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, with the Parikh-Wilczek tunnelling framework the positions of the event horizon of the Vaidya black hole and the Vaidya-Bonner black hole are calculated respectively. We find that the event horizon and the apparent horizon of these two black holes correspond respectively to the two turning points of the Hawking radiation tunnelling barrier. That is, the quantum ergosphere coincides with the tunnelling barrier. Our calculation also implies that the Hawking radiation comes from the apparent horizon.
