Title: One-loop Amplitudes in Six-Dimensional (1,1) Theories from Generalised  Unitarity
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Dimitrios Korres and Daniel Koschade and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: Recently, the spinor helicity formalism and on-shell superspace were developed for six-dimensional gauge theories with (1,1) supersymmetry. We combine these two techniques with (generalised) unitarity, which is a powerful technique to calculate scattering amplitudes in any massless theory. As an application we calculate one-loop superamplitudes with four and five external particles in the (1,1) theory and perform several consistency checks on our results.
