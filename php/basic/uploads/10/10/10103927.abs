Title: On the reanimation of a local BRST invariance in the (Refined)  Gribov-Zwanziger formalism
Authors: D. Dudal and N. Vandersickel
Abstract: We localize a previously established nonlocal BRST invariance of the Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) action by the introduction of additional fields. We obtain a modified GZ action with a corresponding local BRST invariance. We show that correlation functions of the original elementary GZ fields do not change upon evaluation with the modified partition function. We discuss that for vanishing Gribov mass, we are brought back to the original Yang-Mills theory with standard BRST invariance.
