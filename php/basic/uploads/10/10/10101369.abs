Title: Geometry of physical dispersion relations
Authors: Dennis Raetzel and Sergio Rivera and Frederic P. Schuller
Abstract: To serve as a dispersion relation, a cotangent bundle function must satisfy three simple algebraic properties. These conditions are derived from the inescapable physical requirements to have predictive matter field dynamics and an observer-independent notion of positive energy. Possible modifications of the standard relativistic dispersion relation are thereby severely restricted. For instance, the dispersion relations associated with popular deformations of Maxwell theory by Gambini-Pullin or Myers-Pospelov are not admissible.
