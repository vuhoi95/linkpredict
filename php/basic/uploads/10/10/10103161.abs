Title: Hilbert Series for Flavor Invariants of the Standard Model
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Elizabeth E. Jenkins and Aneesh V. Manohar and Giuseppe Torri
Abstract: The Hilbert series is computed for the lepton flavor invariants of the Standard Model with three generations including the right-handed neutrino sector needed to generate light neutrino masses via the see-saw mechanism. We also compute the Hilbert series of the quark flavor invariants for the case of four generations.
