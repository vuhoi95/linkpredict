Title: Bulk spectral functions in single and multi-scalar gravity duals
Authors: Todd Springer and Charles Gale and Sangyong Jeon
Abstract: We examine two point correlation functions involving the trace of the energy momentum tensor in five dimensional gravity dual theories supported by one or more scalar fields. A prescription for determining bulk channel spectral functions is developed. This prescription generalizes previous work which centered on one scalar field. As an application of these techniques, we investigate the bulk spectral function and corresponding sum rule in the Chamblin-Reall background. We show that, when expressed in terms of the beta function, the sum rule for the Chamblin-Reall background can be written in a form similar to the sum rule in Yang-Mills theory.
