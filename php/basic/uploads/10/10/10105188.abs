Abstract: We discuss SU(5) Grand Unified Theories in the context of orientifold compactifications. Specifically, we investigate two and three D-brane stack realizations of the Georgi-Glashow and the flipped SU(5) model and analyze them with respect to their Yukawa couplings. As pointed out in arXiv:0909.0271 the most economical Georgi-Glashow realization based on two stacks generically suffers from a disastrous large proton decay rate. We show that allowing for an additional U(1) D-brane stack this as well as other phenomenological problems can be resolved. We exemplify with globally consistent Georgi-Glashow models based on RCFT that these D-brane quivers can be indeed embedded in a global setting. These globally consistent realizations admit rigid O(1) instantons inducing the perturbatively missing coupling 10105^H. Finally we show that flipped SU(5) D-brane realizations even with multiple U(1) D-brane stacks are plagued by severe phenomenological drawbacks which generically cannot be overcome.
