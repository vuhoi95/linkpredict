Title: Anomalous coupling of scalars to gauge fields
Authors: Philippe Brax and Clare Burrage and Anne-Christine Davis and David Seery and Amanda Weltman
Abstract: We study the transformation properties of a scalar-tensor theory, coupled to fermions, under the Weyl rescaling associated with a transition from the Jordan to the Einstein frame. We give a simple derivation of the corresponding modification to the gauge couplings. After changing frame, this gives rise to a direct coupling between the scalar and the gauge fields.
