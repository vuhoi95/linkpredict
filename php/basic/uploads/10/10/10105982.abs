Title: On the generality of the LLM geometries in M-theory
Authors: Eoin Ó Colgáin and Jun-Bao Wu and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: In this note we revisit the Lin, Lunin, Maldacena (LLM) class of d=11 supergravity solutions with symmetry SO(6) X SO(3) X R, but generalise to allow for all fluxes consistent with the isometries. Using the Killing spinor equation, we prove there are no supersymmetric geometries with additional fluxes beyond the LLM ansatz. In addition, the LLM relationship between Killing spinors, \epsilon_- = - \gamma_5 \epsilon_+, may be seen as a consequence of identifying two Killing directions identified through the Killing spinor equation corresponding to candidate R-symmetry directions.
