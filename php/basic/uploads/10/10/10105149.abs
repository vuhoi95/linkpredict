Title: Towards classical geometrodynamics from Group Field Theory hydrodynamics
Authors: Daniele Oriti and Lorenzo Sindoni
Abstract: We take the first steps towards identifying the hydrodynamics of group field theories (GFTs) and relating this hydrodynamic regime to classical geometrodynamics of continuum space. We apply to GFT mean field theory techniques borrowed from the theory of Bose condensates, alongside standard GFT and spin foam techniques. The mean field configuration we study is, in turn, obtained from loop quantum gravity coherent states. We work in the context of 2d and 3d GFT models, in euclidean signature, both ordinary and colored, as examples of a procedure that has a more general validity. We also extract the effective dynamics of the system around the mean field configurations, and discuss the role of GFT symmetries in going from microscopic to effective dynamics. In the process, we obtain additional insights on the GFT formalism itself.
