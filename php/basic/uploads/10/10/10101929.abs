Authors: Jian-Pin Wu and Yue Cao and Xiao-Mei Kuang and Wei-Jia Li
Abstract: In this paper we study $3+1$ holographic superconductors with Weyl corrections. We find that the critical temperature of a superconductor with Weyl corrections increases as we amplify the Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$, indicating the condensation will be harder when the parameter $\gamma$ decreases. We also calculate the conductivity and the ratio of gap frequency over critical temperature $\omega_{g}/T_{c}$ numerically for various coupling parameters. We find that the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ becomes larger when the Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$ decreases. We also notice that when $\gamma< 0$ there is an extra spike that appears inside the gap.
