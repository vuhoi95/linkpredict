Title: Boundary operators in minimal Liouville gravity and matrix models
Authors: Jean-Emile Bourgine and Goro Ishiki and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We interpret the matrix boundaries of the one matrix model (1MM) recently constructed by two of the authors as an outcome of a relation among FZZT branes. In the double scaling limit, the 1MM is described by the (2,2p+1) minimal Liouville gravity. These matrix operators are shown to create a boundary with matter boundary conditions given by the Cardy states. We also demonstrate a recursion relation among the matrix disc correlator with two different boundaries. This construction is then extended to the two matrix model and the disc correlator with two boundaries is compared with the Liouville boundary two point functions. In addition, the realization within the matrix model of several symmetries among FZZT branes is discussed.
