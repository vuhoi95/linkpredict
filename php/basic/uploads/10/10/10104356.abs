Title: Considering anomalous dimensions in AdS/QCD models
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: We discuss an AdS / QCD model that consider anomalous dimensions. The effect of this kind of dimensions is considered as a mass term that depend on holographical coordenate for duals modes in bulk.
