Title: Counting charged massless states in the (0,2) heterotic CFT/geometry  connection
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Maximilian Kreuzer and Andrea Puhm
Abstract: We use simple current techniques and their relation to orbifolds with discrete torsion for studying the (0,2) CFT/geometry duality with non-rational internal N=2 SCFTs. Explicit formulas for the charged spectra of heterotic SO(10) GUT models are computed in terms of their extended Poincar\'{e} polynomials and the complementary Poincar\'{e} polynomial which can be computed in terms of the elliptic genera. While non-BPS states contribute to the charged spectrum, their contributions can be determined also for non-rational cases. For model building, with generalizations to SU(5) and SM gauge groups, one can take advantage of the large class of Landau-Ginzburg orbifold examples.
