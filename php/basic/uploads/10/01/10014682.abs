Abstract: Motivated by the recent works of Refs. \cite{R1, R2} where a model of inflation has been suggested with non-minimally coupled massive vector fields, we generalize their work to the study of the bouncing solution. So we consider a massive vector field, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity. Also we consider non-minimal coupling of vector field to the scalar curvature. Then we reconstruct this model in the light of three forms of parametrization for dynamical dark energy. Finally we simply plot reconstructed physical quantities in flat universe.
