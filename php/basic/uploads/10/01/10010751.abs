Title: The CPT group of the spin-3/2 field
Authors: B. Carballo Perez and M. Socolovsky
Abstract: We find out that both the matrix and the operator CPT groups of the spin-3/2 field (with or without mass) are respectively isomorphic to $D_4\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $Q\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. These groups are exactly the same groups as for the Dirac field, though there is no a priori reason why they should coincide.
