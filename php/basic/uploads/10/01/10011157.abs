Title: AdS black disk model for small-x DIS
Authors: Lorenzo Cornalba and Miguel S. Costa and Joao Penedones
Abstract: Using the approximate conformal invariance of QCD at high energies we consider a simple AdS black disk model to describe saturation in DIS. Deep inside saturation the structure functions have the same power law scaling, F_T ~ F_L ~ 1/x^w, where w is related to the expansion rate of the black disk with energy. Furthermore, the ratio F_L /F_T is given by the universal value (1+w)/(3+w), independently of the target. For virtual photon-photon scattering at high energies we obtain explicit expressions and ratios for the total cross sections of transverse and longitudinal photons in terms of the single parameter w.
