Title: Frame-Like Action and Unfolded Formulation for Massive Higher-Spin  Fields
Authors: D. S. Ponomarev and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Unfolded equations of motion for symmetric massive bosonic fields of any spin in Minkowski and (A)dS spaces are presented. Manifestly gauge invariant action for a spin $s \ge 2$ massive field in any dimension is constructed in terms of gauge invariant curvatures.
