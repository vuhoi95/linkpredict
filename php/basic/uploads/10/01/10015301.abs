Title: AdS String: Classical Solutions and Moduli Dynamics
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin
Abstract: We review some recent work and techniques for constructing dynamical string solutions in AdS spacetime. These solutions generalize the folded string and multi-spike solutions of GKP and Kruczenski. The methods developed for constructing these dynamical solutions are based on Pohlmeyer reduction to integrable sinh-Gordon type equations. The integrability of the equations is seen as the crucial tool for reconstruction of the string configurations. We discuss the physical meaning of these dynamical spike solutions and the question of their moduli space.
