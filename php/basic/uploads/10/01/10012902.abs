Title: Rotating Membranes in AdS_4xM^{1,1,1}
Authors: Jongwook Kim and Nakwoo Kim and Jung Hun Lee
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress on gravity duals of supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theories, we consider classical membrane solutions in AdS_4 x M^{1,1,1}. In particular, we present several types of exact solutions rotating in the Sasaki-Einstein 7-manifold whose isometry is SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). We analyze the limiting behavior of macroscopic membranes and discuss how one can identify the dual operators and the implications of our result on their conformal dimensions.
