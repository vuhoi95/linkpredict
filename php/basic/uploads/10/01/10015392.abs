Title: Massive Superstring Scatterings in the Regge Regime
Authors: Song He and Jen-Chi Lee and Keijiro Takahashi and Yi Yang
Abstract: We calculate four classes of high energy massive string scattering amplitudes of fermionic string theory at arbitrary mass levels in the Regge regime (RR). We show that all four leading order amplitudes in the RR can be expressed in terms of the Kummer function of the second kind. Based on the summation algorithm of a set of extended signed Stirling number identities, we show that all four ratios calculated previously by the method of decoupling of zero-norm states among scattering amplitudes in the Gross Regime (GR) can be extracted from this Kummer function in the RR. Finally, we conjecture and give evidences that the existence of these four GR ratios in the RR persists to subleading orders in the Regge expansion of all high energy fermionic string scattering amplitudes.
