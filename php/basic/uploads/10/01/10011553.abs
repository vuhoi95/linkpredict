Title: Constant mean curvature surfaces in AdS_3
Authors: Kazuhiro Sakai and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: We construct constant mean curvature surfaces of the general finite-gap type in AdS_3. The special case with zero mean curvature gives minimal surfaces relevant for the study of Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We also analyze properties of the finite-gap solutions including asymptotic behavior and the degenerate (soliton) limit, and discuss possible solutions with null boundaries.
