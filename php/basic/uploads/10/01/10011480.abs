Title: The computation of one-loop heterotic string threshold corrections for  general orbifold models with discrete Wilson lines
Authors: Michael A. Klaput and Christian Paleani
Abstract: We calculate the moduli dependent part of string one-loop threshold corrections to gauge couplings for the heterotic string theory compactified on abelian toroidal orbifolds, allowing for arbitrary discrete Wilson lines. We show that the knowledge of threshold corrections for any such compactification is equivalent to solving a class of integrals. We solve a sub-class of these integrals and show how any model can be mapped onto this class by fractional linear transformations of its fixed plane moduli. Modular symmetries of the final expression are discussed.
