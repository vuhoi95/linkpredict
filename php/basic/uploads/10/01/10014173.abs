Title: Neutrino oscillation phase dynamically induced by f(R)-gravity
Authors: S. Capozziello and M. De Laurentis and D. Vernieri
Abstract: The gravitational phase shift of neutrino oscillation can be discussed in the framework of f(R)-gravity. We show that the shift of quantum mechanical phase can depend on the given f(R)-theory that we choose. This fact is general and could constitute a fundamental test to discriminate among the various alternative relativistic theories of gravity. Estimations of ratio between the gravitational phase shift and the standard phase are carried out for the electronic Solar neutrinos.
