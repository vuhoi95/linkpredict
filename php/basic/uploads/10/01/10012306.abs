Abstract: We implement Mikhailov's holomorphic curve construction to explore various properties of giant gravitons in type IIB string theory on $AdS_{5}\times T^{1,1}$. By coloring the D-brane worldvolume, we are able to show how, in the string theory, the giant graviton factorizes at its maximal size into two dibaryons - topologically stable D-branes wrapping non-contractible cycles in the $T^{1,1}$. This is related to the structure of the symmetry group of the emergent Klebanov-Witten gauge theory being a product - $SU(N) \times SU(N)$ instead of the canonical $SU(N)$. Finally, we complete this study with a systematic and detailed construction of the spectrum of small fluctuations about the giant graviton configuration. Curiously, we find that the fluctuation spectrum depends on the size of the giant. The similarity of the operator structures in the Klebanov-Witten and ABJM theories leads us to believe that the D4-brane giant graviton in type IIA string theory on $AdS_{4}\times \mathbb{CP}^{3}$ factorizes into two $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ dibaryons in a qualitatively similar way.
