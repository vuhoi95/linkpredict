Title: Casimir effect at nonzero temperature for wedges and cylinders
Authors: Simen Ã…. Ellingsen and Iver Brevik and Kimball A. Milton
Abstract: We consider the Casimir-Helmholtz free energy at nonzero temperature $T$ for a circular cylinder and perfectly conducting wedge closed by a cylindrical arc, either perfectly conducting or isorefractive. The energy expression at nonzero temperature may be regularized to obtain a finite value, except for a singular corner term in the case of the wedge which is present also at zero temperature. Assuming the medium in the interior of the cylinder or wedge be nondispersive with refractive index $n$, the temperature dependence enters only through the non-dimensional parameter $2\pi naT$, $a$ being the radius of the cylinder or cylindrical arc. We show explicitly that the known zero temperature result is regained in the limit $aT\to 0$ and that previously derived high temperature asymptotics for the cylindrical shell are reproduced exactly.
