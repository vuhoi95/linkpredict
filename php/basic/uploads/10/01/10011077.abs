Title: Path integral quantization for massive vector bosons
Authors: D. Djukanovic and J. Gegelia and S. Scherer
Abstract: A parity-conserving and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory of self-interacting massive vector fields is considered. For the interaction terms with dimensionless coupling constants the canonical quantization is performed. It is shown that the self-consistency condition of this system with the second-class constraints in combination with the perturbative renormalizability leads to an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with an additional mass term.
