Title: Matrix Models, Emergent Spacetime and Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Harald Grosse and Fedele Lizzi and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We discuss how a matrix model recently shown to describe emergent gravity may contain extra degrees of freedom which reproduce some characteristics of the standard model, in particular the breaking of symmetries and the correct quantum numbers of fermions.
