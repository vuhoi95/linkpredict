Title: On self-gravitating elementary solutions of non-linear electrodynamics
Authors: J. Diaz-Alonso and D. Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: The electrostatic, spherically symmetric solutions of the general class of non-linear abelian gauge models, minimally coupled to gravity, are classified and discussed in terms of the ADM mass and the electromagnetic energy of the associated flat-space solutions.
