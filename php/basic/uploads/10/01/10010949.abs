Title: Charged cosmological dust solutions of the coupled Einstein and Maxwell  equations
Authors: Joel Spruck and Yisong Yang
Abstract: It is well known through the work of Majumdar, Papapetrou, Hartle, and Hawking that the coupled Einstein and Maxwell equations admit a static multiple blackhole solution representing a balanced equilibrium state of finitely many point charges. This is a result of the exact cancellation of gravitational attraction and electric repulsion under an explicit condition on the mass and charge ratio. The resulting system of particles, known as an extremely charged dust, gives rise to examples of spacetimes with naked singularities. In this paper, we consider the continuous limit of the Majumdar--Papapetrou--Hartle--Hawking solution modeling a space occupied by an extended distribution of extremely charged dust. We show that for a given smooth distribution of matter of finite ADM mass there is a continuous family of smooth solutions realizing asymptotically flat space metrics.
