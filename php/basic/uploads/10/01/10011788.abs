Title: Flavor structure from magnetic fluxes and non-Abelian Wilson lines
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Kang-Sin Choi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We study the flavor structure of 4D effective theories, which are derived from extra dimensional theories with magnetic fluxes and non-Abelian Wilson lines. We study zero-mode wavefunctions and compute Yukawa couplings as well as four-point couplings. In our models, we also discuss non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries such as $D_4$, $\Delta(27)$ and $\Delta(54)$.
