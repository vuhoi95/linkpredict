Title: A gauge mediation scenario with hidden sector renormalization in MSSM
Authors: Masato Arai and Shinsuke Kawai and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: We study the hidden sector effects to the mass renormalization of a simplest gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario. We point out that possible hidden sector contributions render the soft scalar masses smaller, resulting in drastically different sparticle mass spectrum at low energy. In particular, in the ${\bf 5}+\bar{\bf 5}$ minimal gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking with high messenger scale (that is favored by the gravitino cold dark matter scenario), we show that stau can be the next lightest superparticle for moderate values of hidden sector self coupling. This provides a very simple theoretical model of long-lived charged next lightest superparticles, that imply distinctive signals in ongoing and upcoming collider experiments.
