Title: Physics With Two Time Dimensions
Authors: Jacob G. Foster and Berndt MÃ¼ller
Abstract: We explore the properties of physical theories in space-times with two time dimensions. We show that the common arguments used to rule such theories out do not apply if the dynamics associated with the additional time dimension is thermal or chaotic and does not permit long-lived time-like excitations. We discuss several possible realizations of such theories, including holographic representations and the possibility that quantum dynamics emerges as a consequence of a second time dimension.
