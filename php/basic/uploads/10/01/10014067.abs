Title: An exact statement for Wilsonian and Holographic renormalization group
Authors: E. T. Akhmedov and E. T. Musaev
Abstract: We show that Polchinski equations in the D--dimensional matrix scalar field theory can be reduced at large $N$ to the Hamiltonian equations in a (D+1)-dimensional theory. In the subsector of the $\Tr \phi^l$ (for all $l$) operators we find the exact form of the corresponding Hamiltonian. The relation to the Holographic renormalization group is discussed.
