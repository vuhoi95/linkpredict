Abstract: We propose a general approach for the construction of modified gravity which is invariant under foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Special attention is paid to the formulation of modified $F(R)$ Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (FRHL), whose Hamiltonian structure is studied. It is demonstrated that the spatially-flat FRW equations of FRHL are consistent with the constraint equations. The analysis of de Sitter solutions for several versions of FRHL indicates that the unification of the early-time inflation with the late-time acceleration is possible. It is shown that a special choice of parameters for FRHL leads to the same spatially-flat FRW equations as in the case of traditional $F(R)$-gravity. Finally, an essentially most general modified Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity is proposed, motivated by its fully diffeomorphism-invariant counterpart, with the restriction that the action does not contain derivatives higher than the second order with respect to the time coordinate.
