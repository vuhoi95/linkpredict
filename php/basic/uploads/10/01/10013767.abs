Title: Geodesic stability for KS Black hole in Horava-Lifshitz gravity via  Lyapunov exponents
Authors: M. R. Setare and D. Momeni
Abstract: By computing the Lyapunov exponent, which is the inverse of the instability time scale associated with this geodesic motion we show that there is two region of space which in both of them the equatorial timelike geodesics are stable via Lyapunov measure of stability.
