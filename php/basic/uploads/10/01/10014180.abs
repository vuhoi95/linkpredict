Title: Emergent Noncommutative gravity from a consistent deformation of gauge  theory
Authors: Ignacio Cortese and J Antonio Garc√≠a
Abstract: Starting from a standard noncommutative gauge theory and using the Seiberg-Witten map we propose a new version of a noncommutative gravity. We use consistent deformation theory starting from a free gauge action and gauging a killing symmetry of the background metric to construct a deformation of the gauge theory that we can relate with gravity. The result of this consistent deformation of the gauge theory is nonpolynomial in A_\mu. From here we can construct a version of noncommutative gravity that is simpler than previous attempts. Our proposal is consistent and is not plagued with the problems of other approaches like twist symmetries or gauging other groups.
