Title: Large extra dimensions and small black holes at the LHC
Authors: Marcus Bleicher and Piero Nicolini
Abstract: We present an overview of the conjectured production of microscopic black holes as a consequence of high energy hadronic collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) from this year on. Provided the presence of large extra-dimensions, we analyze some possible scenarios that could turn out to be outstanding experimental discoveries. We also discuss some new models which have been recently proposed on the ground of quantum gravity arguments. The final comments are devoted to supposed potential risks connected with the formation of black holes in particle detectors.
