Title: Compactification on negatively curved manifolds
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Renata Kallosh
Abstract: We show that string/M theory compactifications to maximally symmetric space-times using manifolds whose scalar curvature is everywhere negative, must have significant warping, large stringy corrections, or both.
