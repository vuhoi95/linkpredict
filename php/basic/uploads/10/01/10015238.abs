Authors: Shao-Wen Wei and Yu-Xiao Liu and Yong-Qiang Wang
Abstract: With entropic interpretation of gravity proposed by Verlinde, we obtain the Friedmann equation of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe for the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It is shown that, when the parameter of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity $\omega\rightarrow \infty$, the modified Friedmann equation will go back to the one in Einstein gravity. This results may imply that the entropic interpretation of gravity is effective for the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
