Title: (Non)renormalizability of the D-deformed Wess-Zumino model
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Biljana Nikolic and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: We continue the analysis of the $D$-deformed Wess-Zumino model which was started in the previous paper. The model is defined by a deformation which is non-hermitian and given in terms of the covariant derivatives $D_\alpha$. We calculate one-loop divergences in the two-point, three-point and four-point Green functions. We find that the divergences in the four-point function cannot be absorbed and thus our model is not renormalizable. We discuss possibilities to render the model renormalizable.
