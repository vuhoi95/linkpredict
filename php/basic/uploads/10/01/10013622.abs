Title: Massive 3D Gravity Big-Bounce
Authors: H. L. C. Louzada and U. Camara dS and G. M. Sotkov
Abstract: The properties of an extension of the New Massive 3D Gravity by scalar matter with Higgs-like self-interaction are investigated. Its perturbative unitarity consistency is verified for a family of cosmological Bounce solutions found by the superpotential method. They correspond to the lower bound ${\lambda = -1}$ of the BHT unitarity window and describe eternally accelerated 3D Universe between two initial/final stable $dS_3$ vacua states.
