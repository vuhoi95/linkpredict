Title: Higher Winding Strings and Confined Monopoles in N=2 SQCD
Authors: R. Auzzi and S. Bolognesi and M. Shifman
Abstract: We consider composite string solutions in N=2 SQCD with the gauge group U(N), the Fayet--Iliopoulos term \xi \neq 0 and N (s)quark flavors. These bulk theories support non-Abelian strings and confined monopoles identified with kinks in the two-dimensional world-sheet theory. Similar and more complicated kinks (corresponding to composite confined monopoles) must exist in the world-sheet theories on composite strings. In a bid to detect them we analyze the Hanany--Tong (HT) model, focusing on a particular example of N=2. Unequal quark mass terms in the bulk theory result in the twisted masses in the N=(2,2) HT model. For spatially coinciding 2-strings, we find three distinct minima of potential energy, corresponding to three different 2-strings. Then we find BPS-saturated kinks interpolating between each pair of vacua. Two kinks can be called elementary. They emanate one unit of the magnetic flux and have the same mass as the conventional 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole on the Coulomb branch of the bulk theory (\xi =0). The third kink represents a composite bimonopole, with twice the minimal magnetic flux. Its mass is twice the mass of the elementary confined monopole. We find instantons in the HT model, and discuss quantum effects in composite strings at strong coupling. In addition, we study the renormalization group flow in this model.
