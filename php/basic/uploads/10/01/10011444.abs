Title: Modave Lectures on Fuzzballs and Emission from the D1-D5 System
Authors: Borun D. Chowdhury and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: These lecture notes present an introduction to the fuzzball proposal and emission from the D1-D5 system which is geared to an audience of graduate students and others with little background in the subject. The presentation begins with a discussion of the Penrose process and Hawking radiation. The fuzzball proposal is then introduced, and the two- and three-charge systems are reviewed. In the three-charge case details are not discussed. A detailed discussion of emission calculations for D1-D5-P black holes and for certain non-extremal fuzzballs from both the gravity and CFT perspectives is included. We explicitly demonstrate how seemingly different emission processes in gravity, namely, Hawking radiation and superradiance from D1-D5-P black holes, and ergoregion emission from certain non-extremal fuzzballs, are only different manifestations of the same phenomenon in the CFT.
