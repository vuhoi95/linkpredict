Title: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle and Quantum Gravity Phenomenology
Authors: Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: In this article we examine a Generalized Uncertainty Principle which differs from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle by terms linear and quadratic in particle momenta, as proposed by the authors in an earlier paper. We show that this affects all Hamiltonians, and in particular those which describe low energy experiments. We discuss possible observational consequences. Further, we also show that this indicates that space may be discrete at the fundamental level.
