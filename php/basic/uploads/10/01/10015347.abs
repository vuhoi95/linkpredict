Title: Anomalous behavior in an effective model of graphene with Coulomb  interactions
Authors: Alessandro Giuliani and Vieri Mastropietro and Marcello Porta
Abstract: We analyze by exact Renormalization Group (RG) methods the infrared properties of an effective model of graphene, in which two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions propagating with a velocity smaller than the speed of light interact with a three-dimensional quantum electromagnetic field. The fermionic correlation functions are written as series in the running coupling constants, with finite coefficients that admit explicit bounds at all orders. The implementation of Ward Identities in the RG scheme implies that the effective charges tend to a line of fixed points. At small momenta, the quasi-particle weight tends to zero and the effective Fermi velocity tends to a finite value. These limits are approached with a power law behavior characterized by non-universal critical exponents.
