Title: Extending the Spin Projection Operators for Gravity Models with  Parity-Breaking in 3-D
Authors: C. A. Hernaski and B. Pereira-Dias and A. A. Vargas-Paredes
Abstract: We propose a new basis of spin-operators, specific for the case of planar theories, which allows a Lagrangian decomposition into spin-parity components. The procedure enables us to discuss unitarity and spectral properties of gravity models with parity-breaking in a systematic way.
