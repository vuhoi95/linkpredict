Title: Renormalization of QCD_2
Authors: J. Kovacs and S. Nagy and I. Nandori and K. Sailer
Abstract: The low energy infrared scaling of the multi-color 2-dimensional quantum chromodynamics is determined in the framework of its bosonized model by using the functional renormalization group method with gliding sharp cut-off k in momentum space in the local potential approximation. The model exhibits a single phase with a superuniversal effective potential.
