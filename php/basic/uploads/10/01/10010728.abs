Title: New extended Crewther-type relation
Authors: A. L. Kataev and S. V. Mikhailov
Abstract: We propose a conjecture about the detailed structure of the conformal symmetry breaking term in the generalized Crewther relation. We conclude that this conjecture leads to new relations between the QCD expansion coefficients of the Adler D-function and the polarized Bjorken sum rule B$_{jp}$
