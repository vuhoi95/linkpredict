Authors: Xin Li and Zhe Chang and Xiaohuan Mo
Abstract: The Killing equation for a general Finsler space is set up. It is showed that the Killing equation of $(\alpha,\beta)$ space can be divided into two parts. One is the same with Killing equation of a Riemannian metric, another equation can be regarded as a constraint. The solutions of Killing equations present explicitly the isometric symmetry of Finsler space. We find that the isometric group of a special case of $(\alpha,\beta)$ space is the same with the symmetry of Very Special Relativity (VSR). The Killing vectors of Finsler-Funk space are given. Unlike Riemannian constant curvature space, the 4 dimensional Funk space with constant curvature just have 6 independent Killing vectors.
