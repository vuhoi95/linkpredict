Title: Modified gravity emerging from thermodynamics and holographic principle
Authors: Yi Zhang and Yun-gui Gong and Zong-Hong Zhu
Abstract: A new conception is proposed in Ref.\cite{Verlinde:2010hp,Padmanabhan:2009kr} that gravity is one kind of entropic force. In this letter, we try to discuss its applications to the modified gravities by using three different corrections to the area law of entropy which are derived from the quantum effects and extra dimensions. According to the assumption of holographic principle, the number of bits $N$ which is related to the equipartition law of energy is modified. Then, the modified law of Newton's gravity and the modified Friedmann equations are obtained by using the new notion. By choosing suitable parameters, the modified area law of entropy leads to de-Sitter solutions which can be used to explain the accelerating expansion of our universe. It suggests that the accelerating phase in our universe may be an emergent phenomenon based on holographic principle and thermodynamics.
