Title: N = 2 SCFTs: An M5-brane perspective
Authors: Bin Chen and Eoin Ó. Colgáin and Jun-Bao Wu and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: Inspired by the recently discovered holographic duality between N=2 SCFTs and half-BPS M-theory backgrounds, we study probe M5-branes. Though our main focus is supersymmetric M5-branes whose worldvolume has an AdS_n factor, we also consider some other configurations. Of special mention is the identification of AdS_5 and AdS_3 probes preserving supersymmetry, with only the latter supporting a self-dual field strength.
