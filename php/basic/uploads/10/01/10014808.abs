Title: Rigidity of SU(2,2|2)-symmetric solutions in Type IIB
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and Yu Guo
Abstract: We investigate the existence of half-BPS solutions in Type IIB supergravity which are invariant under the superalgebra SU(2,2|2) realized on either AdS_5 x S^2 x S^1 or AdS_5 x S^3 warped over a Riemann surface \Sigma with boundary. We prove that, in both cases, the only solution is AdS_5 x S^5 itself. We argue that this result provides evidence for the non-existence of fully back-reacted intersecting D3/D7 branes with either AdS_5 x S^2 x S^1 x \Sigma or AdS_5 x S^3 x \Sigma near-horizon limits.
