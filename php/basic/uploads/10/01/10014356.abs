Title: Bulk one-point function on disk in one-matrix model
Authors: Alexander Belavin and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We consider bulk correlation numbers on disk in one-matrix model. Using the recently found so-called resonance transformation from the KdV to the Liouville frame, we obtain an explicit expression for the bulk one-point function. The result is consistent with the form of FZZ one-point function in the boundary Liouville Field Theory.
