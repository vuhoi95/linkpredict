Title: Sub-shot-noise quantum metrology with entangled identical particles
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini and U. Marzolino
Abstract: The usual notion of separability has to be reconsidered when applied to states describing identical particles. A definition of separability not related to any a priori Hilbert space tensor product structure is needed: this can be given in terms of commuting subalgebras of observables. Accordingly, the results concerning the use of the quantum Fisher information in quantum metrology are generalized and physically reinterpreted.
