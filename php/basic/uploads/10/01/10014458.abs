Title: Weyl transverse gravity (WTDiff) and the cosmological constant
Authors: Enrique √Ålvarez and Roberto Vidal
Abstract: Scale invariant (transverse) gravitational theories are introduced. They are invariant under pure metric rescalings (i.e. the matter fields are inert under those). This symmetry forbids the presence of a cosmological constant. Those theories are not invariant under the full set of diffeomorphisms, but only with respect to those locally characterized by the fact that their generator is transverse $\pd_\a \xi^\a=0$.
