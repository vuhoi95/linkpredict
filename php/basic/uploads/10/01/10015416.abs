Title: Exceptional quantum subgroups for the rank two Lie algebras B2 and G2
Authors: R. Coquereaux and R. Rais and E. H. Tahri
Abstract: Exceptional modular invariants for the Lie algebras B2 (at levels 2,3,7,12) and G2 (at levels 3,4) can be obtained from conformal embeddings. We determine the associated alge bras of quantum symmetries and discover or recover, as a by-product, the graphs describing exceptional quantum subgroups of type B2 or G2 which encode their module structure over the associated fusion category. Global dimensions are given.
