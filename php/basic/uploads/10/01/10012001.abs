Title: The BLG Theory in Light-Cone Superspace
Authors: Dmitry Belyaev and Lars Brink and Sung-Soo Kim and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: The light-cone superspace version of the d=3, N=8 superconformal theory of Bagger, Lambert and Gustavsson (BLG) is obtained as a solution to constraints imposed by OSp(2,2|8) superalgebra. The Hamiltonian of the theory is shown to be a quadratic form of the dynamical supersymmetry transformation.
