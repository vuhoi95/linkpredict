Title: Holographic Duals of Near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Ying-Ming Huang and Shou-Jyun Zou
Abstract: We consider the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ description of Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black holes by studying their uplifted counterparts in five dimensions. Assuming a natural size of the extra dimension, the near horizon geometries for the extremal limit are exactly $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. We compute the scattering amplitude of a scalar field, with a mode near threshold of frequency and extra dimensional momentum, by a near extremal uplifted black hole. The absorption cross section agrees with the two point function of the CFT dual to the scalar field.
