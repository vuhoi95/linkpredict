Title: Topologically Massive Gravity from the Heterotic String
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: Topologically massive gravity (TMG) in three dimensions provides an interesting toy model for constructing a quantum theory of gravity. Although it can be thought of as standing as a theory in its own right, it is also of interest to see whether it can be described within the larger framework of string theory or M-theory. In this paper, we show that it can be embedded within the heterotic string, via a compactification on $S^3\times T^4$. Since all solutions of TMG can now be lifted to ten dimensions, this allows us to give a string and brane interpretation to quantities such as the central charges in the conformal field theory on the boundary of TMG, and the entropy of the BTZ black hole solution.
