Title: Electromagnetic Waves in the De Sitter Space
Authors: V. S. Otchik and V. M. Red'kov
Abstract: 5-Dimensional wave equation for a massive particle of spin 1 in the background of de Sitter space-time model is solved in static coordinates. The spherical 5-dimensional vectors $A_{a}, a= 1,...,5$ of three types, $j,j+1, j-1$ are constructed. In massless case they give electromagnetic wave solutions, obeying the Lorentz condition. 5-form of equations in massless case is used to produce recipe to build electromagnetic wave solutions of the types $\Pi, E,M$; the first is trivial and can be removed by a gauge ransformation. The recipe is specified to produce spherical $\Pi, E, M$ solutions in static coordinates.
