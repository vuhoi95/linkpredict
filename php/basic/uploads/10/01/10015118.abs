Title: Fourth-order gravity as the inflationary model revisited
Authors: S. Kaneda and S. V. Ketov and N. Watanabe
Abstract: We revisit the old (fourth-order or quadratically generated) gravity model of Starobinsky in four space-time dimensions, and derive the (inflaton) scalar potential in the equivalent scalar-tensor gravity model via a Legendre-Weyl transform. The inflaton scalar potential is used to compute the (CMB) observables of inflation associated with curvature perturbations (namely, the scalar and tensor spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio), including the new next-to-leading-order terms with respect to the inverse number of e-foldings. The results are compared to the recent (WMAP5) experimental bounds. We confirm both mathematical and physical equivalence between f(R) gravity theories and the corresponding scalar-tensor gravity theories.
