Title: New probe of modified gravity
Authors: Alexey Boyarsky and Oleg Ruchayskiy
Abstract: We suggest a new efficient way to constrain a certain class of large scale modifications of gravity. We show that the scale-free relation between density and size of Dark Matter halos, predicted within the LambdaCDM model with Newtonian gravity, gets modified in a wide class of theories of modified gravity.
