Abstract: A recently developed efficient recursive approach for analytically calculating the short-time evolution of the one-particle propagator to extremely high orders is applied here for numerically studying the thermodynamical and dynamical properties of a rotating ideal Bose gas of $^{87}$Rb atoms in an anharmonic trap. At first, the one-particle energy spectrum of the system is obtained by diagonalizing the discretized short-time propagator. Using this, many-boson properties such as the condensation temperature, the ground-state occupancy, density profiles, and time-of-flight absorption pictures are calculated for varying rotation frequencies. The obtained results improve previous semiclassical calculations, in particular for smaller particle numbers. Furthermore, we find that typical time scales for a free expansion are increased by an order of magnitude for the delicate regime of both critical and overcritical rotation.
