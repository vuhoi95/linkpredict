Title: On M-Theory Embedding of Topologically Massive Gravity
Authors: H. Lu and Zhao-Long Wang
Abstract: We show that topologically massive gravity can be obtained by the consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction from recently constructed seven-dimensional gravity with topological terms. The internal four-manifold should be Einstein with the Pontryagin four-form constantly proportional to the volume form. We also discuss the possible lift of the system to D=11. This enables us to connect the mass parameter \tilde\mu in D=3 to the M5-brane charge. The dimensionless quantity 3/(G\tilde \mu) is discrete and proportional to N, where N is the number of M5-branes.
