Title: Reheating in Inflationary Cosmology: Theory and Applications
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Robert Brandenberger and Francis-Yan Cyr-Racine and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: Reheating is an important part of inflationary cosmology. It describes the production of Standard Matter particles after the phase of accelerated expansion. We give a review of the reheating process, focusing on an in-depth discussion of the preheating stage which is characterized by exponential particle production due to a parametric resonance or tachyonic instability. We give a brief overview of the thermalization process after preheating and end with a survey of some applications to supersymmetric theories and to other issues in cosmology such as baryogenesis, dark matter and metric preheating.
