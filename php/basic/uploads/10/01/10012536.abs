Title: New Super Calogero Models and OSp(4|2) Superconformal Mechanics
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Evgeny Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We report on the new approach to constructing superconformal extensions of the Calogero-type systems with an arbitrary number of involved particles. It is based upon the superfield gauging of non-abelian isometries of some supersymmetric matrix models. Among its applications, we focus on the new N=4 superconformal system yielding the U(2) spin Calogero model in the bosonic sector, and the one-particle case of this system, which is a new OSp(4|2) superconformal mechanics with non-dynamical U(2) spin variables. The characteristic feature of these models is that the strength of the conformal inverse-square potential is quantized.
