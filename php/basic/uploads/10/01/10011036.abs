Title: Logarithmic Correlators in Non-relativistic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Ali Hosseiny and Shahin Rouhani
Abstract: We show how logarithmic terms may arise in the correlators of fields which belong to the representation of the Schrodinger-Virasoro algebra (SV) or the affine Galilean Conformal Algebra (GCA). We show that in GCA, only scaling operator can have a Jordanian form and rapidity can not. We observe that in both algebras logarithmic dependence appears along the time direction alone.
