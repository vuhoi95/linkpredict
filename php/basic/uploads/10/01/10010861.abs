Title: Quantum Black Hole in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle Framework
Authors: A. Bina and S. Jalalzadeh and A. Moslehi
Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on canonical quantum gravity of black holes. Through the use of modified partition function that involves the effects of the GUP, we obtain the thermodynamical properties of the Schwarzschild black hole. We also calculate the Hawking temperature and entropy for the modification of the Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of the GUP.
