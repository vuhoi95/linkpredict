Title: On particle collisions in the gravitational field of the Kerr black hole
Authors: A. A. Grib and Yu. V. Pavlov
Abstract: Scattering of particles in the gravitational field of Kerr black holes is considered. It is shown that scattering energy of particles in the centre of mass system can obtain very large values not only for extremal black holes but also for nonextremal ones existing in Nature. This can be used for explanation of still unresolved problem of the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays observed in Auger experiment. Extraction of energy after the collision is investigated. It is shown that due to the Penrose process the energy of the particle escaping the hole at infinity can be large. Contradictions in the problem of getting high energetic particles escaping the black hole are resolved.
