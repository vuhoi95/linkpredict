Title: Geometry of the quantum universe
Authors: J. Ambjorn and A. Goerlich and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: A universe much like the (Euclidean) de Sitter space-time appears as background geometry in the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) regularization of quantum gravity. We study the geometry of such universes which appear in the path integral as a function of the bare coupling constants of the theory.
