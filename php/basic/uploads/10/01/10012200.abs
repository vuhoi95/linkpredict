Title: Global causal propagator for the Klein-Gordon equation on a class of  supersymmetric AdS backgrounds
Authors: Alberto Enciso and Niky Kamran
Abstract: We analyze the Cauchy problem for the Klein-Gordon equation on the type IIB supergravity backgrounds $AdS^5 \times Y^{p,q}$, where $Y^{p,q}$ is any of the Sasaki-Einstein 5-manifolds recently discovered by Gaunlett, Martelli, Sparks and Waldram (Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 8 (2004) 711--734). Although these spaces are not globally hyperbolic, we prove that there exists a unique admissible propagator and derive an integral representation thereof using spectral-theoretic techniques.
