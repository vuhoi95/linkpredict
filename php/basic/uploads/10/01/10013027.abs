Authors: Rustam Ibadov and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Michael Leissner
Abstract: At finite weak mixing angle the sphaleron solution of Weinberg-Salam theory can be endowed with angular momentum proportional to the electric charge. Here we show, that this holds also for sphaleron-antisphaleron systems such as pairs, chains and vortex rings. We also address the equilibrium conditions for these solutions.
