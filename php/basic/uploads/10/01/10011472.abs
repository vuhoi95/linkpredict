Abstract: We study holographic superconductors in a Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black hole without the condition of the detailed balance. We show that it is easier for the scalar hair to form as the parameter of the detailed balance becomes larger, but harder when the mass of the scalar field larger. We also find that the ratio of the gap frequency in conductivity to the critical temperature, $\omega_{g}/T_c$, almost linear decreases with the increase of the balance constant. For $\epsilon= 0$ the ratio reduces to Cai's result $\omega_g/T_c\approx 13$ found in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black hole with the condition of the detailed balance, while as $\epsilon \rightarrow 1$ it tends to Horowitz-Roberts relation $\omega_g/T_c\approx 8$ obtained in the AdS Schwarzschild black hole. Our result provides a bridge between the results for the H\v{o}rava-Lifshitz theory with the condition of the detailed balance and Einstein's gravity.
