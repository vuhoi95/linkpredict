Title: The cosmological perturbation theory in loop cosmology with holonomy  corrections
Authors: Jian-Pin Wu and Yi Ling
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scalar mode of first-order metric perturbations over spatially flat FRW spacetime when the holonomy correction is taken into account in the semi-classical framework of loop quantum cosmology. By means of the Hamiltonian derivation, the cosmological perturbation equations is obtained in longitudinal gauge. It turns out that in the presence of metric perturbation the holonomy effects influence both background and perturbations, and contribute the non-trivial terms $S_{h1}$ and $S_{h2}$ in the cosmological perturbation equations.
