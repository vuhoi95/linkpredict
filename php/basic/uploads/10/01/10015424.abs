Title: Universal amplitude ratios of two-dimensional percolation from field  theory
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino and Jacopo Viti and John Cardy
Abstract: We complete the determination of the universal amplitude ratios of two-dimensional percolation within the two-kink approximation of the form factor approach. For the cluster size ratio, which has for a long time been elusive both theoretically and numerically, we obtain the value 160.2, in good agreement with the lattice estimate 162.5 +/- 2 of Jensen and Ziff.
