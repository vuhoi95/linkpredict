Title: The deformations of nondegenerate constant Poisson bracket with even and  odd deformation parameters
Authors: S. E. Konstein and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: We consider Poisson superalgebras with constant nondegenerate bracket realized on the smooth Grassmann-valued functions with compact supports in R^{2n}. The deformations with even and odd deformation parameters of these superalgebras are presented for n>1.
