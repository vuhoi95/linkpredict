Abstract: We calculate the lateral Lifshitz force between corrugated dielectric slabs of finite thickness. Taking the thickness of the plates to infinity leads us to the lateral Lifshitz force between corrugated dielectric surfaces of infinite extent. Taking the dielectric constant to infinity leads us to the conductor limit which has been evaluated earlier in the literature.
