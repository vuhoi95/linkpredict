Title: Partonic description of a supersymmetric p-brane
Authors: Kanghoon Lee and Jeong-Hyuck Park
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric extensions of a recently proposed partonic description of a bosonic p-brane which reformulates the Nambu-Goto action as an interacting multi-particle action with Filippov-Lie algebra gauge symmetry. We construct a worldline supersymmetric action by postulating, among others, a p-form fermion. Demanding a local worldline supersymmetry rather than the full worldvolume supersymmetry, we circumvent a known no-go theorem against the construction of a Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz supersymmetric action for a p-brane of p>1. We also derive a spacetime supersymmetric Green-Schwarz extension from the preexisting kappa-symmetric action.
