Title: A landscape of non-supersymmetric AdS vacua on coset manifolds
Authors: Paul Koerber and Simon Kors
Abstract: We construct new families of non-supersymmetric sourceless type IIA AdS4 vacua on those coset manifolds that also admit supersymmetric solutions. We investigate the spectrum of left-invariant modes and find that most, but not all, of the vacua are stable under these fluctuations. Generically, there are also no massless moduli.
