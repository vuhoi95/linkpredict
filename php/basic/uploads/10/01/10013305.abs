Title: Example of a self-consistent solution for a fermion on domain wall
Authors: V. A. Gani and V. G. Ksenzov and A. E. Kudryavtsev
Abstract: We discuss a self-consistent solution for a fermion coupled to static scalar field in the form of a kink (domain wall). In particular, we study the case when the fermion occupies an excited non-zero frequency level in the presence of the domain wall field. The effect of the domain wall profile distortion is calculated analytically.
