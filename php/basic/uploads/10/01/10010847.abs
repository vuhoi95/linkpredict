Title: The post-Minkowskian limit of f(R)-gravity
Authors: S. Capozziello and A. Stabile and A. Troisi
Abstract: We formally discuss the post-Minkowskian limit of $f(R)$-gravity without adopting conformal transformations but developing all the calculations in the original Jordan frame. It is shown that such an approach gives rise, in general, together with the standard massless graviton, to massive scalar modes whose masses are directly related to the analytic parameters of the theory. In this sense, the presence of massless gravitons only is a peculiar feature of General Relativity. This fact is never stressed enough and could have dramatic consequences in detection of gravitational waves. Finally the role of curvature stress-energy tensor of $f(R)$-gravity is discussed showing that it generalizes the so called Landau-Lifshitz tensor of General Relativity. The further degrees of freedom, giving rise to the massive modes, are directly related to the structure of such a tensor.
