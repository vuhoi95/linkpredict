Title: QCDMAPT: program package for Analytic approach to QCD
Authors: A. V. Nesterenko and C. Simolo
Abstract: A program package, which facilitates computations in the framework of Analytic approach to QCD, is developed and described in details. The package includes the explicit expressions for relevant spectral functions calculated up to the four-loop level and the subroutines for necessary integrals.
