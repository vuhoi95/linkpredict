Title: Hybrid inflation with moduli stabilization and low scale supersymmetry  breaking
Authors: Sander Mooij and Marieke Postma
Abstract: We study the supergravity hybrid inflation model of Ref.[1] in the presence of a modulus field. The eta-problem is solved by a shift symmetry for the inflaton, which protects the inflaton mass even in the presence of the modulus field. Inflation is (nearly) unaffected by moduli stabilization, provided the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the post-inflation vacuum is small. Therefore the model has the nice phenomenology that it combines low scale supersymmetry breaking with high scale (grand unification scale) inflation.
