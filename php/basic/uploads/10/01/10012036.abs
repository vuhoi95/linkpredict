Title: Bosonic Spectral Action Induced from Anomaly Cancelation
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and Fedele Lizzi
Abstract: We show how (a slight modification of) the noncommutative geometry bosonic spectral action can be obtained by the cancelation of the scale anomaly of the fermionic action. In this sense the standard model coupled with gravity is induced by the quantum nature of the fermions. The regularization used is very natural in noncommutative geometry and puts the bosonic and fermionic action on a similar footing.
