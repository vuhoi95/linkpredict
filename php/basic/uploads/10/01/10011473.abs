Title: Gauge Threshold Corrections in Warped Geometry
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Ian-Woo Kim and Chang Sub Shin
Abstract: We discuss the Kaluza-Klein threshold correction to low energy gauge couplings in theories with warped extra-dimension, which might be crucial for the gauge coupling unification when the warping is sizable. Explicit expressions of one-loop thresholds are derived for generic 5D gauge theory on a slice of AdS_5, where some of the bulk gauge symmetries are broken by orbifold boundary conditions and/or by bulk Higgs vacuum values. Effects of the mass mixing between the bulk fields with different orbifold parities are included as such mixing is required in some class of realistic warped unification models.
