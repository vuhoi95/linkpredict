Title: Poisson-Lie sigma models over low dimensional real Poisson-Lie groups
Authors: S. Hajizadeh and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: The Poisson-Lie sigma models over nonsemisimple low dimensional real Poisson-Lie groups are investigated. We find two sided models on two, three and some four dimensional Poisson-Lie groups where the Poisson-Lie sigma models over Poisson-Lie groups G and its dual $\tilde{G}$ are topological sigma models or BF gauge models.
