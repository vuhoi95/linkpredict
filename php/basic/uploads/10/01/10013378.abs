Title: Holographic phase transition from dyons in an AdS black hole background
Authors: A. R. Lugo and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We construct a dyon solution for a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in a 4 dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole background with temperature T. We then apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe the strong coupling regime of a 2+1 quantum field theory which undergoes a phase transition exhibiting the condensation of a composite charge operator below a critical temperature $T_c$.
