Title: Dirac-Kahler Theory and Massless Fields
Authors: V. A. Pletyukhov and V. I. Strazhev
Abstract: Three massless limits of the Dirac-Kahler theory are considered. It is shown that the Dirac-Kahler equation for massive particles can be represented as a result of the gauge-invariant mixture (topological interaction) of the above massless fields.
