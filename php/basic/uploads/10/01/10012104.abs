Title: (0,2) Deformations of Linear Sigma Models
Authors: Maximilian Kreuzer and Jock McOrist and Ilarion V. Melnikov and M. Ronen Plesser
Abstract: We study (0,2) deformations of a (2,2) supersymmetric gauged linear sigma model for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a Fano toric variety. In the non-linear sigma model these correspond to some of the holomorphic deformations of the tangent bundle on the hypersurface. Combinatorial formulas are given for the number of these deformations, and we show that these numbers are exchanged by mirror symmetry in a subclass of the models.
