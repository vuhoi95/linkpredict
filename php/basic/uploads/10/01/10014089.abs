Title: Thermal Aspects of ABJM theory: Currents and Condensations
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Sangheon Yun
Abstract: To study thermal aspects of the ABJM theory in the strongly coupled regime, we carry out the CP3 invariant dimensional reduction of the type IIA supergravity down to four dimensions. We then investigate zero and finite temperature responses of the operators which are dual to the AdS scalar and vector fields. Two scalar operators are shown to have finite-temperature condensations by coupling of constant source term. The currents dual to the massless and massive gauge fields are not induced by coupling of constant boundary vector potential, which implies that the phase described by black brane background is not superconducting. We also discuss a generalization to charged (dyonic) black holes.
