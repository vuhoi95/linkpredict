Title: Cardy-Verlinde formula of Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole
Authors: M. R. Setare and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: In this paper, we have shown that the entropy of the Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole in Ho$\check{\textbf{r}}$ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity can be expressed by the Cardy-Verlinde formula. The later is supposed to be an entropy formula of conformal field theory in any dimension.
