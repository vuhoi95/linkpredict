Title: Heat-kernel expansion and counterterms of the Faddeev-Popov determinant  in Coulomb and Landau gauge
Authors: Hugo Reinhardt and Davide R. Campagnari
Abstract: The Faddeev-Popov determinant of Landau gauge in d dimensions and Coulomb gauge in d+1 dimensions is calculated in the heat-kernel expansion up to next-to-leading order. The UV-divergent parts in d=3,4 are isolated and the counterterms required for a non-perturbative treatment of the Faddeev-Popov determinant are determined.
