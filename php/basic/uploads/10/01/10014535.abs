Title: Supersymmetry Breaking and Gauge Mediation
Authors: Ryuichiro Kitano and Hirosi Ooguri and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We review recent works on supersymmetry breaking and gauge mediation. We survey our current understanding of dynamical supersymmetry breaking mechanisms and describe new model building tools using duality, meta-stability, and stringy construction. We discuss phenomenological constraints and their solutions, paying attentions to issues with gaugino masses and electroweak symmetry breaking.
