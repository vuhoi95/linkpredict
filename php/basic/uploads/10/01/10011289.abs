Title: Unruh Effect and Holography
Authors: Takayuki Hirayama and Pei-Wen Kao and Shoichi Kawamoto and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We study the Unruh effect on the dynamics of quarks and mesons in the context of AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence. We adopt an AdS$_5$ metric with the boundary Rindler horizon extending into a bulk Rindler-like horizon, which yields the thermodynamics with Unruh temperature verified by computing the boundary stress tensor. We then embed in it a probe fundamental string and a $D7$ brane in such a way that they become the dual of an accelerated quark and a meson in Minkowski space, respectively. Using the standard procedure of holographic renormalization, we calculate the chiral condensate, and also the spectral functions for both the accelerated quark and meson. Especially, we extract the corresponding strength of random force of the Langevin dynamics and observe that it can characterize the phase transition of meson melting. This result raises an issue toward a formulation of complementarity principle for the Rindler horizon. We find most of the dynamical features are qualitatively similar to the ones in the thermal bath dual to the AdS black hole background, though they could be quite different quantitatively.
