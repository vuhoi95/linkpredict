Title: A Remark on the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Mechanism in the Standard  Model
Authors: Thierry Masson and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Mechanism (SSBM) in the Standard Model of particles in the unitary gauge. We show that the computation usually presented of this mechanism can be conveniently performed in a slightly different manner. As an outcome, the computation we present can change the interpretation of the SSBM in the Standard Model, in that it decouples the SU(2)-gauge symmetry in the final Lagrangian instead of breaking it.
