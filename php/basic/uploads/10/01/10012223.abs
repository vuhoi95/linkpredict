Title: Discrete curvature and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Jens Hoppe and Gerhard Huisken
Abstract: For matrix analogues of embedded surfaces we define discrete curvatures and Euler characteristics, and a non-commutative Gauss--Bonnet theorem is shown to follow. We derive simple expressions for the discrete Gauss curvature in terms of matrices representing the embedding coordinates, and provide a large class of explicit examples illustrating the new notions.
