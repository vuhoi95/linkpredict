Title: A note on entropic force and brane cosmology
Authors: Yi Ling and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: Recently Verlinde proposed that gravity is an entropic force caused by information changes when a material body moves away from the holographic screen. In this note we apply this argument to brane cosmology, and show that the cosmological equation can be derived from this holographic scenario.
