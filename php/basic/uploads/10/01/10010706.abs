Title: Jet-quenching of the rotating heavy meson in a ${\mathcal{N}}$=4 SYM  plasma in presence of a constant electric field
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a rotating heavy quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) pair in a ${\mathcal{N}}$=4 SYM thermal plasma. We assume that $q\bar{q}$ center of mass moves at the speed $v$ and furthermore they rotate around the center of mass. We use the AdS/CFT correspondence and consider the effect of external electromagnetic field on the motion of the rotating meson. Then we calculate the jet-quenching parameter corresponding to the rotating meson in the constant electric field.
