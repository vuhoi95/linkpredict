Title: UV/IR duality in noncommutative quantum field theory
Authors: Andre Fischer and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We review the construction of renormalizable noncommutative euclidean phi(4)-theories based on the UV/IR duality covariant modification of the standard field theory, and how the formalism can be extended to scalar field theories defined on noncommutative Minkowski space.
