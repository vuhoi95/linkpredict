Title: Uniform density static fluid sphere in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and  its universality
Authors: N. Dadhich and A. Molina and A. Khugaev
Abstract: In Newtonian theory, gravity inside a constant density static sphere is independent of spacetime dimension. Interestingly this general result is also carried over to Einsteinian as well as higher order Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (Lovelock) gravity notwithstanding their nonlinearity. We prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for universality of Schwarzschild interior solution describing a uniform density sphere for all $n\geq4$ is that its density is constant.
