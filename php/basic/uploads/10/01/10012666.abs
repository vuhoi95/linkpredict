Title: Scalar Kaluza-Klein modes in a multiply warped braneworld
Authors: Ratna Koley and Joydip Mitra and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: The Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of a massive scalar field on a 3-brane embedded in six dimensional multiply warped spacetime are determined. Due to the presence of warping along both the extra dimensions the KK mass spectrum splits into two closely spaced branches which is a distinct feature of this model compared to the five dimensional Randall-Sundrum model. This new cluster of the KK mode spectrum is expected to have interesting phenomenological implications for the upcoming collider experiments. Such a scenario may also be extended for even larger number of orbifolded extra dimensions.
