Title: First-Class Approaches to Massive 2-Forms
Authors: E. M. Cioroianu and S. C. Sararu and O. Balus
Abstract: Massive 2-forms are analyzed from the point of view of the Hamiltonian quantization using the gauge-unfixing approach and respectively the Batalin--Fradkin method. Both methods finally output the manifestly Lorentz covariant path integral for 1- and 2-forms with Stueckelberg coupling.
