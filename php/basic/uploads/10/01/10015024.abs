Title: Donaldson = Seiberg-Witten from Mochizuki's formula and instanton  counting
Authors: Lothar GÃ¶ttsche and Hiraku Nakajima and Kota Yoshioka
Abstract: We propose an explicit formula connecting Donaldson invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants of a 4-manifold of simple type via Nekrasov's deformed partition function for the N=2 SUSY gauge theory with a single fundamental matter. This formula is derived from Mochizuki's formula, which makes sense and was proved when the 4-manifold is complex projective. Assuming our formula is true for a 4-manifold of simple type, we prove Witten's conjecture and sum rules for Seiberg-Witten invariants (superconformal simple type condition), conjectured by Mari\~no, Moore and Peradze.
