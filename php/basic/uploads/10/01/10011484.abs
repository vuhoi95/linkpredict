Title: Clues from nearby galaxies to a better theory of cosmic evolution
Authors: P. J. E. Peebles and Adi Nusser
Abstract: The great advances in the network of cosmological tests show that the relativistic Big Bang theory is a good description of our expanding universe. But the properties of nearby galaxies that can be observed in greatest detail suggest a still better theory would more rapidly gather matter into galaxies and groups of galaxies. This happens in theoretical ideas now under discussion.
