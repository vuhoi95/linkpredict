Title: Holographic dark energy with varying gravitational constant in  Horava-Lifshitz cosmology
Authors: M. R. Setare and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: We investigate the holographic dark energy scenario with a varying gravitational constant in a flat background in the context of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. We extract the exact differential equation determining the evolution of the dark energy density parameter, which includes $G$ variation term. Also we discuss a cosmological implication of our work by evaluating the dark energy equation of state for low redshifts containing varying $G$ corrections.
