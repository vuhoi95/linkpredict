Title: Casimir energy for Dirac fields in $AdS_3$
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We study massless Dirac fields in a portion of $AdS_3$, where one of the boundaries coincides with the "boundary at infinity" of the Anti-de-Sitter space. We evaluate the vacuum energy arising when the local boundary conditions dictated by boundary chirality are imposed, in different combinations, at both one-branes.
