Title: Relating U(N)xU(N) to SU(N)xSU(N) Chern-Simons Membrane theories
Authors: Neil Lambert and Constantinos Papageorgakis
Abstract: By integrating out the U(1)_B gauge field, we show that the U(n)xU(n) ABJM theory at level k is equivalent to a Z_k identification of the (SU(n)xSU(n))/Z_n Chern-Simons theory, but only when n and k are coprime. As a consequence, the k=1 ABJM model for two M2-branes in R^8 can be identified with the N=8 (SU(2)xSU(2))/Z_2 theory. We also conjecture that the U(2)xU(2) ABJM model at k=2 is equivalent to the N=8 SU(2)xSU(2)-theory.
