Title: Flavored Orbifold GUT - an SO(10) x S4 model
Authors: Adisorn Adulpravitchai and Michael A. Schmidt
Abstract: Orbifold grand unified theories (GUTs) solve several problems in GUT model building. Therefore, it is intriguing to investigate similar constructions in the flavor context. In this paper, we propose that a flavor symmetry might emerge due to orbifold compactification of one orbifold and broken by boundary conditions of another orbifold. The combination of the orbifold parities in gauge and flavor space determines the zero modes. We demonstrate the construction in a supersymmetric (SUSY) SO(10) x S_4 orbifold GUT model, which predicts the tribimaximal mixing at leading order in the lepton sector as well as the Cabibbo angle in the quark sector.
