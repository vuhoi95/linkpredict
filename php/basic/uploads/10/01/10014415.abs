Authors: V. M. Red'kov and E. M. Ovsiyuk
Abstract: Exact wave solutions for particles with spin 0, 1/2 and 1 in the static coordinates of the de Sitter space-time model are examined in detail. Firstly, for a scalar particle, two pairs of linearly independent solutions are specified explicitly: running and standing waves. A known algorithm for calculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\epsilon j}$ on the background of the de Sitter space-time model is analyzed. It is shown that the determination of R_{\epsilon j} requires an additional constrain on quantum numbers \epsilon \rho / \hbar c >> j, where \rho is a curvature radius. When taken into account of this condition, the R_{\epsilon j} vanishes identically. It is claimed that the calculation of the reflection coefficient R_{\epsilon j} is not required at all because there is no barrier in an effective potential curve on the background of the de Sitter space-time. The same conclusion holds for arbitrary particles with higher spins, it is demonstrated explicitly with the help of exact solutions for electromagnetic and Dirac fields.
