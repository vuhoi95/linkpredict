Title: Preheating in Bubble Collisions
Authors: Jun Zhang and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: In a landscape with metastable minima, the bubbles will inevitably nucleate. We show that during the bubbles collide, due to the dramatically oscillating of the field at the collision region, the energy deposited in the bubble walls can be efficiently released by the explosive production of the particles. In this sense, the collision of bubbles is actually highly inelastic. The cosmological implications of this result are discussed.
