Title: Liouville-Lifshitz theory in 3+1 dimensions
Authors: J. Alexandre and K. Farakos and A. Tsapalis
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional theory in the z=3 Lifshitz context, with an exponential (Liouville) potential. We determine the exact renormalized potential of the theory and derive the non-perturbative relation between the renormalized and bare couplings. In addition, we show that Lorentz symmetry is naturally generated by quantum fluctuations in the infrared regime, and conclude that the model can be relevant to High Energy Physics.
