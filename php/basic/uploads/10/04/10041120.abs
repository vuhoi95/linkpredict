Title: Noncommutative Geometry Inspired Rotating Black Hole in Three Dimensions
Authors: Juan Manuel Tejeiro and Alexis Larranaga
Abstract: We find a new rotating black hole in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using an anisotropic perfect fluid inspired by the noncommutative black hole. We deduce the thermodynamical quantities of this black hole and compare them with those of a rotating BTZ solution.
