Title: Testing the Rastall's theory using matter power spectrum
Authors: C. E. M. Batista and J. C. Fabris and M. Hamani Daouda
Abstract: The Rastall's theory is a modification of the General Relativity theory leading to a different expression for the conservation law in the matter sector compared with the usual one. It has been argued recently that such a theory may have applications to the dark energy problem, since a pressureless fluid may lead to an accelerated universe. In the present work we confront the Rastall's theory with the power spectrum data. The results indicate a configuration that essentially reduces the Rastall's theory to General Relativity, unless the non-usual conservation law refers to a scalar field, situation where other configurations are eventually possible.
