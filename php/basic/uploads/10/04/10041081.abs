Title: The high spin expansion of twist sector dimensions: the planar N=4 super  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Marco Rossi
Abstract: This review is devoted to collecting some results on the high spin expansion of (minimal) anomalous dimension. Thanks to the recent rationale on integrability, planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (or its $\text{AdS}_5\times\text{S}^5$ string counterpart) represents a very practicable field. Here the attention will be restricted to its sector of twist operators, although the analysis tools are quite general (in integrable theories). Some structures and ideas turn out to be general also for other sectors or gauge theories.
