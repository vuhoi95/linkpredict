Title: Electroweak Phase Transition in the munuSSM
Authors: Daniel J. H. Chung and Andrew J. Long
Abstract: An extension of the MSSM called the munuSSM does not allow a conventional thermal leptogenesis scenario because of the low scale seesaw that it utilizes. Hence, we investigate the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis. Specifically, we identify a parameter region for which the electroweak phase transition is sufficiently strongly first order to realize electroweak baryogenesis. In addition to transitions that are similar to those in the NMSSM, we find a novel class of phase transitions in which there is a rotation in the singlet vector space.
