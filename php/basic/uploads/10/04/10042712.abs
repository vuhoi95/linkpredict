Title: Phase diagram of hot QCD in an external magnetic field: possible  splitting of deconfinement and chiral transitions

Abstract: The structure of the phase diagram for strong interactions becomes richer in the presence of a magnetic background, which enters as a new control parameter for the thermodynamics. Motivated by the relevance of this physical setting for current and future high-energy heavy ion collision experiments and for the cosmological QCD transitions, we use the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and to Polyakov loops as an effective theory to investigate how the chiral and the deconfining transitions are affected, and present a general picture for the temperature--magnetic field phase diagram. We compute and discuss each contribution to the effective potential for the approximate order parameters, and uncover new phenomena such as the paramagnetically-induced breaking of global Z_3 symmetry, and possible splitting of deconfinement and chiral transitions in a strong magnetic field.
