Title: Partition function of the trigonometric SOS model with reflecting end
Authors: Ghali Filali and Nikolai Kitanine
Abstract: We compute the partition function of the trigonometric SOS model with one reflecting end and domain wall type boundary conditions. We show that in this case, instead of a sum of determinants obtained by Rosengren for the SOS model on a square lattice without reflection, the partition function can be represented as a single Izergin determinant. This result is crucial for the study of the Bethe vectors of the spin chains with non-diagonal boundary terms.
