Title: Cosmological k-essence condensation
Authors: Neven Bilic and Gary B. Tupper and Raoul D. Viollier
Abstract: We consider a model of dark energy/matter unification based on a k-essence type of theory similar to tachyon condensate models. Using an extension of the general relativistic spherical model which incorporates the effects of both pressure and the acoustic horizon we show that an initially perturbative k-essence fluid evolves into a mixed system containing cold dark matter like gravitational condensate in significant quantities.
