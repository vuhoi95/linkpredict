Title: Global Structure of Black Holes in String Theory with Gauss-Bonnet  Correction in Various Dimensions
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We study global structures of black hole solutions in Einstein gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term coupled to dilaton in various dimensions. In particular we focus on the problem whether the singularity is weakened due to the Gauss-Bonnet term and dilaton. We find that there appears the non-central singularity between horizon and the center in many cases, where the metric does not diverge but the Kretschmann invariant does diverge. Hence this is a singularity, but we find the singularity is much milder than the Schwarzschild solution and the non-dilatonic one. We discuss the origin of this "fat" singularity. In other cases, we encounter singularity at the center which is much stronger than the usual one. We find that our black hole solutions have three different types of the global structures; the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS and "regular AdS black hole" types.
