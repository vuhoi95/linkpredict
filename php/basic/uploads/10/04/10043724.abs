Title: Inflection point inflation within supersymmetry
Authors: Kari Enqvist and Anupam Mazumdar and Philip Stephens
Abstract: We propose to address the fine tuning problem of inflection point inflation by the addition of extra vacuum energy that is present during inflation but disappears afterwards. We show that in such a case, the required amount of fine tuning is greatly reduced. We suggest that the extra vacuum energy can be associated with an earlier phase transition and provide a simple model, based on extending the SM gauge group to SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{B-L}, where the Higgs field of U(1)_{B-L} is in a false vacuum during inflation. In this case, there is virtually no fine tuning of the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the flat direction which serves as the inflaton. However, the absence of radiative corrections which would spoil the flatness of the inflaton potential requires that the U(1)_{B-L} gauge coupling should be small with g_{B-L}\leq 10^{-4}.
