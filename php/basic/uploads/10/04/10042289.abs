Abstract: We study the full spectrum of spherically symmetric solutions in the five dimensional non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz type gravity theories. For appropriate ranges of the coupling parameters, we have found several classes of solutions which are characterized by an AdS_5, dS_5 or flat large distance asymptotic behaviour, plus the standard 1/r^2 tail of the usual five-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. In addition we have found solutions with an unconventional short or large distance behaviour, and for a special range of the coupling parameters solutions which coincide with black hole solutions of conventional relativistic five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
