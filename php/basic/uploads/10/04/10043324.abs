Title: Minimally modified self-dual 2-forms gravity
Authors: Riccardo Capovilla and Merced Montesinos and Mercedes Velazquez
Abstract: The first order Plebanski formulation of (complex) general relativity (GR) in terms of self-dual 2-forms admits a generalization, proposed by Krasnov, that is qualitatively different from other possible generalizations of GR in terms of metric variables. In this paper, we investigate, within a minimal modification, and in a perturbative approach, the geometrical meaning of the field variables used in the Krasnov generalization, and compare them to the field variables used in the Plebanski formulation.
