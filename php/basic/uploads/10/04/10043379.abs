Title: Brane singularities with a scalar field bulk
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Spiros Cotsakis and Ifigeneia Klaoudatou
Abstract: The singularity structure and the corresponding asymptotic behavior of a 3-brane coupled to a scalar field in a five dimensional bulk is analyzed in full generality, using the method of asymptotic splittings. It is shown that the collapse singularity at a finite distance from the brane can be avoided only at the expense of making the brane world-volume positively or negatively curved.
