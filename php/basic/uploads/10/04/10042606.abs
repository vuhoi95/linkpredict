Title: Area spectrum of near-extremal SdS black holes via the new  interpretation of quasinormal modes
Authors: Wenbo Li and Lixin Xu and Jianbo Lu
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work about a new physical interpretation of quasinormal modes by Maggiore, we investigate the quantization of near-extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in the four dimensional spacetime. Following Kunstatter's method, we derive the area and entropy spectrum of near-extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes which differs from Setare's result. Furthermore, we find that the derived a universal area spectrum is $2\pi n$ which is equally spaced.
