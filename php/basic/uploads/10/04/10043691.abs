Abstract: We study scalar-tensor theory, k-essence and modified gravity with Lagrange multiplier constraint which role is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. Dark Energy cosmology of different types ($\Lambda$CDM, unified inflation with DE, smooth non-phantom/phantom transition epoch) is reconstructed in such models. It is shown that mathematical equivalence between scalar theory and $F(R)$ gravity is broken due to presence of constraint. The cosmological dynamics of $F(R)$ gravity is modified by the second $F_2(R)$ function dictated by the constraint. Dark Energy cosmology is defined by this function while standard $F_1(R)$ function is relevant for local tests (modification of newton regime). A general discussion on the role of Lagrange multipliers to make higher-derivative gravity canonical is developed.
