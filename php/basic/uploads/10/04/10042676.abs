Title: Supersymmetry between Jackiw-Nair and Dirac-Majorana anyons
Authors: Peter A. Horvathy and Mikhail S. Plyushchay and Mauricio Valenzuela
Abstract: The Jackiw-Nair description of anyons combines spin-1 topologically massive fields with the discrete series representation of the Lorentz algebra, which has fractional spin. In the Dirac-Majorana formulation the spin-1 part is replaced by the spin 1/2 planar Dirac equation. The two models are shown to belong to an N=1 supermultiplet, which carries a super-Poincare symmetry.
