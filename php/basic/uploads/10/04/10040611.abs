Title: Born-Infeld-Horava gravity
Authors: Ibrahim Gullu and Tahsin Cagri Sisman and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We define various Born-Infeld gravity theories in 3+1 dimensions which reduce to Horava's model at the quadratic level in small curvature expansion. In their exact forms, our actions provide z->(infinity) extensions of Horava's gravity, but when small curvature expansion is used, they reproduce finite z models, including some half-integer ones.
