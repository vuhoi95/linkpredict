Title: Classical model of confinement
Authors: Yu. P. Goncharov and N. E. Firsova
Abstract: The confinement mechanism proposed earlier and then applied successfully to meson spectroscopy by one of the authors is interpreted in classical terms. For this aim the unique solution of the Maxwell equations, an analog of the corresponding unique solution of the SU(3)-Yang-Mills equations describing linear confinement in quantum chromodynamics, is used. Motion of a charged particle is studied in the field representing magnetic part of the mentioned solution and it is shown that one deals with the full classical confinement of the charged particle in such a field: under any initial conditions the particle motion is accomplished within a finite region of space so that the particle trajectory is near magnetic field lines while the latter are compact manifolds (circles). An asymptotical expansion for the trajectory form in the strong field limit is adduced. The possible application of the obtained results in thermonuclear plasma physics is also shortly outlined.
