Title: The epsilon expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order with small  imaginary chemical potential
Authors: Christoph Lehner and Shoji Hashimoto and Tilo Wettig
Abstract: We discuss chiral perturbation theory for two and three quark flavors in the epsilon expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) including a small imaginary chemical potential. We calculate finite-volume corrections to the low-energy constants $\Sigma$ and $F$ and determine the non-universal modifications of the theory, i.e., modifications that cannot be mapped to random matrix theory (RMT). In the special case of two quark flavors in an asymmetric box we discuss how to minimize the finite-volume corrections and non-universal modifications by an optimal choice of the lattice geometry. Furthermore we provide a detailed calculation of a special version of the massless sunset diagram at finite volume.
