Title: The Bekenstein Bound in Asymptotically Free Field Theory
Authors: E. Arias and N. F. Svaiter and G. Menezes
Abstract: For spatially bounded free fields, the Bekenstein bound states that the specific entropy satisfies the inequality $\frac{S}{E} \leq 2 \pi R$, where $R$ stands for the radius of the smallest sphere that circumscribes the system. The validity of the Bekenstein bound on the specific entropy in the asymptotically free side of the Euclidean $(\lambda\,\phi^{\,4})_{d}$ self-interacting scalar field theory is investigated. We consider the system in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature $\beta^{\,-1}$ and defined in a compact spatial region without boundaries. Using the effective potential, we presented an exhaustive study of the thermodynamic of the model. For low and high temperatures the system presents a condensate. We obtain also the renormalized mean energy $E$ and entropy $S$ for the system. With these quantities, we shown in which situations the specific entropy satisfies the quantum bound.
