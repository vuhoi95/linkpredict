Title: Chiral symmetry breaking and monopole dynamics in non-compact QED3  coupled to a four-fermi interaction
Authors: Wesley Armour and John B. Kogut and Costas Strouthos
Abstract: We present results from the first lattice simulations of three dimensional non-compact quantum electrodynamics (QED3) with N_f four-component fermion flavors coupled to a weak Z(2) chirally invariant four-fermi interaction. Results with $N_f \ge 4$ show that the scaling near the strong coupling chiral transition or sharp crossover is determined by the 3d Gross Neveu ultraviolet-stable renormalization group fixed point. Small deviations of the N_f=4 critical exponents from the respective Gross Neveu ones, hint at evidence for non-zero fermion mass generated by the gauge fields dynamics that might have been enhanced by the four-fermi coupling. It is also shown that the scaling region is suppressed at weak four-fermi couplings and large N_f values. Measurements of i) a monopole susceptibility which is the polarizability of the monopole configurations, and ii) the density of isolated monopoles, imply that for $N_f \ge 1$ and weak gauge couplings the monopoles do not affect the theory's confining properties, because they are shielded.
