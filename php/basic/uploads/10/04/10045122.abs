Title: Five-dimensional AGT Relation and the Deformed beta-ensemble
Authors: Hidetoshi Awata and Yasuhiko Yamada
Abstract: We discuss an analog of the AGT relation in five dimensions. We define a q-deformation of the beta-ensemble which satisfies q-W constraint. We also show a relation with the Nekrasov partition function of 5D SU(N) gauge theory with N_f=2N.
