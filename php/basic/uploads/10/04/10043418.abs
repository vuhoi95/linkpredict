Title: The surface density of holographic entropy
Authors: V. V. Kiselev and S. A. Timofeev
Abstract: On the basis of postulates for the holographic description of gravity and the introduction of entropic force, for static sources we derive the universal law: the entropy of a holographic screen is equal to quarter of its area in the Planck system of units.
