Title: Algebraic renormalization of supersymmetric gauge theories with  dimensionful parameters
Authors: Maarten Golterman and Yigal Shamir
Abstract: It is usually believed that there are no perturbative anomalies in supersymmetric gauge theories beyond the well-known chiral anomaly. In this paper we revisit this issue, because previously given arguments are incomplete. Specifically, we rule out the existence of soft anomalies, i.e., quantum violations of supersymmetric Ward identities proportional to a mass parameter in a classically supersymmetric theory. We do this by combining a previously proven theorem on the absence of hard anomalies with a spurion analysis, using the methods of Algebraic Renormalization. We work in the on-shell component formalism throughout. In order to deal with the nonlinearity of on-shell supersymmetry transformations, we take the spurions to be dynamical, and show how they nevertheless can be decoupled.
