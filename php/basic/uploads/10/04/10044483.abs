Title: Noncommutativity in weakly curved background by canonical methods
Authors: Lj. Davidović and B. Sazdović
Abstract: Using canonical method we investigate $Dp-$brane world-volume noncommutativity in weakly curved background. The term weakly curved means that in the leading order, the source of non-flatness is infinitesimally small Kalb-Ramond field $B_{\mu\nu}$ linear in coordinate, while the Ricci tensor does not contribute being the infinitesimal of the second order. On the solution of boundary conditions, we find simple expression for the space-time coordinates in terms of the effective coordinates and momenta. This basic relation helped us to prove that noncommutativity appears only on the world-sheet boundary. The noncommutativity parameter has a standard form but with infinitesimally small and coordinate dependent antisymmetric tensor $B_{\mu\nu}$. This result coincides with that obtained on the group manifolds in the limit of the large level $n$ of current algebra. After quantization the algebra of functions on Dp-brane world-volume is represented with the Kontsevich star product instead of the Moyal one in the flat background.
