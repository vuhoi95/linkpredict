Title: Radiation Damping in a Non-Abelian Strongly-Coupled Gauge Theory
Authors: Mariano Chernicoff and J. Antonio Garcia and Alberto Guijosa
Abstract: We study a `dressed' or `composite' quark in strongly-coupled N=4 super-Yang-Mills (SYM), making use of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that the standard string dynamics nicely captures the physics of the quark and its surrounding quantum non-Abelian field configuration, making it possible to derive a relativistic equation of motion that incorporates the effects of radiation damping. From this equation one can deduce a non-standard dispersion relation for the composite quark, as well as a Lorentz covariant formula for its rate of radiation.
