Title: Local symmetries of non-expanding horizons
Authors: Rudranil Basu and Ayan Chatterjee and Amit Ghosh
Abstract: Local symmetries of a non-expanding horizon has been investigated in the 1st order formulation of gravity. When applied to a spherically symmetric isolated horizon only a U(1) subgroup of the Lorentz group survives as residual local symmetry that one can make use of in constructing an effective theory on the horizon.
