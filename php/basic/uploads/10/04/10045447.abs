Title: Geometries, Non-Geometries, and Fluxes
Authors: Jock McOrist and David R. Morrison and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: Using F-theory/heterotic duality, we describe a framework for analyzing non-geometric T2-fibered heterotic compactifications to six- and four-dimensions. Our results suggest that among T2-fibered heterotic string vacua, the non-geometric compactifications are just as typical as the geometric ones. We also construct four-dimensional solutions which have novel type IIB and M-theory dual descriptions. These duals are non-geometric with three- and four-form fluxes not of (2,1) or (2,2) Hodge type, respectively, and yet preserve at least N=1 supersymmetry.
