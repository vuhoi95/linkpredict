Title: S-matrix approach to quantum gases in the unitary limit II: the  three-dimensional case
Authors: Pye-Ton How and Andr√© LeClair
Abstract: A new analytic treatment of three-dimensional homogeneous Bose and Fermi gases in the unitary limit of negative infinite scattering length is presented, based on the S-matrix approach to statistical mechanics we recently developed. The unitary limit occurs at a fixed point of the renormalization group with dynamical exponent z=2 where the S-matrix equals -1. For fermions we find T_c /T_F is approximately 0.1. For bosons we present evidence that the gas does not collapse, but rather has a critical point that is a strongly interacting form of Bose-Einstein condensation. This bosonic critical point occurs at n lambda^3 approximately 1.3 where n is the density and lambda the thermal wavelength, which is lower than the ideal gas value of 2.61.
