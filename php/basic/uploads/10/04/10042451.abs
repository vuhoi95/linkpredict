Title: Boltzmann equation in de Sitter space
Authors: Hiroyuki Kitamoto and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: In a time dependent background like de Sitter space, Feynman-Dyson perturbation theory breaks down due to infra-red divergences. We investigate an interacting scalar field theory in Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We derive a Boltzmann equation from a Schwinger-Dyson equation inside the cosmological horizon. Our solution shows that the particle production is compensated by the reduction of the on-shell states due to unitarity. Although the degrees of freedom inside the horizon leads to a small and diminishing screening effect of the cosmological constant, there is a growing screening effect from those outside the horizon.
