Title: Revisitation of the original hot QCD collinear singularity problem
Authors: K. Bouakaz and T. Grandou
Abstract: The long standing issue known as the hot QCD collinear singularity problem has been proven to rely on an incorrect sequence of two mathematical operations. Here, the original derivation of this problem is entirely revisited within the correct sequence, bringing to light new and unexpected conclusions.
