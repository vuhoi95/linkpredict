Abstract: It is known that, in the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, the point-like object is replaced by the smeared object, whose mass density is described by a Gaussian distribution of minimal width $\sqrt{\theta}$ with $\theta$ the noncommutative parameter. The elimination of the point-like structures makes it quite different from the conventional Schwarzschild black hole. In this paper, we mainly investigate the area spectrum and entropy spectrum for the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole with $0\leq \theta\leq (\frac{M}{1.90412})^{2}$. By the use of the new physical interpretation of the quasinormal modes of black holes presented by Maggiore, we obtain the quantized area spectrum and entropy spectrum with the modified Hod's and Kunstatter's methods, respectively. The results show that: (1) The area spectrum and entropy spectrum are discrete. (2) The spectrum spacings are dependent on the parameter $\frac{M}{\sqrt{\theta}}$. (3) The spacing of the area spectrum of the noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole is smaller than that of the conventional one. So does the spacing of the entropy spectrum. (4) The spectra from the two methods are consistent with each other.
