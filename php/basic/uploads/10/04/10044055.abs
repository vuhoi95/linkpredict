Title: Theta-parity in supersymmetry
Authors: Pritibhajan Byakti and Palash B Pal
Abstract: We consider invariance of the action of N=1 supersymmetric theories under the change of sign of the fermionic co-ordinate in superspace. We show that the R-parity can be realized as a special implementation of this symmetry. Other implementations in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model can be related to lepton number and baryon number parities.
