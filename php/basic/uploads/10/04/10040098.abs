Title: Supersymmetric Electromagnetic Waves on Giants and Dual-Giants
Authors: Sujay K. Ashok and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We set up the BPS equations for a D3-brane moving in AdS_5 \times S^5 which preserves two supercharges and with all bosonic fields turned on in the world-volume theory. By solving these, we find generalizations of Mikhailov giants and wobbling dual-giants that include electromagnetic waves propagating on their world-volume. For these giants (dual-giants) we show that the BPS field strength is the real part of the pull-back of a holomorphic 2-form in the ambient space C^3 (C^{1,2}) onto the world-volume.
