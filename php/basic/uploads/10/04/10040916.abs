Title: Antilinear deformations of Coxeter groups, an application to Calogero  models
Authors: Andreas Fring and Monique Smith
Abstract: We construct complex root spaces remaining invariant under antilinear involutions related to all Coxeter groups. We provide two alternative constructions: One is based on deformations of factors of the Coxeter element and the other based on the deformation of the longest element of the Coxeter group. Motivated by the fact that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians admitting an antilinear symmetry may be used to define consistent quantum mechanical systems with real discrete energy spectra, we subsequently employ our constructions to formulate deformations of Coxeter models remaining invariant under these extended Coxeter groups. We provide explicit and generic solutions for the Schroedinger equation of these models for the eigenenergies and corresponding wavefunctions. A new feature of these novel models is that when compared with the undeformed case their solutions are usually no longer singular for an exchange of an amount of particles less than the dimension of the representation space of the roots. The simultaneous scattering of all particles in the model leads to anyonic exchange factors for processes which have no analogue in the undeformed case.
