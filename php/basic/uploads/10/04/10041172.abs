Title: On the Physics of the Riemann Zeros
Authors: Yang-Hui He and Vishnu Jejjala and Djordje Minic
Abstract: We discuss a formal derivation of an integral expression for the Li coefficients associated with the Riemann xi-function which, in particular, indicates that their positivity criterion is obeyed, whereby entailing the criticality of the non-trivial zeros. We conjecture the validity of this and related expressions without the need for the Riemann Hypothesis and discuss a physical interpretation of this result within the Hilbert-Polya approach. In this context we also outline a relation between string theory and the Riemann Hypothesis.
