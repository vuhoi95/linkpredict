Title: Proving the AGT relation for N_f = 0,1,2 antifundamentals
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski and Paulina Suchanek
Abstract: Using recursive relations satisfied by Nekrasov partition functions and by irregular conformal blocks we prove the AGT correspondence in the case of N=2 superconformal SU(2) quiver gauge theories with N_f = 0,1,2 antifundamental hypermultiplets
