Title: Cosmic Dynamics in the Chameleon Cosmology
Authors: H. Farajollahi and A. Salehi
Abstract: We study in this paper chameleon cosmology applied to Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space, which gives rise to the equation of state (EoS) parameter larger than -1 in the past and less than -1 today, satisfying current observations. We also study cosmological constraints on the model using the time evolution of the cosmological redshift of distant sources which directly probes the expansion history of the universe. Due to the evolution of the universe's expansion rate, the model independent Cosmological Redshift Drift (CRD)test is expected to experience a small, systematic drift as a function of time. The model is supported by the observational data obtained from the test.
