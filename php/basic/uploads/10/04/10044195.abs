Title: Wallcrossing and Cohomology of The Moduli Space of Hitchin Pairs
Authors: Wu-yen Chuang and Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Guang Pan
Abstract: A conjectural recursive relation for the Poincar\'e polynomial of the Hitchin moduli space is derived from wallcrossing in the refined local Donaldson-Thomas theory of a curve. A doubly refined generalization of this theory is also conjectured and shown to similarly determine the Hodge polynomial of the same moduli space.
