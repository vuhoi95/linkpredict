Title: Large-angle anomalies in the CMB
Authors: Craig J. Copi and Dragan Huterer and Dominik J. Schwarz and Glenn D. Starkman
Abstract: We review the recently found large-scale anomalies in the maps of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. These include alignments of the largest modes of CMB anisotropy with each other and with geometry and direction of motion of the Solar System, and the unusually low power at these largest scales. We discuss these findings in relation to expectation from standard inflationary cosmology, their statistical significance, the tools to study them, and the various attempts to explain them.
