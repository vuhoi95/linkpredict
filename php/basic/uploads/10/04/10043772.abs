Title: Long life of Gauss-Bonnet corrected black holes
Authors: R. A. Konoplya and A. Zhidenko
Abstract: Dictated by the string theory and various higher dimensional scenarios, black holes in $D>4$-dimensional space-times must have higher curvature corrections. The first and dominant term is quadratic in curvature, and called the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term. We shall show that although the Gauss-Bonnet correction changes black hole's geometry only softly, the emission of gravitons is suppressed by many orders even at quite small values of the GB coupling. The huge suppression of the graviton emission is due to the multiplication of the two effects: the quick cooling of the black hole when one turns on the GB coupling and the exponential decreasing of the grey-body factor of the tensor type of gravitons at small and moderate energies. At higher $D$ the tensor gravitons emission is dominant, so that the overall lifetime of black holes with Gauss-Bonnet corrections is many orders larger than was expected. This effect should be relevant for the future experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Keywords: Hawking radiation, black hole evaporation.
