Title: U_A(1) Anomaly at high temperature: the scalar-pseudoscalar splitting in  QCD
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Alex Kovner
Abstract: We estimate the splitting between the spatial correlation lengths in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels in QCD at high temperature. The splitting is due to the contribution of the instanton/anti-instanton chains in the thermal ensemble, even though instanton contributions to thermodynamic quantities are suppressed. The splitting vanishes at asymptotically high temperatures as $\Delta M/M\propto (\Lambda_{QCD}/T)^b$, where $b$ is the beta function coefficient.
