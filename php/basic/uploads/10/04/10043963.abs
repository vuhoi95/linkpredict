Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of the Reissner-Nordstr√∏m Black Holes
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Jia-Rui Sun
Abstract: Motivated by recent progresses in the holographic descriptions of the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m (RN) black holes, we explore the hidden conformal symmetry of nonextremal uplifted 5D RN black hole by studying the near horizon wave equation of a massless scalar field propagating in this background. Similar to the Kerr black hole case, this hidden symmetry is broken by the periodicity of the associated angle coordinate in the background geometry, but the results somehow testify the dual CFT description of the nonextremal RN black holes. The duality is further supported by matching of the entropies and absorption cross sections calculated from both CFT and gravity sides.
