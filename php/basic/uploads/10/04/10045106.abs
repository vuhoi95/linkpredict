Title: Dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity, Godel Universe and variable  cosmological constant
Authors: C. Furtado and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. F. Santos
Abstract: We study the condition for the consistency of the G\"{o}del metric with the dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity. It turns out to be that this compatibility can be achieved only if the cosmological constant is variable in the space.
