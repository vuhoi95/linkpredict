Title: A coherent state approach to effective potential in noncommutative  D=(2+1) models
Authors: A. C. Lehum and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this work we study the effective potential in noncommutative three-dimensional models where the noncommutativity is introduced through the coherent state approach. We discuss some important characteristics that seem to be typical to this approach, specially the behavior of the quantum corrections in the small noncommutativity limit.
