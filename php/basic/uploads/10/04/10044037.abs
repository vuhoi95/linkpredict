Title: Exact spin quantum Hall current between boundaries of a lattice strip
Authors: Jan de Gier and Bernard Nienhuis and Anita Ponsaing
Abstract: Employing an inhomogeneous solvable lattice model, we derive an exact expression for a boundary-to-boundary edge current on a lattice of finite width. This current is an example of a class of parafermionic observables recently introduced in an attempt to rigorously prove conformal invariance of the scaling limit of critical two-dimensional lattice models. It also corresponds to the spin current at the spin-Quantum Hall transition in a model introduced by Chalker and Coddington, and generalized by Gruzberg, Ludwig and Read. Our result is derived from a solution of the $q$-deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, and is expressed in terms of a symplectic Toda-lattice wave-function.
