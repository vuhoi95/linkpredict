Title: Extremal Charged Rotating Black Holes in Odd Dimensions
Authors: Masoud Allahverdizadeh and Jutta Kunz and Francisco Navarro-Lerida
Abstract: Employing higher order perturbation theory, we obtain charged rotating black holes in odd dimensions, where the Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian may be supplemented with a Chern-Simons term. Starting from the Myers-Perry solutions, we use the electric charge as the perturbative parameter, and focus on extremal black holes with equal-magnitude angular momenta. For Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with arbitrary Chern-Simons coupling constant, we perform the perturbations up to third order for any odd dimension. We discuss the physical properties of these black holes and study their dependence on the charge. In particular, we show that the gyromagnetic ratio $g$ of Einstein-Maxwell black holes differs from the lowest order perturbative value $D-2$, and that the first correction term to $g/(D-2)$ is universal.
