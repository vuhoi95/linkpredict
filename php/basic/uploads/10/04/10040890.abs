Title: Gravitational-Wave Stochastic Background from Kinks and Cusps on Cosmic  Strings
Authors: S. Olmez and V. Mandic and X. Siemens
Abstract: We compute the contribution of kinks on cosmic string loops to stochastic background of gravitational waves (SBGW).We find that kinks contribute at the same order as cusps to the SBGW.We discuss the accessibility of the total background due to kinks as well as cusps to current and planned gravitational wave detectors, as well as to the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and pulsar timing constraints. As in the case of cusps, we find that current data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO, are sensitive to areas of parameter space of cosmic string models complementary to those accessible to pulsar, BBN, and CMB bounds.
