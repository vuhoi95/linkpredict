Title: Calabi-Yau (p+1)-folds from p-folds
Authors: H. Lu and Zhao-Long Wang
Abstract: We establish the general formalism for constructing metrics of Calabi-Yau (p+1)-folds in terms of that of a p-fold by adding a complex-line bundle. We present a few explicit low-lying examples. We further consider holomorphic linearization and obtain the six-dimensional analogue of the Gibbons-Hawking instanton. Whilst the Kahler potential for the Gibbons-Hawking instanton is given by the harmonic function of a three-dimensional flat space, for the generalized solution it is related to the harmonic functions of certain three-dimensional non-flat spaces that are direct products of R and two-dimensional Kahler spaces.
