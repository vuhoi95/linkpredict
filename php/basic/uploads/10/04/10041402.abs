Title: Punctuated eternal inflation via AdS/CFT
Authors: David A. Lowe and Shubho Roy
Abstract: The work is an attempt to model a scenario of inflation in the framework of Anti de Sit- ter/Conformal Field theory (AdS/CFT) duality, a potentially complete nonperturbative description of quantum gravity via string theory. We look at bubble geometries with de Sitter interiors within an ambient Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter black hole spacetime and obtain a characterization for the states in the dual CFT on boundary of the asymptotic AdS which code the expanding dS bubble. These can then in turn be used to specify initial conditions for cosmology. Our scenario naturally interprets the entropy of de Sitter space as a (logarithm of) subspace of states of the black hole microstates. Consistency checks are performed and a number of implications regarding cosmology are discussed including how the key problems or paradoxes of conventional eternal inflation are overcome.
