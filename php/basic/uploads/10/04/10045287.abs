Title: Static solutions with nontrivial boundaries for the  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in vacuum
Authors: Gustavo Dotti and Julio Oliva and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: The classification of certain class of static solutions for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in vacuum is performed in $d\geq5$ dimensions. The class of metrics under consideration is such that the spacelike section is a warped product of the real line and an arbitrary base manifold. It is shown that for a generic value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the base manifold must be necessarily Einstein, with an additional restriction on its Weyl tensor for $d>5$. The boundary admits a wider class of geometries only in the special case when the Gauss-Bonnet coupling is such that the theory admits a unique maximally symmetric solution. The additional freedom in the boundary metric enlarges the class of allowed geometries in the bulk, which are classified within three main branches, containing new black holes and wormholes in vacuum.
