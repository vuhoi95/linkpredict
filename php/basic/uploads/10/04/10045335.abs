Title: Entropy of Kaluza-Klein Black Hole from Kerr/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Ran Li and Ming-Fan Li and Ji-Rong Ren
Abstract: We extend the recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence to examine the dual conformal field theory of Kaluza-Klein black hole. For the extremal Kaluza-Klein black hole, the central charge and temperature of the dual conformal field are calculated, and the microscopic entropy calculated by using Cardy formula agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of extremal Kaluza-Klein black hole. For the non-extremal case, we investigate the hidden conformal symmetry of Kaluza-Klein black hole by studying the near-region wave equation of a neutral massless scalar field, and find the left and right temperatures of dual conformal field theory. Furthermore, the entropy of non-extremal Kaluza-Klein black hole is reproduced by using Cardy formula.
