Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Field Localized on Walls with Four-Dimensional World  Volume
Authors: Kazutoshi Ohta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: A mechanism using the position-dependent gauge coupling is proposed to localize non-Abelian gauge fields on domain walls in five-dimensional space-time. Low-energy effective theory posseses a massless vector field, and a mass gap. The four-dimensional gauge invariance is maintained intact. We obtain perturbatively the four-dimensional Coulomb law for static sources on the domain wall. BPS domain wall solutions with the localization mechanism are explicitly constructed in the U(1)xU(1) supersymmetric gauge theory coupling to the non-Abelian gauge fields only through the cubic prepotential, which is consistent with the general principle of supersymmetry in five-dimensional space-time.
