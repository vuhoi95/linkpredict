Title: Properties of the general NHDM. I. The orbit space
Authors: I. P. Ivanov and C. C. Nishi
Abstract: We study the scalar sector of the general N-Higgs-doublet model via geometric constructions in the space of gauge orbits. We give a detailed description of the shape of the orbit space both for general N and, in more detail, for N=3. We also comment on remarkable analogies between NHDM and quantum information theory.
