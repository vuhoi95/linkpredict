Title: Semiclassical calculation of an induced decay of false vacuum
Authors: A. Monin and M. B. Voloshin
Abstract: We consider a model where a scalar field develops a metastable vacuum state and weakly interacts with another scalar field. In this situation we find the probability of decay of the false vacuum stimulated by the presence and collisions of particles of the second field. The discussed calculation is an illustration of the recently suggested thermal approach to treatment of induced semiclassical processes.
