Abstract: The (D+1)-dimensional $(\beta,\beta')$-two-parameter Lorentz-covariant deformed algebra introduced by Quesne and Tkachuk [C. Quesne and V. M. Tkachuk, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. \textbf {39}, 10909 (2006).], leads to a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position (minimal length). The Klein-Gordon equation in a (3+1)-dimensional space-time described by Quesne-Tkachuk Lorentz-covariant deformed algebra is studied in the case where $\beta'=2\beta$ up to first order over deformation parameter $\beta$. It is shown that the modified Klein-Gordon equation which contains fourth-order derivative of the wave function describes two massive particles with different masses. We have shown that physically acceptable mass states can only exist for $\beta<\frac{1}{8m^{2}c^{2}}$ which leads to an isotropic minimal length in the interval $10^{-17}m<(\bigtriangleup X^{i})_{0}<10^{-15}m$. Finally, we have shown that the above estimation of minimal length is in good agreement with the results obtained in previous investigations.
