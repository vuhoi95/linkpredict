Title: Influence on the entropic force by the virtual degree of freedom on the  holographic screen
Authors: Qiyuan Pan and Bin Wang
Abstract: We generalize the study of entropic force to a general static spherical spacetime and examine the acceleration, temperature, equation of gravity and the energy associated with the holographic screen in this general background. We show that the virtual degree of freedom on the holographic screen plays a crucial role in interpreting field equations of gravity based on thermodynamical perspective.
