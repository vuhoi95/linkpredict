Title: Lie $3-$algebra and super-affinization of split-octonions
Authors: Sergio Giardino and Hector L. Carrion
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to extend the concept of a generalized Lie $3-$ algebra, known to the divisional algebra of the octonions $\mathbb{O}$, to split-octonions $\mathbb{SO}$, which is non-divisional. This is achieved through the unification of the product of both of the algebras in a single operation. Accordingly, a notational device is introduced to unify the product of both algebras. We verify that $\mathbb{SO}$ is a Malcev algebra and we recalculate known relations for the structure constants in terms of the introduced structure tensor. Finally we construct the manifestly super-symmetric $\mathcal{N}=1\;\mathbb{SO}$ affine super-algebra. An application of the split Lie $3-$algebra for a Bagger and Lambert gauge theory is also discussed.
