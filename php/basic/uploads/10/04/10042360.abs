Title: Limits on the parameters of the equation of state for interacting dark  energy
Authors: German Izquierdo and Diego Pavon
Abstract: Under the assumption that cold dark matter and dark energy interact with each other through a small coupling term, $Q$, we constrain the parameter space of the equation of state $w$ of those dark energy fields whose variation of the field since last scattering do not exceed Planck's mass. We use three parameterizations of $w$ and two different expressions for $Q$. Our work extends previous ones.
