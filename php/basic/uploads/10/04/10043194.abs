Title: Semi-simple $o(N)$-extended super-Poincar√© algebra
Authors: Dmitrij V. Soroka and Vyacheslav A. Soroka
Abstract: A semi-simple tensor extension of the Poincar\'e algebra is given for the arbitrary dimensions $D$. It is illustrated that this extension is a direct sum of the $D$-dimensional Lorentz algebra $so(D-1,1)$ and $D$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) algebra $so(D-1,2)$. A supersymmetric also semi-simple $o(N)$ generalization of this extension is introduced in the D=4 dimensions. It is established that this generalization is a direct sum of the 4-dimensional Lorentz algebra $so(3,1)$ and orthosymplectic algebra $osp(N,4)$ (super-AdS algebra). Quadratic Casimir operators for the generalization are constructed. The form of these operators indicates that the components of an irreducible representation for this generalization are distinguished by the mass, angular momentum and quantum numbers corresponding to the internal symmetry, tensor and supersymmetry generators. That generalizes the Regge trajectory idea. The probable unification of the N=10 supergravity with the SO(10) GUT model is discussed. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Anna Yakovlevna Gelyukh.
