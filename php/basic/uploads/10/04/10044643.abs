Title: Studying the topological stability of the $λΦ^4 $ kink
Authors: Hernán Piragua and Patricio S. Letelier
Abstract: The lambda-phi4 kink is linearly and topologically stable. We study how extra energy perturbations are dissipated beyond the linear regime. We found that depending on the width, amplitude and energy of a Gaussian perturbation different scenarios are possible: radiation, oscillons creation, kink anti-kink pairs production and shock waves.
