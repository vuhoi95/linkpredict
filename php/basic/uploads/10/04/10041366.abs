Title: Casimir energy between media-separated cylinders: the scalar case
Authors: F. C. Lombardo and F. D. Mazzitelli and P. I. Villar and D. A. R. Dalvit
Abstract: We derive exact expressions for the Casimir scalar interaction energy between media-separated eccentric dielectric cylinders and for the media-separated cylinder-plane geometry using a mode-summation approach. Similarly to the electromagnetic Casimir-Lifshitz interaction energy between fluid-separated planar plates, the force between cylinders is attractive or repulsive depending on the relative values of the permittivities of the three intervening media.
