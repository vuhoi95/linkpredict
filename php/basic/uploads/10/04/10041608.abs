Title: Three Dimensional Charged Black Hole Inspired by Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Alexis Larranaga and Juan Manuel Tejeiro
Abstract: We find a new charged black hole in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using an anisotropic perfect fluid inspired by the noncommutative black hole as the source of matter and a gaussian distribution of electric charge. We deduce the thermodynamical quantities of this black hole and compare them with those of a charged BTZ solution.
