Title: Decaying dark matter mimicking time-varying dark energy
Authors: Sourish Dutta and Robert J. Scherrer
Abstract: A $\Lambda$CDM model with dark matter that decays into inert relativistic energy on a timescale longer than the Hubble time will produce an expansion history that can be misinterpreted as stable dark matter with time-varying dark energy. We calculate the corresponding spurious equation of state parameter, $\widetilde w_\phi$, as a function of redshift, and show that the evolution of $\widetilde w_\phi$ depends strongly on the assumed value of the dark matter density, erroneously taken to scale as $a^{-3}$. Depending on the latter, one can obtain models that mimic quintessence ($\widetilde w_\phi > -1$), phantom models ($\widetilde w_\phi < -1$) or models in which the equation of state parameter crosses the phantom divide, evolving from $\widetilde w_\phi > -1$ at high redshift to $\widetilde w_\phi < -1$ at low redshift. All of these models generically converge toward $\widetilde w_\phi \approx -1$ at the present. The degeneracy between the $\Lambda$CDM model with decaying dark matter and the corresponding spurious quintessence model is broken by the growth of density perturbations.
