Title: Circle actions, central extensions and string structures
Authors: Michael K. Murray and Raymond F. Vozzo
Abstract: The caloron correspondence can be understood as an equivalence of categories between $G$-bundles over circle bundles and $LG \rtimes_\rho S^1$-bundles where $LG$ is the group of smooth loops in $G$. We use it, and lifting bundle gerbes, to derive an explicit differential form based formula for the (real) string class of an $LG \rtimes_\rho S^1$-bundle.
