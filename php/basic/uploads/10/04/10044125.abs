Abstract: Results on the resummation of non-power-series expansions of the Adler function of a scalar, $D_S$, and a vector, $D_V$, correlator are presented within fractional analytic perturbation theory (FAPT). The first observable can be used to determine the decay width $\Gamma_{H\to b\bar{b}}$ of a scalar Higgs boson to a bottom-antibottom pair, while the second one is relevant for the $e^+e^-$ annihilation cross section. The obtained estimates are compared with those from fixed-order (FOPT) and contour-improved perturbation theory (CIPT), working out the differences. We prove that although FAPT and CIPT are conceptually different, they yield identical results. The convergence properties of these expansions are discussed and predictions are extracted for the resummed series of $R_S$ and $D_V$ using one- and two-loop coupling running, and making use of appropriate generating functions for the coefficients of the perturbative series.
