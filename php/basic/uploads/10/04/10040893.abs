Title: Large non-Gaussianities in the Effective Field Theory Approach to  Single-Field Inflation: the Bispectrum
Authors: Nicola Bartolo and Matteo Fasiello and Sabino Matarrese and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: The methods of effective field theory are used to study generic theories of inflation with a single inflaton field and to perform a general analysis of the associated non-Gaussianities. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of the various generic three-point correlators, the bispectra, which may be generated by different classes of single-field inflationary models. Besides the well-known results for the DBI-like models and the ghost inflationary theories, we point out that curvature-related interactions may give rise to large non-Gaussianities in the form of bispectra characterized by a flat shape which, quite interestingly, is independently produced by several interaction terms. In a subsequent work, we will perform a similar general analysis for the non-Gaussianities generated by the generic four-point correlator, the trispectrum.
