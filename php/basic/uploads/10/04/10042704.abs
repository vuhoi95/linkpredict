Title: Can primordial magnetic fields seeded by electroweak strings cause an  alignment of quasar axes on cosmological scales?
Authors: Robert Poltis and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: The decay of non-topological electroweak strings formed during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe may leave an observable imprint in the universe today. Such strings can naturally seed primordial magnetic fields. Protogalaxies then tend to form with their axis of rotation parallel to the external magnetic field, and moreover, the external magnetic field produces torque which forces the galaxy axis to align with the magnetic field, even if the two axis were not aligned initially. This can explain an (observed, but as of yet unexplained) alignment of the quasars' polarization vectors. We demonstrate that the shape of a magnetic field left over from two looped electroweak strings can explain the non-trivial alignment of quasar polarization vectors and make predictions for future observations.
