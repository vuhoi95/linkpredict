Title: Unconventional Fermi surface in two-dimensional systems of Dirac  fermions
Authors: Jing-Rong Wang and Guo-Zhu Liu
Abstract: At the low energy regime, the decay rate of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions due to interactions can be written as $\mathrm{Im}\Sigma(\omega) \propto |\omega|^{x}$ at zero temperature. We find that the fermion system has: I) no sharp Fermi surface and no well-defined quasiparticle peak for $0<x<1/2$; II) a sharp Fermi surface but no well-defined quasiparticle peak for $1/2\leq x\leq 1$; III) both sharp Fermi surface and well-defined quasiparticle peak for $x>1$. In the presence of long-range gauge/Coulomb interaction or certain massless boson mode, the system exhibits unusual behavior belonging to class II.
