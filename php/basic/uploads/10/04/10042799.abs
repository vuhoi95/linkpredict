Abstract: The extended supersymmetric (SUSY) sigma-model has been proposed on the bases of SO(2N+1) Lie algebra spanned by fermion annihilation-creation operators and pair operators. The canonical transformation, extension of an SO(2N) Bogoliubov transformation to an SO(2N+1) group, is introduced. Embedding the SO(2N+1) group into an SO(2N+2) group and using SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset variables, we have investigated the SUSY sigma-model on the Kaehler manifold, the coset space SO(2N+2)/U(N+1). We have constructed the Killing potential, extension of the potential in the SO(2N)/U(N) coset space to that in the SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset space. It is equivalent to the generalized density matrix whose diagonal-block part is related to a reduced scalar potential with a Fayet-Ilipoulos term. The f-deformed reduced scalar potential is optimized with respect to vacuum expectation value of the sigma-model fields and a solution for one of the SO(2N+1) group parameters has been obtained. The solution, however, is only a small part of all solutions obtained from anomaly-free SUSY coset models. To construct the coset models consistently, we must embed a coset coordinate in an anomaly-free spinor representation (rep) of SO(2N+2) group and give corresponding Kaehler and Killing potentials for an anomaly-free SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) model based on each positive chiral spinor rep. Using such mathematical manipulation we construct successfully the anomaly-free SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) SUSY sigma-model and investigate new aspects which have never been seen in the SUSY sigma-model on the Kaehler coset space SO(2N)/U(N). We reach a f-deformed reduced scalar potential. It is minimized with respect to the vacuum expectation value of anomaly-free SUSY sigma-model fields. Thus we find an interesting f-deformed solution very different from the previous solution for an anomaly-free SO(2.5+2)/(SU(5+1)*U(1)) SUSY sigma-model.
