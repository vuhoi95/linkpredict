Abstract: We develop a theory of nonlinear cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales for a single scalar field with a general kinetic term and a general form of the potential. We employ the ADM formalism and the spatial gradient expansion approach, characterised by $O(\epsilon^m)$, where $\epsilon=1/(HL)$ is a small parameter representing the ratio of the Hubble radius to the characteristic length scale $L$ of perturbations. We obtain the general solution for a full nonlinear version of the curvature perturbation valid up through second-order in $\epsilon$ ($m=2$). We find the solution satisfies a nonlinear second-order differential equation as an extension of the equation for the linear curvature perturbation on the comoving hypersurface. Then we formulate a general method to match a perturbative solution accurate to $n$-th-order in perturbation inside the horizon to our nonlinear solution accurate to second-order ($m=2$) in the gradient expansion on scales slightly greater than the Hubble radius. The formalism developed in this paper allows us to calculate the superhorizon evolution of a primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the so-called $\delta N$ formalism or separate universe approach which is equivalent to leading order ($m=0$) in the gradient expansion. In particular, it can deal with the case when there is a temporary violation of slow-roll conditions. As an application of our formalism, we consider Starobinsky's model, which is a single field model having a temporary non-slow-roll stage due to a sharp change in the potential slope. We find that a large non-Gaussianity can be generated even on superhorizon scales due to this temporary suspension of slow-roll inflation.
