Title: Generating Higher-Order Lie Algebras by Expanding Maurer Cartan Forms
Authors: Ricardo Caroca and Nelson Merino and Alfredo PÃ©rez and Patricio Salgado
Abstract: By means of a generalization of the Maurer-Cartan expansion method we construct a procedure to obtain expanded higher-order Lie algebras. The expanded higher order Maurer-Cartan equations for the case $\mathcal{G}=V_{0}\oplus V_{1}$ are found. A dual formulation for the S-expansion multialgebra procedure is also considered. The expanded higher order Maurer Cartan equations are recovered from S-expansion formalism by choosing a special semigroup. This dual method could be useful in finding a generalization to the case of a generalized free differential algebra, which may be relevant for physical applications in, e.g., higher-spin gauge theories.
