Title: Extremal Three-point Correlators in Kerr/CFT
Authors: Melanie Becker and Sera Cremonini and Waldemar Schulgin
Abstract: We compute three-point correlation functions in the near-extremal, near-horizon region of a Kerr black hole, and compare to the corresponding finite-temperature conformal field theory correlators. For simplicity, we focus on scalar fields dual to operators ${\cal O}_h$ whose conformal dimensions obey $h_3=h_1+h_2$, which we name \emph{extremal} in analogy with the classic $AdS_5 \times S^5$ three-point function in the literature. For such extremal correlators we find perfect agreement with the conformal field theory side, provided that the coupling of the cubic interaction contains a vanishing prefactor $\propto h_3-h_1-h_2$. In fact, the bulk three-point function integral for such extremal correlators diverges as $1/(h_3-h_1-h_2)$. This behavior is analogous to what was found in the context of extremal AdS/CFT three-point correlators. As in AdS/CFT our correlation function can nevertheless be computed via analytic continuation from the non-extremal case.
