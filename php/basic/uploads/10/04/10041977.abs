Title: Branes in the OSP(1|2) WZNW model
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida
Abstract: The boundary OSP(1|2) WZNW model possesses two types of branes, which are localized on supersymmetric Euclidean AdS$_2$ and on two-dimensional superspheres. We compute the coupling of closed strings to these branes with two different methods. The first one uses factorization constraints and the other one a correspondence to boundary N=1 super-Liouville field theory, which we proof with path integral techniques. We check that the results obey the Cardy condition and reproduce the semi-classical computations. For the check we also compute the spectral density of open strings that are attached to the non-compact branes.
