Title: On the consistency of the Horava Theory
Authors: Jorge Bellorin and Alvaro Restuccia
Abstract: With the goal of giving evidence for the theoretical consistency of the Horava Theory, we perform a Hamiltonian analysis on a classical model suitable for analyzing its effective dynamics at large distances. The model is the lowest-order truncation of the Horava Theory with the detailed-balance condition. We consider the pure gravitational theory without matter sources. The model has the same potential term of general relativity, but the kinetic term is modified by the inclusion of an arbitrary coupling constant lambda. Since this constant breaks the general covariance under space-time diffeomorphisms, it is believed that arbitrary values of lambda deviate the model from general relativity. We show that this model is not a deviation at all, instead it is completely equivalent to general relativity in a particular partial gauge fixing for it. In doing this, we clarify the role of a second-class constraint of the model.
