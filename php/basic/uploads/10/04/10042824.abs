Title: Covariantly constant forms on torsionful geometries from world-sheet and  spacetime perspectives
Authors: P. S. Howe and George Papadopoulos and Vid Stojevic
Abstract: The symmetries of two-dimensional supersymmetric sigma models on target spaces with covariantly constant forms associated to special holonomy groups are analysed. It is shown that each pair of such forms gives rise to a new one, called a Nijenhuis form, and that there may be further reductions of the structure group. In many cases of interest there are also covariantly constant one-forms which also give rise to symmetries. These geometries are of interest in the context of heterotic supergravity solutions and the associated reductions are studied from a spacetime point of view via the Killing spinor equations.
