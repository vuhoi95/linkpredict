Title: Top Quarks as a Window to String Resonances
Authors: Zhe Dong and Tao Han and Min-xin Huang and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We study the discovery potential of string resonances decaying to $t\bar{t}$ final state at the LHC. We point out that top quark pair production is a promising and an advantageous channel for studying such resonances, due to their low Standard Model background and unique kinematics. We study the invariant mass distribution and angular dependence of the top pair production cross section via exchanges of string resonances. The mass ratios of these resonances and the unusual angular distribution may help identify their fundamental properties and distinguish them from other new physics. We find that string resonances for a string scale below 4 TeV can be detected via the $t\bar{t}$ channel, either from reconstructing the $t\bar{t}$ semi-leptonic decay or recent techniques in identifying highly boosted tops.
