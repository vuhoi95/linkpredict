Title: Anisotropic oscillator with pseudo-hermiticity and its noncommutative  extension
Authors: Jun-Qing Li and Yan-Gang Miao
Abstract: When a non-hermitian hamiltonian has a certain symmetry, such as the PT pseudo-hermiticity, it is still possible that the hamiltonian has a real spectrum. In this note, by adding an imaginary potential proportional to ip_1p_2 to the hamiltonian of an anisotropic planar oscillator, we construct a PT pseudo-hermitian hamiltonian and obtain its real spectrum. In addition, we find that the reality of the energy spectrum remains when the model is extended to the canonical noncommutative space.
