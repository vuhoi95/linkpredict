Title: Quantum counterparts of VII$_{a}$, III$_{a=1}$, VI$_{a\neq1}$ over  harmonic oscillator
Authors: E. Paal and J. Virkepu
Abstract: Operadic Lax representations for the harmonic oscillator are used to construct the quantum counterparts of some real three dimensional Lie algebras. The Jacobi operators of these quantum algebras are studied in semiclassical approximation.
