Abstract: One of the many remarkable features of MHV scattering amplitudes is their conjectured equality to lightlike polygon Wilson loops, which apparently holds at all orders in perturbation theory as well as non-perturbatively. This duality is usually expressed in terms of purely four-dimensional quantities obtained by appropriate subtraction of the IR and UV divergences from amplitudes and Wilson loops respectively. In this paper we demonstrate, by explicit calculation, the completely unanticipated fact that the equality continues to hold at two loops through order epsilon in dimensional regularization for both the four-particle amplitude and the (parity-even part of the) five-particle amplitude.
