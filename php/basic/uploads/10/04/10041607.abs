Title: Infrared propagators of Yang-Mills theory from perturbation theory
Authors: Matthieu Tissier and Nicolas Wschebor
Abstract: We show that the correlation functions of ghosts and gluons for the pure Yang-Mills theory in Landau gauge can be accurately reproduced for all momenta by a one-loop calculation. The key point is to use a massive extension of the Faddeev-Popov action. The agreement with lattice simulation is excellent in d=4. The one-loop calculation also reproduces all the characteristic features of the lattice simulations in d=3 and naturally explains the pecularities of the propagators in d=2.
