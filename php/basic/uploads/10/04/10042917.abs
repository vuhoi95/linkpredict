Title: The matrix model version of AGT conjecture and CIV-DV prepotential
Authors: A. Morozov and Sh. Shakirov
Abstract: Recently exact formulas were provided for partition function of conformal (multi-Penner) beta-ensemble in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa phase, which, if interpreted as Dotsenko-Fateev correlator of screenings and analytically continued in the number of screening insertions, represents generic Virasoro conformal blocks. Actually these formulas describe the lowest terms of the q_a-expansion, where q_a parameterize the shape of the Penner potential, and are exact in the filling numbers N_a. At the same time, the older theory of CIV-DV prepotential, straightforwardly extended to arbitrary beta and to non-polynomial potentials, provides an alternative expansion: in powers of N_a and exact in q_a. We check that the two expansions coincide in the overlapping region, i.e. for the lowest terms of expansions in both q_a and N_a. This coincidence is somewhat non-trivial, since the two methods use different integration contours: integrals in one case are of the B-function (Euler-Selberg) type, while in the other case they are Gaussian integrals.
