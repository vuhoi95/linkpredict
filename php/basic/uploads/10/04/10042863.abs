Title: Novel Complete Non-compact Symmetries for the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in  a Wormhole Scalar Model and Axion-Dilaton String Cosmology
Authors: Ruben Cordero and Victor D. Granados and Roberto D. Mota
Abstract: We find the full symmetries of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Hawking and Page wormhole model and an axion-dilaton string cosmology. We show that the Wheeler-DeWitt Hamiltonian admits an U(1,1) hidden symmetry for the Hawking and Page model and U(2,1) for the axion-dilaton string cosmology. If we consider the existence of matter-energy renormalization, for each of these models we find that the Wheeler-DeWitt Hamiltonian accept an additional SL(2,R) dynamical symmetry. In this case, we show that the SL(2,R) dynamical symmetry generators transform the states from one energy Hilbert eigensubspace to another. Some new wormhole type-solutions for both models are found.
