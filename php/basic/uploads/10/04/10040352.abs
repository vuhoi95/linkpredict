Title: Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Quest for Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: Quantum Gravity by Causal Dynamical Triangulation has over the last few years emerged as a serious contender for a nonperturbative description of the theory. It is a nonperturbative implementation of the sum-over-histories, which relies on few ingredients and initial assumptions, has few free parameters and - crucially - is amenable to numerical simulations. It is the only approach to have demonstrated that a classical universe can be generated dynamically from Planckian quantum fluctuations. At the same time, it allows for the explicit evaluation of expectation values of invariants characterizing the highly nonclassical, short-distance behaviour of spacetime. As an added bonus, we have learned important lessons on which aspects of spacetime need to be fixed a priori as part of the background structure and which can be expected to emerge dynamically.
