Title: Non-Perturbative Field Theory - From two dimensional conformal field  theory to QCD in four dimensions
Authors: Yitzhak Frishman and Jacob Sonnenschein
Abstract: This note is based on the summary of our book entitled "Non-perturbative field theoryfrom two dimensional conformal field theory to QCD in four dimensions", published recently by Cambridge University Press. It includes 436 pages. The book provides a detailed description of the tool box of non-perturbative techniques, presents applications of them to simplified systems, mainly of gauge dynamics in two dimensions, and examines the lessons one can learn from those systems about four dimensional QCD and hadron physics. In particular the book deals with conformal invariance, integrability, bosonization, large N, solitons in two dimensions and monopoles and instantons in four dimensions, confinement versus screening and finally the hadronic spectrum and scattering. We also attach the table of contents and the list of references of the book. We would be grateful for any comments or suggestions related to the material in the book. These may be incorporated in a possible future edition. They may be sent via the e-mails below.
