Title: SL(2,C) gravity on noncommutative space with Poisson structure
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Shao-Jun Zhang
Abstract: The Einstein's gravity theory can be formulated as an SL(2,C) gauge theory in terms of spinor notations. In this paper, we consider a noncommutative space with the Poisson structure and construct an SL(2,C) formulation of gravity on such a space. Using the covariant coordinate technique, we build a gauge invariant action in which, according to the Seiberg-Witten map, the physical degrees of freedom are expressed in terms of their commutative counterparts up to the first order in noncommutative parameters.
