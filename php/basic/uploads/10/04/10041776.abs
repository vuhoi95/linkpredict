Title: Trispectrum from Ghost Inflation
Authors: Keisuke Izumi and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: Ghost inflation predicts almost scale-invariant primordial cosmological perturbations with relatively large non-Gaussianity. The bispectrum is known to have a large contribution at the wavenumbers forming an equilateral triangle and the corresponding nonlinear parameter $f_{NL}^{equil}$ is typically of order $O(10^2)$. In this paper we calculate trispectrum from ghost inflation and show that the corresponding nonlinear parameter $\tau_{NL}$ is typically of order $O(10^4)$. We investigate the shape dependence of the trispectrum and see that it has some features different from DBI inflation. Therefore, our result may be useful as a template to distinguish ghost inflation from other models of inflation by future experiments.
