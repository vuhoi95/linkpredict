Title: Wall Crossing and Instantons in Compactified Gauge Theory
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Nick Dorey and Kirill Petunin
Abstract: We calculate the leading weak-coupling instanton contribution to the moduli-space metric of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) compactified on R^3 x S^1. The results are in precise agreement with the semiclassical expansion of the exact metric recently conjectured by Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke based on considerations related to wall-crossing in the corresponding four-dimensional theory.
