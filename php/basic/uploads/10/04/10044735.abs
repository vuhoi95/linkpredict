Title: Amplitudes of 3D and 6D Maximal Superconformal Theories in Supertwistor  Space
Authors: Yu-tin Huang and Arthur E. Lipstein
Abstract: We use supertwistor space to construct scattering amplitudes of maximal superconformal theories in three and six dimensions. In both cases, the constraints of superconformal invariance and rationality imply that the three-point amplitude vanishes on-shell, which constrains the four-point amplitude to have vanishing residues in all channels. In three dimensions, we find a unique solution for the four-point amplitude and demonstrate that it agrees with the component result in the BLG theory. This suggests that BLG is the unique three-dimensional theory with classical OSp(8|4) symmetry that admits a Lagrangian description. We also show that one can derive the four-point amplitude of the ABJM theory from our N=8 result by reducing the supersymmetry, which implies that the tree-level Yangian symmetry recently found in ABJM is also present in BLG. In six dimensions, we find that the consistency conditions imply that all tree-level amplitudes vanish. This leads us to conjecture that an interacting six-dimensional theory with classical OSp(8|4) symmetry does not have a Lagrangian description, local or nonlocal, unless the (2,0) tensor multiplets are supplemented by additional degrees of freedom.
