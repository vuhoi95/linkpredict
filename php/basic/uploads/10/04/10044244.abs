Abstract: We investigate the stability of a new warped black string with nontrivial topologies in five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime. After studying the linear gravitational perturbation, we find that this black string is unstable when the Kaluza-Klein mass falls in a certain range and the instability exists for all topological spacetimes.
