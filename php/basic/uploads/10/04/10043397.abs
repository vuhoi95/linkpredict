Title: Uniqueness of the coordinate independent Spin(9)xSU(2) state of Matrix  Theory
Authors: Mariusz Hynek and Maciej Trzetrzelewski
Abstract: We explicitly prove, using some nontrivial identities involving gamma matrices, that there can be only one Spin(9)xSU(2) invariant state which depends only on fermionic variables.
