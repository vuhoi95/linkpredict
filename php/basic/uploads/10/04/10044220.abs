Title: Quantum Gravity, Dynamical Energy-Momentum Space and Vacuum Energy
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Djordje Minic and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We argue that the combination of the principles of quantum theory and general relativity allow for a dynamical energy-momentum space. We discuss the freezing of vacuum energy in such a dynamical energy-momentum space and present a phenomenologically viable seesaw formula for the cosmological constant in this context.
