Title: One-loop matching factors for staggered bilinear operators with improved  gauge actions
Authors: Jongjeong Kim and Weonjong Lee and Stephen R. Sharpe
Abstract: We present results for one-loop perturbative matching factors using bilinear operators composed of improved staggered fermions, using unimproved (Wilson) and improved (Symanzik, Iwasaki, and DBW2) gluon actions. We consider two fermions actions---HYP/$\bar{\text{Fat7}}$-smeared and "asqtad". The former is being used in calculations of electroweak matrix elements, while the latter have been used extensively by the MILC collaboration. We observe that using the improved gluon action leads to small reductions in the perturbative corrections, but that these reductions are smaller than those obtained when moving from the tadpole-improved naive staggered action to either HYP-smeared or asqtad action.
