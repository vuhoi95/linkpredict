Title: Branes and fluxes in special holonomy manifolds and cascading field  theories
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and Shinji Hirano and Peter Ouyang
Abstract: We conduct a study of holographic RG flows whose UV is a theory in 2+1 dimensions decoupled from gravity, and the IR is the N=6,8 superconformal fixed point of ABJM. The solutions we consider are constructed by warping the M-theory background whose eight spatial dimensions are manifolds of special holonomies sp(1) times sp(1) and spin(7). Our main example for the spin(7) holonomy manifold is the A8 geometry originally constructed by Cvetic, Gibbons, Lu, and Pope. On the gravity side, our constructions generalize the earlier construction of RG flow where the UV was N=3 Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons matter system and are simpler in a number of ways. Through careful consideration of Page, Maxwell, and brane charges, we identify the discrete and continuous parameters characterizing each system. We then determine the range of the discrete data, corresponding to the flux/rank for which the supersymmetry is unbroken, and estimate the dynamical supersymmetry breaking scale as a function of these data. We then point out the similarity between the physics of supersymmetry breaking between our system and the system considered by Maldacena and Nastase. We also describe the condition for unbroken supersymmetry on class of construction based on a different class of spin(7) manifolds known as B8 spaces whose IR is different from that of ABJM and exhibit some interesting features.
