Title: Brane f(R) gravity cosmologies
Authors: Adam Balcerzak and Mariusz P. Dabrowski
Abstract: By the application of the generalized Israel junction conditions we derive cosmological equations for the fourth-order $f(R)$ brane gravity and study their cosmological solutions. We show that there exists a non-static solution which describes a four-dimensional de-Sitter $(dS_4)$ brane embedded in a five-dimensional anti-de-Sitter $(AdS_5)$ bulk for a vanishing Weyl tensor contribution. On the other hand, for the case of a non-vanishing Weyl tensor contribution, there exists a static brane only. We claim that in order to get some more general non-static $f(R)$ brane configurations, one needs to admit a dynamical matter energy-momentum tensor in the bulk rather than just a bulk cosmological constant.
