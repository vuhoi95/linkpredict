Title: Species and Strings
Authors: Gia Dvali and Cesar Gomez
Abstract: Based on well-known properties of semi-classical black holes, we show that weakly-coupled string theory can be viewed as a theory of N = 1/g_s^2 particle species. This statement is a string theoretic realization of the fact that the fundamental scale in any consistent D-dimensional theory of gravity is not the Planck length l_D, but rather the species scale L_N = N^1/(D-2) l_D. Using this fact, we derive the bound on semi-classical black hole entropy in any consistent theory of gravity as S > N, which when applied to string theory provides additional evidence for the former relation. This counting also shows that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be viewed as the entanglement entropy, without encountering any puzzle of species. We demonstrate that the counting of species extends to the M-theory limit. The role of the species scale is now played by the eleven-dimensional Planck length, beyond which resolution of distances is gravitationally-impossible. The conclusion is, that string theory is a theory of species and gets replaced by a pure gravitational theory in the limit when species become strongly coupled and decouple.
