Title: Bouncing Universe and phantom crossing in Modified Gravity and its  reconstruction
Authors: H. Farajollahi and F. Milani
Abstract: In this paper we consider FRW cosmology in modified gravity which contain arbitrary functions $f(\phi)$. It is shown that the bouncing solution appears in the model whereas the equation of state (EoS) parameter crosses the phantom divider. The reconstruction of the model is also investigated with the aim to reconstruct the arbitrary functions and variables of the model.
