Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole
Authors: Yong-Qiang Wang and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: We investigate the hidden conformal symmetry of the 4-dimensional non-extremal Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole with the idea of the near-region Kerr/CFT correspondence proposed by Castro, Maloney and Strominger in arXiv:1004.0996[hep-th]. The near-region KN black hole is dual to a 2D CFT with left and right temperatures $T_L=(2 M^2-Q^2)/(4\pi J)$ and $T_R=\sqrt{M^4-J^2-M^2Q^2}/(2\pi J)$. Furthermore, we reproduce the microscopic entropy of the KN black hole via the Cardy formula, which is in agreement with the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and precisely match the absorption cross section of a near-region scalar field in the KN black hole with the finite-temperature absorption cross section for a 2D CFT.
