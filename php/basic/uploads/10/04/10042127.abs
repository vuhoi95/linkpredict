Title: Gauge Theories on Deformed Spaces
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Erwin Kronberger and Rene I. P. Sedmik and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: The aim of this review is to present an overview over available models and approaches to non-commutative gauge theory. Our main focus thereby is on gauge models formulated on flat Groenewold-Moyal spaces and renormalizability, but we will also review other deformations and try to point out common features. This review will by no means be complete and cover all approaches, it rather reflects a highly biased selection.
