Title: Generalized BRST transformation in Abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor  field theory
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We generalize the BRST transformations in Abelian rank-2 tensor field theory by allowing the parameter to be finite and field dependent and show that such transformations play crucial role in studying the Abelian 2-form gauge theory in noncovariant gauges. The generating functionals in different effective theories are connected through these generalized BRST transformations with different choice of finite parameter. We further consider the generalization of the anti-BRST transformations and show that even anti-BRST transformations with the finite field dependent parameter relate the generating functional for different effective theories. Such generalized BRST/anti-BRST transformations are useful in connecting generating functionals corresponding to different effective theories. Field/antifield formulation of this Abelian 2-form gauge theory is also studied in the context of generalized BRST transormations. We show that generalized BRST transformation connects the generating functional corresponding to the different solutions of quantum master equation in field/antifield formulation.
