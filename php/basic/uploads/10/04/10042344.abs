Title: Causality in 1+1 Dimensional Yukawa Model-II
Authors: Asrarul Haque and Satish D. Joglekar
Abstract: We discuss the limits g tending to large, M tending to large with g^3/M = const. of the 1 + 1 dimensional Yukawa model. We take into account conclusion of the results on bound states of the Yukawa Model in this limit (obtained in [7]). We find that model reduces to an effective nonlocal phi 3 theory in this limit. We observe causality violation in this limit. We discuss the result.
