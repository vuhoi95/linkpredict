Title: The quantization of the symplectic groupoid of the standard Podles  sphere
Authors: F. Bonechi and N. Ciccoli and N. Staffolani and M. Tarlini
Abstract: We give an explicit form of the symplectic groupoid that integrates the semiclassical standard Podles sphere. We show that Sheu's groupoid, whose convolution C*-algebra quantizes the sphere, appears as the groupoid of the Bohr-Sommerfeld leaves of a (singular) real polarization of the symplectic groupoid. By using a complex polarization we recover the convolution algebra on the space of polarized sections. We stress the role of the modular class in the definition of the scalar product in order to get the correct quantum space.
