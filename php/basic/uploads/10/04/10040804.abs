Title: Primordial Gravitational Waves and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
Authors: D. Baskaran and L. P. Grishchuk and W. Zhao
Abstract: This is a summary of presentations delivered at the OC1 parallel session "Primordial Gravitational Waves and the CMB" of the 12th Marcel Grossmann meeting in Paris, July 2009. The reports and discussions demonstrated significant progress that was achieved in theory and observations. It appears that the existing data provide some indications of the presence of gravitational wave contribution to the CMB anisotropies, while ongoing and planned observational efforts are likely to convert these indications into more confident statements about the actual detection.
