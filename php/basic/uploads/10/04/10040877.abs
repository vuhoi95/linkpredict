Title: A No-go Theorem Prohibiting Inflation in the Entropic Force Scenario
Authors: Miao Li and Yi Pang
Abstract: We show that to accommodate inflation in the entropic force scenario of Verlinde, it is necessary to introduce a negative temperature on a holographic screen, this will introduce several puzzles such as energy non-conservation. If one tries to modify the derivation of the Einstein equations to avoid a negative temperature, we prove that it is impossible to find a proper new definition of temperature to derive the Einstein equations.
