Title: Lifshitz Solutions of D=10 and D=11 supergravity
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We construct infinite families of Lifshitz solutions of D=10 and D=11 supergravity with dynamical exponent z=2. The new solutions are based on five- and seven-dimensional Einstein manifolds and are dual to theories in 1+2 and 1+1 spacetime dimensions, respectively. When the Einstein spaces are Sasaki-Einstein, the solutions are supersymmetric.
