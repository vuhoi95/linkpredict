Title: Properties of Schroedinger Black Holes from AdS Space
Authors: Bom Soo Kim and Daiske Yamada
Abstract: Properties of Schroedinger black holes are derived from AdS black holes expressed in light-cone coordinates with a particular normalization. The advantages of this method over the direct analysis of the Schroedinger geometry are the simplicity and the well-defined Brown-York procedure with the standard counterterms. The method is demonstrated for several physical interests, including the computation of the DC conductivity and the derivation of the R-charged black hole thermodynamic properties.
