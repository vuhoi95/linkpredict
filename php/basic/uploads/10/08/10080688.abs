Title: Inconsistences in Interacting Agegraphic Dark Energy Models
Authors: C. Y. Sun and Yu Song
Abstract: It is found that the origin agegraphic dark energy tracks the matter in the matter-dominated epoch and then the subsequent dark-energy-dominated epoch becomes impossible. It is argued that the difficulty can be removed when the interaction between the agegraphic dark energy and dark matter is considered. In the note, by discussing three different interacting models, we find that the difficulty still stands even in the interacting models. Furthermore, we find that in the interacting models, there exists the other serious inconsistence that the existence of the radiation/matter-dominated epoch contradicts the ability of agegraphic dark energy in driving the accelerated expansion. The contradiction can be avoided in one of the three models if some constraints on the parameters hold.
