Title: Higher charges and regularized quantum trace identities in su(1,1)  Landau-Lifshitz model
Authors: A. Melikyan and A. Pinzul and G. Weber
Abstract: We solve the operator ordering problem for the quantum continuous integrable su(1,1) Landau-Lifshitz model, and give a prescription to obtain the quantum trace identities, and the spectrum for the higher-order local charges. We also show that this method, based on operator regularization and renormalization, which guarantees quantum integrability, as well as the construction of self-adjoint extensions, can be used as an alternative to the discretization procedure, and unlike the latter, is based only on integrable representations.
