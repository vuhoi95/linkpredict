Title: Chiral correlators of the Ising conformal field theory
Authors: Eddy Ardonne and German Sierra
Abstract: We derive explicit expressions for the conformal blocks of the Ising conformal field theory, for the correlators of an arbitrary number of primary fields. These results are obtained from the bosonized description of the Ising model. Interestingly, correlators involving Majorana fermions, can be obtained in two different ways, giving rise to identities between the `bosonic' and `fermionic' description of these correlators. These identities are generalizations of the famous Cauchy-identity. The conformal blocks of the Ising model are used to derive expression for the conformal blocks of the su(2)_2 WZW conformal field theory.
