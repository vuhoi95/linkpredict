Title: Closed Superstrings in a Uniform Magnetic Field and Regularization  Criterion
Authors: Akira Kokado and Gaku Konisi and Takesi Saito
Abstract: We summarize exact solutions of closed superstrings in a constant magnetic field, from a view point of the regularization criterion. Some models will be excluded according to this criterion. The spectrum-generating algebra is also constructed in these interacting models.
