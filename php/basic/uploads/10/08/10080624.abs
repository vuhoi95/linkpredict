Abstract: In the framework of three-dimensional Born-Infeld Electrodynamics, we pursue an investigation of the consequences of the space-time dimensionality on the existence of magnetostatic fields generated by electric charges at rest in an inertial frame, which are present in its four-dimensional version. Our analysis reveals interesting features of the model. In fact, a magnetostatic field associated with an electric charge at rest does not appear in this case. Interestingly, the addition of the topological term (Chern-Simons) to Born-Infeld Electrodynamics yields the appearance of the magnetostatic field. We also contemplate the fields associated to the would-be-magnetic monopole in three dimensions.
