Title: Exact g-function flows from the staircase model
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Roberto Tateo and Ruth Wilbourne
Abstract: Equations are found for exact g-functions corresponding to integrable bulk and boundary flows between successive unitary c<1 minimal conformal field theories in two dimensions, confirming and extending previous perturbative results. These equations are obtained via an embedding of the flows into a boundary version of Al. Zamolodchikov's staircase model.
