Title: Lower Dimensional Quantum Black Holes
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Greg Landsberg
Abstract: There are theoretical reasons to think that space-time is lower dimensional at very short distances. If this is the case, quantum black holes produced at the LHC or in cosmic rays scattering live in lower dimensions. We discuss production cross section and signatures for the corresponding quantum black holes at the LHC within several different models of low-dimensional space-time.
