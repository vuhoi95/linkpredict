Title: Charge Enhancement of Noncommutative Gravity
Authors: Mansour Haghighat and Allen Stern
Abstract: Noncommutative corrections to the metric tensor can be significantly enhanced by the presence of electromagnetic fields. Neutron stars, with their large magnetic fields, are possible candidates to search for such effects. We use precision measurements of the gravitational redshift from pulsars to put bounds on the parameters of noncommutative gravity.
