Title: On semiclassical computation of 3-point functions of closed string  vertex operators in AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: R. Roiban and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider the leading large string tension correction to correlation functions of three vertex operators of particular massive string states in AdS_5 x S^5 string theory. We assume that two of these states are "heavy" carrying large spins (of order string tension) and thus can be treated semiclassically while the third state is "light" having fixed quantum numbers. We study several examples. In the case when the "heavy" states are described by a folded string with large spin in AdS_5 the 3-point function scales as a semiclassical spin parameter of the "heavy" state in power of the string level of the "light" massive string state. We observe similar behavior in the case of "heavy" states which admit a small angular momentum limit which may thus represent correlators of three quantum massive string states.
