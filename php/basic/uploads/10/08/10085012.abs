Title: D-branes Wrapped on Fuzzy del Pezzo Surfaces
Authors: Kazuyuki Furuuchi and Kazumi Okuyama
Abstract: We construct classical solutions in quiver gauge theories on D0-branes probing toric del Pezzo singularities in Calabi-Yau manifolds. Our solutions represent D4-branes wrapped around fuzzy del Pezzo surfaces. We study the fluctuation spectrum around the fuzzy CP^2 solution in detail. We also comment on possible applications of our fuzzy del Pezzo surfaces to the fuzzy version of F-theory, dubbed F(uzz) theory.
