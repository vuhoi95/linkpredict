Title: Short-distance regularity of Green's function and UV divergences in  entanglement entropy
Authors: Dmitry Nesterov and Sergey N. Solodukhin
Abstract: Reformulating our recent result (arXiv:1007.1246 [hep-th]) in coordinate space we point out that no matter how regular is short-distance behavior of Green's function the entanglement entropy in the corresponding quantum field theory is always UV divergent. In particular, we discuss a recent example by Padmanabhan (arXiv:1007.5066 [gr-qc]) of a regular Green's function and show that provided this function arises in a field theory the entanglement entropy in this theory is UV divergent and calculate the leading divergent term.
