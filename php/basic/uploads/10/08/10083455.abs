Title: Constraining the interacting dark energy models from weak gravity  conjecture and recent observations
Authors: Ximing Chen and Bin Wang and Nana Pan and Yungui Gong
Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of the weak gravity conjecture in constraining the dark energy by comparing with observations. For general dark energy models with plausible phenomenological interactions between dark sectors, we find that although the weak gravity conjecture can constrain the dark energy, the constraint is looser than that from the observations.
