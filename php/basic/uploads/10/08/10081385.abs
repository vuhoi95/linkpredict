Title: Master Equations for Gravitational Perturbations of Static Lovelock  Black Holes in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Tomohiro Takahashi and Jiro Soda
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the master equations for gravitational perturbations of vector and scalar type for static vacuum Lovelock black holes. Together with our previous work on the tensor type perturbation, we now provide the full set of master equations that governs all types of gravitational perturbations of static vacuum Lovelock black holes in any dimensions.
