Title: Delta-like singularity in the Reduction of the Laplace Equation for  Spherical Coordinates and the Validity of Radial Schrodinger Equation
Authors: Anzor A. Khelashvili and Teimuraz P. Nadareishvili
Abstract: By careful exploration of separation of variables into the Laplacian in spherical coordinates, we obtain the extra delta-like singularity, elimination of which restricts the radial wave function at the origin. This constraint has the form of boundary condition for the radial Schrodinger equation.
