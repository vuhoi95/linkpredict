Title: $f(T)$ models with phantom divide line crossing
Authors: Puxun Wu and Hongwei Yu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new models in $f(T)$ gravity to realize the crossing of the phantom divide line for the effective equation of state, and we then study the observational constraints on the model parameters. The best fit results suggest that the observations favor a crossing of the phantom divide line.
