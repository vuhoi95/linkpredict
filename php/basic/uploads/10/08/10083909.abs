Title: High spin limits and non-abelian T-duality
Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos and Konstadinos Sfetsos
Abstract: The action of the non-abelian T-dual of the WZW model is related to an appropriate gauged WZW action via a limiting procedure. We extend this type of equivalence to general sigma-models with non-abelian isometries and their non-abelian T-duals, focusing on Principal Chiral models. We reinforce and refine this equivalence by arguing that the non-abelian T-duals are the effective backgrounds describing states of an appropriate parent theory corresponding to divergently large highest weight representations. The proof involves carrying out a subtle limiting procedure in the group representations and relating them to appropriate limits in the corresponding backgrounds. We illustrate the general method by providing several non-trivial examples.
