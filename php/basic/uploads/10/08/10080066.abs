Title: General Solutions of Braneworlds under the Schwarzschild Ansatz
Authors: Keiichi Akama and Takashi Hattori and Hisamitsu Mukaida
Abstract: General solutions for braneworld dynamics coupled with the bulk Einstein equation are derived under the Schwarzschild ansatz. They relate the brane metric to the exterior configurations, and establish fine tuning conditions for the braneworlds to reproduce successes of the Einstein gravity.
