Title: Electronic Properties and Hidden Symmetries of Graphene
Authors: L. B Drissi and E. H Saidi and M. Bousmina
Abstract: Using the relation between the structural and the electronic properties of honeycomb, we study the hidden SU(3) symmetry of the graphene monolayer and exhibit the link with its electronic properties. We show that the conservation law of incoming and outgoing electronic momenta at each site of graphene is solved in terms of SU(3) representations; and the Fourier waves {\phi}(k_{x},k_{y}) of the hopping electron may be classified by SU(3) highest weight multiplets {\phi}_{p,q}({\xi}). It is also shown that the phases arctan((k_{y})/(k_{x})) of the waves are quantized as (((p+q))/((p-q)))sqrt(3) with p, q positive integers. Other features are also discussed.
