Title: A worldsheet perspective on string inflation
Authors: Koenraad Schalm and Ted van der Aalst
Abstract: We investigate the constraints of slow-roll inflation on the string worldsheet. A general gravity-matter set-up is used in which the worldsheet consists of an abstract CFT coupled to a 3+1 dimensional non-linear sigma model. The empirical slow-roll parameters are expressed in terms of the beta functions of operators in the matter/internal CFT and the beta function of the dilaton. The result confirms that inflation is only sensitive to macroscopic properties of the matter sector, and that in string theory inflation is a non-perturbative (in g_s) phenomenon and one must go beyond tree-level string theory.
