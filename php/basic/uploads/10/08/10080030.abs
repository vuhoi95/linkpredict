Title: Wall-crossing from supersymmetric galaxies
Authors: Evgeny Andriyash and Frederik Denef and Daniel L. Jafferis and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: We give an elementary physical derivation of the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing formula, valid for any theory with a 4d N=2 supergravity description. Our argument leads to a slight generalization of the formula, which relates monodromy to the BPS spectrum.
