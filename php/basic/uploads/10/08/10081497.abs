Title: Lorentz violation in the linearized gravity
Authors: A. F. Ferrari and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We study some consequences of the introduction of a Lorentz-violating modification term in the linearized gravity, which leads to modified dispersion relations for gravitational waves in the vacuum. We also discuss possible mechanisms for the induction of such a term in the Lagrangian.
