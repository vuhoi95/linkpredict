Title: Diagrammatic Exponentiation for Products of Wilson Lines
Authors: Alexander Mitov and George Sterman and Ilmo Sung
Abstract: We provide a recursive diagrammatic prescription for the exponentiation of gauge theory amplitudes involving products of Wilson lines and loops. This construction generalizes the concept of webs, originally developed for eikonal form factors and cross sections with two eikonal lines, to general soft functions in QCD and related gauge theories. Our coordinate space arguments apply to arbitrary paths for the lines.
