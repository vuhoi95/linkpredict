Title: Black stars induced by matter on a brane: exact solutions
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and M. A. Kurkov
Abstract: New exact asymptotically flat solutions of five-dimensional Einstein equations with horizon are found to describe multidimensional black stars generated by matter on the brane, conceivably on high energy colliders. The five-dimensional space-time is realized as an orbifold against reflection of a special extra-space coordinate and matter on the brane is induced by tailoring of the five-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole metric.
