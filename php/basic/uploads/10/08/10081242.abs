Abstract: Poincare invariant quantum field theories can be formulated on non-commutative planes if the statistics of fields is twisted. This is equivalent to state that the coproduct on the Poincare group is suitably twisted. In the present work we present a twisted Poincare invariant quantum field theory at finite temperature. For that we use the formalism of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD). This TFD formalism is extend to incorporate interacting fields. This is a non trivial step, since the separation in positive and negative frequency terms is no longer valid in TFD. In particular, we prove the validity of Wick's theorem for twisted scalar quantum field at finite temperature.
