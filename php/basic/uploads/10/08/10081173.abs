Title: Spontaneous breaking of superconformal invariance in (2+1)D  supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theories in the large N limit
Authors: A. C. Lehum and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: In this work it is studied the spontaneous breaking of superconformal and gauge invariances in the Abelian N=1,2 three-dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theories in a large N limit. It is computed the K\"ahlerian effective superpotential at subleading order and shown that the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism is the responsible for the dynamical generation of a mass scale in the N=1 model. This effect appears due to two-loop diagrams that are logarithmic divergent. In particular, the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism fails when we lift the N=1 to N=2 Supersymmetric Chern-Simons-Matter model, like what happens in a perturbative expansion in the coupling constants.
