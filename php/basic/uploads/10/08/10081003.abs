Title: The Nakayama automorphism of the almost Calabi-Yau algebras associated  to SU(3) modular invariants
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: We determine the Nakayama automorphism of the almost Calabi-Yau algebra A associated to the braided subfactors or nimrep graphs associated to each SU(3) modular invariant. We use this to determine a resolution of A as an A-A bimodule, which will yield a projective resolution of A.
