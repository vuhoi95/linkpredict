Title: Domain Wall solutions to Horava gravity
Authors: Carlos R. Argüelles and Nicolás E. Grandi
Abstract: We investigated purely gravitational domain wall solutions to Horava nonrelativistic theory of gravity with detailed balance in 3 + 1 dimensions. We find that for arbitrary values of the running parameter {\lambda} > 1/3 two branches of membrane solutions exist. For positive values of the cosmo-logical constant, the solution represents a space that is bounded in the transverse direction, with singularities sitting at each of the boundaries. For negative values of the cosmological constant, the solution contains a single membrane sitting at the center of a space, which extends infinitely in the transverse direction approaching a Lifshitz metric. In that case there is one additional degenerate branch, for which the lapse function is undetermined.
