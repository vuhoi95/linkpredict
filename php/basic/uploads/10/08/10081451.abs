Title: A New Perspective on Path Integral Quantum Mechanics in Curved  Space-Time
Authors: Dinesh Singh and Nader Mobed
Abstract: A fundamentally different approach to path integral quantum mechanics in curved space-time is presented, as compared to the standard approaches currently available in the literature. Within the context of scalar particle propagation in a locally curved background, such as described by Fermi or Riemann normal co-ordinates, this approach requires use of a constructed operator to rotate the initial, intermediate, and final position ket vectors onto their respective local tangent spaces, defined at each local time step along some arbitrary classical reference worldline. Local time translation is described using a quantum mechanical representation of Lie transport, that while strictly non-unitary in operator form, nevertheless correctly recovers the free-particle Lagrangian in curved space-time, along with new contributions. This propagator yields the prediction that all probability violating terms due to curvature contribute to a quantum violation of the weak equivalence principle, while the remaining terms that conserve probability also correspondingly satisfy the weak equivalence principle, at least to leading-order in the particle's Compton wavelength. Furthermore, this propagator possesses an overall curvature-dependent and gauge-invariant phase factor that can be interpreted as the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect and Berry's phase.
