Title: High-energy asymptotics of D-brane decay amplitudes from Coulomb gas  electrostatics
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matti Jarvinen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri
Abstract: We study the high-energy limit of tree-level string production amplitudes from decaying D-branes in bosonic string theory, interpreting the vertex operators as external charges interacting with a Coulomb gas corresponding to the rolling tachyon background, and performing an electrostatic analysis. In particular, we consider two open string - one closed string amplitudes and four open string amplitudes, and calculate explicit formulas for the leading exponential behavior.
