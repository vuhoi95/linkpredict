Title: Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Dyons
Authors: Kok-Geng Lim and Rosy Teh and Khai-Ming Wong
Abstract: Monopole-antimonopole pair (MAP) with both electric and magnetic charges are presented. The MAP possess opposite magnetic charges but they carry the same electric charges. These stationary MAP dyon solutions possess finite energy but they do not satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations and are not BPS solutions. They are axially symmetric solutions and are characterized by a parameter, $-1\leq\eta\leq 1$ which determines the net electric charges of these MAP dyons. These dyon solutions are solved numerically when the magnetic charges of the dipoles are $n=\pm 1, \pm 2$ and when the strength of the Higgs field potential $\lambda=0, 1$. When $\lambda=0$, the time component of the gauge field potential is parallel to the Higgs field in isospin space and the MAP separation distance, total energy and net electric charge increase exponentially fast to infinity when $\eta$ approaches $\pm 1$. However when $\lambda=1$, all these three quantities approach a finite critical value as $\eta$ approaches $\pm 1$.
