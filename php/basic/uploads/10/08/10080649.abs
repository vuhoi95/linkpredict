Title: On the fermionic T-duality of the AdS_4 \times CP^3 sigma-model
Authors: Ido Adam and Amit Dekel and Yaron Oz
Abstract: In this note we consider a fermionic T-duality of the coset realization of the type IIA sigma-model on AdS_4 \times CP^3 with respect to the three flat directions in AdS_4, six of the fermionic coordinates and three of the CP^3 directions. We show that the Buscher procedure fails as it leads to a singular transformation and discuss the result and its implications.
