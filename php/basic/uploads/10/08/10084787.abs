Title: Comment on Asymptotically Safe Inflation
Authors: S. -H. Henry Tye and Jiajun Xu
Abstract: We comment on Weinberg's interesting analysis of asymptotically safe inflation (arXiv:0911.3165). We find that even if the gravity theory exhibits an ultraviolet fixed point, the energy scale during inflation is way too low to drive the theory close to the fixed point value. We choose the specific renormalization groupflow away from the fixed point towards the infrared region that reproduces the Newton's constant and today's cosmological constant. We follow this RG flow path to scales below the Planck scale to study the stability of the inflationary scenario. Again, we find that some fine tuning is necessary to get enough efolds of infflation in the asymptotically safe inflationary scenario.
