Title: Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis in Effective Supergravity
Authors: Bhaskar Dutta and Kuver Sinha
Abstract: We investigate the viability of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis in D=4, N=1 supergravity descending from string theory. The process relies on an initial condition where visible sector supersymmetric flat directions obtain tachyonic masses during inflation. We discuss this condition for a variety of cases where supersymmetry is broken during inflation by a geometric modulus or hidden sector scalar, and outline scenarios where the initial condition is satisfied.
