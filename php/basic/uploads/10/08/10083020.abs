Authors: Xiang-hua Zhai and Xin-zhou Li and Chao-Jun Feng
Abstract: The Casimir effect for a massless scalar field on the helix boundary condition which is named as quantum spring is studied in our recent paper\cite{Feng}. In this paper, the Casimir effect of the quantum spring is investigated in $(D+1)$-dimensional spacetime for the massless and massive scalar fields by using the zeta function techniques. We obtain the exact results of the Casimir energy and Casimir force for any $D$, which indicate a $Z_2$ symmetry of the two space dimensions. The Casimir energy and Casimir force have different expressions for odd and even dimensional space in the massless case but in both cases the force is attractive. In the case of odd-dimensional space, the Casimir energy density can be expressed by the Bernoulli numbers, while in the even case it can be expressed by the $\zeta$-function. And we also show that the Casimir force has a maximum value which depends on the spacetime dimensions. In particular, for a massive scalar field, we found that the Casimir force varies as the mass of the field changes.
