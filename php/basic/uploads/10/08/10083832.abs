Title: Coupling Brane Fields to Bulk Supergravity
Authors: Susha L. Parameswaran and Jonas Schmidt
Abstract: In this note we present a simple, general prescription for coupling brane localized fields to bulk supergravity. We illustrate the procedure by considering 6D N=2 bulk supergravity on a 2D orbifold, with brane fields localized at the fixed points. The resulting action enjoys the full 6D N=2 symmetries in the bulk, and those of 4D N=1 supergravity at the brane positions.
