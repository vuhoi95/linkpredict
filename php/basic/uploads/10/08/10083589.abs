Title: Cosmological Perturbations in the "Healthy Extension'' of  Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Alessandro Cerioni and Robert H. Brandenberger
Abstract: We study linear cosmological perturbations in the ``healthy extension'' of Horava-Lifshitz gravity which has recently been analyzed \cite{BPS2}. We find that there are two degrees of freedom for scalar metric fluctuations, but that one of them decouples in the infrared limit. Also, for appropriate choices of the parameters defining the Lagrangian, the extra mode can be made well-behaved even in the ultraviolet.
