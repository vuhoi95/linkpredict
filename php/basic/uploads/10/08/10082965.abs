Title: Simple loop integrals and amplitudes in N=4 SYM
Authors: J. M. Drummond and J. M. Henn
Abstract: We use momentum twistors to evaluate planar loop integrals. Infrared divergences are regulated by the recently proposed AdS-inspired mass regulator. We show that two-loop amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills can be expanded in terms of basis integrals having twistor numerators. We argue that these integrals are considerably simpler compared to the ones conventionally used. Our case in point is the two-loop six-point MHV amplitude. We present analytical results for the remainder function in a kinematical limit, and find agreement with a recent Wilson loop computation. We also provide two-loop evidence that the logarithm of MHV amplitudes can be written in terms of simple twistor space integrals.
