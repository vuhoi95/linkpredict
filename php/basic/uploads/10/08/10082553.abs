Title: New Massive Gravity Domain Walls
Authors: U. Camara dS and G. M. Sotkov
Abstract: The properties of the asymptotic $AdS_3$ space-times representing flat domain walls (DW's) solutions of the New Massive 3D Gravity with scalar matter are studied. Our analysis is based on $I^{st}$ order BPS-like equations involving an appropriate superpotential. The Brown-York boundary stress-tensor is used for the calculation of DW's tensions as well as of the $CFT_2$'s central charges. The holographic renormalization group flows and the phase transitions in specific deformed $CFT_2$ dual to 3D massive gravity model with quadratic superpotential are discussed.
