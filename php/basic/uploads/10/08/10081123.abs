Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of Rotating Black Holes in Minimal  Five-Dimensional Gauged Supergravity
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: In the present paper we show that for a low frequency limit the wave equation of massless scalar field in the background of non-extremal charged rotating black holes in five-dimensional minimal gauged and ungauged supergravity can be written as the Casimir of an $SL(2,R)$ symmetry, our result show that the entropy of the black hole is reproduced by the Cardy formula, also the absorption cross section is in consistence with the finite temperature absorption cross section for a 2D CFT.
