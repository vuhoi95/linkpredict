Authors: Pu-Jian Mao and Ran Li and Lin-Yu Jia and Ji-Rong Ren
Abstract: It has been recently pointed out that, under certain conditions, the energy of particles accelerated by black holes in the center-of-mass frame can become arbitrarily high. In this Letter, we study the collision of two particles around the four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory. We find that the center-of-mass energy for a pair of colliding particles is unlimited at the horizon of charged nonrotating and extremal rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole.
