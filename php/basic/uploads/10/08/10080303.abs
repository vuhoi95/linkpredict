Title: The General Type N Solution of New Massive Gravity
Authors: Haji Ahmedov and Alikram N. Aliev
Abstract: We find the most general algebraic type N solution with non-vanishing scalar curvature, which comprises all type N solutions of new massive gravity in three dimensions. We also give the special forms of this solution, which correspond to certain critical values of the topological mass. Finally, we show that at the special limit, the null Killing isometry of the spacetime is restored and the solution describes AdS pp-waves.
