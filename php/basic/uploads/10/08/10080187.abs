Title: The Cosmological Constant as a Function of Extrinsic Curvature and  Spatial Curvature
Authors: Jin-Zhang Tang and Qiang Xu
Abstract: In this paper we suppose that the cosmological constant will change when the universe expends. For a general consideration, the cosmological constant is assumed to be a function of scale factor and Hubble constant. According to the ADM formulation, to the FRW metric, the extrinsic curvature $I$ equals $-6H^{2}$ and spatial curvature $R$ equals $6k/a^{2}$. Therefore we suppose cosmological constant is a function of extrinsic curvature and spatial curvature. We investigate the cosmological evolution of FRW universe in these models. At last we investigate two particular models which could fit the observation data about dark energy well. Actually a changeless cosmological constant is not essential. If when the universe expands, the cosmological constant changes slowly and gradually flows to a constant, the observation data about dark energy could also be fitted well by this kind of theory.
