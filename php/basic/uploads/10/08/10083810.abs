Title: Form factor expansion for thermal correlators
Authors: B. Pozsgay and G. Takacs
Abstract: We consider finite temperature correlation functions in massive integrable Quantum Field Theory. Using a regularization by putting the system in finite volume, we develop a novel approach (based on multi-dimensional residues) to the form factor expansion for thermal correlators. The first few terms are obtained explicitly in theories with diagonal scattering. We also discuss the validity of the LeClair-Mussardo proposal.
