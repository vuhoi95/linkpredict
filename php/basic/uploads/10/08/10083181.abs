Title: Path Integral Quantization of Generalized Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Rodrigo Bufalo and Bruto Max Pimentel and German Enrique Ramos Zambrano
Abstract: In this paper, a complete covariant quantization of generalized electrodynamics is shown through the path integral approach. To this goal, we first studied the hamiltonian structure of system following Dirac's methodology and, then, we followed the Faddeev-Senjanovic procedure to obtain the transition amplitude. The complete propagators (Schwinger-Dyson-Fradkin equations) of the correct gauge fixation and the generalized Ward-Fradkin-Takahashi identities are also obtained. Afterwards, an explicit calculation of one-loop approximation of all Green's functions and a discussion about the obtained results are presented.
