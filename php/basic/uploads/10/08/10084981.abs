Title: A Note on Nahm's Conjecture in Rank 2 Case
Authors: An Huang and Chul-hee Lee
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to get a complete list of positive definite symmetric matrices with integer entries $\a&b\b&d\$ such that all complex solutions to the system of equations $1-x_1=x_1^ax_2^b\ 1-x_2=x_1^bx_2^d$ are real. This result is related to Nahm's conjecture in rank 2 case.
