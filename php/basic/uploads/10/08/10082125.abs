Title: Step-like discontinuities in Bose-Einstein condensates and Hawking  radiation: dispersion effects
Authors: Carlos Mayoral and Alessandro Fabbri and Massimiliano Rinaldi
Abstract: In this paper we extend the hydrodynamic results of [1] and study, analytically, the propagation of Bogoliubov phonons on top of Bose-Einstein condensates with step-like discontinuities by taking into account dispersion effects. We focus on the Hawking signal in the density-density correlations in the formation of acoustic black hole-like configurations.
