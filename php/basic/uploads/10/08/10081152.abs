Title: Non-Gaussianity with Lagrange Multiplier Field in the Curvaton Scenario
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xin-Zhou Li
Abstract: In this paper, we will use $\delta \mathcal{N}$-formalism to calculate the primordial curvature perturbation for the curvaton model with a Lagrange multiplier field. We calculate the non-linearity parameters $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$ in the sudden-decay approximation in this kind of model, and we find that one could get a large non-Gaussinity even if the curvaton dominates the total energy density before it decays, and this property will make the curvaton model much richer. We also calculate the probability density function of the primordial curvature perturbation in the sudden-decay approximation, as well as some moments of it.
