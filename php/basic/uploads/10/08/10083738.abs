Authors: Yuan-Harng Lee and Jon Links and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We obtain the exact solutions for a family of spin-boson systems. This is achieved through application of the representation theory for polynomial deformations of the $su(2)$ Lie algebra. We demonstrate that the family of Hamiltonians includes, as special cases, known physical models which are the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, the molecular asymmetric rigid rotor, the Tavis-Cummings model, and a two-mode generalisation of the Tavis-Cummings model.
