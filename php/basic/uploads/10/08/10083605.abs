Title: Relativistic Collective Coordinate System of Solitons and Spinning  Skyrmion
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Toru Kikuchi
Abstract: We consider constructing the relativistic system of collective coordinates of a field theory soliton on the basis of a simple principle: The collective coordinates must be introduced into the static solution in such a way that the equation of motion of the collective coordinates ensures that of the original field theory. As an illustration, we apply this principle to the quantization of spinning motion of the Skyrmion by incorporating the leading relativistic correction to the rigid body approximation. We calculate the decay constant and various static properties of nucleons, and find that the relativistic corrections are in the range of 5% -- 20%. We also examine how the baryons deform due to the spinning motion.
