Title: Test bodies and naked singularities: is the self-force the cosmic  censor?
Authors: Enrico Barausse and Vitor Cardoso and Gaurav Khanna
Abstract: Jacobson and Sotiriou showed that rotating black holes could be spun-up past the extremal limit by the capture of non-spinning test bodies, if one neglects radiative and self-force effects. This would represent a violation of the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat spacetimes. We show that for some of the trajectories giving rise to naked singularities, radiative effects can be neglected. However, for these orbits the conservative self-force is important, and seems to have the right sign to prevent the formation of naked singularities.
