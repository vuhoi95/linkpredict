Title: Space-time and special relativity from causal networks
Authors: Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano and Alessandro Tosini
Abstract: We show how the Minkowskian space-time emerges from a topologically homogeneous causal network, presenting a simple analytical derivation of the Lorentz transformations, with metric as pure event-counting. The derivation holds generally for d=1 space dimension, however, it can be extended to d>1 for special causal networks.
