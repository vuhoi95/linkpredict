Title: Note on New KLT relations
Authors: Bo Feng and Song He and Rijun Huang and Yin Jia
Abstract: In this short note, we present two results about KLT relations discussed in recent several papers. Our first result is the re-derivation of Mason-Skinner MHV amplitude by applying the S_{n-3} permutation symmetric KLT relations directly to MHV amplitude. Our second result is the equivalence proof of the newly discovered S_{n-2} permutation symmetric KLT relations and the well-known S_{n-3} permutation symmetric KLT relations. Although both formulas have been shown to be correct by BCFW recursion relations, our result is the first direct check using the regularized definition of the new formula.
