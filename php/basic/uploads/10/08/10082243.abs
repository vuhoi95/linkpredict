Title: Slowly rotating black holes in the Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Hyung Won Lee and Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We investigate slowly rotating black holes in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. For $\Lambda_W=0$ and $\lambda=1$, we find a slowly rotating black hole of the Kehagias-Sfetsos solution in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We discuss their thermodynamic properties by computing mass, temperature, angular momentum, and angular velocity on the horizon.
