Title: Point Interaction in two and three dimensional Riemannian Manifolds
Authors: Fatih Erman and O. Teoman Turgut
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative renormalization of the bound state problem of n bosons interacting with finitely many Dirac delta interactions on two and three dimensional Riemannian manifolds using the heat kernel. We formulate the problem in terms of a new operator called the principal or characteristic operator. In order to investigate the problem in more detail, we then restrict the problem to one particle sector. The lower bound of the ground state energy is found for general class of manifolds, e.g., for compact and Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The estimate of the bound state energies in the tunneling regime is calculated by perturbation theory. Non-degeneracy and uniqueness of the ground state is proven by Perron-Frobenius theorem. Moreover, the pointwise bounds on the wave function is given and all these results are consistent with the one given in standard quantum mechanics. Renormalization procedure does not lead to any radical change in these cases. Finally, renormalization group equations are derived and the beta-function is exactly calculated. This work is a natural continuation of our previous work based on a novel approach to the renormalization of point interactions, developed by S. G. Rajeev.
