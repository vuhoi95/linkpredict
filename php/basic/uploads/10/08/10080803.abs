Title: spinney: A Form Library for Helicity Spinors
Authors: Gavin Cullen and Maciej Koch-Janusz and Thomas Reiter
Abstract: In this work, the library spinney is presented, which provides an implementation of helicity spinors and related algorithms for the symbolical manipulation program Form. The package is well suited for symbolic amplitude calculations both in traditional, Feynman diagram based approaches and unitarity-based techniques.
