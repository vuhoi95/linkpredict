Title: Semionic Supersymmetric Solitons
Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The Bogomolnyi vortex of the N=2 supersymmetric abelian-Higgs model in 2+1 dimensions is shown to be a ``semion'' of spin 1/4. Specifically, the effective superparticle action for one vortex is shown to describe, upon quantization, a parity self-dual centrally-charged `short' supermultiplet of ``relativistic helicities'' (-1/4,-1/4, 1/4,1/4).
