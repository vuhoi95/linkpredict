Title: On Dynamics of Brans--Dicke Theory of Gravitation
Authors: Hossein Farajollahi and Mehrdad Farhoudi and Hossein Shojaie
Abstract: We study longstanding problem of cosmological clock in the context of Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation. We present the Hamiltonian formulation of the theory for a class of spatially homogenous cosmological models. Then, we show that formulation of the Brans-Dicke theory in the Einstein frame allows how an identification of an appropriate cosmological time variable, as a function of the scalar field in the theory, can be emerged in quantum cosmology. The classical and quantum results are applied to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models.
