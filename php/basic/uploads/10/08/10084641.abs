Title: Gravitational Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: K. -I. Izawa and T. Kugo and T. T. Yanagida
Abstract: We consider supersymmetry breaking models with a purely constant superpotential in supergravity. The supersymmetry breaking is induced for the vanishing cosmological constant. As a hidden mediation sector of supersymmetry breaking, it naturally leads to a split spectrum in supersymmetric standard model. We also point out possible utility of our setup to construct nonlinear sigma model and/or Fayet-Iliopoulos-like term in broken supergravity.
