Title: Quasinormal Modes of Self-Dual Warped AdS$_3$ Black Hole in Topological  Massive Gravity
Authors: Ran Li and Ji-Rong Ren
Abstract: We consider the various perturbations of self-dual warped AdS$_3$ black hole and obtain the exact expressions of quasinormal modes by imposing the vanishing Dirichlet boundary condition at asymptotic infinity. It is expected that the quasinormal modes agree with the poles of retarded Green's functions of the dual CFT. Our results provide a quantitative test of the warped AdS/CFT correspondence.
