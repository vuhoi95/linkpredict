Title: Solutions of the Strominger System via Stable Bundles on Calabi-Yau  Threefolds
Authors: Bjorn Andreas and Mario Garcia-Fernandez
Abstract: We prove that a given Calabi-Yau threefold with a stable holomorphic vector bundle can be perturbed to a solution of the Strominger system provided that the second Chern class of the vector bundle is equal to the second Chern class of the tangent bundle. If the Calabi-Yau threefold has strict SU(3) holonomy then the equations of motion derived from the heterotic string effective action are also satisfied by the solutions we obtain.
