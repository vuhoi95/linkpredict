Title: Any quantum state can be cloned in the presence of closed timelike  curves
Authors: D. Ahn and T. C. Ralph and R. B. Mann
Abstract: The possible existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) draws attention to fundamental questions about what is physically possible and what is not. An example is the "no cloning theorem" in quantum mechanics, which states that no physical means exists by which an unknown arbitrary quantum state can be reproduced or copied perfectly. Using the Deutsch approach, we show here that this theorem can be circumvented in the presence of closed timelike curves, allowing the cloning of an unknown arbitrary quantum state chosen from a finite alphabet of states. Since the "no cloning theorem" has played a central role in the development of quantum information science, it is clear that the existence of CTCs would radically change the rules for quantum information technology. Nevertheless we show that this type of cloning does not violate no-signalling criteria.
