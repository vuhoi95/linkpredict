Title: Massive Gravity: Resolving the Puzzles
Authors: Lasma Alberte and Ali H. Chamseddine and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: We consider the massless limit of Higgs gravity, where the graviton becomes massive when the scalar fields acquire expectation values. We determine the Vainshtein scale and prove that massive gravity smoothly goes to General Relativity below this scale. We find that the Vainshtein scale depends on the particular action of scalar fields used to give mass to the graviton.
