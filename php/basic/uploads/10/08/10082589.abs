Title: Hopf maps and Wigner's little groups
Authors: Ruben Mkrtchyan and Armen Nersessian and Vahagn Yeghikyan
Abstract: We present the explicit formulae relating Hopf maps with Wigner's little groups. They, particularly, explain simple action of group on a fiber for the first and second Hopf fibrations, and present most simplified form for the third one. Corresponding invariant Lagrangians are presented, and their possible reductions are discussed.
