Authors: Molin Liu and Benhai Yu and Rumin Wang and Lixin Xu
Abstract: We study the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves propagating in spherically symmetric spacetimes with dynamical cosmological constant both in low-energy and high-energy zones. In the former low-energy regime, we solve analytically the Regge-Wheeler wave equation and obtain an analytic absorption probability expression which varies with $M\sqrt{\Lambda}$, where $M$ is the central mass and $\Lambda$ is cosmological constant. The low-energy absorption probability, which is in the range of $[0, 0.986701]$, increases monotonically with increase in $\Lambda$. In the latter high-energy regime, the scalar particles adopt their geometric optics limit value. The trajectory equation with effective potential emerges and the analytic high-energy greybody factor, which is relevant with the area of classically accessible regime, also increases monotonically with increase in $\Lambda$, as long $\Lambda$ is less than or of the order of $10^4$. In this high-energy case, the null cosmological constant result reduces to the Schwarzschild value $27\pi r_g^2/4$.
