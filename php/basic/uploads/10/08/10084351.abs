Title: Stability of the aether
Authors: William Donnelly and Ted Jacobson
Abstract: The requirements for stability of a Lorentz violating theory are analyzed. In particular we conclude that Einstein-aether theory can be stable when its modes have any phase velocity, rather than only the speed of light as was argued in a recent paper.
