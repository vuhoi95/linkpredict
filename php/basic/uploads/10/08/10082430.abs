Title: Conductivity at finite 't Hooft coupling from AdS/CFT
Authors: M. Ali-Akbari and K. Bitaghsir Fadafan
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study the DC conductivity of massive $\mathcal{N} = 2$ hypermultiplet fields in an $\mathcal{N} = 4\, SU(N_c)$ super-Yang-Mills theory plasma in the large $N_c$ and finite 't Hooft coupling. We also discuss general curvature-squared and Gauss-Bonnet corrections on the DC conductivity.
