Title: Three Approaches to Classical Thermal Field Theory
Authors: E. Gozzi and R. Penco
Abstract: In this paper we study three different functional approaches to classical thermal field theory, which turn out to be the classical counterparts of three well-known different formulations of quantum thermal field theory: the Closed-Time Path (CTP) formalism, the Thermofield Dynamics (TFD) and the Matsubara approach.
