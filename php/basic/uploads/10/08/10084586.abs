Title: Analytic explanation of the strong spin-dependent amplification in  Hawking radiation from rotating black holes
Authors: De-Chang Dai and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: Numerical studies of black hole greybody factors indicate that Hawking emission from a highly rotating black hole is strongly spin dependent, with particles of highest spin (gravitons) dominating the energy spectrum. So far, there has been no analytic explanation or description of this effect. Using "gravitomagnetism", or the formal analogy between the Maxwell's field equations for electro- magnetism and Einstein's equations for gravity, we were able to establish a link between the spin of the rotating black hole and spin of an emitted particle. Namely, the intrinsic spin of the particle creates a "mass dipole moment" which interacts with external gravitomagnetic field whose source is the rotation of the black hole. We showed that a rotating black hole prefers to shed its spin, i.e. tends to emit particles with the spin parallel to its own. We also showed that the probability for emission grows with the increasing spin of the emitted particles. The amplification factors can be huge if a black hole is highly rotating, i.e. close to extremal. When applied to central galactic black holes, the same physical mechanism indicate that particles orbiting around these black holes should have spins strongly correlated with the spin of the black hole, which may have implications for cosmic rays believed to be coming from these regions of space.
