Title: Thermodynamics of AdS/QCD within the 5D dilaton-gravity model
Authors: E. Megias and H. J. Pirner and K. Veschgini
Abstract: We calculate the pressure, entropy density, trace anomaly and speed of sound of the gluon plasma using the dilaton potential of Ref. arXiv:0911.0627[hep-ph] in the dilaton-gravity theory of AdS/QCD. The finite temperature observables are calculated from the Black Hole solutions of the Einstein equations, and using the Bekenstein-Hawking equality of the entropy with the area of the horizon. Renormalization is well defined, because the T=0 theory has asymptotic freedom. Comparison with lattice simulations is made.
