Title: Holographic Superconductors in Quasi-topological Gravity
Authors: Xiao-Mei Kuang and Wei-Jia Li and Yi Ling
Abstract: In this paper we study (3+1) dimensional holographic superconductors in quasi-topological gravity which is recently proposed by R. Myers {\it et.al.}. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we find in general the condensation becomes harder with the increase of coupling parameters of higher curvature terms. In particular, comparing with those in ordinary Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we find that positive cubic corrections in quasi-topological gravity suppress the condensation while negative cubic terms make it easier. We also calculate the conductivity numerically for various coupling parameters. It turns out that the universal relation of $\omega_g/T_c\simeq 8$ is unstable and this ratio becomes larger with the increase of the coupling parameters. A brief discussion on the condensation from the CFT side is also presented.
