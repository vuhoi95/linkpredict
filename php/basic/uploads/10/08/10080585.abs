Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of Rotating Black Hole with four Charges
Authors: Kai-Nan Shao and Zhibai Zhang
Abstract: Kerr/CFT correspondence exhibits many remarkable connections between the near horizon Kerr black hole and a CFT. Recently, a hidden conformal symmetry in the solution space of Kerr black hole is shown by Castro, Maloney and Strominger. Applying the formula on a rotating black hole with four independent U(1) charges derived in string theory which is known as the 4D Cvetic-Youm solution, we show that the same hidden conformal symmetry is also held. The temperatures we derived match the Cardy formula correctly and we give a clarification about old explains on them. The calculation on entropy and absorption cross section is also given, which totally agrees with the previous results. This work together with previous ones in this series, robustly support the validity of the way in which the hidden conformal symmetry is derived, and reflect the evidence of Kerr/CFT correspondence.
