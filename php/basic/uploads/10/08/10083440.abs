Title: Twist Quantization of String and Hopf Algebraic Symmetry
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We describe the twist quantization of string worldsheet theory, which unifies the description of quantization and the target space symmetry, based on the twisting of Hopf and module algebras. We formulate a method of decomposing a twist into successive twists to analyze the twisted Hopf and module algebra structure, and apply it to several examples, including finite twisted diffeomorphism and extra treatment for zero modes.
