Title: Landau problem for bilayer graphene: Exact results
Authors: Young-Hwan Hyun and Yoonbai Kim and Corneliu Sochichiu and Min-Young Choi
Abstract: We consider graphene bilayer in a constant magnetic field of arbitrary orientation (i.e. tilted with respect to the graphene plane). In the low energy approximation to tight binding model with Peierls substitution, we find the exact spectrum of Landau levels. This spectrum is two-fold degenerate in the limit of large in-plane field, which gives rise to a new SU(2) symmetry in this limit.
