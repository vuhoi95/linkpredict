Title: Confinement induced by fermion damping in three-dimensional QED
Authors: Jing Wang and Jing-Rong Wang and Wei Li and Guo-Zhu Liu
Abstract: The three-dimensional non-compact QED is known to exhibit weak confinement when fermions acquire a finite mass via the mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. In this paper, we study the effect of fermion damping caused by elastic scattering on the classical potential between fermions. By calculating the vacuum polarization function that incorporates the fermion damping effect, we show that fermion damping can induce a weak confinement even when the fermions are massless and the chiral symmetry is not broken.
