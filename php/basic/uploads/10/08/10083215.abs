Title: Thermodynamics for Kodama observer in general spherically symmetric  spacetimes
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Jian-Long Li and Yong-Qiang Wang
Abstract: By following the spirit of arXiv:1003.5665, we define a new Tolman temperature of Kodama observer directly related to its acceleration. We give a generalized integral form of thermodynamics relation on virtual sphere of constant $r$ in non-static spherical symmetric spacetimes. This relation contains work term contributed by `redshift work density', `pressure density' and `gravitational work density'. We illustrate it in RN black hole, Dilaton-Maxwell-Einstein black hole and Vaidya black hole. We argue that the co-moving observers are not physically related to Kodama observers in FRW universe unless in the vacuum case. We also find that a generalized differential form of first law is difficult to be well defined, and it would not give more information than the integral form.
