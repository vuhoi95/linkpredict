Title: About the Non Relativistic Structure of the AdS/CFT Superalgebras
Authors: Antonino Sciarrino and Paul Sorba
Abstract: The property of the conformal algebra to contain the Schr\"odinger algebra in one less space dimension is extended to the supersymmetric case. More precisely, we determine the counterpart of any field theory admissible super conformal algebra. Even if each type of superalgebra provides a different solution, its basis decomposition into two copies of the super Schr\"odinger algebra, differing only by their super Heisenberg part, remains valid in all the cases, so generalizing a feature already observed in the non supersymmetric conformal case.
