Title: Translational-invariant noncommutative gauge theory
Authors: F. Ardalan and N. Sadooghi
Abstract: A generalized translational invariant noncommutative field theory is analyzed in detail, and a complete description of translational invariant noncommutative structures is worked out. The relevant gauge theory is described, and the planar and nonplanar axial anomalies are obtained.
