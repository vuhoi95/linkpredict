Title: Gravitational Atom in Compactified Extra Dimensions
Authors: E. G. Floratos and G. K. Leontaris and N. D. Vlachos
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanical effects of the modified Newtonian potential in the presence of extra compactified dimensions. We develop a method to solve the resulting Schroedinger equation and determine the energy shifts caused by the Yukawa-type corrections of the potential. We comment on the possibility of detecting the modified gravitational bound state Energy spectrum by present day and future experiments.
