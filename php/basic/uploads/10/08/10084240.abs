Title: Cosmological dynamics with modified induced gravity on the normal DGP  branch
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Faeze Kiani
Abstract: In this paper we investigate cosmological dynamics on the normal branch of a DGP-inspired scenario within a phase space approach where induced gravity is modified in the spirit of $f(R)$-theories. We apply the dynamical system analysis to achieve the stable solutions of the scenario in the normal DGP branch. Firstly, we consider a general form of the modified induced gravity and we show that there is a standard de Sitter point in phase space of the model. Then we prove that this point is stable attractor only for those $f(R)$ functions that account for late-time cosmic speed-up.
