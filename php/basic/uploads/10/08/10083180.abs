Title: Twisted Sectors in Gravity Duals of N=4 Chern-Simons Theories
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Shuichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We study Kaluza-Klein modes of a d=7, N=2 vector multiplet in AdS_4 x S^3. Such modes arise in the context of AdS/CFT as dual objects of a class of gauge invariant operators in N=4 Chern-Simons theories. We confirm that the Kaluza-Klein modes precisely reproduce the BPS spectrum of the operators.
