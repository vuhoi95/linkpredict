Title: Tinkertoys for Gaiotto Duality
Authors: Oscar Chacaltana and Jacques Distler
Abstract: We describe a procedure for classifying N=2 superconformal theories of the type introduced by Davide Gaiotto. Any curve, C, on which the 6D A_{N-1} SCFT is compactified, can be decomposed into 3-punctured spheres, connected by cylinders. We classify the spheres, and the cylinders that connect them. The classification is carried out explicitly, up through N=5, and for several families of SCFTs for arbitrary N. These lead to a wealth of new S-dualities between Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian N=2 SCFTs.
