Title: AdS_4/CFT_3 Construction from Collective Fields
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin and Jo√£o P. Rodrigues
Abstract: We pursue the construction of higher-spin theory in AdS_4 from CFT_3 of the O(N) vector model in terms of canonical collective fields. In null plane quantization an exact map is established between the two spaces. The coordinates of the AdS_4 space-time are generated from the collective coordinates of the bi-local field. This, in the light cone gauge, provides an exact one to one reconstruction of bulk AdS_4 space-time and higher-spin fields.
