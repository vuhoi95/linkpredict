Title: Soft Collinear Degeneracies in an Asymptotically Free Theory
Authors: Martin Lavelle and David McMullan and Tom Steele
Abstract: In asymptotically free theories with collinear divergences it is sometimes claimed that these divergences cancel if one sums over initial and final state degenerate cross-sections and uses an off-shell renormalisation scheme. We show for scalar $\phi^3$ theory in six dimensions that there are further classes of soft collinear divergences and that they do not cancel. Furthermore, they yield a non-convergent series of terms at a fixed order of perturbation theory. Similar effects in gauge theories are also summarised.
