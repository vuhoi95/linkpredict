Title: Moduli and electromagnetic black brane holography
Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of 4-dimensional gauge theories with finite electric charge density in the presence of a constant magnetic field. Their gravity duals are planar magnetically and electrically charged AdS black holes in theories that contain a gauge Chern-Simons term. We present a careful analysis of the near horizon geometry of these black branes at finite and zero temperature for the case of a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field. With the knowledge of the near horizon data, we obtain analytic expressions for the shear viscosity coefficient and entropy density, and also study the effect of a generic set of four derivative interactions on their ratio. We also comment on the attractor flows of the extremal solutions.
