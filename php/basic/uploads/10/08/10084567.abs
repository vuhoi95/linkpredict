Title: Dynamical Selection of the Primordial Density Fluctuation Amplitude
Authors: Jean-Luc Lehners and Paul J. Steinhardt
Abstract: In inflationary models, the predicted amplitude of primordial density perturbations Q is much larger than the observed value (~10^{-5}) for natural choices of parameters. To explain the requisite exponential fine-tuning, anthropic selection is often invoked, especially in cases where microphysics is expected to produce a complex energy landscape. By contrast, we find examples of ekpyrotic models based on heterotic M-theory for which dynamical selection naturally favors the observed value of Q.
