Title: Deformed Special Relativity from Asymptotically Safe Gravity
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Sabine Hossenfelder and Roberto Percacci
Abstract: By studying the notion of a fundamentally minimal length scale in asymptotically safe gravity we find that a specific version of deformed special relativity (DSR) naturally arises in this approach. We then consider two thought experiments to examine the interpretation of the scenario and discuss similarities and differences to other approaches to DSR.
