Title: New potentials from Scherk-Schwarz reductions
Authors: Hugo Looyestijn and Erik Plauschinn and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We study compactifications of eleven-dimensional supergravity on Calabi-Yau threefolds times a circle, with a duality twist along the circle a la Scherk-Schwarz. This leads to four-dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity with a semi-positive definite potential for the scalar fields, which we derive explicitly. Furthermore, inspired by the orientifold projection in string theory, we define a truncation to N=1 supergravity. We determine the D-terms, Kaehler- and superpotentials for these models and study the properties of the vacua. Finally, we point out a relation to M-theory compactifications on seven-dimensional manifolds with G2 structure.
