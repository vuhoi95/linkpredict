Title: Catastrophic Instability of Small Lovelock Black Holes
Authors: Tomohiro Takahashi and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We study the stability of static black holes in Lovelock theory which is a natural higher dimensional generalization of Einstein theory. We show that Lovelock black holes are stable under vector perturbations in all dimensions. However, we prove that small Lovelock black holes are unstable under tensor perturbations in even-dimensions and under scalar perturbations in odd-dimensions. Therefore, we can conclude that small Lovelock black holes are unstable in any dimensions. The instability is stronger on small scales and hence catastrophic in the sense that there is no smooth descendant.
