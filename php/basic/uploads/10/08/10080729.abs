Title: From Supercurrents to Soft Terms
Authors: Sibo Zheng and Jia-Hui Huang
Abstract: In this paper,hidden sectors of Ferrara-Zumino multiplets with contributions to soft terms coming from quantum supergravity are investigated in framework of gravity mediation. The two-point correlator of Ferrara-Zumino multiplets can be parameterized, which implies the wave function renormalizations of components fields in gravity supermultiplet can be evaluated in relatively simple form. Soft terms are calculated via supercurrent approach. We find gaugino masses are independent of sfermion masses on general grounds. The unification of gaugino masses is not universal. In comparison with general gauge mediation, there are no sum rules for sfermion masses of each generation.
