Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of Kerr-Bolt Spacetimes
Authors: A. M. Ghezelbash and V. Kamali and M. R. Setare
Abstract: We extend the recent proposal of hidden conformal symmetry to the four-dimensional spacetimes with rotational parameter and NUT twist. We consider the wave equation of a massless scalar field in background of Kerr-Bolt spacetimes and show in the "near region", the wave equation can be reproduced by the $SL(2,R)_L \times SL(2,R)_R$ Casimir quadratic operators. Moreover, we compute the microscopic entropy of the dual CFT by Cardy formula and find a perfect match to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of Kerr-Bolt spacetimes. The absorption cross section of a near region scalar field also matches to microscopic absorption cross section of the dual CFT.
