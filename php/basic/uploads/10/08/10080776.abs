Title: Hidden Yangian symmetry in sigma model on squashed sphere
Authors: Io Kawaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss a hidden symmetry of a two-dimensional sigma model on a squashed S^3. The SU(2) current can be improved so that it can be regarded as a flat connection. Then we can obtain an infinite number of conserved non-local charges and show the Yangian algebra by directly checking the Serre relation. This symmetry is also deduced from the coset structure of the squashed sphere. The same argument is applicable to the warped AdS_3 spaces via double Wick rotations.
