Title: Exact String-Like Solutions in Conformal Gravity
Authors: Y. Verbin and Y. Brihaye
Abstract: The cylindrically-symmetric static vacuum equations of Conformal Gravity are solved for the case of additional boost symmetry along the axis. We present the complete family of solutions which describe the exterior gravitational field of line sources in Conformal Gravity. We also analyze the null geodesics in these spaces.
