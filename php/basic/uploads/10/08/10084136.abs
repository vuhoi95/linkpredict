Title: Faithful nonclassicality indicators and extremal quantum correlations in  two-qubit states
Authors: Davide Girolami and Mauro Paternostro and Gerardo Adesso
Abstract: The state disturbance induced by locally measuring a quantum system yields a signature of nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement. Here we present a detailed study of such correlations for two-qubit mixed states. To overcome the asymmetry of quantum discord and the unfaithfulness of measurement-induced disturbance (severely overestimating quantum correlations), we propose an ameliorated measurement-induced disturbance as nonclassicality indicator, optimized over joint local measurements, and we derive its closed expression for relevant two-qubit states. We study its analytical relation with discord, and characterize the maximally quantum-correlated mixed states, that simultaneously extremize both quantifiers at given von Neumann entropy: among all two-qubit states, these states possess the most robust quantum correlations against noise.
