Title: G-inflation: inflation driven by the Galileon field
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Masahide Yamaguchi and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflation model, G-inflation, which has a Galileon-like nonlinear derivative interaction of the form $G(\phi, (\nabla\phi)^2)\Box\phi$ in the Lagrangian with the resultant equations of motion being of second order. It is shown that (almost) scale-invariant curvature fluctuations can be generated even in the exactly de Sitter background and that the tensor-to-scalar ratio can take a significantly larger value than in the standard inflation models, violating the standard consistency relation. Furthermore, violation of the null energy condition can occur without any instabilities. As a result, the spectral index of tensor modes can be blue, which makes it easier to observe quantum gravitational waves from inflation by the planned gravitational-wave experiments such as LISA and DECIGO as well as by the upcoming CMB experiments such as Planck and CMBpol.
