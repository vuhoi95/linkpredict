Title: Open string pair creation from worldsheet instantons
Authors: Christian Schubert and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: Worldline instantons provide a particularly elegant way to derive Schwinger's well-known formula for the pair creation rate due to a constant electric field in quantum electrodynamics. In this note, we show how to extend this method to the corresponding problem of open string pair creation.
