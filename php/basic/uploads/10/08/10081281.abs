Title: On the localization of fermions on thick D-branes
Authors: Oscar Castillo-Felisola and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: Hints on the possible localization of fermions on double thick D-branes (Domain Walls) are found by analyzing the moduli space of parameters. Deeper analysis toward this direction might help to select phenomenologically plausible models. A new kind of condition for fermion localization is proposed. This might be useful in multi-brane-world scenarios, which are important when symmetry breaking is considered in the AdS/CFT formalism, as well as in curved brane-worlds.
