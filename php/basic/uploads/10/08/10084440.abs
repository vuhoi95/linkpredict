Authors: Frank GÃ¶hmann and Alexander Seel and Junji Suzuki
Abstract: We represent the density matrix of a finite segment of the integrable isotropic spin-1 chain in the thermodynamic limit as a multiple integral. Our integral formula is valid at finite temperature and also includes a homogeneous magnetic field.
