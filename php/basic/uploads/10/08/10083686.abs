Authors: Heng Guo and Yu-Xiao Liu and Shao-Wen Wei and Chun-E Fu
Abstract: In this letter, we first investigate the gravity localization and mass spectrum of gravity KK modes on de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter thick branes. Then, the effective Newtonian gravitational potentials for these bent branes are discussed by the two typical examples. The corrections of the Newtonian potential turns out to be $\Delta U(r)\sim 1/r^{2}$ at small $r$ for both cases. These corrections are very different from that of the Randall-Sundrum brane model $\Delta U(r)\sim 1/r^{3}$.
