Abstract: Using quiver gauge theories in (1+2)-dimensions, we give brane realizations of a class of Quantum Hall Solitons (QHS) embedded in Type IIA superstring on the ALE spaces with exotic singularities. These systems are obtained by considering two sets of wrapped D4-branes on 2-spheres. The space-time on which the QHS live is identified with the world-volume of D4-branes wrapped on a collection of intersecting 2-spheres arranged as extended Dynkin diagrams of Kac-Moody Lie algebras. The magnetic source is given by an extra orthogonal D4-brane wrapping a generic 2-cycle in the ALE spaces. It is shown as well that data on the representations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras fix the filling factor of the QHS. In case of finite Dynkin diagrams, we recover results on QHS with integer and fractional filling factors known in the literature. In case of hyperbolic bilayer models, we obtain amongst others filling factors describing holes in the graphene.
