Title: Witten's D_4 Integrable Hierarchies Conjecture
Authors: Huijun Fan and Amanda Francis and Tyler J. Jarvis and Evan Merrell and Yongbin Ruan
Abstract: We prove that the total descendant potential functions of the theory of Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten for D_4 with symmetry group <J> and D_4^T with symmetry group G_{max}, respectively, are both tau-functions of the D_4 Kac-Wakimoto/Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy. This completes the proof, begun in [FJR], of the Witten Integrable Hierarchies Conjecture for all simple (ADE) singularities.
