Title: Direct Gaugino Mediation
Authors: Daniel Green and Andrey Katz and Zohar Komargodski
Abstract: We describe renormalizable supersymmetric four-dimensional theories which lead to gaugino mediation and various generalizations thereof. Even though these models are strongly coupled, we can demonstrate the parametric suppression of soft scalar masses via Seiberg duality. For instance, we show that our models have a parameter which continuously interpolates between suppressed soft scalar masses and their conventional gauge mediated contribution. The main physical effect which we utilize is the general relation between massive deformations in one frame and higgsing in the dual frame. Some compelling and relatively unexplored particle physics scenarios arise naturally in this framework. We offer preliminary comments on various aspects of the phenomenology and outline several of the outstanding open problems.
