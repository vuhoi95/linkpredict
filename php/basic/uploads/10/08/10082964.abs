Title: High temperature correlation functions: universality, extraction of  exchange interactions, divergent correlation lengths and generalized Debye  length scales
Authors: Saurish Chakrabarty and Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We derive a universal form for the correlation function of general n component systems in the limit of high temperatures or weak coupling. This enables the extraction of effective microscopic interactions from measured high temperature correlation functions. We find that in systems with long range interactions, there exist diverging correlation lengths with amplitudes that tend to zero in the high temperature limit. For general systems with disparate long range interactions, we introduce the notion of generalized Debye length (and time) scales and further relate it to the divergence of the largest correlation length in the high temperature (or weak coupling) limit.
