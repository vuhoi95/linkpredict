Title: A modular invariant bulk theory for the c=0 triplet model
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Ingo Runkel and Simon Wood
Abstract: A proposal for the bulk space of the logarithmic W(2,3)-triplet model at central charge zero is made. The construction is based on the idea that one may reconstruct the bulk theory of a rational conformal field theory from its boundary theory. The resulting bulk space is a quotient of the direct sum of projective representations, which is isomorphic, as a vector space, to the direct sum of tensor products of the irreducible representations with their projective covers. As a consistency check of our analysis we show that the partition function of the bulk theory is modular invariant, and that the boundary state analysis is compatible with the proposed annulus partition functions of this model.
