Title: On the algebraic classification of pseudo-Riemannian spaces
Authors: Sigbjorn Hervik and Alan Coley
Abstract: We consider arbitrary-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces of signature $(k,k+m)$. We introduce a boost-weight decomposition and define a number of algebraic properties (e.g., the ${\bf S}_i$- and ${\bf N}$-properties) and present a boost-weight decomposition to classify the Weyl tensors of arbitrary signature and discuss degenerate algebraic types (e.g., VSI spaces). We consider the four dimensional neutral signature space as an illustration.
