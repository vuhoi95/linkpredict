Title: Pseudo-Riemannian VSI spaces
Authors: Sigbjorn Hervik and Alan Coley
Abstract: In this paper we consider pseudo-Riemannian spaces of arbitrary signature for which all of their polynomial curvature invariants vanish (VSI spaces). We discuss an algebraic classification of pseudo-Riemannian spaces in terms of the boost weight decomposition and define the ${\bf S}_i$- and ${\bf N}$-properties, and show that if the curvature tensors of the space possess the ${\bf N}$-property then it is a VSI space. We then use this result to construct a set of metrics that are VSI. All of the VSI spaces constructed possess a geodesic, expansion-free, shear-free, and twist-free null-congruence. We also discuss the related Walker metrics.
