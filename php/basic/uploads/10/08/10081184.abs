Title: Non-Equilibrium Fluctuations of Black Hole Horizons
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Susumu Okazawa and Sen Zhang
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium nature of fluctuations of black hole horizons by applying the fluctuation theorems and the Jarzynski equality developed in the non-equilibrium statistical physics. These theorems applied to space-times with black hole horizons lead to the generalized second law of thermodynamics. It is also suggested that the second law should be violated microscopically so as to satisfy the Jarzynski equality.
