Title: Renormalization Group Flow for Noncommutative Fermi Liquids
Authors: Sendic Estrada-Jimenez and Hugo Garcia-Compean and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: Some recent studies of the AdS/CFT correspondence for condensed matter systems involve the Fermi liquid theory as a boundary field theory. Adding B-flux to the boundary D-branes leads in a certain limit to the noncommutative Fermi liquid, which calls for a field theory description of its critical behavior. As a preliminary step to more general consideration, the modification of the Landau's Fermi liquid theory due to noncommutativity of spatial coordinates is studied in this paper. We carry out the renormalization of interactions at tree level and one loop in a weakly coupled fermion system in two spatial dimensions. Channels ZS, ZS' and BCS are discussed in detail. It is shown that while the Gaussian fixed point remains unchanged, the BCS instability is modified due to the space non-commutativity.
