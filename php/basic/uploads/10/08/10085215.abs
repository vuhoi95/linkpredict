Abstract: We review the construction and applications of exactly Poincar\'e invariant quantum mechanical models of few-degree of freedom systems. We discuss the construction of dynamical representations of the Poincar\'e group on few-particle Hilbert spaces, the relation to quantum field theory, the formulation of cluster properties, and practical considerations related to the construction of realistic interactions and the solution of the dynamical equations. Selected applications illustrate the utility of this approach.
