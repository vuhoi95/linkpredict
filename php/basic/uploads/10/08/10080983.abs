Abstract: We study consistent Kaluza-Klein reductions of type IIB supergravity on T(1,1) down to five-dimensions. We find that the most general reduction containing singlets under the global SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry of T(1,1) is N=4 gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with a particular gauging due to topological and geometric flux. Key to this reduction is several modes which have not been considered before in the literature and our construction allows us to easily show that the Papadopoulos - Tseytlin ansatz for IIB solutions on T(1,1) is a consistent truncation. This explicit reduction provides an organizing principle for the linearized spectrum around the warped deformed conifold as well as the baryonic branch and should have applications to the physics of flux compactifications with warped throats.
