Title: A Extended Cosmological Cardy-Verlinde Formula
Authors: Thiago G. Prado and Marcos C. Verges
Abstract: E. Verlinde obtained a generalized formula for the entropy of a conformal field theory. For this we consider a (n+1) dimensional closed radiation dominated FLWR in the context of the holographic principle. In this work we construct a extension of the Cardy-Verlinde formula to positive cosmological constant spaces (dS spaces) with arbitrary topology
