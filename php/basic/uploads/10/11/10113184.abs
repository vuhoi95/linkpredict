Title: Thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet-Born-Infeld black holes in AdS space
Authors: De-Cheng Zou and Zhan-Ying Yang and Rui-Hong Yue and Peng Li
Abstract: We construct solutions of a model which includes the Gauss-Bonnet and Born-Infeld terms for various horizon topologies $(k=0, \pm 1)$, and then the mass, temperature, entropy and heat capacity of black holes are computed. For the sake of simplicity, we perform the stability analysis of five dimensional topological black holes in AdS space.
