Title: Boltzmann Equation for Relativistic Neutral Scalar Field in  Non-equilibrium Thermo Field Dynamics
Authors: Yuichi Mizutani and Tomohiro Inagaki
Abstract: A relativistic neutral scalar field is investigated on the basis of the Schwinger-Dyson equation in the non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics. A time evolution equation for a distribution function is obtained from a diagonalization condition for the Schwinger-Dyson equation. An explicit expression of the time evolution equation is calculated in the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction model at the 2-loop level. The Boltzmann equation is derived for the relativistic scalar field. We set a simple initial condition and numerically solve the Boltzmann equation and show the time evolution of the distribution function and the relaxation time.
