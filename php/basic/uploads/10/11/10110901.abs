Title: Localizability in de Sitter space
Authors: N. Yokomizo and J. C. A. Barata
Abstract: An analogue of the Newton-Wigner position operator is defined for a massive neutral scalar field in de Sitter space. The one-particle subspace of the theory, consisting of positive-energy solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation selected by the Hadamard condition, is identified with an irreducible representation of de Sitter group. Postulates of localizability analogous to those written by Wightman for fields in Minkowski space are formulated on it, and a unique solution is shown to exist. A simple expression for the time-evolution of the operator is presented.
