Title: Finite size effects on the Poynting-Robertson effect: a fully general  relativistic treatment
Authors: Jae Sok Oh and Hongsu Kim and Hyung Mok Lee
Abstract: Ever since the first discovery of Poynting and Robertson, the radiation source has been treated as merely a point. Even in a very few studies where the size of the source has been taken into account, the treatment of the problem remained largely non-relativistic. In the present work, we address the issue of the finite size effects on the Poynting-Robertson effect in a fully relativistic manner for the first time. As a result, the emergence and the characteristic of the critical point/suspension orbit can be studied in a systematic and detailed manner.
