Title: Q-tubes and Q-crusts
Authors: Nobuyuki Sakai and Hideki Ishihara and Ken-ichi Nakao
Abstract: We explore equilibrium solutions of non-topological solitons in a general class of scalar field theories which include global U(1) symmetry. We find new types of solutions, tube-shaped and crust-shaped objects, and investigate their stability. Like Q-balls, the new solitons can exist in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, which may responsible for baryon asymmetry and dark matter. Therefore, observational signals of the new solitons would give us more informations on the early universe and supersymmetric theories.
