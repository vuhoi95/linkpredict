Title: On the structure of the S-matrix in general boundary quantum field  theory in curved space
Authors: Daniele Colosi and Max Dohse
Abstract: We use the general boundary formulation (GBF) of quantum field theory to compute the S-matrix for a general interacting scalar field in curved spacetime. This S-matrix is obtained as the asymptotic limit of the GBF-amplitude associated with a finite spacetime region. Two types of regions are of interest here. The first type is bounded by the disjoint union of two (non-compact) hypersurfaces. For the special choice of Cauchy hypersurfaces, the asymptotic GBF-amplitude reduces to the standard S-matrix. The second type of region is enclosed by one connected and timelike boundary, called the hypercylinder region. As a by-product we obtain the general expression of the Feynman propagator for the field defined in both regions. Our work generalizes previous results obtained in Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes to (a wide class of) curved spacetimes.
