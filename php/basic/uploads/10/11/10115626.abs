Title: Possible splitting of deconfinement and chiral transitions in strong  magnetic fields in QCD
Authors: Eduardo S. Fraga and Ana Julia Mizher and M. N. Chernodub
Abstract: We show that finite-temperature deconfinement and chiral transitions can split in a strong enough magnetic field. The splitting in critical temperatures of these transitions in a constant magnetic field of a typical LHC magnitude is of the order of 10 MeV. A new deconfined phase with broken chiral symmetry appears.
