Title: Gravitating magnetic monopole in Vaidya geometry
Authors: Sushant G. Ghosh and L. P. Singh
Abstract: A magnetic-monopole solution of a non-Abelian gauge theory as proposed by 't Hooft and Polyakov is studied in the Vaidya spacetime. We find that the solutions of Einstein equations generates a geometry of the Bonnor-Vaidya corresponding to magnetically charged null fluid with Higgs field contributing a cosmological term. In the absence of the scalar fields the corresponding Wu-Yang solution of the gauge theory still generates the Bonnor-Vaidya geometry, but with no cosmological term.
