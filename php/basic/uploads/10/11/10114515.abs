Title: The Roberge-Weiss endpoint in N_f = 2 QCD
Authors: Claudio Bonati and Guido Cossu and Massimo D'Elia and Francesco Sanfilippo
Abstract: We present the results of extensive simulations regarding the critical behavior at the endpoint of the Roberge-Weiss transition for N_f = 2 QCD. We confirm early evidence, presented in arXiv:0909.0254, according to which the Roberge-Weiss endpoint is first order in the limit of large or small quark masses, and second order for intermediate masses. A systematic study of the transition strength as a function of the quark mass in the first order regions, permits us to estimate the tricritical values of the quark mass separating the second order region from the first order ones.
