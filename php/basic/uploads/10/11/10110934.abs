Title: Permutation Orbifold of N=2 Supersymmetric Minimal Models
Authors: M. Maio and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: In this paper we apply the previously derived formalism of permutation orbifold conformal field theories to N=2 supersymmetric minimal models. By interchanging extensions and permutations of the factors we find a very interesting structure relating various conformal field theories that seems not to be known in literature. Moreover, unexpected exceptional simple currents arise in the extended permuted models, coming from off-diagonal fields. In a few situations they admit fixed points that must be resolved. We determine the complete CFT data with all fixed point resolution matrices for all simple currents of all Z_2-permutations orbifolds of all minimal N=2 models with k\neq 2 mod 4.
