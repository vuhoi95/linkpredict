Title: On the finite spectral triple of an almost-commutative geometry
Authors: F. J. Vanhecke and A. R. da Silva and C. Sigaud
Abstract: In this short communication, we examine the relevance of the signature of the space-time metric in the construction of the product of a pseudo-Riemannian spectral triple with a finite triple describing the internal geometry. We obtain arguments favouring the appearance of SU(2) and U(1) as gauge groups in the standard model.
