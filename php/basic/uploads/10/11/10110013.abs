Title: Cosmic Sum Rules
Authors: Mads T. Frandsen and Isabella Masina and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We introduce new sum rules allowing to determine universal properties of the unknown component of the cosmic rays and show how they can be used to predict the positron fraction at energies not yet explored by current experiments and to constrain specific models.
