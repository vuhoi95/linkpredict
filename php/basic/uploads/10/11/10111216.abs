Title: Fundamental String (Membrane) Orbiting D5(M5)-branes
Authors: Rashmi R. Nayak and Pratap K. Swain
Abstract: We study fundamental string (F-string) dynamics near D5-brane in some limits. We find that when the angular momentum of the probe is proportional to string length (l_s) and square root of string coupling constant {g_s}, the F-string lies in its metastable orbit at a finite distance from D5-branes. We further study the metastable orbits of a M2-brane in M5-brane background.
