Title: Long-distance behavior of temperature correlation functions in the  one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: K. K. Kozlowski and J. M. Maillet and N. A. Slavnov
Abstract: We describe a Bethe ansatz based method to derive, starting from a multiple integral representation, the long-distance asymptotic behavior at finite temperature of the density-density correlation function in the interacting one-dimensional Bose gas. We compute the correlation lengths in terms of solutions of non-linear integral equations of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz type. Finally, we establish a connection between the results obtained in our approach with the correlation lengths stemming from the quantum transfer matrix method.
