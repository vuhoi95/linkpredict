Title: E11 and Supersymmetry
Authors: Duncan Steele and Peter West
Abstract: We introduce fermions into the E11 non-linear realisation. We show, at low levels, that the commutators of the Cartan involution invariant subalgebra of E11 with the known supersymmetry transformations of eleven dimensional supergravity lead to symmetries of the theory indicating the consistency of supersymmetry and E11.
