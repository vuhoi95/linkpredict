Abstract: A direct connection is proved between the Non-Abelian Bianchi Identities and the Abelian Bianchi identities for the 't Hooft tensor in a generic gauge; the existence of a magnetic current is related to the violation of NABI's. Using this relation it is shown that not all gauges are equivalent to detect monopoles on the lattice, that e.g. the Maximal Abelian Gauge is a legitimate choice while the Landau gauge is not. Nevertheless monopole condensation is found to be a gauge invariant property.
