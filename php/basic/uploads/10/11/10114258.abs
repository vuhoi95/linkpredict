Title: Consistency of isotropic modified Maxwell theory: Microcausality and  unitarity
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and M. Schreck
Abstract: The Lorentz-violating isotropic modified Maxwell theory minimally coupled to standard Dirac theory is characterized by a single real dimensionless parameter which is taken to vanish for the case of the standard (Lorentz-invariant) theory. A finite domain of positive and negative values of this Lorentz-violating parameter is determined, in which microcausality and unitarity hold. The main focus of this article is on isotropic modified Maxwell theory, but similar results for two anisotropic nonbirefringent cases are presented in the appendices.
