Title: Lepton number violation in theories with a large number of Standard  Model copies
Authors: Sergey Kovalenko and Heinrich PÃ¤s and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: We examine lepton number violation (LNV) in theories with a saturated black hole bound on a large number of species. Such theories have been advocated recently as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem and an explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses. The violation of lepton number can be a potential phenomenological problem of this N-copy extension of the Standard Model as due to the low quantum gravity scale black holes may induce TeV scale LNV operators generating unacceptably large rates of LNV processes. We show, however, that this does not happen in this scenario due to a specific compensation mechanism between contributions of different Majorana neutrino states to these processes. As a result rates of LNV processes are extremely small and far beyond experimental reach, at least for the left-handed neutrino states.
