Title: The virial relation for compact Q-balls in the complex signum-Gordon  model
Authors: Huawen Wang and Hongbo Cheng
Abstract: In this work the properties of Q-balls in the complex signum-Gordon model in $d$ spatial dimensions is studied. We obtain a general virial relation for this kind of Q-ball in the higher-dimensional spacetime. We compute the energy and radii of Q-ball with V-shaped field potential as a function of spatial dimensionality and a parameter defining the model potential energy density.
