Title: The Parity Odd Universe, Dark Energy and QCD
Authors: Federico R. Urban and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: Cosmological observations on the largest scales exhibit a solid record of unexpected anomalies and alignments, apparently pointing towards a large scale violation of statistical isotropy. These include a variety of CMB measurements, as well as alignments of quasar polarisation vectors. In this paper we explore the possibility that several of the aforementioned large scale correlations are in fact not independent, and can be understood in a coherent way within the framework of a parity odd local Universe, and ultimately related to the nature of Dark Energy and its interactions with light.
