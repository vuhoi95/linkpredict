Abstract: We construct finite mass, asymptotically flat black hole solutions in d=5 Einstein--Yang-Mills--Chern-Simons theory. Our results indicate the existence of a second order phase transition between Reissner-Nordstrom solutions and the non-Abelian black holes which generically are thermodynamically preferred. Some of the non-Abelian configurations are also stable under linear, spherically symmetric perturbations. In addition a solution in closed form describing an extremal black hole with non-Abelian hair is found for a special value of the Chern-Simons coupling constant.
