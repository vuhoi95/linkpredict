Title: Symmetries of Self-Dual Yang-Mills Equations Dimensionally Reduced From  (2,2) Space-time
Authors: Paul Mansfield and Adam Wardlow
Abstract: We construct infinite-dimensional symmetries of the two dimensional equation which results from the dimensional reduction of the self-duality condition in (2, 2) signature space-time. These are symmetries of the dimensionally reduced Chalmers-Siegel action and so hold off-shell.
