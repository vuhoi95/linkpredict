Title: Extra dimensions as a source of the electroweak model
Authors: S. V. Bolokhov and K. A. Bronnikov and S. G. Rubin
Abstract: The Higgs boson of the Standard model is described by a set of off-diagonal components of the multidimensional metric tensor, as well as the gauge fields. In the low-energy limit, the basic properties of the Higgs boson are reproduced, including the shape of the potential and interactions with the gauge fields of the electroweak part of the Standard model.
