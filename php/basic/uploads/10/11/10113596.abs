Title: Traversable wormhole in the deformed Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Edwin J. Son and Wontae Kim
Abstract: Asymptotically flat wormhole solutions are found in the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It turns out that higher curvature terms can not play the role of exotic matters which are crucial to form a traversable wormhole, and external exotic sources are still needed. In particular, the exotic matter behaves like phantom energy if Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum is considered outside the wormhole. Interestingly, the spherically symmetric setting makes the matter and the higher curvature contribution satisfy four-dimensional conservation of energy in the covariant form.
