Title: Statistical Properties of Cosmological Billiards
Authors: Thibault Damour and Orchidea Maria Lecian
Abstract: Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) pioneered the study of the statistical properties of the never-ending oscillatory behavior (among successive Kasner epochs) of the geometry near a space-like singularity. We show how the use of a "cosmological billiard" description allows one to refine and deepen the understanding of these statistical properties. Contrary to previous treatments, we do not quotient the dynamics by its discrete symmetry group (of order 6), thereby uncovering new phenomena, such as correlations between the successive billiard corners in which the oscillations take place. Starting from the general integral invariants of Hamiltonian systems, we show how to construct invariant measures for various projections of the cosmological-billiard dynamics. In particular, we exhibit, for the first time, a (non-normalizable) invariant measure on the "Kasner circle" which parametrizes the exponents of successive Kasner epochs. Finally, we discuss the relation between: (i) the unquotiented dynamics of the Bianchi IX (a, b, c or mixmaster) model; (ii) its quotienting by the group of permutations of (a, b, c); and (iii) the billiard dynamics that arose in recent studies suggesting the hidden presence of Kac-Moody symmetries in cosmological billiards.
