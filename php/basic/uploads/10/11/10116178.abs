Abstract: We reveal the center vortex content of SU(2) calorons and ensembles of them. While one part of the vortex connects the constituent dyons of a single caloron, another part is predominantly spatial and can be related to the twist that exists in the caloron gauge field. The latter part depends strongly on the caloron holonomy and degenerates to a plane between the dyons when the asymptotic Polyakov loop is traceless. Correspondingly, the spatial vortex in caloron ensembles is percolating in this case. This finding fits perfectly in the confinement scenario of vortices and shows that calorons are suitable to facilitate the vortex (de)confinement mechanism.
