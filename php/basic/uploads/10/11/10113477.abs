Title: Cosmic Jets
Authors: C. Chicone and B. Mashhoon and K. Rosquist
Abstract: We discuss time-dependent gravitational fields that "accelerate" free test particles to the speed of light resulting in cosmic double-jet configurations. It turns out that complete gravitational collapse along a spatial axis together with corresponding expansion along the other two axes leads to the accelerated motion of free test particles up and down parallel to the collapse axis such that a double-jet pattern is asymptotically formed with respect to the collapsed configuration.
