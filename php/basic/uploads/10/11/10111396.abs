Title: Irreducible Highest Weight Representations Of The Simple n-Lie Algebra
Authors: Dana Balibanu and Johan van de Leur
Abstract: A. Dzhumadil'daev classified all irreducible finite dimensional representations of the simple n-Lie algebra. Using a slightly different approach, we obtain in this paper a complete classification of all irreducible, highest weight modules, including the infinite-dimensional ones. As a corollary we find all primitive ideals of the universal enveloping algebra of this simple n-Lie algebra.
