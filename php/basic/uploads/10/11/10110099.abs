Title: Hierarchies of Susy Splittings and Invisible Photinos as Dark Matter
Authors: W. Fischler and W. Tangarife Garcia
Abstract: We explore how to generate hierarchies in the splittings between superpartners. Some of the consequences are the existence of invisible components of dark matter, new inflaton candidates, invisible monopoles and a number of invisible particles that might dominate during various eras, in particular between BBN and recombination and decay subsequently.
