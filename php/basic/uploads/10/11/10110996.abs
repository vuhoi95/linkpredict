Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Pau Figueras and Ricardo Monteiro and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: Myers-Perry black holes with a single spin in d>5 have been shown to be unstable if rotating sufficiently rapidly. We extend the numerical analysis which allowed for that result to the asymptotically AdS case. We determine numerically the stationary perturbations that mark the onset of the instabilities for the modes that preserve the rotational symmetries of the background. The parameter space of solutions is thoroughly analysed, and the onset of the instabilities is obtained as a function of the cosmological constant. Each of these perturbations has been conjectured to represent a bifurcation point to a new phase of stationary AdS black holes, and this is consistent with our results.
