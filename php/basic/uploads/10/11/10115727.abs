Abstract: We develop superspace techniques to construct general off-shell N=1,2,3,4 superconformal sigma-models in three space-time dimensions. The most general N=3 and N=4 superconformal sigma-models are constructed in terms of N=2 chiral superfields. Several superspace proofs of the folklore statement that N=3 supersymmetry implies N=4 are presented both in the on-shell and off-shell settings. We also elaborate on (super)twistor realisations for (super)manifolds on which the three-dimensional N-extended superconformal groups act transitively and which include Minkowski space as a subspace.
