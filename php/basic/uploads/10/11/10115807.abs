Title: The deformations of antibracket with even and odd deformation parameters
Authors: S. E. Konstein and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: We consider antibracket superalgebras realized on the smooth Grassmann-valued functions with compact supports in n-dimensional space and with the grading inverse to Grassmanian parity. The deformations with even and odd deformation parameters of these superalgebras are presented for arbitrary n.
