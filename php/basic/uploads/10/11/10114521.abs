Title: Simple exercises to flatten your potential
Authors: Xi Dong and Bart Horn and Eva Silverstein and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We show how backreaction of the inflaton potential energy on heavy scalar fields can flatten the inflationary potential, as the heavy fields adjust to their most energetically favorable configuration. This mechanism operates in previous UV-complete examples of axion monodromy inflation - flattening a would-be quadratic potential to one linear in the inflaton field - but occurs more generally, and we illustrate the effect with several examples. Special choices of compactification minimizing backreaction may realize chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential, but we argue that a flatter potential such as power-law inflation $V(\phi) \propto \phi^p$ with $p<2$ is a more generic option at sufficiently large values of $\phi$.
