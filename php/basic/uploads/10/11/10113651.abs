Title: The asymmetry of the dimension two condensate
Authors: David Vercauteren and David Dudal and John Gracey and Nele Vandersickel and Henri Verschelde
Abstract: I present recent analytical work concerning the electric-magnetic asymmetry in the dimension two condensate <A^2> in pure Yang-Mills theory. We reproduce qualitatively the lattice results previously found by Chernodub and Ilgenfritz.
