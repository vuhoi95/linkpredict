Abstract: Quantum evaporation of Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) black holes is analyzed in the mean field approximation. This semi-classical theory incorporates back reaction. Detailed analytical and numerical calculations show that, while some of the assumptions underlying the standard evaporation paradigm are borne out, several are not. Furthermore, if the black hole is initially macroscopic, the evaporation process exhibits remarkable universal properties (which are distinct from the features observed in the simplified, exactly soluble models). Although the literature on CGHS black holes is quite rich, these features had escaped previous analyses, in part because of lack of required numerical precision, and in part because certain properties and symmetries of the model were not fully recognized. Finally, our results provide support for the full quantum gravity scenario recently developed by Ashtekar, Taveras and Varadarajan.
