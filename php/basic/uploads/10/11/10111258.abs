Title: Wall-Crossing from Boltzmann Black Hole Halos
Authors: Jan Manschot and Boris Pioline and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: A key question in the study of N=2 supersymmetric string or field theories is to understand the decay of BPS bound states across walls of marginal stability in the space of parameters or vacua. By representing the potentially unstable bound states as multi-centered black hole solutions in N=2 supergravity, we provide two fully general and explicit formulae for the change in the (refined) index across the wall. The first, "Higgs branch" formula relies on Reineke's results for invariants of quivers without oriented loops, specialized to the Abelian case. The second, "Coulomb branch" formula results from evaluating the symplectic volume of the classical phase space of multi-centered solutions by localization. We provide extensive evidence that these new formulae agree with each other and with the mathematical results of Kontsevich and Soibelman (KS) and Joyce and Song (JS). The main physical insight behind our results is that the Bose-Fermi statistics of individual black holes participating in the bound state can be traded for Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, provided the (integer) index \Omega(\gamma) of the internal degrees of freedom carried by each black hole is replaced by an effective (rational) index \bar\Omega(\gamma)= \sum_{m|\gamma} \Omega(\gamma/m)/m^2. A similar map also exists for the refined index. This observation provides a physical rationale for the appearance of the rational Donaldson-Thomas invariant \bar\Omega(\gamma) in the works of KS and JS. The simplicity of the wall crossing formula for rational invariants allows us to generalize the "semi-primitive wall-crossing formula" to arbitrary decays of the type \gamma\to M\gamma_1+N\gamma_2 with M=2,3.
