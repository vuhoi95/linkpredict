Title: Non-universal shear viscosity from Einstein gravity
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Patrick Kerner and Hansj√∂rg Zeller
Abstract: A very famous result of gauge/gravity duality is the universality of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in every field theory holographically dual to classical, two-derivative (Einstein) gravity. We present a way to obtain deviation form this universality by breaking the rotational symmetry spontaneously. In anisotropic fluids additional shear modes exist and their corresponding shear viscosities may be non-universal. We confirm this by explicitly calculating the shear viscosities in a transversely isotropic background, a p-wave superfluid, and study its critical behavior. This is a first decisive step towards further applications of gauge/gravity duality to physical systems.
