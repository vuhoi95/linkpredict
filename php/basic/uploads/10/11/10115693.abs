Title: Chronology protection and the stringy exclusion principle

Abstract: We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions to AdS supergravity in three dimensions, that correspond to type IIB seven branes wrapped on an internal S3xT4. These solutions are generalizations of the three dimensional Goedel universe and have closed timelike curves. We propose an enhancon-like mechanism for excising the closed timelike curve region by including the effects of additional light degrees of freedom. These take the form of tensionless 7-brane probes, effectively described through the backreaction of a smeared domain wall. The absence of closed timelike curves in the asymptotic AdS3 geometries obtained in this way is shown to be equivalent to a unitarity bound in the dual CFT, known as the stringy exclusion principle.
