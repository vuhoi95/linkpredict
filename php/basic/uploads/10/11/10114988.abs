Title: Second Law Violations in Lovelock Gravity for Black Hole Mergers
Authors: Sudipta Sarkar and Aron C. Wall
Abstract: We study the classical second law of black hole thermodynamics, for Lovelock theories (other than General Relativity), in arbitrary dimensions. Using the standard formula for black hole entropy, we construct scenarios involving the merger of two black holes in which the entropy instantaneously decreases. Our construction involves a Kaluza-Klein compactification down to a dimension in which one of the Lovelock terms is topological. We discuss some open issues in the definition of the second law which might be used to compensate this entropy decrease.
