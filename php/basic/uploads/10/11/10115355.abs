Title: Vacua of N=10 three dimensional gauged supergravity
Authors: Auttakit Chatrabhuti and Parinya Karndumri
Abstract: We study scalar potentials and the corresponding vacua of N=10 three dimensional gauged supergravity. The theory contains 32 scalar fields parametrizing the exceptional coset space $\frac{E_{6(-14)}}{SO(10)\times U(1)}$. The admissible gauge groups considered in this work involve both compact and non-compact gauge groups which are maximal subgroups of $SO(10)\times U(1)$ and $E_{6(-14)}$, respectively. These gauge groups are given by $SO(p)\times SO(10-p)\times U(1)$ for $p=6,...10$, $SO(5)\times SO(5)$, $SU(4,2)\times SU(2)$, $G_{2(-14)}\times SU(2,1)$ and $F_{4(-20)}$. We find many AdS$_3$ critical points with various unbroken gauge symmetries. The relevant background isometries associated to the maximally supersymmetric critical points at which all scalars vanish are also given. These correspond to the superconformal symmetries of the dual conformal field theories in two dimensions.
