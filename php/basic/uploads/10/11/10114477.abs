Title: Next-to-leading resummations in cosmological perturbation theory
Authors: Stefano Anselmi and Sabino Matarrese and Massimo Pietroni
Abstract: One of the nicest results in cosmological perturbation theory is the analytical resummaton of the leading corrections at large momentum, which was obtained by Crocce and Scoccimarro for the propagator. Using an exact evolution equation, we generalize this result, by showing that a class of next-to-leading corrections can also be resummed at all orders in perturbation theory. The new corrections modify the propagator by a few percent in the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation range of scales, and therefore cannot be neglected in resummation schemes aiming at an accuracy compatible with future generation galaxy surveys. Similar tools can be employed to derive improved approximations for the Power Spectrum.
