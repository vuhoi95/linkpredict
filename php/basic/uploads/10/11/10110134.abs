Title: Power-Law Entropy Corrected Holographic Dark Energy Model
Authors: Ahmad Sheykhi and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: Among various scenarios to explain the acceleration of the universe expansion, the holographic dark energy (HDE) model has got a lot of enthusiasm recently. In the derivation of holographic energy density, the area relation of the black hole entropy plays a crucial role. Indeed, the power-law corrections to entropy appear in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields in and out the horizon. Inspired by the power-law corrected entropy, we propose the so-called "power-law entropy-corrected holographic dark energy" (PLECHDE) in this Letter. We investigate the cosmological implications of this model and calculate some relevant cosmological parameters and their evolution. We also briefly study the so-called "power-law entropy-corrected agegraphic dark energy" (PLECADE).
