Title: Collective Excitations of Supersymmetric Plasma
Authors: Alina Czajka and Stanislaw Mrowczynski
Abstract: Collective excitations of N = 1 supersymmetric electromagnetic plasma are studied. Since the Keldysh-Schwinger approach is used, not only equilibrium but also non-equilibrium plasma, which is assumed to be ultrarelativistic, is under consideration. The dispersion equations of photon, photino, electron and selectron modes are written down and the self-energies, which enter the equations, are computed in the Hard Loop Approximation. The self-energies are discussed in the context of effective action which is also given. The photon modes and electron ones appear to be the same as in the usual ultrarelativistic plasma of electrons, positrons and photons. The photino modes coincide with the electron ones and the selectron modes are as of free relativistic massive particle.
