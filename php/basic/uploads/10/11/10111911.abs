Title: More Three Dimensional Mirror Pairs
Authors: Dimitri Nanopoulos and Dan Xie
Abstract: We found a lot of new three dimensional N = 4 mirror pairs generalizing previous considerations on three dimensional generalized quiver gauge theories. We recovered almost all previous discovered mirror pairs with these constructions. One side of these mirror pairs are always the conventional quiver gauge theories. One of our result can also be used to determine the matter content and weakly coupled gauge groups of four dimensional N = 2 generalized quiver gauge theories derived from six dimensional A_N and D_N theory, therefore we explicitly constructed four dimensional S-duality pairs.
