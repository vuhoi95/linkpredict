Title: Universal Area Product Formulae for Rotating and Charged Black Holes in  Four and Higher Dimensions
Authors: M. Cvetic and G. W. Gibbons and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We present explicit results for the product of all horizon areas for general rotating multi-charge black holes, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in four and higher dimensions. The expressions are universal, and depend only on the quantized charges, quantized angular momenta and the cosmological constant. If the latter is also quantized these universal results may provide a "looking glass" for probing the microscopics of general black holes.
