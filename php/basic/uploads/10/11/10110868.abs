Title: Symmetry energy of dense matter in holographic QCD
Authors: Youngman Kim and Yunseok Seo and Ik Jae Shin and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We study the nuclear symmetry energy of dense matter using holographic QCD. To this end, we consider two flavor branes with equal quark masses in a D4/D6/D6 model. We find that at all densities the symmetry energy monotonically increases. At small densities, it exhibits a power law behavior with the density, $E_{\rm sym} \sim \rho^{1/2}$.
