Title: Exact phase space functional for two-body systems
Authors: José M. Gracia-Bondía and Joseph C. Várilly
Abstract: The determination of the two-body density functional from its one-body density is achieved for Moshinsky's harmonium model, using a phase-space formulation, thereby resolving its phase dilemma. The corresponding sign rules can equivalently be obtained by minimizing the ground-state energy.
