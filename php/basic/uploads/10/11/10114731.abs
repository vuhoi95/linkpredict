Title: Homology of Lie algebra of supersymmetries
Authors: Michael Movshev and Albert Schwarz and Renjun Xu
Abstract: We study the homology and cohomology groups of super Lie algebra of supersymmetries and of super Poincare algebra. We discuss in detail the calculation in dimensions D=10 and D=6. Our methods can be applied to extended supersymmetry algebra and to other dimensions.
