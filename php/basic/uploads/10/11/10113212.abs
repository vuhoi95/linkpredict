Title: Notes on Ghost Dark Energy
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Qiping Su and Zhong-Liang Tuo and Hong-Bo Zhang
Abstract: We study a phenomenological dark energy model which is rooted in the Veneziano ghost of QCD. In this dark energy model, the energy density of dark energy is proportional to Hubble parameter and the proportional coefficient is of the order $\Lambda^3_{QCD}$, where $\Lambda_{QCD}$ is the mass scale of QCD. The universe has a de Sitter phase at late time and begins to accelerate at redshift around $z_{acc}\sim0.6$. We also fit this model and give the constraints on model parameters, with current observational data including SnIa, BAO, CMB, BBN and Hubble parameter data. We find that the squared sound speed of the dark energy is negative, which may cause an instability. We also study the cosmological evolution of the dark energy with interaction with cold dark matter.
