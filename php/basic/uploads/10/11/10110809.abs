Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of Extremal Kerr-Bolt Spacetimes
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: We show that extremal Kerr-Bolt spacetimes have a hidden conformal symmetry. In this regard, we consider the wave equation of a massless scalar field propagating in extremal Kerr-Bolt spacetimes and find in the "near region", the wave equation in extremal limit can be written in terms of the $SL(2,R)$ quadratic Casimir. Moreover, we obtain the microscopic entropy of the extremal Kerr-Bolt spacetimes also we calculate the correlation function of a near-region scalar field and find perfect agreement with the dual 2D CFT.
