Title: General inflaton potentials in supergravity
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Tomas Rube
Abstract: We describe a way to construct supergravity models with an arbitrary inflaton potential V ({\phi}) and show that all other scalar fields in this class of models can be stabilized at the inflationary trajectory by a proper choice of the K\"ahler potential.
