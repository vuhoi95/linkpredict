Authors: Amer Iqbal and Shaheen Nazir and Zahid Raza and Zain Saleem
Abstract: Nekrasov-Okounkov identity gives a product representation of the sum over partitions of a certain function of partition hook length. In this paper we give several generalizations of the Nekrasov-Okounkov identity using the cyclic symmetry of the topological vertex.
