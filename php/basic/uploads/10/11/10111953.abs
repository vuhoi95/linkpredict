Title: On tree amplitudes with gluons coupled to gravitons
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Yi-Jian Du and Bo Feng
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tree amplitudes with gluons coupled to gravitons. We first study the relations among the mixed amplitudes. With BCFW on-shell recursion relation, we will show the color-order reversed relation, $U(1)$-decoupling relation and KK relation hold for tree amplitudes with gluons coupled to gravitons. We then study the disk relation which expresses mixed amplitudes by pure gluon amplitudes. More specifically we will prove the disk relation for mixed amplitudes with gluons coupled to one graviton. Using the disk relation and the properties of pure gluon amplitudes, the color-order reversed relation, $U(1)$-decoupling relation and KK relation for mixed amplitudes can also be proved. Finally, we give some brief discussions on BCJ-like relation for mixed amplitudes.
