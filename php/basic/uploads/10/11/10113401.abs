Title: Introduction to supergeometry
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Florian Schaetz
Abstract: These notes are based on a series of lectures given by the first author at the school of `Poisson 2010', held at IMPA, Rio de Janeiro. They contain an exposition of the theory of super- and graded manifolds, cohomological vector fields, graded symplectic structures, reduction and the AKSZ-formalism.
