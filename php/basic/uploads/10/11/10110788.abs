Title: Supersymmetry restoration in lattice formulations of 2D  $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ WZ model based on the Nicolai map
Authors: Daisuke Kadoh and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: For lattice formulations of the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Wess--Zumino (2D $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ WZ) model on the basis of the Nicolai map, we show that supersymmetry (SUSY) and other symmetries are restored in the continuum limit without fine tuning, to all orders in perturbation theory. This provides a theoretical basis for use of these lattice formulations for computation of correlation functions.
