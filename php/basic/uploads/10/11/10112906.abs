Title: Chiral Symmetry Restoration in Holographic Noncommutative QCD
Authors: Tadahito Nakajima and Yukiko Ohtake and Kenji Suzuki
Abstract: We consider the noncommutative deformation of the Sakai--Sugimoto model at finite temperature and finite baryon chemical potential. The space noncommutativity is possible to have an influence on the flavor dynamics of the QCD. The critical temperature and critical value of the chemical potential are modified by the space noncommutativity. The influence of the space noncommutativity on the flavor dynamics of the QCD is caused by the Wess--Zumino term in the effective action of the D8-branes. The intermediate temperature phase, in which the gluons deconfine but the chiral symmetry remains broken, is easy to be realized in some region of the noncommutativity parameter.
