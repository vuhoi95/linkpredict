Title: On the factorization of overlapping singularities at NNLO
Authors: Charalampos Anastasiou and Franz Herzog and Achilleas Lazopoulos
Abstract: Real and virtual corrections in NNLO QCD require multi-dimensional integrals with overlapping singularities. We first review ideas and methods which have been proposed for performing such computations. We then present a new method for the factorization of overlapping singularities based on non-linear integral transformations. We apply this method for the evaluation of all integral topologies which appear in double real radiation corrections in cross-section calculations for the production of a heavy system at hadron colliders. Finally, we demonstrate with typical examples that two-loop virtual corrections are amenable to the same method.
