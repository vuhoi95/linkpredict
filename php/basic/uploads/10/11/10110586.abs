Title: Topological field theory and thermal responses of interacting  topological superconductors
Authors: Zhong Wang and Xiao-Liang Qi and Shou-Cheng Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional, time-reversal invariant topological superconductors with generic interaction by their response to external fields. The first description is a gravitational topological field theory, which gives a $Z_2$ classification of topological superconductors, and predicts a half-quantized thermal Hall effect on the surface. The second description introduces an s-wave proximity pairing field on the surface, and the associated topological defects give an integer $Z$ classification of the topological superconductors.
