Title: Breaking the $Z_2$ symmetry of the Randall-Sundrum scenario and the fate  of the massive modes
Authors: Alejandra Melfo and Nelson Pantoja and Freddy Ram√≠rez
Abstract: We address in detail the issue of possible resonances in the massive modes on a brane without reflection symmetry. After identifying a set of solvability conditions, we show explicitly how the modes of the asymmetric case can be traced back to the modes of the symmetric RS-2 scenario. The possible occurrence of resonances is revisited and discussed by finding analytical solutions. We find that the resonant behavior is very mild even for strong asymmetries, and moreover it occurs only for very large masses, so that its effects on the Newtonian potential are exponentially suppressed.
