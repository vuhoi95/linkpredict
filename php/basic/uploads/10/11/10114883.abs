Abstract: We present Monte Carlo results for the thermodynamics of pure SU(N) gauge theories with $N=2,...,6$ in 2+1 dimensions. We focus on the confined phase region $T<T_c$ and study thermodynamics variables such as the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, pressure, energy and entropy density using the integral method. We also investigate scaling properties with $N$ of the different observables. We compare our results with a gas of free glueballs and the bosonic string predictions for the Hagedorn spectrum.
