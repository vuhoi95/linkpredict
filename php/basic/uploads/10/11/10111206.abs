Title: Lorentz-preserving fields in Lorentz-violating theories
Authors: Oindrila Ganguly and Debashis Gangopadhyay and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: We identify a fairly general class of field configurations (of spins 0, 1/2 and 1) which preserve Lorentz invariance in effective field theories of Lorentz violation characterized by a constant timelike vector. These fields concomitantly satisfy the equations of motion yielding cubic dispersion relations similar to those found earlier. They appear to have prospective applications in inflationary scenarios.
