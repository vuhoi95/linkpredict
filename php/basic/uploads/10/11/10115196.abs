Title: The regular cosmic string in Born-Infeld gravity
Authors: Rafael Ferraro and Franco Fiorini
Abstract: It is shown that Born-Infeld gravity --a high energy deformation of Einstein gravity-- removes the singularities of a cosmic string. The respective vacuum solution results to be free of conical singularity and closed timelike curves. The space ends at a minimal circle where the curvature invariants vanish; but this circle cannot be reached in a finite proper time.
