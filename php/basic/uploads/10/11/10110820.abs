Title: Adiabaticity and emergence of classical space-time in time-dependent  matrix theories
Authors: Ben Craps and Oleg Evnin
Abstract: We discuss the low-curvature regime of time-dependent matrix theories proposed to describe non-perturbative quantum gravity in asymptotically plane-wave space-times. The emergence of near-classical space-time in this limit turns out to be closely linked to the adiabaticity of the matrix theory evolution. Supersymmetry restoration at low curvatures, which is crucial for the usual space-time interpretation of matrix theories, becomes an obvious feature of the adiabatic regime.
