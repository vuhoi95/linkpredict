Authors: M. Umar Farooq and M. Akbar and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: In this paper we study the relationship between the Einstein field equations for the (2+1)-dimensional evolving wormhole and the first law of thermodynamics. It has been shown that the Einstein field equations can be rewritten as a similar form of the first law of thermodynamics at the dynamical trapping horizon (as proposed by Hayward) for the dynamical spacetime which describes intrinsic thermal properties associated with the trapping horizon. For a particular choice of the shape and potential functions we are able to express field equations as a similar form of first law of thermodynamics $dE=-TdS+WdA$ at the trapping horizons. Here $E=\rho A$, $T=-\kappa /2\pi $, $S=4\pi \tilde{r}_{A}$, $W=(\rho -p)/2$%, and $A=\pi \tilde{r}_{A}^{2}$, are the total matter energy, horizon temperature, wormhole entropy, work density and volume of the evolving wormhole respectively.
