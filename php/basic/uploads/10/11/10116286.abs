Title: Representations of the Dirac wave function in a curved spacetime
Authors: Mayeul Arminjon and Frank Reifler
Abstract: The Dirac wave function in a curved spacetime is usually defined as a quadruplet of scalar fields. It can alternatively be defined as a four-vector field. We describe these two representations in a common geometrical framework and we prove theorems that relate together the different representations and the different choices of connections. In particular, the standard Dirac equation in a curved spacetime, with any choice of the tetrad field, is equivalent to a particular realization of the Dirac equation for a vector wave function, in the same spacetime.
