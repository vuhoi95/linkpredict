Title: The Bel-Robinson tensor for topologically massive gravity
Authors: S. Deser and J. Franklin
Abstract: We construct, and establish the (covariant) conservation of, a 4-index "super-stress tensor" for TMG. Separately, we discuss its invalidity in quadratic curvature models and suggest a generalization.
