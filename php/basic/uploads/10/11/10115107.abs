Title: Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Anomalous Charges
Authors: Yasha Neiman and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic regime of gauge theories with general triangle anomalies, where the participating currents may be global or gauged, abelian or non-abelian. We generalize the argument of arXiv:0906.5044, and construct at the viscous order the stress-energy tensor, the charge currents and the entropy current.
