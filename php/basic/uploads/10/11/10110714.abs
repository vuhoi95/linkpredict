Title: A geometric solution to the coincidence problem, and the size of the  landscape as the origin of hierarchy
Authors: Raphael Bousso and Ben Freivogel and Stefan Leichenauer and Vladimir Rosenhaus
Abstract: Without assuming necessary conditions for observers such as galaxies or entropy production, we show that the causal patch measure predicts the coincidence of vacuum energy and present matter density. Their common scale, and thus the enormous size of the visible universe, has its origin in the number of metastable vacua in the landscape.
