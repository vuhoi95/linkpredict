Title: Stochastic Analysis of an Accelerated Charged Particle -Transverse  Fluctuations-
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Yasuhiro Yamamoto and Sen Zhang
Abstract: An accelerated particle sees the Minkowski vacuum as thermally excited, and the particle moves stochastically due to an interaction with the thermal bath. This interaction fluctuates the particle's transverse momenta like the Brownian motion in a heat bath. Because of this fluctuating motion, it has been discussed that the accelerated charged particle emits extra radiation (the Unruh radiation) in addition to the classical Larmor radiation, and experiments are under planning to detect such radiation by using ultrahigh intensity lasers constructed in near future. There are, however, counterarguments that the radiation is canceled by an interference effect between the vacuum fluctuation and the fluctuating motion. In fact, in the case of an internal detector where the Heisenberg equation of motion can be solved exactly, there is no additional radiation after the thermalization is completed. In this paper, we revisit the issue in the case of an accelerated charged particle in the scalar-field analog of QED. We prove the equipartition theorem of transverse momenta by investigating a stochastic motion of the particle, and show that the Unruh radiation is partially canceled by an interference effect.
