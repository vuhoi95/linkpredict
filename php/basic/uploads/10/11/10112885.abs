Title: Non-archimedean quantum cosmology and tachyonic inflation
Authors: G. S. Djordjevic and Lj. Nesic
Abstract: We review the relevance of quantum rolling tachyons and corresponding inflation scenario in the frame of the standard, $p$-adic and adelic minisuperspace quantum cosmology. The field theory of tachyon matter proposed by Sen in a zero-dimensional version suggested by Kar leads to a model of a particle moving in a constant external field with quadratic damping. We calculate the exact quantum propagator of the model, as well as, the vacuum states and conditions necessary to construct an adelic generalization. In addition we present an overview on several important cosmological models on archimedean and nonarchimedean spaces.
