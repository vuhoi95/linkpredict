Abstract: We study intersecting extremal black attractors in non chiral 8D N=1 supergravity with moduli space ((SO(2,N))/(SO(2)\times SO(N)))\times SO(1,1) and work out explicitly the attractor mechanism for various black p-brane configurations with the typical near horizon geometries AdS_{p+2} \times S^{m} \times T^{6-p-m}. We also give the classification of the solutions of the attractor equations in terms of the SO(N-k) subgroups of SO(2)\times SO(N) symmetry of the moduli space as well as their interpretations in terms of both heterotic string on 2-torus and its type IIA dual. Other features such as non trivial SO(1,7) central charges Z_{{\mu}_1...{\mu}_{p}} in 8D N=1 supergravity and their connections to p-form gauge fields are also given.
