Abstract: We study the scaling behavior in the tunneling amplitude when quasiparticles tunnel along a straight path between the two edges of a fractional quantum Hall annulus. Such scaling behavior originates from the propagation and tunneling of charged quasielectrons and quasiholes in an effective field analysis. In the limit when the annulus deforms continuously into a quasi-one-dimensional ring, we conjecture the exact functional form of the tunneling amplitude for several cases, which reproduces the numerical results in finite systems exactly. The results for Abelian quasiparticle tunneling is consistent with the scaling anaysis; this allows for the extraction of the conformal dimensions of the quasiparticles. We analyze the scaling behavior of both Abelian and non-Abelian quasiparticles in the Read-Rezayi Z_k-parafermion states. Interestingly, the non-Abelian quasiparticle tunneling amplitudes exhibit nontrivial k-dependent corrections to the scaling exponent.
