Title: Thermodynamics of Slowly Rotating Charged Black Holes in anti-de Sitter  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: De-Cheng Zou and Zhan-Ying Yang and Rui-Hong Yue
Abstract: By using a new approach, we demonstrate analytic expressions for slowly rotating Gauss-Bonnet charged black holes with negative cosmological constant. Up to the linear order of the rotating parameter a, the mass, Hawking temperature and entropy of the charged black holes get no corrections from rotation.
