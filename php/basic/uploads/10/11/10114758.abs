Title: Twisting adjoint module algebras
Authors: Petr Kulish and Andrey Mudrov
Abstract: Transformation of operator algebras under Hopf algebra twist is studied. It is shown that that adjoint module algebras are stable under the twist. Applications to vector fields on non-commutative space-time are considered.
