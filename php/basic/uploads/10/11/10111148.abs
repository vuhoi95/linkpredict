Title: A nonperturbative model for the strong running coupling within potential  approach
Authors: Yu. O. Belyakova and A. V. Nesterenko
Abstract: A nonperturbative model for the QCD invariant charge, which contains no low-energy unphysical singularities and possesses an elevated higher loop corrections stability, is developed in the framework of potential approach. The static quark-antiquark potential is constructed by making use of the proposed model for the strong running coupling. The obtained result coincides with the perturbative potential at small distances and agrees with relevant lattice simulation data in the nonperturbative physically-relevant region. The developed model yields a reasonable value of the QCD scale parameter, which is consistent with its previous estimations obtained within potential approach.
