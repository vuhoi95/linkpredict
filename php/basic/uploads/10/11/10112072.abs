Title: Yang-Baxter operators from (G, Î¸)-Lie algebras
Authors: Florin F. Nichita and Bogdan P. Popovici
Abstract: The (G, \theta)-Lie algebras are structures which unify the Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras. We use them to produce solutions for the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. The constant and the spectral-parameter Yang-Baxter equations and Yang-Baxter systems are also studied.
