Title: Heterotic Non-Kahler Geometries via Polystable Bundles on Calabi-Yau  Threefolds
Authors: Bjorn Andreas and Mario Garcia-Fernandez
Abstract: In arXiv:1008.1018 it is shown that a given stable vector bundle $V$ on a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ which satisfies $c_2(X)=c_2(V)$ can be deformed to a solution of the Strominger system and the equations of motion of heterotic string theory. In this note we extend this result to the polystable case and construct explicit examples of polystable bundles on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds where it applies. The polystable bundle is given by a spectral cover bundle, for the visible sector, and a suitably chosen bundle, for the hidden sector. This provides a new class of heterotic flux compactifications via non-Kahler deformation of Calabi-Yau geometries with polystable bundles. As an application, we obtain examples of non-Kahler deformations of some three generation GUT models.
