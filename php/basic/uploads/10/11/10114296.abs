Title: Generalized Geometry in AdS/CFT and Volume Minimization
Authors: Maxime Gabella and James Sparks
Abstract: We study the general structure of the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence in type IIB string theory from the perspective of generalized geometry. We begin by defining a notion of "generalized Sasakian geometry," which consists of a contact structure together with a differential system for three symplectic forms on the four-dimensional transverse space to the Reeb vector field. A generalized Sasakian manifold which satisfies an additional "Einstein" condition provides a general supersymmetric AdS_5 solution of type IIB supergravity with fluxes. We then show that the supergravity action restricted to a space of generalized Sasakian structures is simply the contact volume, and that its minimization determines the Reeb vector field for such a solution. We conjecture that this contact volume is equal to the inverse of the trial central charge whose maximization determines the R-symmetry of any four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theory. This variational procedure allows us to compute the contact volumes for a predicted infinite family of solutions, and we find perfect agreement with the central charges and R-charges of BPS operators in the dual mass-deformed generalized conifold theories.
