Title: External field influence on semiflexible macromolecules: geometric  coupling
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Yevgeny Mamasakhlisov and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We suggested a geometric approach to address the external field influence on the DNA molecules, described by the WLC model via geometric coupling. It consists in the introduction of the effective metrics depending on the potential of the external field, with further re-definition of the arc-length parameter and of the extrinsic curvatures of the DNA molecules. It yields the nontrivial impact of the external field in the internal energy of macromolecules. We give the Hamiltonian formulation of this model and perform its preliminary analysis in the redefinition of the initial energy density.
