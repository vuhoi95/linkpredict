Title: Non-Gaussianities in Multifield Inflation: Superhorizon Evolution,  Adiabaticity, and the Fate of fnl
Authors: Joel Meyers and Navin Sivanandam
Abstract: We explore the superhorizon generation of large fnl of the local form in two field inflation. We calculate the two- and three-point observables in a general class of potentials which allow for an analytic treatment using the delta N formalism. Motivated by the conservation of the curvature perturbation outside the horizon in the adiabatic mode and also by the observed adiabaticity of the power spectrum, we follow the evolution of fnl^{local} until it is driven into the adibatic solution by passing through a phase of effectively single field inflation. We find that although large fnl^{local} may be generated during inflation, such non-gaussianities are transitory and will be exponentially damped as the cosmological fluctuations approach adiabaticity.
