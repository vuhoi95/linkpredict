Title: Spatial scalar correlator in strongly coupled hot N=4 Yang-Mills theory
Authors: K. Kajantie and M. Vepsalainen
Abstract: We use AdS/CFT duality to compute in N=4 Yang-Mills theory the finite temperature spatial correlator G(r) of the scalar operator F^2, integrated over imaginary time. The computation is carried out both at zero frequency and integrating the spectral function over frequencies. The result is compared with a perturbative computation in finite T SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory.
