Title: Drinfeld twists of the open XXZ chain with non-diagonal boundary terms
Authors: Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: The Drinfeld twists or factorizing F-matrices for the open XXZ spin chain with non-diagonal boundary terms are constructed. It is shown that in the F-basis the two sets of pseudo-particle creation operators simultaneously take completely symmetric and polarization free form. The explicit and completely symmetric expressions of the two sets of Bethe states of the model are obtained.
