Title: Fundamental physics and cosmology with LISA
Authors: Stanislav Babak and Jonathan R. Gair and Antoine Petiteau and Alberto Sesana
Abstract: In this article we give a brief review of the fundamental physics that can be done with the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. This includes detection of gravitational wave bursts coming from cosmic strings, measuring a stochastic gravitational wave background, mapping spacetime around massive compact objects in galactic nuclei with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and testing the predictions of General Relativity for the strong dynamical fields of inspiralling binaries. We give particular attention to new results which show the capability of LISA to constrain cosmological parameters using observations of coalescing massive Black Hole binaries.
