Title: Toward Supergravity Spectral Action
Authors: J. L. López and O. Obregón and M. P. Ryan and M. Sabido
Abstract: A spectral action of Euclidean supergravity is proposed. We calculate up to $a_4$, the Seeley-Dewitt coefficients in the expansion of the spectral action associated to the supergravity Dirac operator. This is possible because in simple supergravity, as in pure gravity, a well defined and mathematically consistent Dirac operator can be constructed.
