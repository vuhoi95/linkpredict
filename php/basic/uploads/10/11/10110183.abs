Title: Massive Gravity: Exorcising the Ghost
Authors: Lasma Alberte and Ali H. Chamseddine and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: We consider Higgs massive gravity [1,2] and investigate whether a nonlinear ghost in this theory can be avoided. We show that although the theory considered in [10,11] is ghost free in the decoupling limit, the ghost nevertheless reappears in the fourth order away from the decoupling limit. We also demonstrate that there is no direct relation between the value of the Vainshtein scale and the existence of nonlinear ghost. We discuss how massive gravity should be modified to avoid the appearance of the ghost.
