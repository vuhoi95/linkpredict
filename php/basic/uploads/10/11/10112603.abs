Authors: N. Iorgov and V. Shadura and Yu. Tykhyy
Abstract: Using some modification of the standard fermion technique we derive factorized formula for spin operator matrix elements (form-factors) between general eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of quantum Ising chain in a transverse field of finite length. The derivation is based on the approach recently used to derive factorized formula for Z_N-spin operator matrix elements between ground eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of the Z_N-symmetric superintegrable chiral Potts quantum chain. The obtained factorized formulas for the matrix elements of Ising chain coincide with the corresponding expressions obtained by the Separation of Variables Method.
