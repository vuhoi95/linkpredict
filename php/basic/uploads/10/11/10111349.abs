Title: An upper bound on the total inelastic cross-section as a function of the  total cross-section
Authors: Tai Tsun Wu and Andr√© Martin and Shasanka Mohan Roy and Virendra Singh
Abstract: Recently Andr\'e Martin has proved a rigorous upper bound on the inelastic cross-section $\sigma_{inel}$ at high energy which is one-fourth of the known Froissart-Martin-Lukaszuk upper bound on $\sigma_{tot}$. Here we obtain an upper bound on $\sigma_{inel}$ in terms of $\sigma_{tot}$ and show that the Martin bound on $\sigma_{inel}$ is improved significantly with this added information.
