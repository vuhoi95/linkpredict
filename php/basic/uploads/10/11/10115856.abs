Title: Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking and String Theory
Authors: S. P. de Alwis and Z. Lalak
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of finding scenarios, within type IIB string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with fluxes, for realizing gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking. We find that while in principle such scenarios are not ruled out, in practice it is hard to get acceptable constructions, since typically, supersymmetry breaking cannot be separated from the stabilization of the light modulus.
