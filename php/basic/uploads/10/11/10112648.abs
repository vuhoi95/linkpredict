Title: Dirac method and symplectic submanifolds in the cotangent bundle of a  factorizable Lie group
Authors: S. Capriotti and H. Montani
Abstract: In this work we study some symplectic submanifolds in the cotangent bundle of a factorizable Lie group defined by second class constraints. By applying the Dirac method, we study many issues of these spaces as fundamental Dirac brackets, symmetries, and collective dynamics. This last item allows to study integrability as inherited from a system on the whole cotangent bundle, leading in a natural way to the AKS theory for integrable systems.
