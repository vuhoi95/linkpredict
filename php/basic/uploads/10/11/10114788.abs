Title: A dark energy model alternative to generalized Chaplygin gas
Authors: Hoavo Hova and Huanxiong Yang
Abstract: We propose a new fluid model of dark energy for $-1 \leq \omega_{\text{eff}} \leq 0$ as an alternative to the generalized Chaplygin gas models. The energy density of dark energy fluid is severely suppressed during barotropic matter dominant epochs, and it dominates the universe evolution only for eras of small redshift. From the perspective of fundamental physics, the fluid is a tachyon field with a scalar potential flatter than that of power-law decelerated expansion. Different from the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model, the suggested dark energy model claims that the cosmic acceleration at present epoch can not continue forever but will cease in the near future and a decelerated cosmic expansion will recover afterwards.
