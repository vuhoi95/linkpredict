Title: A Study on Charged Neutron Star in $AdS_5$
Authors: Vincenzo Parente and Raju Roychowdhury
Abstract: Motivated by an open question raised in recent times regarding the phase transition during the collapse of a neutron star to form a black hole and related stability issues, we have constructed charged neutron stars in $AdS_5$ and show that these stars become unstable at a particular value of their radius, regarded as the Chandrasekhar radius. We reproduced the calculations recently done in [20] in our $AdS_5$ charged star. The analysis shows that the non-Fermi liquid behavior found there in $AdS_4$ is still true in this higher dimensional case with the presence of Kosevich-Lifshitz oscillations.
