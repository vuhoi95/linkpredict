Title: The Backreaction of Anti-M2 Branes on a Warped Stenzel Space
Authors: Iosif Bena and Gregory Giecold and Nick Halmagyi
Abstract: We find the superpotential governing the supersymmetric warped M-theory solution with a transverse Stenzel space found by Cvetic, Gibbons, Lu and Pope in hep-th/0012011, and use this superpotential to extract and solve the twelve coupled equations underlying the first-order backreacted solution of a stack of anti-M2 branes in this space. These anti-M2 branes were analyzed recently in a probe approximation by Klebanov and Pufu, who conjectured that they should be dual to a metastable vacuum of a supersymmetric 2+1 dimensional theory. We find that the would-be supergravity dual to such a metastable vacuum must have an infrared singularity and discuss whether this singularity is acceptable or not. Given that a similar singularity appears when placing anti-D3 branes in the Klebanov-Strassler solution, our work strengthens the possibility that anti-branes in warped throats do not give rise to metastable vacua.
