Title: Operator algebra quantum groups of universal gauge groups
Authors: Snigdhayan Mahanta and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: In this paper, we quantize universal gauge groups such as SU(\infty), in the sigma-C*-algebra setting. More precisely, we propose a concise definition of sigma-C*-quantum groups and explain the concept here. At the same time, we put this definition in the mathematical context of countably compactly generated groups as well as C*-compact quantum groups.
