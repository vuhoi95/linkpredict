Title: Holographic dual of free field theory
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Luca Mazzucato and Shlomo S. Razamat
Abstract: We derive a holographic dual description of free quantum field theory in arbitrary dimensions, by reinterpreting the exact renormalization group, to obtain a higher spin gravity theory of the general type which had been proposed and studied as a dual theory. We show that the dual theory reproduces all correlation functions.
