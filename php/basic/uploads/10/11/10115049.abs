Title: The Quantum 3D Superparticle
Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The minimal (${\cal N}=1$) superparticle in three spacetime dimensions (3D) is quantized. For non-zero mass it describes a spin-1/4 semion supermultiplet of "relativistic helicities" (-1/4, 1/4). The addition of a parity-violating Lorentz-Wess-Zumino term shifts this to $(\beta-1/4,\beta+1/4)$ for arbitrary $\beta$. For zero mass, in which case spin is not defined, the quantum superparticle describes a supermultiplet of one boson and one fermion.
