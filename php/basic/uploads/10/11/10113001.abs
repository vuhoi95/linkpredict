Title: Quark mass dependence of the vacuum electric conductivity induced by the  magnetic field in SU(2) lattice gluodynamics
Authors: P. V. Buividovich and M. I. Polikarpov
Abstract: We study the electric conductivity of the vacuum of quenched SU(2) lattice gauge theory induced by the magnetic field B as a function of the bare quark mass m. The conductivity grows as the quark mass decreases. Simplest power-like fit indicates that the conductivity behaves as B/sqrt(m). We discuss the implications of this result for dilepton angular distributions in heavy ion collisions.
