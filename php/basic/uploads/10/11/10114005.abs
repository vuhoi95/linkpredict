Title: Beyond cusp anomalous dimension from integrability in SYM$_4$
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Paolo Grinza and Marco Rossi
Abstract: We study the first sub-leading correction $O((\ln s)^0)$ to the cusp anomalous dimension in the high spin expansion of finite twist operators in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory. This term is still governed by a linear integral equation which we study in the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the strong coupling regime we find agreement with the string theory computations
