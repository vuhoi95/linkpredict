Title: Augmented Recursion For One-loop Amplitudes
Authors: David C. Dunbar and James H. Ettle and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We present a semi-recursive method for calculating the rational parts of one-loop amplitudes when recursion produces double poles. We illustrate this with the graviton scattering amplitude M^{1-loop}(1-, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+).
