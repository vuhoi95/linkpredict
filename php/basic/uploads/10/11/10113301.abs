Title: Voros product and the Pauli principle at low energies
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Anirban Saha and Frederik. G. Scholtz
Abstract: Using the Voros star product, we investigate the status of the two particle correlation function to study the possible extent to which the previously proposed violation of the Pauli principle may impact at low energies. The results show interesting features which are not present in the computations made using the Moyal star product.
