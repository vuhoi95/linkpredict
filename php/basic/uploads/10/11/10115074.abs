Title: Eikonal equation of the Lorentz-violating Maxwell theory
Authors: Zhi Xiao and Lijing Shao and Bo-Qiang Ma
Abstract: We derive the eikonal equation of light wavefront in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) from the photon sector of the standard model extension (SME). The results obtained from the equations of $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields respectively are the same. This guarantees the self-consistency of our derivation. We adopt a simple case with only one non-zero LIV parameter as an illustration, from which we find two points. One is that, in analogy with Hamilton-Jacobi equation, from the eikonal equation, we can derive dispersion relations which are compatible with results obtained from other approaches. The other is that, the wavefront velocity is the same as the group velocity, as well as the energy flow velocity. If further we define the signal velocity $v_s$ as the front velocity, there always exists a mode with $v_s>1$, hence causality is violated classically. Thus our method might be useful in the analysis of Lorentz violation in QED in terms of classical causality .
