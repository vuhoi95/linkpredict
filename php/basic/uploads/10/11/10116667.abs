Title: On Solutions to the "Faddeev-Niemi" Equations
Authors: Antti J. Niemi and Andrzej Wereszczynski
Abstract: Recently it has been pointed out that the "Faddeev-Niemi" equations that correspond to the Yang-Mills equations of motion for a decomposed gauge field, can have solutions that obey the standard Yang-Mills equations with a source term. Here we present a general class of such gauge field configurations.
