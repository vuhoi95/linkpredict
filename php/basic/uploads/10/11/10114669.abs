Title: On semiclassical calculation of three-point functions in AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Recently there has been progress on the computation of two- and three-point correlation functions with two "heavy" states via semiclassical methods. We extend this analysis to the case of AdS_4 x CP^3, and examine the suggested procedure for the case of several simple string solutions. By making use of AdS/CFT duality, we derive the relevant correlation functions of operators belonging to the dual N=6 Chern-Simons gauge theory.
