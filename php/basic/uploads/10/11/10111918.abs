Title: On the critical condition in gravitational shock wave collision and  heavy ion collisions
Authors: Shu Lin and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: In this paper, we derived a critical condition for matter equilibration in heavy ion collisions using a holographic approach. A gravitational shock waves with infinite transverse extension is used to model infinite nucleus. We constructed the trapped surface in the collision of two asymmetric planar shock waves with sources at different depth in the bulk AdS and formulated a critical condition for matter equilibration in collision of "nucleus" in the dual gauge theory. We found the critical condition is insensitive to the depth of the source closer to the AdS boundary. To understand the origin of the critical condition, we computed the Next to Leading Order stress tensor in the boundary field theory due to the interaction of the nucleus and found the critical condition corresponds to the breaking down of the perturbative expansion. We indeed expect non-perturbative effects be needed to describe black hole formation.
