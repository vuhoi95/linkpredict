Title: Yangian symmetry of light-like Wilson loops
Authors: J. M. Drummond and L. Ferro and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We show that a certain class of light-like Wilson loops exhibits a Yangian symmetry at one loop, or equivalently, in an Abelian theory. The Wilson loops we discuss are equivalent to one-loop MHV amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in a certain kinematical regime. The fact that we find a Yangian symmetry constraining their functional form can be thought of as the effect of the original conformal symmetry associated to the scattering amplitudes in the N=4 theory.
