Title: D1-brane in Constant R-R 3-form Flux and Nambu Dynamics in String Theory
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho
Abstract: We consider D1-string in a constant R-R 3-form flux background and analyze its low energy limit. The leading order low energy theory has reparametrization symmetry and is a generalization of an earlier work by Takhtajan. We show that the dynamical evolution of the theory takes a generalized Hamiltonian form in terms of a Nambu bracket. This description is formulated in terms of reparametrization invariant quantities and requires no fixing of the reparametrization symmetry. We also show that a Nambu- Poisson (p + 2)-bracket arises naturally in the reparametrization invariant description of the low energy theory of a p-brane in a constant (p + 2)-form flux background. For example, our results apply for a fundamental string in a constant NS-NS 3-form flux H3 and an M2-brane in a constant 4-form flux F4.
