Title: Charged fermions tunneling from accelerating and rotating black holes
Authors: Mudassar Rehman and K. Saifullah
Abstract: We study Hawking radiation of charged fermions from accelerating and rotation black holes with electric and magnetic charges. We calculate the tunneling probabilities of incoming and outgoing fermionic particles and find the Hawking temperature of these black holes. We also provide an explicit expression of the classical action for the massive and massless particles in the background of these black holes.
