Title: Quantum Back-Reaction in Scale Invariant Induced Gravity Inflation
Authors: A. Tronconi and G. Venturi
Abstract: A quartic, self-interacting potential in the induced gravity framework is known to have a pure de Sitter attractor for the homogeneous mode. In order to obtain non-zero slow roll parameters we therefore study the quantum back-reaction of the scalar and the tensor perturbations on such a homogeneous dynamics. The results are then compared with inflationary observables in order to constrain the parameters of the model.
