Title: On Type IIA geometries dual to N = 2 SCFTs
Authors: R. A. Reid-Edwards and B. Stefanski jr
Abstract: We provide explicit solutions of Type IIA supergravity which are believed to be dual to N = 2 superconformal four dimensional gauge theories. These explicit solutions are based on the general ansatz for such a type of backgrounds introduced by Gaiotto and Maldacena.
