Authors: M. A. Bershtein and V. A. Fateev and A. V. Litvinov
Abstract: In this paper we consider parafermionic Liouville field theory. We study integral representations of three-point correlation functions and develop a method allowing us to compute them exactly. In particular, we evaluate the generalization of Selberg integral obtained by insertion of parafermionic polynomial. Our result is justified by different approach based on dual representation of parafermionic Liouville field theory described by three-exponential model.
