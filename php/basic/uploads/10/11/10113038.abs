Title: Perturbation Theory on the Non-Commutative Plane with a Singular  Potential
Authors: M. Nieto and P. A. G. Pisani and H. Falomir
Abstract: In this article we study the problem of a non-relativistic particle in the presence of a singular potential in the noncommutative plane. The potential contains a term proportional to $1/R^2$, where $R^2$ is the squared distance to the origin in the noncommutative plane. We find that the spectrum of energies is non analytic in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$.
