Title: P-Wave Holographic Insulator/Superconductor Phase Transition
Authors: Amin Akhavan and Mohsen Alishahiha
Abstract: Using a five dimensional AdS soliton in an Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge group we study p-wave holographic insulator/superconductor phase transition. To explore the phase structure of the model we consider the system in the probe limit as well as fully back reacted solutions. We will also study zero temperature limit of the p-wave holographic superconductor in four dimensions.
