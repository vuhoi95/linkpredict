Abstract: We describe a concise general scheme for constructing solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond gravity-matter system in bulk space-time interacting self-consistently with one or more (widely separated) codimension-one electrically charged lightlike branes. The lightlike brane dynamics is explicitly given by manifestly reparametrization invariant world-volume actions. We present several explicit classes of solutions with different physical interpretation as wormhole-like space-times with one, two or more "throats", singularity-free black holes, brane worlds and space-times undergoing a sequence of spontaneous compactification-decompactification transitions.
