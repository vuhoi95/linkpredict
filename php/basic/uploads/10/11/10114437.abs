Title: A consequence of the repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz force on nano-scale and  the related Wheeler propagator in the classical electrodynamics
Authors: Ferenc Markus and Mario Rocca and Katalin Gambar
Abstract: Mainly on nano-scale, but maybe not exclusively, it can be imagined a spontaneous charge disjunction inside certain media due to the fluctuations, collisions, wall effects, radiation or/and other presently unknown interactions. The repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz force may be also a good candidate as a source of this kind of phenomenon. To cover this assumption mathematically an additional term should appear in the Maxwell equations. As a consequence of this term, similar Klein-Gordon equations with a negative mass term will be obtained for the electric and magnetic fields. These equations may have tachyonic solutions depending on the parameter of the charge disjunction process. Finally, the propagator is formulated, the electric field and the charge density are calculated during the charge disjunction.
