Title: Addendum: Behavior of a bipartite system in a cavity
Authors: C. A. Linhares and A. P. C. Malbouisson and J. M. C. Malbouisson
Abstract: This note is an Addendum to our previous article [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{81}, 053820 (2010)]. We show that under the assumption of a Bose-Einstein distribution for the thermal reservoir, zero-temperature properties of the entangled states considered there are not changed by heating, for temperatures up to the order of room temperatures. In this case, the system is dissipative in free space and presents stability for a small cavity, both for T=0 and for finite temperature.
