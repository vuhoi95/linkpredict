Title: Holographic Q-Picture of Black Holes in Five Dimensional Minimal  Supergravity
Authors: C. -M. Chen and V. Kamali and M. R. Setare
Abstract: In this article, we explore the holographic Q-picture description for the charged rotating black holes in the five-dimensional minimal supergravity. The central charge in the Q-picture depends only on black hole charge, therefore can be computed from the near horizon geometry of the extremal and non-rotating counterpart. Moreover, the CFT temperatures can be identified by studying the hidden conformal symmetry, and the related gravity-CFT dictionary can be translated via thermodynamics analysis. The entropy and absorption cross section computed from both gravity and CFT sides properly agree with each other.
