Title: Fine structure of the Poynting-Robertson effect for a luminous spinning  relativistic star
Authors: Jae Sok Oh and Hongsu Kim and Hyung Mok Lee
Abstract: As a sequel to our recent works challenging toward the systematic inclusion of the effect of radiation on the trajectory of a test particle orbiting around a luminous spinning relativistic star eventually aiming at its application to the accretion flow. We explore in the present work the fine structure of the trajectory of test particle just entering the ``suspension orbit" under the purpose of a detailed investigation of test particle's trajectory in the vicinity of the ``suspension orbit". We end up with a rather puzzling behavior that, contrary to our expectation, the specific angular momentum of the test particle instantly rises instead of decreasing monotonically just before the test particle enters the ``suspension orbit".
