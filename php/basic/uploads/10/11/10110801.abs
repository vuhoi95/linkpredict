Title: The curvaton scenario in Brane cosmology: model parameters and their  constraints
Authors: H. Farajollahi and A. Ravanpak
Abstract: We have studied the curvaton scenario in brane world cosmology in an intermediate inflationary scenario. This approach has allowed us to find some constraints on different parameters that appear in the model.
