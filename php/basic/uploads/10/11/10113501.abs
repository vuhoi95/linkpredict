Title: Dark Radiation Emerging After Big Bang Nucleosynthesis?
Authors: Willy Fischler and Joel Meyers
Abstract: We show how recent data from observations of the cosmic microwave background may suggest the presence of additional radiation density which appeared after big bang nucleosynthesis. We propose a general scheme by which this radiation could be produced from the decay of non-relativistic matter, we place constraints on the properties of such matter, and we give specific examples of scenarios in which this general scheme may be realized.
