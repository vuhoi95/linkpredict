Title: Scalar Field Reconstruction of Power-Law Entropy-Corrected HDE
Authors: Esmaeil Ebrahimi and Ahmad Sheykhi
Abstract: A so called "power-law entropy-corrected holographic dark energy" (PLECHDE) was recently proposed to explain the dark energy dominated universe. This model is based on the power-law corrections to black hole entropy which appear in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields between inside and outside of the horizon. In this paper, we suggest a correspondence between interacting PLECHDE and tachyon, quintessence, K-essence and dilaton scalar field models of dark energy in a non-flat FRW universe. Then, we reconstruct the potential terms accordingly, and present the dynamical equations which describe the evolution of the scalar field dark energy models.
