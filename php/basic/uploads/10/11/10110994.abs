Title: Six Open String Disk Amplitude in Pure Spinor Superspace
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Oliver Schlotterer and Stephan Stieberger and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: The tree-level amplitude of six massless open strings is computed using the pure spinor formalism. The OPE poles among integrated and unintegrated vertices can be efficiently organized according to the cohomology of pure spinor superspace. The identification and use of these BRST structures and their interplay with the system of equations fulfilled by the generalized Euler integrals allow the full supersymmetric six-point amplitude to be written in compact form. Furthermore, the complete set of extended Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations are derived from the monodromy properties of the disk world-sheet and explicitly verified for the supersymmetric numerator factors.
