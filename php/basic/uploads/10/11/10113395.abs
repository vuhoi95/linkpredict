Title: Observational constraints on Chaplygin cosmology in a braneworld  scenario with induced gravity and curvature effect
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and T. Azizi and N. Alipour
Abstract: We study cosmological dynamics and late-time evolution of an extended induced gravity braneworld scenario. In this scenario, curvature effects are taken into account via the Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action and there is also a Chaplygin gas component on the brane. We show that this model mimics an effective phantom behavior in a relatively wider range of redshifts than previously formulated models. It also provides a natural framework for smooth crossing of the phantom-divide line due to presence of the Chaplygin gas component on the brane. We confront the model with observational data from type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to constraint the model parameters space.
