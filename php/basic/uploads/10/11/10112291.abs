Title: The effect of higher derivative correction on $Î·/s$ and  conductivities in STU model
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan and A. R. Amani
Abstract: In this paper we study the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy, electrical and thermal conductivities for the R-charged black hole in STU model. We generalize previous works to the case of a black hole with three different charges. Actually we use diffusion constant to obtain ratio of shear viscosity to entropy. By applying the thermodynamical stability we recover previous results. Also we investigate the effect of higher derivative corrections.
