Title: Matrix Model and Refined Wall-Crossing Formula
Authors: Haitao Liu and Jie Yang and Jian Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, we show how to get matrix models corresponding to the refined BPS states partition functions of $\mathbb{C}^3$, resolved conifold and $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_2$ by inserting the identity operator at a proper position in the fermionic expression of the refined BPS states partition functions.
