Title: 5D supersymmetric domain wall solution with active hyperscalars and  mixed AdS/non-AdS asymptotics
Authors: Jorge Bellor√≠n and Claudia Colonnello
Abstract: We find a new supersymmetric 5D solution of N = 2 supergravity coupled to one hypermultiplet that depends only on the fifth dimension (the energy scale in a holographic context). In one asymptotic limit the domain wall approaches to the AdS_5 form but in the other one does not. Similarly, the hyperscalars, which are all proportional between them, go asymptotically to a critical point of the potential only in one direction. The quaternionic Kahler manifold of the model is the H^4 hyperboloid. We use the standard metric of H^4 in an explicit conformally flat form with several arbitrary parameters. We argue that the holographic dual of the domain wall is a RG flow of an D = 4, N = 1 gauge theory acquiring a conformal supersymmetry at the IR limit, which correspond to the AdS_5 asymptotic limit.
