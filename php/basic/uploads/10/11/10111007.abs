Title: Counting Majorana zero modes in superconductors
Authors: Luiz Santos and Yusuke Nishida and Claudio Chamon and Christopher Mudry
Abstract: A counting formula for computing the number of (Majorana) zero modes bound to topological point defects is evaluated in a gradient expansion for systems with charge-conjugation symmetry. This semi-classical counting of zero modes is applied to some examples that include graphene and a chiral p-wave superconductor in two-dimensional space. In all cases, we explicitly relate the counting of zero modes to Chern numbers.
