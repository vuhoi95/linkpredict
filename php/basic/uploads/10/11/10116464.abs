Title: Black holes on gravitational instantons
Authors: Yu Chen and Edward Teo
Abstract: In this paper, we classify and construct five-dimensional black holes on gravitational instantons in vacuum Einstein gravity, with RxU(1)xU(1) isometry. These black holes have spatial backgrounds which are Ricci-flat gravitational instantons with U(1)xU(1) isometry, and are completely regular space-times outside the event horizon. Most of the known exact five-dimensional vacuum black-hole solutions can be classified within this scheme. Amongst the new space-times presented are static black holes on the Euclidean Kerr and Taub-bolt instantons. We also present a rotating black hole on the Eguchi-Hanson instanton.
