Title: Holography and colliding gravitational shock waves in asymptotically  AdS_5 spacetime
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Using holography, we study the collision of planar shock waves in strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. This requires the numerical solution of a dual gravitational initial value problem in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime.
