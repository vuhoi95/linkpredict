Title: Open M2-branes with Flux and Modified Basu-Harvey Equation
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Gurdeep S. Sehmbi
Abstract: The supersymmetric actions of closed multiple M2 branes with flux for the BL and the ABJM theories have been constructed recently by Lambert and Richmond in \cite{LR}. In this paper we extend the construction to the case of open M2-branes with flux and derive the boundary conditions. This allows us to derive the modified Basu-Harvey equation in the presence of flux. As an example, we consider the Lorentzian BL model. A new feature of the fuzzy funnel solution describing a D2-D4 intersection is obtained as a result of the flux.
