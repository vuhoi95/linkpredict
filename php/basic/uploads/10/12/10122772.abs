Title: Note on I-brane Near Horizon PP-wave Background
Authors: Rashmi R. Nayak and Pratap K. Swain
Abstract: We find out a PP-wave spacetime with constant Neveu-Schwarz (NS) three form flux by taking a Penrose limit on the 1+1 dimensional intersection of two orthogonal stacks of fivebranes in type IIB string theory. We further find out an intersecting (D1-D5)-brane solution in this background and analyze its supersymmetry properties by solving the dilatino and gravitino variations explicitly.
