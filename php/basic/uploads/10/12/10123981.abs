Title: A recursive method for SYM n-point tree amplitudes
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Oliver Schlotterer and Stephan Stieberger and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We present a recursive method for super Yang-Mills color-ordered n-point tree amplitudes based on the cohomology of pure spinor superspace in ten space-time dimensions. The amplitudes are organized into BRST covariant building blocks with diagrammatic interpretation. Manifestly cyclic expressions (no longer than one line each) are explicitly given up to n=10 and higher leg generalizations are straightforward.
