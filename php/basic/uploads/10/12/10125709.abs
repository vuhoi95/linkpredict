Title: Hawking temperature for constant curvature black bole and its analogue  in de Sitter space
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: The constant curvature (CC) black holes are higher dimensional generalizations of BTZ black holes. It is known that these black holes have the unusual topology of ${\cal M}_{D-1}\times S^1$, where $D$ is the spacetime dimension and ${\cal M}_{D-1}$ stands for a conformal Minkowski spacetime in $D-1$ dimensions. The unusual topology and time-dependence for the exterior of these black holes cause some difficulties to derive their thermodynamic quantities. In this work, by using globally embedding approach, we obtain the Hawking temperature of the CC black holes. We find that the Hawking temperature takes the same form when using both the static an global coordinates. Also it is identical to the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the boundary de Sitter spaces of these CC black holes. Employing the same approach, we obtain the Hawking temperature for the counterparts of CC black holes in de Sitter spaces.
