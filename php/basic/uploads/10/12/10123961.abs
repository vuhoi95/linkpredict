Title: On Effective Action of Multiple M5-branes and ABJM Action
Authors: Seiji Terashima and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: We calculate the fluctuations from the classical multiple M5-brane solution of ABJM action which we found in the previous paper. We obtain D4-brane-like action but the gauge coupling constant depends on the spacetime coordinate. This is consistent with the expected properties of M5-brane action, although we will need to take into account the monopole operators in order to fully understand M5-branes. We also see that the Nambu-Poisson bracket is hidden in the solution.
