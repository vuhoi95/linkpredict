Title: Induced gauge interactions revisited
Authors: Bogusław Broda and Michał Szanecki
Abstract: It has been shown that the old-fashioned idea of Sakharov's induced gravity and gauge interactions in the "one-loop dominance" version works astonishingly well yielding reasonable parameters. It appears that induced coupling constants of gauge interactions of the standard model assume qualitatively realistic values. Moreover, it is possible to induce the Barbero--Immirzi parameter of canonical gravity from the fields entering the standard model.
