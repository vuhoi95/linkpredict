Title: A note on the 3D Brans-Dicke theory
Authors: T. G. do Prado and V. S. Mendes and M. C. Verges
Abstract: Since the evidence for an accelerated universe and the gap of 70% in the total energy, collected by WMAP, search for alternatives for the general relativity is an important issue, for this theory is not suited for these new phenomena. A particular alternative is the Brans-Dicke theory which has being allowing inspiring results, for example, concerning k-essence type fields in 4 dimensions. However, this theory is almost unexplored in the context of the dimensional reduction of the theory in 3 dimensions. In this work, we address some problems in this dimensional reduction, namely, evaluation of the deceleration parameter of the universe described by the 3 dimensional Brans-Dicke with and without matter. In both cases, we see that it is not possible to consider the theory as a model of k-essence descrybing the dark energy, but it can be considered as descrybing the dark matter.
