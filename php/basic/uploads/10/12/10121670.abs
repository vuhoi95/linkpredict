Abstract: Noncommutative geometry may be a starting point to a quantum gravity. We study the influence of the spacetime noncommutative parameter on the strong field gravitational lensing in the noncommutative Schwarzschild black-hole spacetime and obtain the angular position and magnification of the relativistic images. Supposing that the gravitational field of the supermassive central object of the galaxy described by this metric, we estimate the numerical values of the coefficients and observables for strong gravitational lensing. Comparing to the Reissner-Norstr\"{om} black hole, we find that the influences of the spacetime noncommutative parameter is similar to those of the charge, just these influences are much smaller. This may offer a way to distinguish a noncommutative black hole from a Reissner-Norstr\"{om} black hole, and may probe the spacetime noncommutative constant $\vartheta$ \cite{foot} by the astronomical instruments in the future.
