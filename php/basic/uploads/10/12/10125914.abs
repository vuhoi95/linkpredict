Title: Machian Origin of the Entropic Gravity and Cosmic Acceleration
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Igor Kanatchikov
Abstract: We discuss the emergence of relativistic effects in the Machian universe with a global preferred frame and use thermodynamic considerations to clarify the origin of gravity as an entropic force and the origin of dark energy/cosmic acceleration as related to the Hawking-Unruh temperature at the universe's horizon.
