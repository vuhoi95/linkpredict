Title: Non-Abelian magnetic monopole dominance for SU(3) Wilson loop average
Authors: Kei-Ichi Kondo and Akihiro Shibata and Toru Shinohara and Seikou Kato
Abstract: We show that the non-Abelian magnetic monopole defined in a gauge-invariant way in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory gives a dominant contribution to confinement of the fundamental quark, in sharp contrast to the SU(2) case.
