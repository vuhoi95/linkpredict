Title: Towards Cosmological Black Rings
Authors: J. B. Gutowski and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We classify all pseudo-supersymmetric near horizon geometries of extremal black holes in five dimensional de-Sitter supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. We find that there are three types of solution. The first type corresponds to the near-horizon geometry of extremal de Sitter BMPV black holes, and the spatial cross-section of the horizon is topologically S^3. The other two solutions cannot be embedded into the minimal de-Sitter supergravity theory, and correspond to near-horizon geometries for which the spatial cross-sections of the horizon are T^3 or S^1 * S^2.
