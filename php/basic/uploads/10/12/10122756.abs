Title: Cosmic acceleration a new review
Authors: O. A. Lemets and D. A. Yerokhin
Abstract: Recent observations of near supernova show that the acceleration expansion of Universe decreases. This phenomenon is called the transient acceleration. In the second part of work we consider the 3-component Universe composed of a scalar field, interacting with the dark matter on the agegraphic dark energy background. We show that the transient acceleration appears in frame of such a model. The obtained results agree with the latest cosmological observations, namely, the 557 SNIa sample (Union2) was released by the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP) Collaboration.
