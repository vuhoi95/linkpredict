Title: Warped Universal Extra Dimensions
Authors: Anibal D. Medina and Eduardo Ponton
Abstract: We consider a 5D warped scenario with a KK-parity symmetry, where the non-trivial warping arises from the dynamics that stabilizes the size of the extra dimension. Generically, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) particle is the first excitation of the radion field, while the next-to-lightest Kaluza-Klein particle is either the first excitation of the (RH) top quark or the first KK-parity odd Higgs. All these masses are expected to be of order the electroweak scale. We present simple analytical expressions for the masses and wavefunctions of the lowest lying KK modes, and derive the Feynman rules necessary for phenomenological applications. The framework allows to interpolate between a strongly warped scenario a la Randall-Sundrum (RS), and a weakly warped scenario that shares properties of both RS and Universal Extra Dimensions models.
