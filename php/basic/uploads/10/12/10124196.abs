Title: Logarithmic tensor category theory, II: Logarithmic formal calculus and  properties of logarithmic intertwining operators
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: This is the second part in a series of papers in which we introduce and develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part II), we develop logarithmic formal calculus and study logarithmic intertwining operators.
