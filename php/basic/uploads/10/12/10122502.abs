Title: SuperParticle realization of twisted N=2 SUSY algebra
Authors: Roberto Casalbuoni and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: We construct a pseudoclassical particle model associated to the twisted N=2 SUSY algebra in four dimensions. The particle model has four kappa symmetries. Three of them can be used to reduce the model to the vector supersymmetry particle case. The quantization of the model gives rise to two copies of the 4d Dirac equation. The kappa symmetries result to be associated to 4 TSUSY invariant bilinear odd operators who are null operators when a particular condition is satisfied. These operators are in correspondence one to one with analogous operators existing in the case of the N=2 SUSY algebra, making both cases 1/2 BPS.
