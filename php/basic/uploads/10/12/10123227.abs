Title: Strong dynamics at the Planck scale as a solution to the cosmological  moduli problem
Authors: Fuminobu Takahashi and Tsutomu T. Yanagida
Abstract: We argue that strong dynamics at the Planck scale can solve the cosmological moduli problem. We discuss its implications for inflation models, and find that a certain type of multi-field inflation model is required for this mechanism to work, since otherwise it would lead to the serious eta-problem. Combined with the inflaton-induced gravitino problem, we show that a chaotic inflation with a discrete symmetry naturally avoids both problems. Interestingly, the focus point supersymmetry is predicted when this mechanism is applied to the Polonyi model.
