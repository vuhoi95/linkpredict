Title: U-duality and non-BPS solutions
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Stefano Giusto and Clement Ruef
Abstract: We derive the explicit action of the U-duality group of the STU model on both BPS and non-BPS extremal multi-center solutions. As the class of known non-BPS extremal solutions is not closed under U-duality, we generate in this way new solutions. These should represent the most general class of extremal non-BPS multi-center under-rotating solutions of the STU model.
