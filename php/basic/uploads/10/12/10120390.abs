Title: Massive charged particle's tunneling from spherical charged black hole
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Zhao Xue and Shao-Jun Zhang
Abstract: We generalize the Parikh-Wilczek scheme to the tunneling of a massive charged particle from a general spherical charged black hole. We obtain that the tunneling probability depends on the energy, the mass and the charge of the particle. In particular, the modified Hawking temperature is related to the charge. Only at the leading order approximation can the standard Hawking temperature be reproduced. We take the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole as an example to clarify our points of view, and find that the accumulation of Hawking radiation makes it approach an extreme black hole.
