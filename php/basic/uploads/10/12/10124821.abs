Title: Two-component quark-gluon plasma in stringy models
Authors: H. Verschelde and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: The two-component liquid model reproduces the basic properties of the quark-gluon plasma as observed in heavy-ion collisions. The key dynamic element of the model is the existence of a light scalar. We argue that existence of such a scalar is a generic feature of stringy models of quantum chromodynamics. The lattice data provide evidence for a condensed, three-dimensional scalar field as well. We outline a possible crucial check of the model on the lattice.
