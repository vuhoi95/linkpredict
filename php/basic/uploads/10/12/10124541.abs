Title: Brane Holes
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that in models with large extra dimensions under special conditions one can extract information from the interior of 4D black holes. For this purpose we study an induced geometry on a test brane in the background of a higher dimensional static black string or a black brane. We show that at the intersection surface of the test brane and the bulk black string/brane the induced metric has an event horizon, so that the test brane contains a black hole. We call it a brane hole. When the test brane moves with a constant velocity V with respect to the bulk black object it also has a brane hole, but its gravitational radius r_e is greater than the size of the bulk black string/brane r_0 by the factor (1-V^2)^{-1}. We show that bulk `photon' emitted in the region between r_0 and r_e can meet the test brane again at a point outside r_e. From the point of view of observers on the test brane the events of emission and capture of the bulk `photon' are connected by a spacelike curve in the induced geometry. This shows an example in which extra dimensions can be used to extract information from the interior of a lower dimensional black object. Instead of the bulk black string/brane, one can also consider a bulk geometry without horizon. We show that nevertheless the induced geometry on the moving test brane can include a brane hole. In such a case the extra dimensions can be used to extract information from the complete region of the brane hole interior. We discuss thermodynamic properties of brane holes and interesting questions which arise when such an extra dimensional channel for the information mining exists.
