Title: Nonassociative strict deformation quantization of C*-algebras and  nonassociative torus bundles
Authors: K. C. Hannabuss and V. Mathai
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of nonassociative strict deformation quantization of C*-algebras with a torus action. We shall also present a definition of nonassociative principal torus bundles, and give a classification of these as nonassociative strict deformation quantization of ordinary principal torus bundles. We then relate this to T-duality of principal torus bundles with $H$-flux. We also show that the Octonions fit nicely into our theory.
