Title: Supersymmetry Transformations for Delta Potentials
Authors: David J. Fern√°ndez C. and Manuel Gadella and Luis-Miguel Nieto
Abstract: We make a detailed study of the first and second-order SUSY partners of a one-dimensional free Hamiltonian with a singular perturbation proportional to a Dirac delta function. It is shown that the second-order transformations increase the spectral manipulation possibilities offered by the standard first-order supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
