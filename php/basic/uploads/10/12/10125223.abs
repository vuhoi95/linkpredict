Title: Regular isolated black holes
Authors: Carlos Kozameh and Osvaldo Moreschi and Alejandro Perez
Abstract: We define a family of spacetimes representing isolated black holes exhibiting remarkable universal properties which are natural generalizations from stationary spacetimes. They admit a well defined notion of surface gravity k_H. This generalized surface gravity mediates an exponential relation between a regular null coordinate w near the horizon and an asymptotic Bondi null coordinate u defined in the vicinity of future null infinity. Our construction provides a framework for the study of gravitational collapse of an isolated system in its late stage of evolution.
