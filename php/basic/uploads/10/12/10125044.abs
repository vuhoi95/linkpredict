Title: Charged Balanced Black Rings in Five Dimensions
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Kirsten Schn√ºlle
Abstract: We present balanced black ring solutions of pure Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions. The solutions are asymptotically flat, and their tension and gravitational self-attraction are balanced by the repulsion due to rotation and electrical charge. Hence the solutions are free of conical singularities and possess a regular horizon which exhibits the topology S1 x S2 of a torus. We discuss the global charges and the horizon properties of the solutions and show that they satisfy a Smarr relation. We construct these black rings numerically, restricting to the case of black rings with a rotation in the direction of the S1.
