Title: Glueballs Mass Spectrum in an Inflationary Braneworld Scenario
Authors: L. Barosi and F. A. Brito and H. S. Jesuino and A. R. Queiroz
Abstract: We address the issue of glueball masses in a holographic dual field theory on the boundary of an AdS space deformed by a four-dimensional cosmological constant. These glueballs are related to scalar and tensorial fluctuations of the bulk fields on this space. In the Euclidean AdS4 case the allowed masses are discretized and are related to distinct inflaton masses on a 3-brane with several states of inflation. We then obtain the e-folds number in terms of the glueball masses. In the last part we focus on the Lorentzian dS4 case to focus on the QCD equation of state in dual field theory.
