Title: Crunches, Hats, and a Conjecture
Authors: Daniel Harlow and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: Our purpose in this paper is to discuss criteria for the existence of a precise dual description of a cosmology. A number of exact descriptions exist for flat and anti de Sitter backgrounds and possibly for open FRW universes that nucleate in an eternally inflating background. In addition duals have been proposed for de Sitter space, and for crunching FRW bubbles with negative cosmological constant. In the latter cases there is reason to think the dualities are at best approximate. One of our primary purposes is to analyze the quality of these descriptions, i.e., how exact they can be made. Maldacena's recent discussion of dualities involving crunching FRW cosmologies provides an opportunity for exploring some of these question.
