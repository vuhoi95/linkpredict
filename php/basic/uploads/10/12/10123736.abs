Title: Metastable supersymmetry breaking in extended supergravity
Authors: Andrea Borghese and Diederik Roest
Abstract: We consider the stability of non-supersymmetric critical points of general N=4 supergravities. A powerful method to analyse this issue based on the sGoldstino direction has been developed for minimal supergravity. We adapt this to the present case, and address the conceptually new features arising for extended supersymmetry. As an application, we investigate the stability when supersymmetry breaking proceeds via either the gravity or the matter sector. Finally, we outline the N=8 case.
