Title: On quasi-local charges and Newman--Penrose type quantities in  Yang--Mills theories
Authors: Réka Farkas and László B Szabados
Abstract: We generalize the notion of quasi-local charges, introduced by P. Tod for Yang--Mills fields with unitary groups, to non-Abelian gauge theories with arbitrary gauge group, and calculate its small sphere and large sphere limits both at spatial and null infinity. We show that for semisimple gauge groups no reasonable definition yield conserved total charges and Newman--Penrose (NP) type quantities at null infinity in generic, radiative configurations. The conditions of their conservation, both in terms of the field configurations and the structure of the gauge group, are clarified. We also calculate the NP quantities for stationary, asymptotic solutions of the field equations with vanishing magnetic charges, and illustrate these by explicit solutions with various gauge groups.
