Title: Anomaly Mediation from Randall-Sundrum to Dine-Seiberg
Authors: David Sanford and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: In this paper we reconsider the derivation of anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking. We work in a general formalism where the F-term of the conformal compensator superfield is arbitrary. This allows for a continuous interpolation between the original derivation and a more recent Dine-Seiberg derivation of anomaly mediation. We show that the physical soft parameters are independent of the compensator F-term and results of two formalisms agree. Finally, we discuss the role of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric thresholds in the effective low energy Lagrangian as well as the effects of explicit small mass parameters (such as mu-term) on the superpartner spectrum.
