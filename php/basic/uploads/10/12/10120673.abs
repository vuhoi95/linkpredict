Title: Phantom Inflation with A Steplike Potential
Authors: Zhi-Guo Liu and Jun Zhang and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: The phantom inflation predicts a slightly blue spectrum of tensor perturbation, which might be tested in coming observations. In normal inflation models, the introduction of step in its potential generally results in an oscillation in the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbation. We will check whether there is a similar case in the phantom inflation with steplike potential. We find that for same potentials, the oscillation of the spectrum of phantom inflation is nearly same with that of normal inflation, the difference between them is the tilt of power spectrum.
