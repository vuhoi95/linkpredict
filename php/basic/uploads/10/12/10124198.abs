Title: Logarithmic tensor category theory, IV: Constructions of tensor product  bifunctors and the compatibility conditions
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: This is the fourth part in a series of papers in which we introduce and develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part IV), we give constructions of the P(z)- and Q(z)-tensor product bifunctors using what we call "compatibility conditions" and certain other conditions.
