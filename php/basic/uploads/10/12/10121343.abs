Title: The vacuum revealed: the final state of vacuum instabilities in compact  stars
Authors: Paolo Pani and Vitor Cardoso and Emanuele Berti and Jocelyn Read and Marcelo Salgado
Abstract: Quantum fields in compact stars can be amplified due to a semiclassical instability. This generic feature of scalar fields coupled to curvature may affect the birth and the equilibrium structure of relativistic stars. We point out that the semiclassical instability has a classical counterpart, which occurs exactly in the same region of the parameter space. For negative values of the coupling parameter the instability is equivalent to the well-known "spontaneous scalarization" effect: the plausible end-state of the instability is a static, asymptotically flat equilibrium configuration with nonzero expectation value for the quantum fields, which is compatible with experiments in the weak-field regime and energetically favored over stellar solutions in general relativity. For positive values of the coupling parameter the new configurations are energetically disfavored, and the end-point of the instability remains an open and interesting issue. The vacuum instability may provide a natural mechanism to produce spontaneous scalarization, leading to new experimental opportunities to probe the nature of vacuum energy via astrophysical observations of compact stars.
