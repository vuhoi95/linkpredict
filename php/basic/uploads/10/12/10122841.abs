Title: Nambu-Goldstone explosion under brane perforation
Authors: D. V. Gal'tsov and E. Yu. Melkumova and S. Zamani-Mogaddam
Abstract: We show that perforation of the three-brane by mass impinging upon it from the five-dimensional bulk excites Nambu-Goldstone spherical wave propagating outwards with the velocity of light. It is speculated that such an effect can give rise to "`unmotivated" energy release events in the brane-world cosmological models.
