Title: Quantum Gravitational Contributions to Gauge Field Theories
Authors: Yong Tang and Yue-Liang Wu
Abstract: We revisit quantum gravitational contributions to quantum gauge field theories in the gauge condition independent Vilkovisky-DeWitt formalism based on the background field method. With the advantage of Landau-DeWitt gauge, we explicitly obtain the gauge condition independent result for the quadratically divergent gravitational corrections to gauge couplings. By employing, in a general way, a scheme-independent regularization method that can preserve both gauge invariance and original divergent behavior of integrals, we show that the resulting gauge coupling is power-law running and asymptotically free. The regularization scheme dependence is clarified by comparing with results obtained by other methods. The loop regularization scheme is found to be applicable for a consistent calculation.
