Title: Dark matter, Elko fields and Weinberg's quantum field theory formalism
Authors: Adam Gillard and Benjamin Martin
Abstract: The Elko quantum field was introduced by Ahluwalia and Grumiller, who proposed it as a candidate for dark matter. We study the Elko field in Weinberg's formalism for quantum field theory. We prove that if one takes the symmetry group to be the full Poincar\'e group then the Elko field is not a quantum field in the sense of Weinberg. This confirms results of Ahluwalia, Lee and Schritt, who showed using a different approach that the Elko field does not transform covariantly under rotations and hence has a preferred axis.
