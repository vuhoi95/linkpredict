Title: Some physical consequences of an exact vacua distribution in the  Bousso-Polchinski Landscape
Authors: Cesar Asensio and Antonio Segui
Abstract: The Bousso-Polchinski (BP) Landscape is a proposal for solving the Cosmological Constant Problem. The solution requires counting the states in a very thin shell in flux space. We find an exact formula for this counting problem which has two simple asymptotic regimes, one of them being the method of counting low $\Lambda$ states given originally by Bousso and Polchinski. We finally give some applications of the extended formula: a robust property of the Landscape which can be identified with an effective occupation number, an estimator for the minimum cosmological constant and a possible influence on the KKLT stabilization mechanism.
