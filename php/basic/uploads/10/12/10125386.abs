Title: Conformal transformations and Nordstr√∂m's scalar theory of gravity
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: As we shall briefly recall, Nordstr\"om's theory of gravity is observationally ruled out. It is however an interesting example of non-minimal coupling of matter to gravity and of the role of conformal transformations. We show in particular that they could be useful to extend manifolds through curvature singularities.
