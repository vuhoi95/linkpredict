Title: Supercurvaton
Authors: Vittoria Demozzi and Andrei Linde and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: We discuss observational consequences of the curvaton scenario, which naturally appears in the context of the simplest model of chaotic inflation in supergravity. The non-gaussianity parameter f_NL in this scenario can take values in the observationally interesting range from O(10) to O(100). These values may be different in different parts of the universe. The regions where f_NL is particularly large form a curvaton web resembling a net of thick domain walls, strings, or global monopoles.
