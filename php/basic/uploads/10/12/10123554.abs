Title: Tracking the effects of interactions on spinons in gapless Heisenberg  chains
Authors: J. -S. Caux and H. Konno and M. Sorrell and R. Weston
Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the nature of spinon excitations in Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains. We explicitly compute the two-spinon part of the longitudinal structure factor of the infinite chain in zero field for all values of anisotropy in the gapless antiferromagnetic regime, via an exact algebraic approach. Our results allow us to quantitatively describe the behaviour of these fundamental excitations for cases ranging from free to fully coupled chains, thereby explicitly mapping the effects of `turning on the interactions' in a strongly-correlated system.
