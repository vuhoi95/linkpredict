Title: Voros product, noncommutative inspired Reissner-Nordstr{รถ}m black hole  and corrected area law
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: We emphasize the importance of the Voros product in defining a noncommutative inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. The entropy of this black hole is then computed in the tunneling approach and is shown to obey the area law at the next to leading order in the noncommutative parameter $\theta$. Modifications to entropy/area law is then obtained by going beyond the semi-classical approximation. The leading correction to the semiclassical entropy/area law is found to be logarithmic and its coefficient involves the noncommutative parameter $\theta$.
