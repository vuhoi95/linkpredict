Title: AdS Black Hole Solution in Dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Yukinori Sasagawa
Abstract: We find that AdS spacetime with a non-trivial linear dilaton field is an exact solution in the effective action of string theory, which is described by gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet curvature terms coupled to a dilaton field in the string frame. The AdS radius is determined by the spacetime dimensions and the coupling constants of curvature corrections. We also construct the asymptotically AdS black hole solutions with a linear dilaton field numerically. We discuss the thermodynamical properties of those solutions. Extending the model to the case with the even-order higher Lovelock curvature terms, we also find the exact AdS spacetime with non-trivial dilaton. We further find a cosmological solution with a bounce of three space and a solitonic solution with a non-trivial dilaton field, which is regular everywhere and approaches an asymptotically AdS spacetime.
