Title: Chiral Resonant Solitons in Broer-Kaup Type New Hydrodynamic Systems
Authors: Jyh-Hao Lee and Oktay K. Pashaev
Abstract: New Broer-Kaup type systems of hydrodynamic equations are derived from the derivative reaction-diffusion systems arising in SL(2,R) Kaup-Newell hierarchy, represented in the non-Madelung hydrodynamic form. A relation with the problem of chiral solitons in quantum potential as a dimensional reduction of 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory for anyons is shown. By the Hirota bilinear method, soliton solutions are constructed and the resonant character of soliton interaction is found.
