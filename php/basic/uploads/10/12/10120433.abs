Title: Algebra of differential operators associated with Young diagrams
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and S. Natanzon
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between Young diagrams and differential operators of infinitely many variables. These operators form a commutative associative algebra isomorphic to the algebra of the conjugated classes of finite permutations of the set of natural numbers. The Schur functions form a complete system of common eigenfunctions of these differential operators, and their eigenvalues are expressed through the characters of symmetric groups. The structure constants of the algebra are expressed through the Hurwitz numbers.
