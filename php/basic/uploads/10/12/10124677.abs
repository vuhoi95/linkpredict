Title: Finite-size effects for jet quenching
Authors: Suphakorn Chunlen and Kasper Peeters and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We study corrections to the drag force exerted on a quark moving through a quark-gluon plasma of finite extent, using holographic methods. Interestingly we find that the leading correction is negative, i.e. it reduces the magnitude of the drag force as compared to its value in infinite volume.
