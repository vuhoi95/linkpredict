Title: Traveling solitons in Lorentz-violating systems
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and R. A. C. Correa
Abstract: In this work we present a class of traveling solitons in Lorentz-violating systems. In the case of Lorentz violating scenarios, it is usual to construct static solitonic configurations. Here it is shown that it is possible to construct some traveling solitons which, as it should be expected, can not be mapped into a static configuration by means of Lorentz boosts due to its explicit breaking. Furthermore, in the model studied, a complete set of solutions is obtained. The solutions present a critical behavior controlled by the choose of an arbitrary integration constant.
