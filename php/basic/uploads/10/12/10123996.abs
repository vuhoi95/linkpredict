Title: Review of AdS/CFT Integrability, Chapter III.7: Hirota Dynamics for  Quantum Integrability
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Vladimir Kazakov
Abstract: We review recent applications of the integrable discrete Hirota dynamics (Y-system) in the context of calculation of the planar AdS/CFT spectrum. We start from the description of solution of Hirota equations by the Backlund method where the requirement of analyticity results in the nested Bethe ansatz equations. Then we discuss applications of the Hirota dynamics for the analysis of the asymptotic limit of long operators in the AdS/CFT Y-system.
