Abstract: Detailed features of solitons in holographic superfluids are discussed. Using solitons as probes, we study the behavior of holographic superfluids by varying the scaling dimension of the condensing operator, and build a comparison to the BEC-BCS comparison phenomena. Further evidence for this analogy is provided by the behavior of solitons' length scales as well as by the superfluid critical velocity.
