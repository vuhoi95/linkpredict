Title: Degenerate Fermi gas perturbations at standard background cosmology
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and E. L. D. Perico
Abstract: The hypothesis of a tiny fraction of the cosmic inventory evolving cosmologically as a degenerate Fermi gas test fluid at some dominant cosmological background is investigated. Our analytical results allow for performing preliminary computations to the evolution of perturbations for relativistic and non-relativistic test fluids. The density fluctuation, $\delta$, the fluid velocity divergence, $\theta$, and an explicit expression for the dynamics of the shear stress, $\sigma$, are obtained for a degenerate Fermi gas in the background regime of radiation. Extensions to the dominance of matter and to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological background are also investigated and lessons concerning the formation of large structures of degenerate Fermi gas are depicted.
