Title: Gauge Formulation for Two Potential Theory of Dyons
Authors: O. P. S. Negi and H. Dehnen
Abstract: Dual electrodynamics and corresponding Maxwell's equations (in the presence of monopole only) are revisited from the symmetry of duality and gauge invariance. Accordingly, the manifestly covariant, dual symmetric and gauge invariant two potential theory of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons has been developed consistently from U(1)\times U(1) gauge symmetry. Corresponding field equations and equation of motion are derived from Lagrangian formulation adopted for U(1)\times U(1) gauge symmetry for the justification of two four potentials of dyons.
