Title: Five-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric mechanics
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Sergey Krivonos and Anton Sutulin
Abstract: We perform an $su(2)$ Hamiltonian reduction in the bosonic sector of the $su(2)$-invariant action for two free $(4,4,0)$ supermultiplets. As a result, we get the five dimensional \Nf supersymmetric mechanics describing the motion of an isospin carrying particle interacting with a Yang monopole. Some possible generalizations of the action to the cases of systems with a more general bosonic action constructed with the help of the ordinary and twisted \Nf hypermultiplets are considered.
