Title: D-brane non-perturbative effects and geometric deformations
Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Luca Martucci
Abstract: We study how non-perturbative dynamics on D-branes affects the ten-dimensional geometry. We show that a gaugino condensate changes the complex and the symplectic structures of the original manifold by deforming the supersymmetry conditions. The cases of D5, D6 and D7-branes are discussed in detail. In the latter case we find the explicit form of the resulting back-reacted background at linear order in the gaugino condensate.
