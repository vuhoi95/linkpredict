Abstract: It is shown that the $E_8$ trigonometric Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian, when written in terms of the Fundamental Trigonometric Invariants (FTI), is in algebraic form, i.e., has polynomial coefficients, and preserves two infinite flags of polynomial spaces marked by the Weyl (co)-vector and $E_8$ highest root (both in the basis of simple roots) as characteristic vectors. The explicit form of the Hamiltonian in new variables has been obtained both by direct calculation and by means of the orbit function technique. It is shown a triangularity of the Hamiltonian in the bases of orbit functions and of algebraic monomials ordered through Weyl heights. Examples of first eigenfunctions are presented.
