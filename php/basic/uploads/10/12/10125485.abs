Title: Feynman integrals and motives of configuration spaces
Authors: Ozgur Ceyhan and Matilde Marcolli
Abstract: We formulate the problem of renormalization of Feynman integrals and its relation to periods of motives in configuration space instead of momentum space. The algebro-geometric setting is provided by the wonderful compactifications of arrangements of subvarieties associated to the subgraphs of a Feynman graph and a (quasi)projective variety. The motive and the class in the Grothendieck ring are computed explicitly for these wonderful compactifications, in terms of the motive of the variety and the combinatorics of the Feynman graph, using recent results of Li Li. The pullback to the wonderful compactification of the form defined by the unrenormalized Feynman amplitude has singularities along a hypersurface, whose real locus is contained in the exceptional divisors of the iterated blowup that gives the wonderful compactification. A regularization of the Feynman integrals can be obtained by modifying the cycle of integration, by replacing the divergent locus with a Leray coboundary. The ambiguities are then defined by Poincare' residues. While these residues give mixed Tate periods associated to the cohomology of the exceptional divisors and their intersections, the regularized integrals give rise to periods of the hypersurface complement in the wonderful compactification, which can be motivically more complicated.
