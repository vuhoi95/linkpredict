Title: First-order quantum correction to the Larmor radiation from a moving  charge in a spatially homogeneous time-dependent electric field
Authors: Kazuhiro Yamamoto and Gen Nakamura
Abstract: First-order quantum correction to the Larmor radiation is investigated on the basis of the scalar QED on a homogeneous background of time-dependent electric field, which is a generalization of a recent work by Higuchi and Walker so as to be extended for an accelerated charged particle in a relativistic motion. We obtain a simple approximate formula for the quantum correction in the limit of the relativistic motion when the direction of the particle motion is parallel to that of the electric field.
