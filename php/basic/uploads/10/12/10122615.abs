Title: Scalar Moduli, Wall Crossing and Phenomenological Predictions
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Bhupendra Nath Tiwari
Abstract: We present the scalar moduli stabilization from the perspective of the real intrinsic geometry. In this paper, we describe the physical nature of the vacuum moduli fluctuations of an arbitrary Fayet configuration. For finitely many abelian scalar fields, we show that the framework of the real intrinsic geometry investigates the mixing between the marginal and threshold vacua. Interestingly, we find that the phenomena of wall crossing and the search of the stable vacuum configurations, pertaining to $D$-term and $F$-term scalar moduli, can be accomplished for the abelian charges. For given vacuum expectation values of the moduli scalars, we provide phenomenological aspects of the vacuum fluctuations and phase transitions in the supersymmetry breaking configurations.
