Title: Infrared chiral anomaly at finite temperature
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study the Schwinger model at finite temperature and show that a temperature dependent chiral anomaly may arise from the long distance behavior of the electric field. At high temperature this anomaly depends linearly on the temperature $T$ and is present not only in the two point function, but also in all even point amplitudes.
