Title: Higher Dimensional Cosmology: Relations among the radii of two  homogeneous spaces
Authors: E. A. Leon and J. A. Nieto and R. Nunez-Lopez and A. Lipovka
Abstract: We study a cosmological model in 1+D+d dimensions where D dimensions are associated with the usual Friedman-Robertson-Walker type metric with radio a(t) and d dimensions corresponds to an additional homogeneous space with radio b(t). We make a general analysis of the field equations and then we obtain solutions involving the two cosmological radii, a(t) and b(t). The particular case D=3, d=1 is studied in some detail.
