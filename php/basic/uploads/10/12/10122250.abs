Title: N=4, d=1 Supersymmetric Hyper-Kaehler Sigma Models with Isospin  Variables
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Sergey Krivonos and Anton Sutulin
Abstract: We provide a Lagrangian formulation of \Nf supersymmetric mechanics describing the motion of an isospin carrying particle on conformal to hyper-K\"{a}hler spaces in a non-Abelian background gauge field. In two examples we discuss in details, this background field is identified with the field of BPST instantons in the flat and Taub-NUT spaces.
