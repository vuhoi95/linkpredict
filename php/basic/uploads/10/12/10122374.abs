Title: Particle Creation by Naked Singularities in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Umpei Miyamoto and Hiroya Nemoto and Masahiro Shimano
Abstract: Recently, the possibility was pointed out by one of the present authors and his collaborators that an effective naked singularity referred to as "a visible border of spacetime" is generated by high-energy particle collision in the context of large extra dimensions or TeV-scale gravity. In this paper, we investigate the particle creation by a naked singularity in general dimensions, while adopting a model in which a marginally naked singularity forms in the collapse of a homothetic lightlike pressureless fluid. We find that the spectrum deviates from that of Hawking radiation due to scattering near the singularity but can be recast in quasi-thermal form. The temperature is always higher than that of Hawking radiation of a same-mass black hole, and can be arbitrarily high depending on a parameter in the model. This implies that, in principle, the naked singularity may be distinguished from a black hole in collider experiments.
