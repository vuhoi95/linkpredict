Title: Schur function expansions of KP tau functions associated to algebraic  curves
Authors: V. Enolski and J. Harnad
Abstract: The Schur function expansion of Sato-Segal-Wilson KP tau-functions is reviewed. The case of tau-functions related to algebraic curves of arbitrary genus is studied in detail. Explicit expressions for the Pl\"ucker coordinate coefficients appearing in the expansion are obtained in terms of directional derivatives of the Riemann theta function or Klein sigma function along the KP flow directions. Using the fundamental bi-differential, it is shown how the coefficients can be expressed as polynomials in terms of Klein's higher genus generalizations of Weierstrass' zeta and P functions. The cases of genus two hyperelliptic and genus three trigonal curves are detailed as illustrations of the approach developed here.
