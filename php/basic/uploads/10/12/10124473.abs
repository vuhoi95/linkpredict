Abstract: Annihilation of different dark matter (DM) candidates into Standard Model (SM) particles could be detected through their contribution to the gamma ray fluxes that are measured on the Earth. The magnitude of such contributions depends on the particular DM candidate, but certain imprints of produced photon spectra may be analyzed in a model-independent fashion. In this work we provide the fitting formulae for the photon spectra generated by WIMP annihilation into quarks, leptons and gauge bosons channels in a wide range of WIMP masses.
