Title: Correlation functions of magnon and spike
Authors: Chanyong Park and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: After considering a solitonic string moving in the Poincare $AdS$ and two-dimensional sphere, we calculate the two-point correlation function of magnon and spike in the semi-classical limit without any explicit solution. We also calculate the three-point correlation functions between two heavy and one light operators. We find that the coupling between two heavy and one light operators in the string side is the exactly same as one obtained from the gauge theory by using the RG analysis.
