Title: Large spin expansion of semiclassical 3-point correlators in AdS_5 x S^5

Abstract: 3-point correlators in AdS_5xS^5 string theory in which two states are "heavy" (have large quantum numbers) and the third is "light" (here chosen as chiral primary scalar) can be computed semiclassically in terms of the "light" vertex operator evaluated on the classical string solution sourced by the two "heavy" operators. We observe that in the case when the "heavy" operators represent BPS states there is an ambiguity in the computation depending on whether the mass shell (or marginality) condition is imposed before or after integration over the world sheet. We show that this ambiguity is resolved in a universal way by defining the BPS correlator as a limit of the one with non-BPS "heavy" states. We consider several examples with "heavy" states represented by folded or circular spinning strings in AdS_5xS^5 that admit a point-like BMN-type limit when one S^5 spin J is much larger than the others. Remarkably, in all of these cases the large J expansion of the 3-point correlator has the same structure as expected in perturbative (tree-level and one-loop) dual gauge theory. We conjecture that, like the leading chiral primary correlator term, the coefficients of the first few subleading terms are also protected, i.e. should be the same at strong and weak coupling.
