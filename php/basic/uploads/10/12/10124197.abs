Title: Logarithmic tensor category theory, III: Intertwining maps and tensor  product bifunctors
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: This is the third part in a series of papers in which we introduce and develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part III), we introduce and study intertwining maps and tensor product bifunctors.
