Title: Twist operators in N=4 beta-deformed theory
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Tomasz Lukowski
Abstract: In this paper we derive both the leading order finite size corrections for twist-2 and twist-3 operators and the next-to-leading order finite-size correction for twist-2 operators in beta-deformed SYM theory. The obtained results respect the principle of maximum transcendentality as well as reciprocity. We also find that both wrapping corrections go to zero in the large spin limit. Moreover, for twist-2 operators we studied the pole structure and compared it against leading BFKL predictions.
