Authors: P. G. Castro and B. Chakraborty and R. Kullock and F. Toppan
Abstract: Noncommutative oscillators are first-quantized through an abelian Drinfel'd twist deformation of a Hopf algebra and its action on a module. Several important and subtle issues making possible the quantization are solved. The spectrum of the single-particle Hamiltonians is computed. The multi-particle Hamiltonians are fixed, unambiguously, by the Hopf algebra coproduct. The symmetry under particle exchange is guaranteed. In d=2 dimensions the rotational invariance is preserved, while in d=3 the so(3) rotational invariance is broken down to an so(2) invariance.
