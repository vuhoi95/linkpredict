Title: Integrable defects in affine Toda field theory and infinite dimensional  representations of quantum groups
Authors: E. Corrigan and C. Zambon
Abstract: Transmission matrices for two types of integrable defect are calculated explicitly, first by solving directly the nonlinear transmission Yang-Baxter equations, and second by solving a linear intertwining relation between a finite dimensional representation of the relevant Borel subalgebra of the quantum group underpinning the integrable quantum field theory and a particular infinite dimensional representation expressed in terms of sets of generalized `quantum' annihilation and creation operators. The principal examples analysed are based on the $a_2^{(2)}$ and $a_n^{(1)}$ affine Toda models but examples of similar infinite dimensional representations for quantum Borel algebras for all other affine Toda theories are also provided.
