Title: Interplay of fixed points in scalar models
Authors: S. Nagy and K. Sailer
Abstract: We performed the renormalization group analysis of scalar models exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is shown that an infrared fixed point appears in the broken symmetric phase of the models, which induces a dynamical scale, that can be identified with the correlation length. This enables one to identify the type of the phase transition which shows similarity to the one appearing in the crossover scale. The critical exponent $\nu$ of the correlation length also proved to be equal in the crossover and the infrared scaling regimes.
