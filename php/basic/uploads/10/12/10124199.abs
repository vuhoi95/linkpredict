Title: Logarithmic tensor category theory, V: Convergence condition for  intertwining maps and the corresponding compatibility condition
Authors: Yi-Zhi Huang and James Lepowsky and Lin Zhang
Abstract: This is the fifth part in a series of papers in which we introduce and develop a natural, general tensor category theory for suitable module categories for a vertex (operator) algebra. In this paper (Part V), we study products and iterates of intertwining maps and of logarithmic intertwining operators and we begin the development of our analytic approach.
