Title: Relic Densities of Gauged Axions and Supersymmetry
Authors: Claudio Coriano and Marco Guzzi and Antonio Mariano
Abstract: We illustrate the structure and the main phenomenological features of a supersymmetric model (the USSM-A) built following a bottom-up approach and containing an anomalous abelian gauge symmetry. This model supports a gauged axion in its spectrum and provides a generalization of the global (supersymmetric) Peccei-Quinn construction. Complete simulations of the neutralino relic density are performed. Bounds from CAST and WMAP, combined with dark matter simulations, provide significant constraints on the scale of the interactions between the axion and the gauge fields.
