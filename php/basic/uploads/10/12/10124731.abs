Title: The FZZ duality with boundary
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: The Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (FZZ) duality relates Witten's cigar model to sine-Liouville theory. This duality was proven in the path integral formulation and extended to the case of higher genus closed Riemann surfaces by Schomerus and one of the authors. In this note we further extend the duality to the case with boundary. Specifically, we relate D1-branes in the cigar model to D2-branes in the sine-Liouville theory. In particular, the boundary action for D2-branes in the sine-Liouville theory is constructed. We also consider the fermionic version of the FZZ duality. This duality was proven as a mirror symmetry by Hori and Kapustin, but we give an alternative proof in the path integral formulation which directly relates correlation functions. Also here the case with boundary is investigated and the results are consistent with those for branes in N=2 super Liouville field theory obtained by Hosomichi.
