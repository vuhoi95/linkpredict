Title: The Non-Compact Weyl Equation
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Theodora Ioannidou
Abstract: A non-compact version of the Weyl equation is proposed, based on the infinite dimensional spin zero representation of the sl_2 algebra. Solutions of the aforementioned equation are obtained in terms of the Kummer functions. In this context, we discuss the ADHMN approach in order to construct the corresponding non-compact BPS monopoles.
