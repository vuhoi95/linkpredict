Abstract: We study the second-order phase transition (SOPT) for the spherically symmetric Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS) black hole in the deformed H\v{o}rava-Lifshitz gravity by applying the methods of equilibrium and non-equilibrium fluctuations. We find that, although the KS black hole has only one mass parameter as the usual Schwarzschild ones, the SOPT will take place if the mass of the KS black hole changes across the critical point $\frac{\sqrt{5+\sqrt{33}}(\sqrt{33}-1)} {16\sqrt{\omega}} $. The result show us that there is difference between the H\v{o}rava-Lifshitz gravity and the Einstein's gravity theory.
