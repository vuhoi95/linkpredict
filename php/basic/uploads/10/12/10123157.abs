Title: Thermally Favourable Gauge Mediation
Authors: Ioannis Dalianis and Zygmunt Lalak
Abstract: We discuss the thermal evolution of the spurion and messenger fields of ordinary gauge mediation models taking into account the Standard Model degrees of freedom. It is shown that for thermalized messengers the metastable susy breaking vacuum becomes thermally selected provided that the susy breaking sector is sufficiently weakly coupled to messengers or to any other observable field.
