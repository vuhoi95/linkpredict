Title: Anisotropic Drag Force from 4D Kerr-AdS Black Holes
Authors: Ardian Nata Atmaja and Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: Using AdS/CFT we investigate the effect of angular-momentum-induced anisotropy on the instantaneous drag force of a heavy quark. The dual description is that of a string moving in the background of a Kerr-AdS black holes. The system exhibits the expected focussing of jets towards the impact parameter plane. We put forward that we can use the connection between this focussing behavior and the angular momentum induced pressure gradient to extrapolate the pressure gradient correction to the drag force that can be used for transverse elliptic flow in realistic RHIC. The result is recognizable as a relativistic pressure gradient force.
