Title: Chaplygin gas braneworld inflation according to WMAP7 data
Authors: R. Zarrouki and M. Bennai
Abstract: We consider a Chaplygin gas model with an exponential potential in framework of braneworld inflation. We apply the slow-roll approximation in the high-energy limit to derive various inflationary spectrum perturbation parameters. We show that the inflation observables depend only on the e-folding number N and the final value of the slow-roll parameter e(end). Whereas for small running of the scalar spectral index dns/dlnk, the inflation observables are in good agreement with recent WMAP7 data.
