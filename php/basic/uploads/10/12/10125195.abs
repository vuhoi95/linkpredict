Title: New observations in the BRST analysis of dynamical non-Abelian 2-form  gauge theory
Authors: R. Kumar and R. P. Malik
Abstract: We generalize the usual gauge transformations connected with the 1-form gauge potential to the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the four (3+1)-dimensional (4D) topologically massive non-Abelian gauge theory that incorporates the famous (B\wedge F) term where there is an explicit topological coupling between 1-form and 2-form gauge fields. A novel feature of our present investigation is the observation that the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the auxiliary 1-form field (K_\mu) and 2-form gauge potential (B_{0i}) are not generated by the (anti-)BRST charges that are derived by exploiting all the relevant (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations corresponding to all the fields of the present theory. This observation is a new result because it is drastically different from the application of the BRST formalism to (non-)Abelian 1-form and Abelian 2-form as well as 3-form gauge theories.
