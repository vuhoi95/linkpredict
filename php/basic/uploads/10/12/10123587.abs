Title: Remarks on the notion of quantum integrability
Authors: J. -S. Caux and J. Mossel
Abstract: We discuss the notion of integrability in quantum mechanics. Starting from a review of some definitions commonly used in the literature, we propose a different set of criteria, leading to a classification of models in terms of different integrability classes. We end by highlighting some of the expected physical properties associated to models fulfilling the proposed criteria.
