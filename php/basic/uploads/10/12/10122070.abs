Title: Geometrothermodynamics of a Charged Black Hole of String Theory
Authors: Alexis Larranaga and Sindy Mojica
Abstract: The thermodynamics of the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) charged black hole from string theory is reformulated within the context of the recently developed formalism of geometrothermodynamics. The geometry of the space of equilibrium states is curved, but we show that the thermodynamic curvature does not diverge when the black hole solution becomes a naked singularity. This provides a counterexample to the conventional notion that a thermodynamical curvature divergence signals the occurrence of a phase transition.
