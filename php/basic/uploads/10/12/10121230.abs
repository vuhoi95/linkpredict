Title: Magneto-roton excitation in a holographic quantum Hall fluid
Authors: Niko Jokela and Gilad Lifschytz and Matthew Lippert
Abstract: We compute the neutral bosonic excitation spectra of the holographic quantum Hall fluid described by the D3-D7' system. We find that the system is stable, gapped, and, in a range of parameters, exhibits a spectrum of low-lying excitations very similar to that of a quantum Hall fluid, including a magneto-roton excitation.
