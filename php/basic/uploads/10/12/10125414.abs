Title: Planck mass and Dilaton field as a function of the noncommutative  parameter
Authors: S. Zaim and Z. Aouachria
Abstract: A deformed Bianchi type I metric in noncommutative gauge gravity is obtained. The gauge potential (tetrad fields) and scalar curvature are determined up to the second order in the noncommutativity parameters. The noncommutativity correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action is deduced. We obtain the Planck mass, on noncommutative space-time as a function of the noncommutative parameter {\theta}, which implies that noncommutativity has modified the structure and topology of the space-time.
