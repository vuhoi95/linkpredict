Title: Notes on SUSY Gauge Theories on Three-Sphere
Authors: Naofumi Hama and Kazuo Hosomichi and Sungjay Lee
Abstract: We extend the formula for partition functions of N=2 superconformal gauge theories on S^3 obtained recently by Kapustin, Willett and Yaakov, to incorporate matter fields with arbitrary R-charge assignments. We use the result to check that the self-mirror property of N=4 SQED with two electron hypermultiplets is preserved under a certain mass deformation which breaks the supersymmetry to N=2.
