Abstract: A new class of inflation models within the context of G-inflation is proposed, in which the standard model Higgs boson can act as an inflaton thanks to Galileon-like non-linear derivative interaction. The generated primordial density perturbation is shown to be consistent with the present observational data. We also make a general discussion on potential-driven G-inflation models, and find a new consistency relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the tensor spectral index $n_T$, $r = -32 \sqrt{6}n_T / 9$, which is crucial in discriminating the present models from standard inflation with a canonical kinetic term.
