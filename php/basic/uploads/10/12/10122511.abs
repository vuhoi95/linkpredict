Authors: Hong Li and Jie Liu and Jun-Qing Xia and Yi-Fu Cai
Abstract: In this paper we present the constraints on cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature contributions to the cosmological perturbations. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC), we perform a global analysis for cosmological parameters using the latest astronomical data, such as 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) observations, matter power spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) luminous red galaxies (LRG), and "Union2" type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) sample. We find that the correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature modes are mildly better fitting to the current data than the pure adiabatic ones, with the minimal $\chi^2$ given by the likelihood analysis being reduced by 3.5. We also obtain a tight limit on the fraction of the CDM isocurvature contributions, which should be less than 14.6% at 95% confidence level. With the presence of the isocurvature modes, the adiabatic spectral index becomes slightly bigger, n_s^{\rm adi}=0.972\pm0.014~(1\,\sigma), and the tilt for isocurvature spectrum could be large, namely, the best fit value is n_s^{\rm iso}=3.020. Finally, we discuss the effect on WMAP normalization priors, shift parameter R, acoustic scale l_A and z_{*}, from the CDM isocurvaure perturbation. By fitting the mixed initial condition to the combined data, we find the mean values of R, l_A and z_{*} can be changed about 2.9\sigma, 2.8\sigma and 1.5\sigma respectively, comparing with those obtained in the pure adiabatic condition.
