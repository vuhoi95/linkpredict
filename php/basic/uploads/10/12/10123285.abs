Title: Detection of cosmic superstrings by geodesic test particle motion
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Claus LÃ¤mmerzahl and Parinya Sirimachan
Abstract: (p,q)-strings are bound states of p F-strings and q D-strings and are predicted to form at the end of brane inflation. As such these cosmic superstrings should be detectable in the universe. In this paper we argue that they can be detected by the way that massive and massless test particles move in the space-time of these cosmic superstrings, in particular we study solutions to the geodesic equation in the space-time of field theoretical (p,q)-strings. The geodesics can be classified according to the test particle's energy, angular momentum and momentum in the direction of the string axis. We discuss how the change of the magnetic fluxes, the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the Planck mass, the Higgs to gauge boson mass ratios and the binding between the F- and D-strings, respectively, influence the motion of the test particles. While massless test particles can only move on escape orbits, a new feature as compared to the infinitely thin string limit is the existence of bound orbits for massive test particles. In particular, we observe that - in contrast to the space-time of a single Abelian-Higgs string - bound orbits for massive test particles in (p,q)-string space-times are possible if the Higgs boson mass is larger than the gauge boson mass. We also compute the effect of the binding between the p- and the q-string on observables such as the light deflection and the perihelion shift. While light deflection can also be caused by other matter distributions, the possibility of a negative perihelion shift seems to be a feature of finite width cosmic strings that could lead to the unmistakable identification of such objects. In Melvin space-times, which are asymptotically non-conical, massive test particles have to move on bound orbits, while massless test particles can only escape to infinity if their angular momentum vanishes.
