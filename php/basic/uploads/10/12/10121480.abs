Title: Fermion localization on a split brane
Authors: A. E. R. Chumbes and A. E. O. Vasquez and M. B. Hott
Abstract: In this work we analyze the localization of fermions on a brane embedded in five-dimensional, warped and non-warped, space-time. In both cases we use the same nonlinear theoretical model with a non-polynomial potential featuring a self-interacting scalar field whose minimum energy solution is a soliton (a kink) which can be continuously deformed into a two-kink. Thus a single brane splits into two branes. The behavior of spin 1/2 fermions wavefunctions on the split brane depends on the coupling of fermions to the scalar field and on the geometry of the space-time.
