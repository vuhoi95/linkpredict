Title: Supersymmetric three family chiral SU(6) grand unification model from  F-theory
Authors: Kang-Sin Choi and Jihn E. Kim
Abstract: We obtain a supersymmetric three family chiral SU(6) grand unification model with the global family symmetry SU(3)[family] from F-theory. This model has nice features such as all the fermion masses are reasonably generated and there results only one pair of Higgs doublets, realizing the doublet-triplet splitting from the family symmetry SU(3)[family]. The proton hexality is realized toward the proton stability problem. There is a room to fit the three gauge couplings using the F-theory flux idea and we obtain the proton lifetime in the 10^{36-37} yr region.
