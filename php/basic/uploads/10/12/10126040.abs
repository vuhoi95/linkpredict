Title: The Black Hole Membrane Paradigm in f(R) Gravity
Authors: Saugata Chatterjee and Maulik Parikh and Sudipta Sarkar
Abstract: To an outside observer, a black hole's event horizon appears to behave exactly like a dynamical fluid membrane. We extend this membrane paradigm to black holes in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity. We derive the stress tensor and various transport coefficients of the fluid and find that the membrane behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid except for the special case of Einstein gravity. Using Euclidean methods, we study the thermodynamics of the membrane. We speculate on what theories of gravity admit horizons with fluid properties.
