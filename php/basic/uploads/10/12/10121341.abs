Title: Asymmetric Dark Matter from Hidden Sector Baryogenesis
Authors: Bhaskar Dutta and Jason Kumar
Abstract: We consider the production of asymmetric dark matter during hidden sector baryogenesis. We consider a particular supersymmetric model where the dark matter candidate has a number density approximately equal to the baryon number density, with a mass of the same scale as the $b$, $c$ and $\tau$. Both baryon asymmetry and dark matter are created at the same time in this model. We describe collider and direct detection signatures of this model.
