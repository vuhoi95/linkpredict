Title: The most general ELKO Matter in torsional f(R)-theories
Authors: Luca Fabbri and Stefano Vignolo
Abstract: We study f(R)-gravity with torsion in presence of the most general ELKO matter, checking the consistency of the conservation laws with the matter field equations; we discuss some mathematical features of the field equations in connection with a cosmological application.
