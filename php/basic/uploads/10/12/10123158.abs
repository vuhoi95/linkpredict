Title: Exponential fall-off Behavior of Regge Scatterings in Compactified Open  String Theory
Authors: Song He and Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We calculate massive string scattering amplitudes of compactified open string in the Regge regime. We extract the complete infinite ratios among high-energy amplitudes of different string states in the fixed angle regime from these Regge string scattering amplitudes. The complete ratios calculated by this indirect method include and extend the subset of ratios calculated previously (Lee and Yang, 2007, and Lee, Takimi, and Yang, 2008) by the more difficult direct fixed angle calculation. In this calculation of compactified open string scattering, we discover a realization of arbitrary real values L in the identity Eq.(4.18), rather than integer value only in all previous high-energy string scattering amplitude calculations. The identity in Eq.(4.18) was explicitly proved recently in Lee, Yan, and Yang to link fixed angle and Regge string scattering amplitudes. In addition, we discover a kinematic regime with stringy highly winding modes, which shows the unusual exponential fall-off behavior in the Regge string scattering. This is in complementary with a kenematic regime discovered previously (Lee, Takimi, and Yang, 2008), which shows the unusual power-law behavior in the high-energy fixed angle compactified string scatterings. Key words: Regge string scatterings; High-energy String
