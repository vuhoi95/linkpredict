Title: Semi-direct Gauge-Yukawa Mediation
Authors: Zhaofeng Kang and Tianjun Li and Tao Liu and Jin Min Yang
Abstract: We propose semi-direct Gauge-Yukawa mediation of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. The messenger fields mediating SUSY breaking to the visible sector do not directly couple with the goldstino field, and instead they have gauge and Yukawa interactions with some primary messenger fields which couple directly with the goldstino fields. From the explicit Feynman diagram calculations for the SUSY breaking soft masses, we find that the SUSY particle spectra can be realistic. Especially, this generalization of semi-direct gauge mediation solves the massless gaugino mass problem since the holomorphic soft mass terms of the messenger fields can be generated by Yukawa couplings. We also provide some arguments that this scenario can be realized naturally in some dynamical SUSY-breaking models such as the ISS-like model.
