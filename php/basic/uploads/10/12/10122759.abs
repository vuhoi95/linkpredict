Title: Chiral matter wavefunctions in warped compactifications
Authors: Fernando Marchesano and Paul McGuirk and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We analyze the wavefunctions for open strings stretching between intersecting 7-branes in type IIB/F-theory warped compactifications, as a first step in understanding the warped effective field theory of 4d chiral fermions. While in general the equations of motion do not seem to admit a simple analytic solution, we provide a method for solving the wavefunctions in the case of weak warping. The method describes warped zero modes as a perturbative expansion in the unwarped spectrum, the coefficients of the expansion depending on the warping. We perform our analysis with and without the presence of worldvolume fluxes, illustrating the procedure with some examples. Finally, we comment on the warped effective field theory for the modes at the intersection.
