Title: 4D gravity on a BPS brane in 5D AdS-Minkowski space
Authors: R. C. Fonseca and F. A. Brito and L. Losano
Abstract: We calculate small correction terms to gravitational potential near an asymmetric BPS brane embedded in a 5D AdS-Minkowski space in the context of supergravity. The normalizable wave functions of gravity fluctuations around the brane describe only massive modes. We compute such wave functions analytically in the thin wall limit. We estimate the correction to gravitational potential for small and long distances, and show that there is an intermediate range of distances in which we can identify 4D gravity on the brane below a crossover scale. The 4D gravity is metastable and for distances much larger than the crossover scale the 5D gravity is recovered.
