Title: Entropic Corrections to Einstein Equations
Authors: S. H. Hendi and A. Sheykhi
Abstract: Considering the general quantum corrections to the area law of black hole entropy and adopting the viewpoint that gravity interprets as an entropic force, we derive the modified forms of MOND theory of gravitation and Einstein field equations. As two special cases we study the logarithmic and power-law corrections to entropy and find the explicit form of the obtained modified equations.
