Title: Bound state energies and phase shifts of a non-commutative well
Authors: J. D. Thom and F. G. Scholtz
Abstract: Non-commutative quantum mechanics can be viewed as a quantum system represented in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on non-commutative configuration space. Within this framework an unambiguous definition can be given for the non-commutative well. Using this approach we compute the bound state energies, phase shifts and scattering cross sections of the non- commutative well. As expected the results are very close to the commutative results when the well is large or the non-commutative parameter is small. However, the convergence is not uniform and phase shifts at certain energies exhibit a much stronger then expected dependence on the non-commutative parameter even at small values.
