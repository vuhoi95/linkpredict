Title: CMB Polarization in Einstein-Aether Theory
Authors: Masahiro Nakashima and Tsutomu Kobayashi
Abstract: We study the impact of modifying the vector sector of gravity on the CMB polarization. We employ the Einstein-aether theory as a concrete example. The Einstein-aether theory admits dynamical vector perturbations generated during inflation, leaving imprints on the CMB polarization. We derive the perturbation equations of the aether vector field in covariant formalism and compute the CMB B-mode polarization using the modified CAMB code. It is found that the amplitude of the B-mode signal from the aether field can surpass the one from the inflationary gravitational waves. The shape of the spectrum is clearly understood in an analytic way using the tight coupling approximation.
