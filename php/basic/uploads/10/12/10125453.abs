Title: Hidden conformal symmetry of extremal Kaluza-Klein black hole in four  dimensions
Authors: Yong-Chang Huang and Fang-Fang Yuan
Abstract: We study the hidden conformal symmetry of four-dimensional extremal Kaluza-Klein black hole. The scalar Laplacian corresponding to the radial equation in the near-region is rewritten in terms of the $SL(2,\mathbb R)$ quadratic Casimir. Using the first law of black hole thermodynamics, this symmetry enables us to obtain the conjugate charges for the CFT side. The real-time correlators are also found to agree with the CFT expectations.
