Title: New Structure of Knot Invariants
Authors: Kefeng Liu and Pan Peng
Abstract: Based on the proof of Labastida-Mari{\~n}o-Ooguri-Vafa conjecture \cite{lmov}, we derive an infinite product formula for Chern-Simons partition functions, the generating function of quantum $\fsl_N$ invariants. Some symmetry properties of the infinite product will also be discussed.
