Authors: Ya-Peng Hu and Huai-Fan Li and Zhang-Yu Nie
Abstract: In the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the hydrodynamics of the dual conformal field in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity. By considering the parameters of the boosted black brane in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity as functions of boundary coordinates, and then solving the corresponding correction terms, we calculate the first order stress-energy tensor of the dual conformal field. From this first order stress-energy tensor, we also obtain the shear viscosity and entropy density. And these results are consistent with those of some previous works from the effective coupling of gravitons.
