Title: The Ising Susceptibility Scaling Function
Authors: Y. Chan and A. J. Guttmann and B. G. Nickel and J. H. H. Perk
Abstract: We have dramatically extended the zero field susceptibility series at both high and low temperature of the Ising model on the triangular and honeycomb lattices, and used these data and newly available further terms for the square lattice to calculate a number of terms in the scaling function expansion around both the ferromagnetic and, for the square and honeycomb lattices, the antiferromagnetic critical point.
