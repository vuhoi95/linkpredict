Authors: O. P. S. Negi and H. Dehnen and Gaurav Karnatak and P. S. Bisht
Abstract: Postulating the existence of magnetic monopole in electromagnetism and Heavisidian monopoles in gravitational interactions, a unified theory of gravi-electromagnetism has been developed on generalizing the Schwinger-Zwanziger formulation of dyon to quaternion in simple and consistent manner. Starting with the four Lorentz like forces on different charges, we have generalized the Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization parameters in order to obtain the angular momentum for unified fields of dyons and gravito-dyons (i.e. Gravi-electromagnetism). Taking the unified charge as quaternion, we have reformulated manifestly covariant and consistent theory for the dynamics of four charges namely electric, magnetic, gravitational and Heavisidian associated with gravi electromagnetism.
