Title: 3D gauged supergravity from wrapped M5-branes with AdS/CMT applications
Authors: Eoin Ó Colgáin and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: By identifying a bosonic consistent truncation from the 1/4-BPS wrapped M5-brane geometry of Maldacena, Strominger and Witten in D = 11 supergravity and finding a supersymmetric extension, we recover an N = 2 D = 3 supergravity theory. Reductions of a large class of supersymmetric solutions corresponding to wrapped M2 and M5-branes lead to black strings and warped AdS3 solutions preserving supersymmetry. With a view to AdS/CMT applications, we also construct a numerical hairy BTZ black hole and, as a preliminary step in this direction, determine the conductivity of the dual CFT.
