Title: Constraints on warped compactifications
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: We discuss a possible compactification of a higher-dimensional gravitational theory, which give rise to a de Sitter or an accelerating universe, to the extent that it can describe a low energy limit of string theory. Such analysis can be carried out by the usual integration over the internal space in the Einstein equations. The combined field equations in the higher-dimensional supergravity theory after integration give several new terms which may help to realize a de Sitter compactification. After developing the general framework, we describe some specific examples involving the dilaton and mass parameter.
