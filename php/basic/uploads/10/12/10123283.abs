Title: Static interactions and stability of matter in Rindler space
Authors: F. Lenz and K. Ohta and K. Yazaki
Abstract: Dynamical issues associated with quantum fields in Rindler space are addressed in a study of the interaction between two sources at rest generated by the exchange of scalar particles, photons and gravitons. These static interaction energies in Rindler space are shown to be scale invariant, complex quantities. The imaginary part will be seen to have its quantum mechanical origin in the presence of an infinity of zero modes in uniformly accelerated frames which in turn are related to the radiation observed in inertial frames. The impact of a uniform acceleration on the stability of matter and the properties of particles is discussed and estimates are presented of the instability of hydrogen atoms when approaching the horizon.
