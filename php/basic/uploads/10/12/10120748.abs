Abstract: Recently, Ban\~{a}dos, Silk and West (BSW) found that the center-of-mass energy of two colliding test particles in the neighborhood of an extreme Kerr black hole could be arbitrarily high when one particle has the critical angular momentum $L_\text{C}$. In their paper, they considered the black holes living in a Minkowski space-time with a zero cosmological constant. In this work, we study this process of particles in the backgrounds of the Kerr black holes living in a space-time with a nonzero cosmological constant. We find that for kerr black holes living in a space-time with a negative cosmological constant (Kerr-anti-de Sitter black holes), this process of particles could happen only if the Kerr-anti-de Sitter black hole is extreme and an additional fine tuning is satisfied; while for kerr black holes living in a space-time with a positive cosmological constant (Kerr-de Sitter black holes), this process of particles could happen no matter the Kerr-de Sitter black hole is extreme or not. We also study the particle collision outside the outer horizon of the Kerr-(anti-) de Sitter black hole in some cases. We find that there is a possibility that we could tune one colliding particle's angular momentum to gain the large center-of-mass energy without increase the particle's energy.
