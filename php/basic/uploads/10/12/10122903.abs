Title: Unfolded Scalar Supermultiplet
Authors: D. S. Ponomarev and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Unfolded equations of motion for N = 1, D = 4 scalar supermultiplet are presented. We show how the superspace formulation emerges from the unfolded formulation. To analyze supersymmetric unfolded equations we extend the \sigma_-cohomology technics to the case with several operators \sigma_. The role of higher \sigma_-cohomology in the derivation of constraints is emphasized and illustrated by the example of scalar supermultiplet.
