Title: Properties of scalar perturbations generated by conformal scalar field
Authors: M. Libanov and S. Mironov and V. Rubakov
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations may be generated when complex conformal scalar field rolls down its negative quartic potential. We begin with the discussion of peculiar infrared properties of this scenario. We then consider the statistical anisotropy inherent in the model. Finally, we discuss the non-Gaussianity of scalar perturbations. Because of symmetries, the bispectrum vanishes identically. We present a general expression for the trispectrum and give its explicit form in the folded limit.
