Title: Chiral Magnetic Effect from Q-balls
Authors: Minoru Eto and Koji Hashimoto and Hideaki Iida and Akitsugu Miwa
Abstract: We apply a generic framework of linear sigma models for revealing a mechanism of the mysterious phenomenon, the chiral magnetic effect, in quark-gluon plasma. An electric current arises along a background magnetic field, which is given rise to by Q-balls (non-topological solitons) of the linear sigma model with axial anomaly. We find additional alternating current due to quark mass terms. The hadronic Q-balls, baby boson stars, may be created in heavy-ion collisions.
