Abstract: We study the g-essence model with Yukawa interactions between a scalar field $\phi$ and a Dirac field $\psi$. For the homogeneous, isotropic and flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe filled with the such g-essence, the exact solution of the model is found. Moreover, we reconstruct the corresponding scalar and fermionic potentials which describe the coupled dynamics of the scalar and fermionic fields. It is shown that some particular g-essence models with Yukawa interactions correspond to the usual and generalized Chaplygin gas unified models of dark energy and dark matter. Also we present some scalar-fermionic Dirac-Born-Infeld models corresponding g-essence models with Yukawa interactions which again describe the unified dark energy-dark matter system.
