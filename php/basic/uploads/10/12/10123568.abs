Title: Fuzzy Scalar Field Theory as Matrix Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Matthias Ihl and Christoph Sachse and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of scalar field theory on a three dimensional Euclidean spacetime whose spatial component is a fuzzy sphere. The corresponding model is an ordinary one-dimensional matrix model deformed by terms involving fixed external matrices. These terms can be approximated by multitrace expressions using a group theoretical method developed recently. The resulting matrix model is accessible to the standard techniques of matrix quantum mechanics.
