Title: Flow equations and attractors for black holes in N = 2 U(1) gauged  supergravity
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Alessandra Gnecchi
Abstract: We investigate the existence of supersymmetric static dyonic black holes with spherical horizon in the context of N= 2 U(1) gauged supergravity in four dimensions. We analyze the conditions for their existence and provide the general first-order flow equations driving the scalar fields and the metric warp factors from the asymptotic AdS4 geometry to the horizon. We work in a general duality-symmetric setup, which allows to describe both electric and magnetic gaugings. We also discuss the attractor mechanism and the issue of moduli (de-)stabilization.
