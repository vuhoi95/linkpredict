Authors: Xian-Hui Ge and Kwanghyun Jo and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider the AdS$_4$ RN black hole and work out the momentum dependent hydrodynamic analysis for the vector modes. We also perform the spectral function calculation of the dual field theory. As an application, we consider the permittivity and permeability and find that for low frequency regime, the index of refraction is found to be negative, supporting the claim made in ref.\cite{amariti} for AdS$_5$. We also find that at static limit the medium has the zero permeability, a character of the superconductivity .
