Title: The Little Skyrmion: New Dark Matter for Little Higgs Models
Authors: Marc Gillioz and Andreas von Manteuffel and Pedro Schwaller and Daniel Wyler
Abstract: We study skyrmions in the littlest Higgs model and discuss their possible role as dark matter candidates. Stable massive skyrmions can exist in the littlest Higgs model also in absence of an exact parity symmetry, since they carry a conserved topological charge due to the non-trivial third homotopy group of the SU(5)/SO(5) coset. We find a spherically symmetric skyrmion solution in this coset. The effects of gauge fields on the skyrmion solutions are analyzed and found to lead to an upper bound on the skyrmion mass. The relic abundance is in agreement with the observed dark matter density for reasonable parameter choices.
