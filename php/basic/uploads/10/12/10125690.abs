Abstract: In this paper, we have considered the g-essence and its particular cases, k-essence and f-essence, within the framework of the Einstein-Cartan theory. We have shown that a single fermionic field can give rise to the accelerated expansion within the Einstein-Cartan theory. The exact analytical solution of the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations is found. This solution describes the accelerated expansion of the Universe with the equation of state parameter $w=-1$ as in the case of $\Lambda$CDM model.
