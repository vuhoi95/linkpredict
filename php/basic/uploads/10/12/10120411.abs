Title: Thermodynamics on the Maximally Symmetric Holographic Screen and Entropy  from Conical Singularities
Authors: Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu
Abstract: For a general maximally symmetric (spherically, plane or hyperbola symmetric) holographic screen, we rewrite the equations of motion of general Lovelock gravity into the form of some generalized first law of thermodynamics, under certain ansatz. With this observation together with other two independent ways, exactly the same temperature and entropy on the screen are obtained. So it is argued that the thermodynamic interpretation of gravity is physically meaningful not only on the horizon, but also on a general maximally symmetric screen. Moreover, the formula of entropy is further checked in the (maximally symmetric) general static case and dynamical case. The entropy formula also holds for those cases. Finally, the method of conical singularity is used to calculate the entropy on such screen, and the result again confirms the entropy formula.
