Title: First-order flows and stabilisation equations for non-BPS extremal black  holes
Authors: Pietro Galli and Kevin Goldstein and Stefanos Katmadas and Jan Perz
Abstract: We derive a generalised form of flow equations for extremal static and rotating non-BPS black holes in four-dimensional ungauged N = 2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. For particular charge vectors, we give stabilisation equations for the scalars, analogous to the BPS case, describing full known solutions. Based on this, we propose a generic ansatz for the stabilisation equations, which surprisingly includes ratios of harmonic functions.
