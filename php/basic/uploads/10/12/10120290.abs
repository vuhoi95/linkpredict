Title: Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and Painlevé IV Equation
Authors: David Bermudez and David J. Fernández C
Abstract: As it has been proven, the determination of general one-dimensional Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians having third-order differential ladder operators requires to solve the Painlev\'e IV equation. In this work, it will be shown that some specific subsets of the higher-order supersymmetric partners of the harmonic oscillator possess third-order differential ladder operators. This allows us to introduce a simple technique for generating solutions of the Painlev\'e IV equation. Finally, we classify these solutions into three relevant hierarchies.
