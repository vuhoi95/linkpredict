Title: Two Moving-Angled 1-Branes with Electric Fields in a Partially Compact  Spacetime
Authors: Davoud Kamani and Niloufar Nowrouzi
Abstract: In this article we consider two $m1$-branes at angle in the presence of the background electric fields, in a partially compact spacetime. The branes have motions along a common direction that is perpendicular to both of them. Using the boundary state formalism, we calculate their interaction amplitude. Some special cases of this interaction will be studied in detail.
