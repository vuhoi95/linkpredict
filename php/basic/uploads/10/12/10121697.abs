Title: Non-Gaussianities of Single Field Inflation with Non-minimal Coupling
Authors: Taotao Qiu and Kwei-Chou Yang
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussianities of inflation driven by a single scalar field coupling non-minimally to the Einstein Gravity. We assume that the form of the scalar field is very general with an arbitrary sound speed. For convenience to study, we take the subclass that the non-minimal coupling term is linear to the Ricci scalar $R$. We define a parameter $\mu\equiv\epsilon_h/\epsilon_\theta$ where $\epsilon_h$ and $\epsilon_\theta$ are two kinds of slow-roll parameters, and obtain the dependence of the shape of the 3-point correlation function on $\mu$. We also show the estimator $F_{NL}$ in the equilateral limit. Finally, based on numerical calculations, we present the non-Gaussianities of non-minimal coupling chaotic inflation as an explicit example.
