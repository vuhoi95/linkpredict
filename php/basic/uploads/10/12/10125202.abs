Title: Inflation with a Weyl term, or ghosts at work
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Misao Sasaki and Yuuiti Sendouda and Ahmed Youssef
Abstract: In order to assess the role of ghosts in cosmology, we study the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations during inflation when a Weyl term is added to the action. Our main result is that vector perturbations can no longer be ignored and that scalar modes diverge in the newtonian gauge but remain bounded in the comoving slicing.
