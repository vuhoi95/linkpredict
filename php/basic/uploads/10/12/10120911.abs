Title: Surface operators in 3d Topological Field Theory and 2d Rational  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Natalia Saulina
Abstract: We study surface operators in 3d Topological Field Theory and their relations with 2d Rational Conformal Field Theory. We show that a surface operator gives rise to a consistent gluing of chiral and anti-chiral sectors in the 2d RCFT. The algebraic properties of the resulting 2d RCFT, such as the classification of symmetry-preserving boundary conditions, are expressed in terms of properties of the surface operator. We show that to every surface operator one may attach a Morita-equivalence class of symmetric Frobenius algebras in the ribbon category of bulk line operators. This provides a simple interpretation of the results of Fuchs, Runkel and Schweigert on the construction of 2d RCFTs from Frobenius algebras. We also show that every topological boundary condition in a 3d TFT gives rise to a commutative Frobenius algebra in the category of bulk line operators. We illustrate these general considerations by studying in detail surface operators in abelian Chern-Simons theory.
