Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of various aspects of projectable F(R) Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. We show that some versions of F(R) HL gravity may have stable de Sitter solution and instable flat space solution. In this case, the problem of scalar graviton does not appear because flat space is not vacuum state. Generalizing the U(1) HL theory proposed in arXiv:1007.2410, we formulate U(1) extension of scalar theory and of F(R) Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The Hamiltonian approach for such the theory is developed in full detail. It is demonstrated that its Hamiltonian structure is the same as for the non-relativistic covariant HL gravity. The spectrum analysis performed around flat background indicates towards the consistency of the theory because it contains graviton with only transverse polarization. Finally, we analyze the spatially-flat FRW equations for U(1) invariant F(R) Horava-Lifshitz gravity.
