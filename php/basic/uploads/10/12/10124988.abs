Title: Holographic dark energy at the Ricci scale
Authors: Iván Durán and Diego Pavón
Abstract: We consider a holographic cosmological model in which the infrared cutoff is fixed by the Ricci's length and dark matter and dark energy do not evolve separately but interact non-gravitationally with one another. This substantially alleviates the cosmic coincidence problem as the ratio between both components remains finite throughout the expansion. We constrain the model with observational data from supernovae, cosmic background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations, gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters, the history of the Hubble function, and the growth function. The model shows consistency with observation.
