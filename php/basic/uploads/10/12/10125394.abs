Abstract: We consider a supersymmetric QCD with soft supersymmetry breaking terms as the dynamics for the electroweak symmetry breaking. We find various advantages compared to the non-supersymmetric models, such as a natural incorporation of the dynamical top-quark mass generation (the topcolor mechanism), the existence of a boson-pair condensation (the composite Higgs fields) and a large anomalous dimension of the composite operator to cure the flavor-changing-neutral-current and the S-parameter crises of the technicolor theories. The knowledge of the weakly coupled description (the Seiberg duality) enables us to perform perturbative computations in strongly coupled theories. Working in a large flavor theory where perturbative calculations are reliable in the dual description, one can find a stable vacuum with chiral symmetry breaking. The top/bottom quarks and also the Higgsinos obtain masses through a dynamically generated superpotential.
