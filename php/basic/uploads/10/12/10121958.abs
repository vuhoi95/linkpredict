Title: Notes on chiral hydrodynamics within effective theory approach
Authors: A. V. Sadofyev and V. I. Shevchenko and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We address the issue of evaluating chiral effects (such as the newly discovered chiral separation) in hydrodynamic approximation. The main tool we use is effective theory which defines interaction in terms of chemical potentials $\mu,\mu_5$. In the lowest order in $\mu,\mu_5$ we reproduce recent results based on thermodynamic considerations. In higher orders the results depend on details of infrared cutoff. Another point of our interest is an alternative way of the anomaly matching through introduction of effective scalar fields arising in the hydrodynamic approximation.
