Title: Near-Horizon geometry from flux compactification
Authors: Oscar Loaiza-Brito and Liliana Vazquez-Mercado
Abstract: We study the conditions an arbitrary flux configuration must fulfill in order to construct a 4d space-time of the type $AdS_2\times S^2$ from a type IIB supergravity flux compactification in which NS-NS fluxes are included. We present a solution consisting on a compactification in the presence of 3-form NS-NS and RR fluxes. The internal manifold is a SU(3) structure six-dimensional manifold, with null curvature and with torsion. By preserving two supersymmetries in the four-dimensional low energy theory, we find a way to obtain the $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry as a near-horizon solution by compactification in non-Calabi-Yau manifolds.
