Title: Skyrmions, Rational Maps & Scaling Identities
Authors: E. G. Charalampidis and T. A. Ioannidou and N. S. Manton
Abstract: Starting from approximate Skyrmion solutions obtained using the rational map ansatz, improved approximate Skyrmions are constructed using scaling arguments. Although the energy improvement is small, the change of shape clarifies whether the true Skyrmions are more oblate or prolate.
