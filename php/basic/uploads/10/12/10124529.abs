Title: Exotic supersymmetry of the kink-antikink crystal, and the infinite  period limit
Authors: Mikhail S. Plyushchay and Adrian Arancibia and Luis-Miguel Nieto
Abstract: Some time ago, Thies et al. showed that the Gross-Neveu model with a bare mass term possesses a kink-antikink crystalline phase. Corresponding self-consistent solutions, known earlier in polymer physics, are described by a self-isospectral pair of one-gap periodic Lame potentials with a Darboux displacement depending on the bare mass. We study an unusual supersymmetry of such a second order Lame system, and show that the associated first order Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian possesses the own nonlinear supersymmetry. The Witten index is ascertained to be zero for both of the related exotic supersymmetric structures, each of which admits several alternatives for the choice of a grading operator. A restoration of the discrete chiral symmetry at zero value of the bare mass, when the kink-antikink crystalline condensate transforms into the kink crystal, is shown to be accompanied by structural changes in both of the supersymmetries. We find that the infinite period limit may or may not change the index. We also explain the origin of the Darboux dressing phenomenon recently observed in a non-periodic self-isospectral one-gap Poschl-Teller system, which describes kink-antikink baryons of Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu.
