Title: A Brachistochrone Approach to Reconstruct the Inflaton Potential
Authors: Daniel Wohns and Jiajun Xu and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: We propose a new way to implement an inflationary prior to a cosmological dataset that incorporates the inflationary observables at arbitrary order. This approach employs an exponential form for the Hubble parameter $H(\phi)$ without taking the slow-roll approximation. At lowest non-trivial order, this $H(\phi)$ has the unique property that it is the solution to the brachistochrone problem for inflation.
