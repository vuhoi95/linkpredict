Title: Dual condensate and QCD phase transition
Authors: Bo Zhang and Falk Bruckmann and Christof Gattringer and Zoltan Fodor and Kalman K. Szabo
Abstract: The dual condensate is a new QCD phase transition order parameter, which connnects confinement and chiral symmetry breaking as different mass limits. We discuss the relation between the fermion spectrum at general boundary conditions and the dual condensate and show numerical results for the latter from unquenched SU(3) lattice configurations.
