Title: Asymptotics of physical solutions to the Lorentz-Dirac equation for a  planar motion in constant electromagnetic fields
Authors: P. O. Kazinski and M. A. Shipulya
Abstract: We present a study of planar physical solutions to the Lorentz-Dirac equation in a constant electromagnetic field. In this case, we reduced the Lorentz-Dirac equation to the one second order differential equation. We obtained the asymptotics of physical solutions to this equation at large proper times. It turns out that, in the crossed constant uniform electromagnetic field with vanishing invariants, a charged particle goes to a universal regime at large times. We found the ratio of momentum components which tends to a constant determined only by the external field. This effect is essentially due to a radiation reaction. There is not such an effect for the Lorentz equation in this field.
