Abstract: We study the scattering of graphene quasiparticles by topological defects, represented by holes, pentagons and heptagons. For the case of holes, we obtain the phase shift and found that at low concentration they appear to be irrelevant for the electron transport, giving a negligible contribution to the resistivity. Whenever pentagons are introduced into the lattice and the fermionic current is constrained to move near one of them we realize that such a current is scattered with an angle that depends only on the number of pentagons and on the side the current taken. Such a deviation may be determined by means of a Young-type experiment, through the interference pattern between the two current branches scattered by a pentagon. In the case of a heptagon such a current is also scattered but it diverges from the defect, preventing a interference between two beams of current for the same heptagon.
