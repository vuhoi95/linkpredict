Title: On non-abelian T-dual geometries with Ramond fluxes
Authors: Konstadinos Sfetsos and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We show how to implement T-duality along non-abelian isometries in backgrounds with non-vanishing Ramond fields. When the dimension of the isometry group is odd (even) the duality swaps (preserves) the chirality of the theory. In certain cases a non-abelian duality can result in a massive type-IIA background. We provide two examples by dualising SU(2) isometry subgroups in $AdS_5\times S^5$ and $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$. The resultant dual geometries inherit the original AdS factors but have transverse spaces with reduced isometry and preserve only half of the original supersymmetry. The non-abelian dual of $AdS_5\times S^5$ has an M-theory lift which is related to the gravity duals of N=2 superconformal theories. We comment on a possible interpretation of this as a high spin limit.
