Title: (de)Tails of Toda CFT
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Filippo Passerini
Abstract: The relation between the partition function of N=2 gauge theories in 4d and conformal Toda field theory in 2d is explained for the case where the 4d theory is a linear quiver with "quiver tails". That is when the 4d theory has gauge groups of different rank. We propose an identification of a subset of the states of Toda CFT which represent the Coulomb-branch parameters of the different rank gauge multiplets and study their three-point functions and descendants.
