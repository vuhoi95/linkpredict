Title: Dynamic universality class of large-N gauge theories
Authors: Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: In dynamic critical phenomena, singular behaviors appear not only in the order parameter but also in the other transport coefficients (due to the mode-mode coupling). However, this effect has not been observed in the AdS/CFT duality. We point out that this mode-mode coupling is suppressed by 1/N^2 in the large-N gauge theories which correspond to model H in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin. Thus, the effect cannot be seen in the classical supergravity approximation. We illustrate this point using the example of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory at a finite chemical potential. We also discuss the implications of this result to heavy-ion collisions.
