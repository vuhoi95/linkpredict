Title: Phase transitions in Wilson loop correlator from integrability in global  AdS
Authors: Benjamin A. Burrington and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: We directly compute Wilson loop/Wilson loop correlators on ${\mathbb R}\times $S$^3$ in AdS/CFT by constructing space-like minimal surfaces that connect two space-like circular contours on the boundary of global AdS that are separated by a space-like interval. We compare these minimal surfaces to the disconnected "double cap" solutions both to regulate the area, and show when the connected/disconnected solution is preferred. We find that for sufficiently large Wilson loops no transition occurs because the Wilson loops cannot be sufficiently separated on the sphere. This may be considered an effect similar to the Hawking-Page transition: the size of the sphere introduces a new scale into the problem, and so one can expect phase transitions to depend on this data. To construct the minimal area solutions, we employ a reduction a la Arutyunov-Russo-Tseytlin (used by them for spinning strings), and rely on the integrability of the reduced set of equations to write explicit results.
