Title: Quark Number Susceptibility with Finite Quark Mass in Holographic QCD
Authors: Kyung-il Kim and Youngman Kim and Shingo Takeuchi and Takuya Tsukioka
Abstract: We study the effect of a finite quark mass on the quark number susceptibility in the framework of holographic QCD. We work in a bottom-up model with a deformed AdS black hole and D3/D7 model to calculate the quark number susceptibility at finite temperature with/without a finite quark chemical potential. As expected the finite quark mass suppresses the quark number susceptibility. We find that at high temperatures $T\ge 600$ MeV the quark number susceptibility of light quarks and heavy quarks are almost equal in the bottom-up model. This indicates that the heavy quark like charm contribution to thermodynamics of a QCD-like system may start to become significant at temperatures $T\sim 600$ MeV. In D3/D7 model, we focus on the competition between the quark chemical potential, which enhances the quark number susceptibility, and the quark mass that suppresses the susceptibility. We observe that depending on the relative values of the quark mass and the quark chemical potential, the quark number susceptibility shows a diverging or converging behavior. We also calculate the chiral susceptibility in D3/D7 model to support the observation made with the quark number susceptibility.
