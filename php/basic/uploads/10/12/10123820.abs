Title: Holographic superconductor models in the non-minimal derivative coupling  theory
Authors: Songbai Chen and Qiyuan Pan and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We study a general class of holographic superconductor models via the St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism in the non-minimal derivative coupling theory in which the charged scalar field is kinetically coupling to Einstein's tensor. We explore the effects of the coupling parameter on the critical temperature, the order of phase transitions and the critical exponents near the second-order phase transition point. Moreover, we compute the electric conductive using the probe approximation and check the ratios $\omega_g/T_c$ for the different coupling parameters.
