Title: Y-system and beta-deformed N=4 Super-Yang-Mills
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk
Abstract: We show how the perturbation theory results recently obtained by F.Fiamberti, A.Santambrogio, C.Sieg and D.Zanon for operator anomalous dimensions of beta-deformed Super-Yang-Mills theory can be reproduced from the AdS5/CFT4 Y-system proposed by N.G., V.Kazakov and P.Vieira. To do this, we obtain the general twisted asymptotic solution of this Y-system of functional equations. We show that existence of an additional parameter beta in the deformed theory allows to extract rich information about the perturbation theory integrals directly from Y-system. Using this method we found a simple generating function for a broad class of such integrals.
