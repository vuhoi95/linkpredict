Title: Poincar√© Covariant k-Minkowski Spacetime
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Gherardo Piacitelli
Abstract: A fully Poincare' covariant model is constructed out of the k-Minkowski spacetime. Covariance is implemented by a unitary representation of the Poincare' group, and thus complies with the original Wigner approach to quantum symmetries. This provides yet another example (besides the DFR model), where Poincare' covariance is realised a` la Wigner in the presence of two characteristic dimensionful parameters: the light speed and the Planck length. In other words, a Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) framework may well be realised without deforming the meaning of "Poincare covariance".
