Title: Superspace methods for the computation of wrapping effects in the  standard and beta-deformed N=4 SYM
Authors: Francesco Fiamberti and Alberto Santambrogio and Christoph Sieg
Abstract: We review the general procedure for the field-theoretical computation of wrapping effects in standard and beta-deformed N=4 super Yang-Mills by means of N=1 superspace techniques. In the undeformed theory, these methods allowed to find explicit results at four and five loops for two-impurity operators. In the deformed case, a general expression for the finite-size correction to the anomalous dimension of single-impurity operators at the critical order was obtained.
