Title: Effective Values of Komar Conserved Quantities and Their Applications
Authors: Sujoy Kumar Modak and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: We calculate the effective Komar angular momentum for the Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole. This result is valid at any radial distance on and outside the black hole event horizon. The effcetive values of mass and angular momentum are then used to derive an identity ($K_{\chi^{\mu}}=2ST$) which relates the Komar conserved charge ($K_{\chi^{\mu}}$) corresponding to the null Killing vector ($\chi^{\mu}$) with the thermodynamic quantities of this black hole. As an application of this identity the generalised Smarr formula for this black hole is derived. This establishes the fact that the above identity is a local form of the inherently non-local generalised Smarr formula.
