Title: Comparison of Variations of Statistical and Wald's Entropies
Authors: Merav Hadad and Judy Kupferman
Abstract: We write the variation of the statistical entropy of matter fields outside a black hole along a Killing vector. This is done for generalized theories of gravity, using a Lie derivative and identification of the energy momentum tensor.
