Title: Boundary correlation numbers in one matrix model
Authors: Goro Ishiki and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We introduce one matrix model coupled to multi-flavor vectors. The two-flavor vector model is demonstrated to reproduce the two-point correlation numbers of boundary primary fields of two dimensional (2, 2p+1) minimal Liouville gravity on disk, generalizing the loop operator (resolvent) description. The model can properly describe non-trivial boundary conditions for the matter Cardy state as well as for the Liouville field. From this we propose that the n-flavor vector model will be suited for producing the boundary correlation numbers with n different boundary conditions on disk.
