Abstract: We propose a new lattice superfield formalism in momentum representation which accommodates species doublers of the lattice fermions and their bosonic counterparts as super multiplets. We explicitly show that one dimensional N=2 model with interactions has exact Lie algebraic supersymmetry on the lattice for all super charges. In coordinate representation the finite difference operator is made to satisfy Leibnitz rule by introducing a non local product, the ``star'' product, and the exact lattice supersymmetry is realized. The standard momentum conservation is replaced on the lattice by the conservation of the sine of the momentum, which plays a crucial role in the formulation. Half lattice spacing structure is essential for the one dimensional model and the lattice supersymmetry transformation can be identified as a half lattice spacing translation combined with alternating sign structure. Invariance under finite translations and locality in the continuum limit are explicitly investigated and shown to be recovered. Supersymmetric Ward identities are shown to be satisfied at one loop level. Lie algebraic lattice supersymmetry algebra of this model suggests a close connection with Hopf algebraic exactness of the link approach formulation of lattice supersymmetry.
