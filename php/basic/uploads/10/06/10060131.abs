Title: Stable mass hierarchies and dark matter from hidden sectors in the  scale-invariant standard model
Authors: Robert Foot and Archil Kobakhidze and Raymond R. Volkas
Abstract: Scale invariance may be a classical symmetry which is broken radiatively. This provides a simple way to stabilise the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking against radiative corrections. But for such a theory to be fully realistic, it must actually incorporate a hierarchy of scales, including the Planck and the neutrino mass scales in addition to the electroweak scale. The dark matter sector and the physics responsible for baryogenesis may or may not require new scales, depending on the scenario. We develop a generic way of using hidden sectors to construct a technically-natural hierarchy of scales in the framework of classically scale-invariant theories. We then apply the method to generate the Planck mass and to solve the neutrino mass and dark matter problems through what may be termed the "scale-invariant standard model". The model is perturbatively renormalisable for energy scales up to the Planck mass.
