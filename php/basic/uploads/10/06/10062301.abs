Title: Universal properties of Ising clusters and droplets near criticality
Authors: Gesualdo Delfino and Jacopo Viti
Abstract: Clusters and droplets of positive spins in the two-dimensional Ising model percolate at the Curie temperature in absence of external field. The percolative exponents coincide with the magnetic ones for droplets but not for clusters. We use integrable field theory to determine amplitude ratios which characterize the approach to criticality within these two universality classes of percolative critical behavior.
