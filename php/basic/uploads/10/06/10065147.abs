Title: On black holes in multidimensional theory with Ricci-flat internal  spaces
Authors: S. B. Fadeev and V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: A generalization of the Tangherlini solution for the case of n internal Ricci-flat spaces is obtained. It is shown that in the (2+d)-dimensional section a horizon exists only in the trivial case when the internal-space factors are constant. The p-adic analog of the solution is also considered.
