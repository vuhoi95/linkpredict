Title: Quantum Strings and the AdS4/CFT3 Interpolating Function
Authors: Michael C. Abbott and InÃªs Aniceto and Diego Bombardelli
Abstract: The existence of a nontrivial interpolating function h(\lambda) is one of the novel features of the new AdS4/CFT3 correspondence involving ABJM theory. At strong coupling, most of the investigation of semiclassical effects so far has been for strings in the AdS4 sector. Several cutoff prescriptions have been proposed, leading to different predictions for the constant term in the expansion h(\lambda)=\sqrt{\lambda/2} + c + ... . We calculate quantum corrections for giant magnons, using the algebraic curve, and show by comparing to the dispersion relation that the same prescriptions lead to the same values of c in this CP3 sector. We then turn to finite-J effects, where a comparison with the Luescher F-term correction shows a mismatch for one of the three sum prescriptions. We also compute some dyonic and higher F-terms for future comparisons.
