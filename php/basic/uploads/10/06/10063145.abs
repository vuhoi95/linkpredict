Title: On SUSY breaking from NL/L SUSY relation
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show in two dimensional space-time (d = 2) the relation between a N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetric (NLSUSY) model and a N = 2 linear (L) SUSY Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with matter (N = 2 LSUSY QCD theory). We give a new interpretation of four Nambu-Goldstone fermion (superon) contact terms, which emerge from a N = 2 general SUSY QCD (composite) action, as mass terms for LSUSY supermultiplets and discuss the possible SUSY breaking mechanism in NL/L SUSY relation for SUSY gauge theories in d = 2.
