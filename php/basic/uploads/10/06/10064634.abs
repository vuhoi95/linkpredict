Title: An elementary stringy estimate of transport coefficients of large  temperature QCD
Authors: Francesco Bigazzi and Aldo L. Cotrone
Abstract: Modeling QCD at large temperature with a simple holographic five dimensional theory encoding minimal breaking of conformality, allows for the calculation of all the transport coefficients, up to second order, in terms of a single parameter. In particular, the shear and bulk relaxation times are provided. The result follows by deforming the AdS background with a scalar dual to a marginally relevant operator, at leading order in the deformation parameter.
