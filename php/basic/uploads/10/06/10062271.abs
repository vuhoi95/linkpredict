Title: A Conformal Gauge Mediation and Dark Matter with Only One Parameter
Authors: Tsutomu T. Yanagida and Kazuya Yonekura
Abstract: If the supersymmetry (SUSY) is a solution to the hierarchy problem, it is puzzling that any SUSY particle has not been discovered yet. We show that there is a low-scale conformal gauge mediation model which contains all necessary ingredients, i.e. not only a SUSY-breaking dynamics and a gauge mediation mechanism, but also a candidate for the dark matter. The model has only one free parameter, that is, the mass for messengers. In this model, the dark matter is provided by a composite particle in the SUSY-breaking sector, and the observed value of the dark matter density uniquely fixes the mass of messengers at the order of 10^2 TeV. Then, the sfermion and gaugino masses are fixed to be of order 10^2~10^3 GEV without any arbitrariness, thus the SUSY particles are expected not to be discovered at the Tevatron or LEP, while having a discovery possibility at the LHC.
