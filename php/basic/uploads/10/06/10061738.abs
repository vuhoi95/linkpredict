Title: Sandage-Loeb test for the new agegraphic and Ricci dark energy models
Authors: Jingfei Zhang and Li Zhang and Xin Zhang
Abstract: The Sandage-Loeb (SL) test is a unique method to explore dark energy at the ``redshift desert'' ($2\lesssim z\lesssim 5$), an era not covered by any other dark energy probes, by directly measuring the temporal variation of the redshift of quasar (QSO) Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption lines. In this paper, we study the prospects for constraining the new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) model and the Ricci dark energy (RDE) model with the SL test. We show that, assuming only a ten-year survey, the SL test can constrain these two models with high significance.
