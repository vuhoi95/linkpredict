Title: Black hole solutions in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity with cubic terms
Authors: G. Koutsoumbas and P. Pasipoularides
Abstract: We study four dimensional non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz type gravity, in the case of an action with terms, cubic in curvature. For special choices of the free parameters of the model, we obtain two new analytic black hole solutions which exhibit the standard Schwarzschild asymptotic behavior in the large distance limit. The effect of cubic terms in the short range behavior of the black hole solutions is discussed.
