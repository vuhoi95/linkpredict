Title: Fermion Condensate and Vacuum Current Density Induced by Homogeneous and  Inhomogeneous Magnetic Fields in (2+1)-Dimensions
Authors: Alfredo Raya and Edward Reyes
Abstract: We calculate the condensate and the vacuum current density induced by external static magnetic fields in (2+1)-dimensions. At the perturbative level, we consider an exponentially decaying magnetic field along one cartesian coordinate. Non-perturbatively, we obtain the fermion propagator in the presence of a uniform magnetic field by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation in the rainbow-ladder approximation. In the large flux limit, we observe that both these quantities, either perturbative (inhomogeneous) and non-perturbative (homogeneous), are proportional to the external field, in agreement with early expectations.
