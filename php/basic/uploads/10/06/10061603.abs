Title: Exact (1+1)-dimensional flows of a perfect fluid
Authors: Robi Peschanski and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We present a general solution of relativistic (1+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction as a function of time, uniformly in transverse space. The Khalatnikov potential is expressed as a linear combination of two generating functions with polynomial coefficients of 2 variables. The polynomials, whose algebraic equations are solved, define an infinite-dimensional basis of solutions. The kinematics of the (1+1)-dimensional flow are reconstructed from the potential.
