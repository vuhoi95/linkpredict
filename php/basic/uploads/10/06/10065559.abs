Abstract: In the generalized minimal supergravity (GmSUGRA) scenario, we systematically study the supersymmetry breaking scalar masses, Standard Model fermion Yukawa coupling terms, and trilinear soft terms in SU(5) models with the Higgs fields in the {\bf 24} and {\bf 75} representations, and in SO(10) models where the gauge symmetry is broken down to the Pati-Salam SU(4)_C X SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R gauge symmetry, SU(3)_C X SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R X U(1)_{B-L} gauge symmetry, George-Glashow SU(5) X U(1)' gauge symmetry, flipped SU(5) X U(1)_X gauge symmetry, and SU(3)_C X SU(2)_L X U(1)_1 X U(1)_2 gauge symmetry. Most importantly, we for the first time consider the scalar and gaugino mass relations, which can be preserved from the unification scale to the electroweak scale under one-loop renormalization group equation running, in the SU(5) models, the Pati-Salam models and flipped SU(5) X U(1)_X models arising from SO(10) models. With such interesting relations, we may distinguish the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) and GmSUGRA scenarios if the supersymmetric particle spectrum can be measured at the LHC and ILC. Thus, it provides us with another important window of opportunity at the Planck scale.
