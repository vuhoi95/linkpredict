Title: A master solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and classical  discrete integrable equations
Authors: Vladimir V. Bazhanov and Sergey M. Sergeev
Abstract: We obtain a new solution of the star-triangle relation with positive Boltzmann weights which contains as special cases all continuous and discrete spin solutions of this relation, that were previously known. This new master solution defines an exactly solvable 2D lattice model of statistical mechanics, which involves continuous spin variables, living on a circle, and contains two temperature-like parameters. If one of the these parameters approaches a root of unity (corresponds to zero temperature), the spin variables freezes into discrete positions, equidistantly spaced on the circle. An absolute orientation of these positions on the circle slowly changes between lattice sites by overall rotations. Allowed configurations of these rotations are described by classical discrete integrable equations, closely related to the famous $Q_4$-equations by Adler Bobenko and Suris. Fluctuations between degenerate ground states in the vicinity of zero temperature are described by a rather general integrable lattice model with discrete spin variables. In some simple special cases the latter reduces to the Kashiwara-Miwa and chiral Potts models.
