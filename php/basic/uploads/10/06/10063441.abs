Title: Collapse of Vacuum Bubbles in a Vacuum
Authors: Kin-Wang Ng and Shang-Yung Wang
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of a plenitude of metastable vacua in a string landscape and the possibility of rapid tunneling between these vacua, we revisit the dynamics of a false vacuum bubble in a background de Sitter spacetime. We find that there exists a large parameter space that allows the bubble to collapse into a black hole or to form a wormhole. This may have interesting implications to inflationary physics.
