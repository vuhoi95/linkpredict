Authors: Alexander B. Goncharov and Marcus Spradlin and C. Vergu and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We present a compact analytic formula for the two-loop six-particle MHV remainder function (equivalently, the two-loop light-like hexagon Wilson loop) in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of the classical polylogarithm functions Li_k with cross-ratios of momentum twistor invariants as their arguments. In deriving our result we rely on results from the theory of motives.
