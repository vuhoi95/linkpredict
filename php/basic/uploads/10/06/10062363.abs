Abstract: We study phenomenological aspects of the holographic model of chiral symmetry breaking recently introduced by Kuperstein and Sonnenschein (KS). As a first step, we calculate the spectrum of vector and axial-vector mesons in the KS model. We numerically compute various coupling constants of the mesons and pions. Our analysis indicates that vector meson dominance is realized in this model. The pion, vector meson and axial-vector meson form factors are obtained and studied in detail. We find good agreement with QCD results. In particular, the pion form factor closely matches available experimental data.
