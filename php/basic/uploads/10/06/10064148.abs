Title: Geocentric cosmology: a new look at the measure problem
Authors: Mahdiyar Noorbala and Vitaly Vanchurin
Abstract: We show that most of cutoff measures of the multiverse violate some of the basic properties of probability theory when applied repeatedly to predict the results of local experiments. Starting from minimal assumptions, such as Markov property, we derive a correspondence between cosmological measures and quantum field theories in one lesser dimension. The correspondence allows us to replace the picture of an infinite multiverse with a finite causally connected region accessible by a given observer in conjunction with a Euclidean theory defined on its past boundary.
