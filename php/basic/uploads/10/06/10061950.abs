Title: Probability of the most massive cluster under non-Gaussian initial  conditions
Authors: Laura Cay√≥n and Christopher Gordon and Joseph Silk
Abstract: Very massive high redshift clusters can be used to constrain and test the Lambda CDM model. Taking into account the observational constraints of Jee et al. (2009) we have calculated the probability for the most massive cluster to be found in the range (5.2-7.6)e14 M_sun, between redshifts 1.4-2.2, with a sky area of 11 sqdeg and under non-Gaussian initial conditions. Clusters constrain the non-Gaussianity on smaller scales than current cosmic microwave background or halo bias data and so can be used to test for running of the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL.
