Title: On non-minimal N=4 supermultiplets in 1D and their associated  sigma-models
Authors: Marcelo Gonzales and Sadi Khodaee and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: We construct the non-minimal linear representations of the N=4 Extended Supersymmetry in one-dimension. They act on 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic fields. Inequivalent representations are specified by the mass-dimension of the fields and the connectivity of the associated graphs. The oxidation to minimal N=5 linear representations is given. Two types of N=4 sigma-models based on non-minimal representations are obtained: the resulting off-shell actions are either manifestly invariant or depend on a constrained prepotential. The connectivity properties of the graphs play a decisive role in discriminating inequivalent actions. These results find application in partial breaking of supersymmetric theories.
