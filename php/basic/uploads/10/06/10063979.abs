Title: De Sitter ground state of scalar-tensor gravity and its fluctuation with  dust
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Xin-Zhou Li
Abstract: An exact de Sitter solution of scalar-tensor gravity is found, in which the non-minimal coupling scalar is rolling along a non-constant potential. Based on this solution, a dust-filled FRW universe is explored in frame of scalar-tensor gravity. The effective dark energy induced by the sole non-minimal scalar can be quintessence-like, phantom-like, and more significantly, can cross the phantom divide. The rich and varied properties of scalar-tensor gravity even with only one scalar is shown in this article.
