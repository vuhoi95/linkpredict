Title: Phantom "renormalization" of mass of a quantized electric charge
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and I. Kulnazarov and R. Myrzakulov
Abstract: A regular wormhole solution in gravity coupled with a phantom scalar and electromagnetic fields is found. The solution exists for a special choice of the parameter $f$ of the potential term. The mass $m$ of a wormhole filled with a phantom and electrostatic fields is calculated. It is shown that close to some point $f_0$ a small value of the mass $m$ is the remainder of two big masses of the phantom and electrostatic fields. The connection with the renormalization procedure in quantum filed theory is considered. The connection between Wheeler's idea ``mass without mass'' and renormalization procedure in quantum field theory is discussed.
