Title: Compact hyperbolic extra dimensions: a M-theory solution and its  implications for the LHC
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Seong Chan Park
Abstract: We study M-theory solutions involving compact hyperbolic spaces. The combination of a gap `a la Randall-Sundrum and the topology of an internal Riemann surface allows a geometrical solution to the hierarchy problem that does not require light Kaluza--Klein modes. We comment on the consequences of such a compactification for LHC physics.
