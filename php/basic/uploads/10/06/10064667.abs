Title: A shear spectral sum rule in a non-conformal gravity dual
Authors: Todd Springer and Charles Gale and Sangyong Jeon and Su Houng Lee
Abstract: A sum rule which relates a stress-energy tensor correlator to thermodynamic functions is examined within the context of a simple non-conformal gravity dual. Such a sum rule was previously derived using AdS/CFT for conformal $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, but we show that it does not generalize to the non-conformal theory under consideration. We provide a generalized sum rule and numerically verify its validity. A useful byproduct of the calculation is the computation of the spectral density in a strongly coupled non-conformal theory. Qualitative features of the spectral densities and implications for lattice measurements of transport coefficients are discussed.
