Title: Antilinear spectral symmetry and the vortex zero-modes in topological  insulators and graphene
Authors: Igor F. Herbut and Chi-Ken Lu
Abstract: We construct the general extension of the four-dimensional Jackiw-Rossi-Dirac Hamiltonian that preserves the antilinear reflection symmetry between the positive and negative energy eigenstates. Among other systems, the resulting Hamiltonian describes the s-wave superconducting vortex at the surface of the topological insulator, at a finite chemical potential, and in the presence of both Zeeman and orbital couplings to the external magnetic field. Here we find that the bound zero-mode exists only when the Zeeman term is below a critical value. Other physical realizations pertaining to graphene are considered, and some novel zero-energy wave functions are analytically computed.
