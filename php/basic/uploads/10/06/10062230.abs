Title: On the geometrization of matter by exotic smoothness
Authors: Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga and Helge Rose
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the question how matter may emerge from space. For that purpose we consider the smoothness structure of spacetime as underlying structure for a geometrical model of matter. For a large class of compact 4-manifolds, the elliptic surfaces, one is able to apply the knot surgery of Fintushel and Stern to change the smoothness structure. The influence of this surgery to the Einstein-Hilbert action is discussed. Using the Weierstrass representation, we are able to show that the knotted torus used in knot surgery is represented by a spinor fulfilling the Dirac equation and leading to a mass-less Dirac term in the Einstein-Hilbert action. For sufficient complicated links and knots, there are "connecting tubes" (graph manifolds, torus bundles) which introduce an action term of a gauge field. Both terms are genuinely geometrical and characterized by the mean curvature of the components. We also discuss the gauge group of the theory to be U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3).
