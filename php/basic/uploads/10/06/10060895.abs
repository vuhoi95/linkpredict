Title: Characterizing Topological Order in Superconducting Systems
Authors: M. Cristina Diamantini and Pasquale Sodano
Abstract: Two established frameworks account for the onset of a gap in a superconducting system: one is based on spontaneous symmetry breaking via the Anderson-Higgs-Kibble mechanism, and the other is based on the recently developed paradigm of topological order. We show that, on manifolds with non trivial topology, both mechanisms yield a degeneracy of the ground state arising only from the {\it incompressibility} induced by the presence of a gap. We compute the topological entanglement entropy of a topological superconductor and argue that its measure allows to {\it distinguish} between the two mechanisms of generating a superconducting gap.
