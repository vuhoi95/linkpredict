Title: Quasiparticle scattering from vortices in d-wave superconductors I:  Superflow contribution
Authors: M. Kulkarni and Sriram Ganeshan and A. C. Durst
Abstract: In the vortex state of a d-wave superconductor, massless Dirac quasiparticles are scattered from magnetic vortices via a combination of two basic mechanisms: effective potential scattering due to the superflow swirling about the vortices and Aharonov-Bohm scattering due to the Berry phase acquired by a quasiparticle upon circling a vortex. In this paper, we study the superflow contribution by calculating the differential cross section for a quasiparticle scattering from the effective non-central potential of a single vortex. We solve the massless Dirac equation in polar coordinates and obtain the cross section via a partial wave analysis. We also present a more transparent Born-limit calculation and in this approximation we provide an analytic expression for the differential cross section. The Berry phase contribution to the quasiparticle scattering is considered in a separate paper.
