Title: Unscreening the Gaugino Mass with Chiral Messengers
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Gabriele Ferretti and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: Gaugino screening, the absence of next-to-leading order corrections to gaugino masses, is a generic feature of gauge mediation models of supersymmetry breaking. We show that in a specific class of models, known as semi-direct gauge mediation, it is possible to avoid gaugino screening by allowing for a chiral messenger sector. Messengers then acquire a mass at some scale, for instance by higgsing or by some auxiliary strong coupling dynamics. We implement this idea in a simple model which we work out explicitly.
