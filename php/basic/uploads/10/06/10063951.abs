Title: Repulsive Casimir Force: Sufficient Conditions
Authors: Luigi Rosa and Astrid Lambrecht
Abstract: In this paper the Casimir energy of two parallel plates made by materials of different penetration depth and no medium in between is derived. We study the Casimir force density and derive analytical constraints on the two penetration depths which are sufficient conditions to ensure repulsion. Compared to other methods our approach needs no specific model for dielectric or magnetic material properties and constitutes a complementary analysis.
