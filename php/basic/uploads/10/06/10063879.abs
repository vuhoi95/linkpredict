Abstract: This work deals with $F(T)$ gravity models driven by real scalar fields with usual and phantom dynamics. We illustrate the results with examples of current interest, and we find some analytical solutions for scale factors and scalar fields. The results indicate that torsion-scalar models also admit the accelerated expansion of the universe.
