Title: On the pulsating strings in AdS_5 x T^{1,1}
Authors: D. Arnaudov and H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We study the class of pulsating strings in AdS_5 x T^{1,1}. Using a generalized ansatz for pulsating string configurations we find new solutions of this class. Further we semiclassically quantize the theory and obtain the first correction to the energy. The latter, due to AdS/CFT correspondence, is supposed to give the anomalous dimensions of operators in the dual N=1 superconformal gauge field theory.
