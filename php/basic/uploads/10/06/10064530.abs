Title: T-Duality For String in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: J. Kluson and K. L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We continue our study of the Lorentz breaking string theories. These theories are defined as string theory with modified Hamiltonian constraint which breaks the Lorentz symmetry of target space-time. We analyze properties of this theory in the target space-time that possesses isometry along one direction. We also derive the T-duality rules for Lorentz breaking string theories and show that they are the same as that of Buscher's T-duality for the relativistic strings.
