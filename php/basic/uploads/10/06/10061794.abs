Title: Gyratons on Melvin spacetime
Authors: Hedvika Kadlecova and Pavel Krtous
Abstract: We present and analyze new exact gyraton solutions of algebraic type II on a background which is static, cylindrically symmetric Melvin universe of type D. For a vanishing electromagnetic field it reduces to previously studied gyratons on Minkowski background. We demonstrate that the solutions are member of a more general family of the Kundt spacetimes. We show that the Einstein equations reduce to a set of mostly linear equations on a transverse 2-space and we discuss the properties of polynomial scalar curvature invariants which are generally non-constant but unaffected by the presence of gyratons.
