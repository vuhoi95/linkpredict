Title: Holographic dark energy in Brans-Dicke cosmology with chameleon scalar  field
Authors: M. R. Setare and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: We study a cosmological implication of holographic dark energy in the Brans-Dicke gravity. We employ the holographic model of dark energy to obtain the equation of state for the holographic energy density in non-flat (closed) universe enclosed by the event horizon measured from the sphere of horizon named $L$. Our analysis shows that one can obtain the phantom crossing scenario if the model parameter $\alpha$ (of order unity) is tuned accordingly. Moreover, this behavior is achieved by treating the Brans-Dicke scalar field as a Chameleon scalar field and taking a non-minimal coupling of the scalar field with matter. Hence one can generate phantom-like equation of state from a holographic dark energy model in non-flat universe in the Brans-Dicke cosmology framework.
