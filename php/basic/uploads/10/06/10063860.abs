Title: Analytical treatment of SUSY Quasi-normal modes in a non-rotating  Schwarzschild black hole
Authors: Pablo Alejandro Sanchez and Jesus Martin Romero and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We use the Fock-Ivanenko formalism to obtain the Dirac equation which describes the interaction of a massless 1/2-spin neutral fermion with a gravitational field around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). We obtain approximated analytical solutions for the eigenvalues of the energy (quasi-normal frequencies) and their corresponding eigenstates (quasi-normal states). The interesting result is that all the excited states [and their supersymmetric (SUSY) partners] have a purely imaginary frequency, which can be expressed in terms of the Hawking temperature. Furthermore, as one expects for SUSY Hamiltonians, the isolated bottom state has a real null energy eigenvalue.
