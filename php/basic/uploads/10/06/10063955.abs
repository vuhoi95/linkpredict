Title: Generalized self-dual Chern-Simons vortices
Authors: D. Bazeia and E. da Hora and C. dos Santos and R. Menezes
Abstract: We search for vortices in a generalized Abelian Chern-Simons model with a nonstandard kinetic term. We illustrate our results, plotting and comparing several features of the vortex solution of the generalized model with those of the vortex solution found in the standard Chern-Simons model.
