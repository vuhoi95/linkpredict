Title: Modification of black-body radiance at low temperatures and frequencies
Authors: Carlos Falquez and Ralf Hofmann and Tilo Baumbach
Abstract: In contrast to earlier reports, where the spectrum of the {\sl energy density} of photonic black-body radiation modified by SU(2) effects was discussed, we discuss the low-frequency spectrum of the {\sl radiance} at temperatures ranging between 5 and 20 Kelvin. We conclude that compared to the conventional theory the only observable effect is associated with the spectral gap (total screening). We also discuss how a low-temperature black body cavity under the influence of a sufficiently strong static electric field is forced to emit according to Planck's radiation law (pure U(1) theory) even at low frequencies and how this effect can be utilized to measure SU(2) induced deviations.
