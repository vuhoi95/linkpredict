Title: First law of thermodynamics on holographic screens in entropic force  frame
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Jian-Long Li
Abstract: By following the spirit of Verlinde's entropic force proposal arXiv:1001.0785, we give the differential and integral form of the first law of thermodynamics on the holographic screen enclosing a spherical symmetric black hole. It is consistent with equipartition principle and the form of Komar mass. The entropy of the holographic screen determines its area, i. e. $S=\frac{A}{4}$. And then we express the metric by thermodynamic variables, to give an illustration of how the space is foliated by the thermodynamical potentials.
