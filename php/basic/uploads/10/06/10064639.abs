Authors: G. A. Contrera and M. Orsaria and N. N. Scoccola
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in the framework of a non-local SU(2) chiral quark model which includes wave function renormalization and coupling to the Polyakov loop. Both non-local interactions based on the frequently used exponential form factor, and on fits to the quark mass and renormalization functions obtained in lattice calculations are considered. Special attention is paid to the determination of the critical points, both in the chiral limit and at finite quark mass. In particular, we study the position of the Critical End Point as well as the value of the associated critical exponents for different model parameterizations.
