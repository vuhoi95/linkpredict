Title: Strange Metallic Behavior in Anisotropic Background
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Da-Wei Pang and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We continue our analysis on conductivity in the anisotropic background by employing the D-brane probe technique, where the D-branes play the role of charge carriers. The DC and AC conductivity for massless charge carriers are obtained analytically, while interesting curves for the AC conductivity are also plotted. For massive charge carriers, we calculate the DC and AC conductivities in the dilute limit and we fix the parameters in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory so that the background exhibits the same scaling behaviors as those for real-world strange metals. The DC conductivity at finite density is also computed.
