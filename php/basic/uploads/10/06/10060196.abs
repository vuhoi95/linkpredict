Title: One-loop corrections to the power spectrum in general single-field  inflation
Authors: Nicola Bartolo and Emanuela Dimastrogiovanni and Alberto Vallinotto
Abstract: We perform a thorough computation of the one-loop corrections from both scalar and tensor degrees of freedom to the power spectrum of curvature fluctuations for non-canonical Lagrangians in single-field inflation. We consider models characterized by a small sound speed c_{s}, which produce large non-Gaussianities. As expected, the corrections turn out to be inversely proportional to powers of c_{s}; evaluating their amplitudes it is then possible to derive some theoretical bounds on the sound speed by requesting the conditions necessary for perturbation theory to hold.
