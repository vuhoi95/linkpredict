Title: Conformal Cosmological Model Parameters with Distant SNe Ia Data: "gold"  and "silver"
Authors: Alexander F. Zakharov and Victor N. Pervushin
Abstract: Assuming that supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) are standard candles one could use them to test cosmological theories. The Hubble Space Telescope team analyzed 186 SNe Ia\cite{Riess_04} to test the Standard Cosmological model (SC) associated with expanded lengths in the Universe and evaluate its parameters. We use the same sample to determine parameters of Conformal Cosmological model (CC) with relative reference units of intervals, so that conformal quantities of General Relativity are interpreted as observables. We concluded, that really the test is extremely useful and allows to evaluate parameters of the model. From a formal statistical point of view the best fit of the CC model is almost the same quality approximation as the best fit of SC model with $\Omega_\Lambda=0.72, \Omega_m=0.28$. As it was noted earlier, for CC models, a rigid matter component could substitute the $\Lambda$-term (or quintessence) existing in the SC model. We note that a free massless scalar field can generate such a rigid matter. We describe results of our analysis for more recent "gold" data (for 192 SNe Ia).
