Title: U(2,2) gravity on noncommutative space with symplectic structure
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Zhao Xue and Shao-Jun Zhang
Abstract: The classical Einstein's gravity can be reformulated from the constrained U(2,2) gauge theory on the ordinary (commutative) four-dimensional spacetime. Here we consider a noncommutative manifold with a symplectic structure and construct a U(2,2) gauge theory on such a manifold by using the covariant coordinate method. Then we use the Seiberg-Witten map to express noncommutative quantities in terms of their commutative counterparts up to the first-order in noncommutative parameters. After imposing constraints we obtain a noncommutative gravity theory described by the Lagrangian with up to nonvanishing first order corrections in noncommutative parameters. This result coincides with our previous one obtained for the noncommutative SL(2,C) gravity.
