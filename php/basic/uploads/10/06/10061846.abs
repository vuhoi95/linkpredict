Title: Holographic Non-Fermi Liquids and the Luttinger Theorem
Authors: Finn Larsen and Greg van Anders
Abstract: We show that the Luttinger theorem, a robust feature of Fermi liquids, can be violated in non-Fermi liquids. We compute non-Fermi liquid Green functions using duality to black holes and find that the volume of the Fermi surface depends exponentially on the scaling dimension, which is a measure of the coupling. This demonstrates that Luttinger's theorem does not extend to non-Fermi liquids. We comment on possible experimental signatures.
