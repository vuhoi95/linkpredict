Title: On the infrared behaviour of 3d Chern-Simons theories in N=2 superspace
Authors: Matias Leoni and Andrea Mauri
Abstract: We discuss the problem of infrared divergences in the N=2 superspace approach to classically marginal three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theories. Considering the specific case of ABJM theory, we describe the origin of such divergences and offer a prescription to eliminate them by introducing non-trivial gauge-fixing terms in the action. We also comment on the extension of our procedure to higher loop order and to general three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter models.
