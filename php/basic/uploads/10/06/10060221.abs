Title: Mathieu twining characters for K3
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Stefan Hohenegger and Roberto Volpato
Abstract: The analogue of the McKay-Thompson series for the proposed Mathieu group action on the elliptic genus of K3 is analysed. The corresponding NS-sector twining characters have good modular properties and satisfy remarkable replication identities. These observations provide strong support for the conjecture that the elliptic genus of K3 carries indeed an action of the Mathieu group M24.
