Abstract: We study the modifications induced by spacetime anisotropy on the Casimir effect in the case of two parallel plates. Nonperturbative and perturbative regimes are analyzed. In the first case the Casimir force either vanishes or it reverses its direction which, in any case, makes the proposal untenable. On the other hand, the perturbative model enables us to incorporate appropriately the effects of spacetime anisotropy.
