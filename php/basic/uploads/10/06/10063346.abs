Title: Correlation Functions in N=3 Superconformal Theory
Authors: Dmitriy Drichel and Michael Flohr
Abstract: Using a superspace representation of the N=3 Neveau-Schwarz super Virasoro algebra, we find solutions of N=3 super Ward identities. Global transformations generated by the non-abelian supercurrent require not only superfields, but also functions of Grassmann variables (in particular correlation functions and their linear combinations) to be su(2) representations. As a consequence, the only admissible fields in the theory are isospin singlets and doublets. We show how to compute the generic form of any N=3 n-point function and demonstrate a construction of all su(2) representations on the space of N=3 superfunctions.
