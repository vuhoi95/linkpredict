Title: Cohomology of Line Bundles: Proof of the Algorithm
Authors: Helmut Roschy and Thorsten Rahn
Abstract: We present a proof of the algorithm for computing line bundle valued cohomology classes over toric varieties conjectured by R.~Blumenhagen, B.~Jurke and the authors (arXiv:1003.5217) and suggest a kind of Serre duality for combinatorial Betti numbers that we observed when computing examples.
