Title: Dirichlet boundary conditions in a noncommutative theory
Authors: C. D. Fosco and P. Scuracchio
Abstract: We study the problem of imposing Dirichlet-like boundary conditions along a static spatial curve, in a planar Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory model. After constructing interaction terms that impose the boundary conditions, we discuss their implementation at the level of an interacting theory, with a focus on their physical consequences, and the symmetries they preserve. We also derive the effect they have on certain observables, like the Casimir energies.
