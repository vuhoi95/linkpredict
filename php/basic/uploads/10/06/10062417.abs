Title: Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling and the "cosmic" Josephson effect
Authors: A. Barone and M. Gasperini and G. Rotoli
Abstract: We discuss the possible influence of a cosmic magnetic field on the macroscopic quantum tunneling process associated, in a cosmological context, to the decay of the "false vacuum." We find a close analogy with the effects of an external magnetic field applied to a Josephson junction in the context of low-temperature/high-temperature superconducting devices.
