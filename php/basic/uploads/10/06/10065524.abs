Title: Classical Stability of the BTZ Black Hole in Topologically Massive  Gravity
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Susan Mokhtari and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We demonstrate the classical stability of the BTZ black hole within the context of topologically massive gravity. The linearized perturbation equations can be solved exactly in this case. By choosing standard boundary conditions appropriate to the stability problem, we demonstrate the absence of modes which grow in time, for all values of the Chern-Simons coupling.
