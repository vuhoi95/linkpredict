Abstract: In this paper, we suggest that there are two different individual 2D CFTs holographically dual to the Kerr-Newman black hole, coming from the corresponding two possible limits --- the Kerr/CFT and Reissner-Nordstr\"om/CFT correspondences, namely there exist the Kerr-Newman/CFTs dualities. A probe scalar field at low frequencies turns out can exhibit two different 2D conformal symmetries (named by $J$- and $Q$-pictures, respectively) in its equation of motion when the associated parameters are suitably specified. These twofold dualities are supported by the matchings of entropies, absorption cross sections and real time correlators computed from both the gravity and the CFT sides. Our results lead to a fascinating "microscopic no hair conjecture" --- for each macroscopic hair parameter, in additional to the mass of a black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell theory, there should exist an associated holographic CFT$_2$ description.
