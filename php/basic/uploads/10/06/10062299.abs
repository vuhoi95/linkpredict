Title: New supersymmetric sigma-model duality
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Ulf Lindstrom and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We study dualities in off-shell 4D N = 2 supersymmetric sigma-models, using the projective superspace approach. These include (i) duality between the real O(2n) and polar multiplets; and (ii) polar-polar duality. We demonstrate that the dual of any superconformal sigma-model is superconformal. Since N = 2 superconformal sigma-models (for which target spaces are hyperkahler cones) formulated in terms of polar multiplets are naturally associated with Kahler cones (which are target spaces for N = 1 superconformal sigma-models), polar-polar duality generates a transformation between different Kahler cones. In the non-superconformal case, we study implications of polar-polar duality for the sigma-model formulation in terms of N = 1 chiral superfields. In particular, we find the relation between the original hyperkahler potential and its dual. As an application of polar-polar duality, we study self-dual models.
