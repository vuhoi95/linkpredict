Title: Holographic Optics and Negative Refractive Index
Authors: A. Amariti and D. Forcella and A. Mariotti and G. Policastro
Abstract: In recent years a very exciting and intense activity has been devoted to the understanding and construction of materials that enjoy exotic optical properties, such as a negative refractive index. Motivated by these experimental and theoretical developments, we use the string-inspired idea of holography to study the electromagnetic response of a certain class of media: strongly coupled relativistic systems that admit a dual gravitational description. Our results indicate that this type of media generally have a negative refractive index. Moreover we observe that a negative refractive index could be a common feature of relativistic hydrodynamic systems at low frequencies.
