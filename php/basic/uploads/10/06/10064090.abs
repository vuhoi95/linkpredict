Title: Holographic Evolution of Entanglement Entropy
Authors: Javier Abajo-Arrastia and Joao Aparicio and Esperanza Lopez
Abstract: We study the evolution of entanglement entropy in a 2-dimensional equilibration process that has a holographic description in terms of a Vaidya geometry. It models a unitary evolution in which the field theory starts in a pure state, its vacuum, and undergoes a perturbation that brings it far from equilibrium. The entanglement entropy in this set up provides a measurement of the quantum entanglement in the system. Using holographic techniques we recover the same result obtained before from the study of processes triggered by a sudden change in a parameter of the hamiltonian, known as quantum quenches. Namely, entanglement in 2-dimensional conformal field theories propagates with velocity v^2=1. Both in quantum quenches and in the Vaidya model equilibration is only achieved at the local level. Remarkably, the holographic derivation of this last fact requires information from behind the apparent horizon generated in the process of gravitational collapse described by the Vaidya geometry. In the early stages of the evolution the apparent horizon seems however to play no relevant role with regard to the entanglement entropy. We speculate on the possibility of deriving a thermalization time for occupation numbers from our analysis.
