Authors: R. di Criscienzo and S. Hayward and M. Nadalini and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: Previous work on dynamical black hole instability is further elucidated within the Hamilton-Jacobi method for horizon tunnelling and the reconstruction of the classical action by means of the null-expansion method and making use of a coordinate invariance approach.
