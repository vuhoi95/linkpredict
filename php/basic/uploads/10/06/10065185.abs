Title: Mathieu equation and Elliptic curve
Authors: Wei He and Yan-Gang Miao
Abstract: We present a relation between the Mathieu equation and a particular elliptic curve. We find that the Floquet exponent of the Mathieu equation, for both $q<<1$ and $q>>1$, can be obtained from the integral of a differential one form along the two homology cycles of the elliptic curve. Certain higher order differential operators are needed to generate the WKB expansion. We provide a fifth order proof.
