Title: String Lessons for Higher-Spin Interactions
Authors: A. Sagnotti and M. Taronna
Abstract: String Theory includes a plethora of higher-spin excitations, which clearly lie behind its most spectacular properties, but whose detailed behavior is largely unknown. Conversely, string interactions contain much useful information on higher-spin couplings, which can be very valuable in current attempts to characterize their systematics. We present a simplified form for the three-point (and four-point) amplitudes of the symmetric tensors belonging to the first Regge trajectory of the open bosonic string and relate them to local couplings and currents. These include the cases first discussed, from a field theory perspective, by Berends, Burgers and van Dam, and generalize their results in a suggestive fashion along lines recently explored by Boulanger, Metsaev and others. We also comment on the recovery of gauge symmetry in the low-tension limit, on the current-exchange amplitudes that can be built from these couplings and on the extension to mixed-symmetry states.
