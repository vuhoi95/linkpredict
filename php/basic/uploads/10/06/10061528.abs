Title: Thermofield dynamics and twisted Poincar√© symmetry on Moyal space-time
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and T. R. Govindarajan
Abstract: On Moyal space-time, one can implement twisted Poincar\'e symmetry with the resultant modification of symmetrization and anti-symmetrization postulates for bosons and fermions. We develop the thermofield approach of Umezawa and Takahashi on such a spacetime preserving the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry of the underlying quantum field theory(qft). Implications of this twisted Poincar\'e symmetry for qft's at finite temperature are pointed out.
