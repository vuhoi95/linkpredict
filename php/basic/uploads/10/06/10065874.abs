Title: From world-sheet supersymmetry to super target spaces
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: We investigate the relation between N=(2,2) superconformal Lie group WZNW models and Lie supergroup WZNW models. The B-twist of an exactly marginal perturbation of the world-sheet superconformal sigma model is the supergroup model. Moreover, the superconformal currents are expressed in terms of Lie superalgebra currents in the twisted theory. As applications, we find protected sectors and boundary actions in the supergroup sigma model. A special example is the relation between string theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 in the RNS formalism and the U(1,1|2) x U(1|1) x U(1|1) supergroup WZNW model.
