Title: Shear Viscosity from the Effective Coupling of Gravitons
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Zhang-Yu Nie and Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: We review the progress in the holographic calculation of shear viscosity for strongly coupled field theories. We focus on the calculation of shear viscosity from the effective coupling of transverse gravitons and present some explicit examples.
