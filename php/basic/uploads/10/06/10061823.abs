Abstract: We study the supersymmetric N=(2,2) Wess-Zumino model in two dimensions with the functional renormalization group. At leading order in the supercovariant derivative expansion we recover the nonrenormalization theorem which states that the superpotential has no running couplings. Beyond leading order the renormalization of the bare mass is caused by a momentum dependent wave function renormalization. To deal with the partial differential equations we have developed a numerical toolbox called FlowPy. For weak couplings the quantum corrections to the bare mass found in lattice simulations is reproduced with high accuracy. But in the regime with intermediate couplings higher-order-operators that are not constrained by the nonrenormalization theorem yield the dominating contribution to the renormalized mass.
