Title: Notes on Wall Crossing and Instanton in Compactified Gauge Theory with  Matter
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Kirill Petunin
Abstract: We study the quantum effects on the Coulomb branch of N=2 SU(2) supersymmetric Yang-Mills with fundamental matters compactified on R^3 x S^1, and extract the explicit perturbative and leading non-perturbative corrections to the moduli space metric predicted from the recent work of Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke on wall-crossing [1]. We verify the predicted metric by computing the leading weak coupling instanton contribution to the four fermion correlation using standard field theory techniques, and demonstrate perfect agreement. We also demonstrate how previously known three dimensional quantities can be recovered in appropriate small radius limit, and provide a simple geometric picture from brane construction.
