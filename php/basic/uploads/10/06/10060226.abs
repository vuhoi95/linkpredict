Title: On Abelian Gauge Symmetries and Proton Decay in Global F-theory GUTs
Authors: Thomas W. Grimm and Timo Weigand
Abstract: The existence of abelian gauge symmetries in four-dimensional F-theory compactifications depends on the global geometry of the internal Calabi-Yau fourfold and has important phenomenological consequences. We study conceptual and phenomenological aspects of such U(1) symmetries along the Coulomb and the Higgs branch. As one application we examine abelian gauge factors arising after a certain global restriction of the Tate model that goes beyond a local spectral cover analysis. In SU(5) GUT models this mechanism enforces a global U(1)_X symmetry that prevents dimension-4 proton decay and allows for an identification of candidate right-handed neutrinos. We invoke a detailed account of the singularities of Calabi-Yau fourfolds and their mirror duals starting from an underlying E_8 and E_7 x U(1) enhanced Tate model. The global resolutions and deformations of these singularities can be used as the appropriate framework to analyse F-theory GUT models.
