Title: Exotic smooth R^4, geometry of string backgrounds and quantum D-branes
Authors: Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga and Jerzy Krol
Abstract: In this paper we make a first step toward determining 4-dimensional data from higher dimensional superstring theory and considering these as underlying structures for the theory. First, we explore connections of exotic smoothings of R^4 and certain configurations of NS and D-branes, both classical and (generalized) quantum using C* algebras. Effects of some small exotic R^4's, when localized on S^3, correspond to stringy geometries of B-fields on S^3. Exotic smoothness of R^4 acts as a non-vanishing B-field on S^3. The dynamics of D-branes in SU(2) WZW model at finite k indicates the exoticness of ambient R^4. Next, based on the relation of exotic smooth R^4 with integral levels of SU(2) WZW model we show the correspondence between exotic smoothness on 4-space, transversal to the world volume of NS5 branes, and the number of these NS5 branes. Relation with the calculations in holographically dual 6-dimensional little string theory is discussed. Generalized quantum D-branes in the noncommutative C* algebras corresponding to the codimension-1 foliations of S^3 are considered and these determine the KK invariants of exotic smooth R_h^4 for the case of non-integral $[h]\in H^3(S^3,R)$. Moreover, exotic smooth R^4's embedded in some exotic R^4 as open submanifolds, are shown to correspond to generalized quantum D-branes in the noncommutative C* algebra of the foliation. Finally, we show how exotic smoothness of R^4 is correlated with D6 brane charges in IIA string theory. In the last section we construct wild embeddings of spheres and relate them to D-brane charges as well to KK theory. We conjecture that a quantum D-brane is wild embedding. Then we construct an action for a quantum D-brane and show that the classical limit (the usual embedding) agrees with the Born-Infeld action.
