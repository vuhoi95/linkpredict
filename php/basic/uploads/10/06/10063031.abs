Title: Note on a new fundamental length scale $l$ instead of the Newtonian  constant $G$
Authors: Lijing Shao and Bo-Qiang Ma
Abstract: The newly proposed entropic gravity suggests gravity as an emergent force rather than a fundamental one. In this approach, the Newtonian constant $G$ does not play a fundamental role any more, and a new fundamental constant is required to replace its position. This request also arises from some philosophical considerations to contemplate the physical foundations for the unification of theories. We here consider the suggestion to derive $G$ from more fundamental quantities in the presence of a new fundamental length scale $l$, which is suspected to originate from the structure of quantum space-time, and can be measured directly from Lorentz-violating observations. Our results are relevant to the fundamental understanding of physics, and more practically, of natural units, as well as explanations of experimental constraints in searching for Lorentz violation.
