Title: Quasi-Normal Modes of Extremal BTZ Black Holes in TMG
Authors: Hamid R. Afshar and Mohsen Alishahiha and Amir E. Mosaffa
Abstract: We study the spectrum of tensor perturbations on extremal BTZ black holes in topologically massive gravity for arbitrary values of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, $\mu$. Imposing proper boundary conditions at the boundary of the space and at the horizon, we find that the spectrum contains quasi-normal modes.
