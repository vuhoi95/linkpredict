Title: Two dimensional gravity in genus one in Matrix Models, Topological and  Liouville approaches
Authors: A. Belavin and G. Tarnopolsky
Abstract: One-matrix model in $p$-critical point on torus is considered. The generating function of correlation numbers in genus one is evaluated and used for computation correlation numbers in KdV and CFT frames. It is shown that the correlation numbers in KdV frame in genus one satisfy the Witten topological gravity recurrence relations.
