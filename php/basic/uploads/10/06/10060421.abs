Title: Infrared Evolution and Phase Structure of a Gauge Theory Containing  Different Fermion Representations
Authors: Thomas A. Ryttov and Robert Shrock
Abstract: We study the evolution of an asymptotically free vectorial SU($N$) gauge theory from the ultraviolet to the infrared and the resultant phase structure in the general case in which the theory contains fermions transforming according to several different representations of the gauge group. We discuss the sequential fermion condensation and dynamical mass generation that occur, and comment on the effect of bare fermion mass terms.
