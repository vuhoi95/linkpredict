Title: Quasinormal modes of semiclassical electrically charged black holes
Authors: Owen Pavel Fernandez Piedra and Jeferson de Oliveira
Abstract: We report the results concerning the influence of vacuum polarization due to quantum massive vector, scalar and spinor fields on the scalar sector of quasinormal modes in spherically symmetric charged black holes. The vacuum polarization from quantized fields produces a shift in the values of the quasinormal frequencies, and correspondingly the semiclassical system becomes a better oscillator with respect to the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole.
