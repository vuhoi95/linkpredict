Title: Modern Summation Methods and the Computation of 2- and 3-loop Feynman  Diagrams
Authors: J. Ablinger and J. Bl√ºmlein and S. Klein and C. Schneider
Abstract: By symbolic summation methods based on difference fields we present a general strategy that transforms definite multi-sums, e.g., in terms of hypergeometric terms and harmonic sums, to indefinite nested sums and products. We succeeded in this task with all our concrete calculations of 2--loop and 3--loop massive single scale Feynman diagrams with local operator insertion.
