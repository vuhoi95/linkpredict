Title: A transmission matrix for a fused pair of integrable defects in the  sine-Gordon model
Authors: E. Corrigan and C. Zambon
Abstract: Within the quantum sine-Gordon model a transmission matrix describing the scattering of a soliton with a fused pair of integrable defects is proposed. The result is consistent with the classical picture of scattering and highlights the differences between two defects located at separated points and two defects fused at the same point. Moreover, the analysis reveals how, for certain choices of parameters, both the soliton-soliton and the lightest-breather-soliton S-matrices of the sine-Gordon model are embedded within the transmission matrix, supporting an interpretation in which defects may be regarded as soliton constituents.
