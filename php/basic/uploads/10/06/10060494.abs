Title: Shocks and Universal Statistics in (1+1)-Dimensional Relativistic  Turbulence
Authors: Xiao Liu and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We propose that statistical averages in relativistic turbulence exhibit universal properties. We consider analytically the velocity and temperature differences structure functions in the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic turbulence in which shock waves provide the main contribution to the structure functions in the inertial range. We study shock scattering, demonstrate the stability of the shock waves, and calculate the anomalous exponents. We comment on the possibility of finite time blowup singularities.
