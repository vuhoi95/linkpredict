Title: Semiclassical Regge trajectories of noncritical string and large-N QCD
Authors: Yuri Makeenko and Poul Olesen
Abstract: By properly treating the path integral over the boundary value of the Liouville field (associated with reparametrizations of the boundary contour) in open string theory, we derive consistent off-shell scattering amplitudes in d=26 dimensions. In d<26 we consider a recently proposed boundary ansatz which reproduces a semiclassical correction to the classical string (known as the Luscher term) and obtain in the semiclassical approximation a linear Regge trajectory with the intercept (d-2)/24. We associate it with the quark-antiquark Regge trajectory in large-N QCD and explain why it dominates over perturbative QCD when t > -few GeV^2.
