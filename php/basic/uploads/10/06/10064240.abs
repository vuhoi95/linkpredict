Abstract: In this paper, we mainly investigate the problems of resonances of massive KK fermions on a single scalar constructed thick brane with a piecewise warp factor matching smoothly. The distance between two boundaries and the other parameters are determined by one free parameter through three junction conditions. For the generalized Yukawa coupling $\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi^{k}\Psi$ with odd $k=1,3,5,...$, the mass eigenvalue $m$, width $\Gamma$, lifetime $\tau$, and maximal probability $P_{max}$ of fermion resonances are obtained. Our numerical calculations show that the brane without internal structure also favors the appearance of resonant states for both left- and right-handed fermions. The scalar-fermion coupling and the thickness of the brane influence the resonant behaviors of the massive KK fermions.
