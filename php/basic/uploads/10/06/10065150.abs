Title: Possible Enhancement of High Frequency Gravitational Waves
Authors: Maria G. Romania and N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We study the tensor perturbations in a class of non-local, purely gravitational models which naturally end inflation in a distinctive phase of oscillations with slight and short violations of the weak energy condition. We find the usual generic form for the tensor power spectrum. The presence of the oscillatory phase leads to an enhancement of gravitational waves with frequencies somewhat less than 10^{10} Hz.
