Title: Condensing Nielsen-Olesen strings and the vortex-boson duality in 3+1  and higher dimensions
Authors: A. J. Beekman and D. Sadri and J. Zaanen
Abstract: The vortex-boson (or Abelian-Higgs, XY) duality in 2+1 dimensions demonstrates that the quantum disordered superfluid is equivalent to an ordered superconductor and the other way around. Such a duality structure should be ubiquitous but in 3+1 (and higher) dimensions a precise formulation of the duality is lacking. The problem is that the topological defects become extended objects, strings in 3+1D. We argue how the condensate of such vortex strings must behave from the known physics of the disordered superfluid, namely the Bose-Mott insulator. A flaw in earlier proposals is repaired, and a more direct viewpoint, avoiding gauge fields, in terms of the physical supercurrent is laid out, that also easily generalizes to higher-dimensional and more complicated systems. Furthermore topological defects are readily identified; we demonstrate that the Bose-Mott insulator supports line defects, which may be seen in cold atom experiments.
