Title: On Born-Infeld Gravity in Three Dimensions
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Ali Naseh and Hesam Soltanpanahi
Abstract: In this paper we explore different aspects of three dimensional Born-Infeld as well as Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons gravity. We show that the models have AdS and AdS-wave vacuum solutions. Moreover we observe that although Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons gravity admits a logarithmic solution, Born-Infeld gravity does not, though it has a limiting logarithmic solution as we approach the critical point.
