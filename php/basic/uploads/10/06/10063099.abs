Title: Non-Einstein geometries in Chiral Gravity
Authors: Geoffrey Compère and Sophie de Buyl and Stéphane Detournay
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic solutions of Chiral Gravity (Topologically Massive Gravity at \mu l = 1 with Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions) focusing on non-Einstein metrics. A class of such solutions admits curvature singularities in the interior which are reflected as singularities or infinite bulk energy of the corresponding linear solutions. A non-linear solution is found exactly. The back-reaction induces a repulsion of geodesics and a shielding of the singularity by an event horizon but also introduces closed timelike curves.
