Title: A Note on G-Fluxes for F-theory Model Building
Authors: Joseph Marsano and Natalia Saulina and Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We propose a description of G-fluxes that induce chirality in 4-dimensional F-theory GUT spectra that is intrinsic to F-theory and does not rely on Heterotic/F-theory duality. Using this, we describe how to globally extend fluxes that have been constructed in a semi-local setting and obtain an F-theoretic formula for computing the chiral spectrum that they induce. Chirality computations agree with those from the semi-local Higgs bundle analysis for matter fields that are charged under the GUT-group, and hence with the standard Heterotic formulae where applicable. Finally, the relation of G-fluxes to SU(5)_{perp} bundles on the F-theory 4-fold is discussed and used to motivate a quantization rule that is consistent both with the Higgs bundle one as well as the Heterotic one when a Heterotic dual exists.
