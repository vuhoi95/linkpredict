Title: Holographic Fermi arcs and a d-wave gap
Authors: Francesco Benini and Christopher P. Herzog and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We study fermion correlators in a holographic superfluid with a d-wave (spin two) order parameter. We find that, with a suitable bulk Majorana coupling, the Fermi surface is anisotropically gapped. At low temperatures the gap shrinks to four nodal points. At high temperatures the Fermi surface is partially gapped generating four Fermi arcs.
