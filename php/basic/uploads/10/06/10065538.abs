Title: Fedosov Quantization of Fractional Lagrange Spaces
Authors: Dumitru Baleanu and Sergiu I. Vacaru
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to perform a nonolonomic deformation (Fedosov type) quantization of fractional Lagrange geometries. The constructions are provided for a (fractional) almost Kahler model encoding equivalently all data for fractional Euler-Lagrange equations with Caputo fractional derivative. For homogeneous generating Finsler functions, the geometric models contain quantum versions of fractional Finsler spaces. The scheme can be generalized for fractional Hamilton systems and various models of fractional classical and quantum gravity. We conclude that the approach with Caputo fractional derivative allows us to geometrize both classical and quantum (Fedosov type) fractional regular Lagrange interactions.
