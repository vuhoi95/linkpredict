Title: A Two-Loop Octagon Wilson Loop in N = 4 SYM
Authors: Vittorio Del Duca and Claude Duhr and Vladimir A. Smirnov
Abstract: In the planar N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at weak coupling, we perform the first analytic computation of a two-loop eight-edged Wilson loop embedded into the boundary of AdS3. Its remainder function is given as a function of uniform transcendental weight four in terms of a constant plus a product of four logarithms. We compare to the strong-coupling result, and test a conjecture on the universality of the remainder function proposed in the literature.
