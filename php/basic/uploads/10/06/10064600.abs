Abstract: A generalized Toda Lattice equation is considered. The associated linear problem (Lax representation) is found. For simple case N=3 the $\tau$-function Hirota form is presented that allows to construct an exast solutions of the equations of the 1DGTL. The corresponding hierarchy and its relations with the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and Hersenberg ferromagnetic equation are discussed.
