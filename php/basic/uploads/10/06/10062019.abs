Title: Realization of SU(N) Kondo effect in strong magnetic field
Authors: Assaf Carmi and Yuval Oreg and Micha Berkooz
Abstract: In this paper we suggest a realization for the SU(N) Kondo effect, using quantum dots at strong magnetic field. We purpose using edge states of the quantum Hall effect as pseudo spin that interact with multiple quantum dots structures. In the suggested realization one can access each pseudo spin separately and hence may perform a set of experiments that were impossible until now. We focus on the realization of SU(2) and SU(3) Kondo and find a conductivity of 3/4 quantum conductance in the SU(3) case.
