Title: Black hole entropy from an SU(2)-invariant formulation of Type I  isolated horizons
Authors: Jonathan Engle and Karim Noui and Alejandro Perez and Daniele Pranzetti
Abstract: A detailed analysis of the spherically symmetric isolated horizon system is performed in terms of the connection formulation of general relativity. The system is shown to admit a manifestly SU(2) invariant formulation where the (effective) horizon degrees of freedom are described by an SU(2) Chern-Simons theory. This leads to a more transparent description of the quantum theory in the context of loop quantum gravity and modifications of the form of the horizon entropy.
