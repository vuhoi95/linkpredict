Title: Primordial Density Perturbations and Reheating from Gravity
Authors: N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We consider the presence and evolution of primordial density perturbations in a cosmological model based on a simple ansatz which captures -- by providing a set of effective gravitational field equations -- the strength of the enhanced quantum loop effects that can arise during inflation. After deriving the general equations that perturbations obey, we concentrate on scalar perturbations and show that their evolution is quite different than that of conventional inflationary models but still phenomenologically acceptable. The main reason for this novel evolution is the presence of an oscillating regime after the end of inflation which makes all super-horizon scalar modes oscillate. The same reason allows for a natural and very fast reheating mechanism for the universe.
