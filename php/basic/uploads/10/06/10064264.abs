Title: More on New Massive Gravity: Exact Solutions
Authors: Haji Ahmedov and Alikram N. Aliev
Abstract: We give a novel description of the recently proposed theory of new massive gravity (NMG) in three dimensions. We show that in terms of a Dirac type differential operator acting on the traceless Ricci tensor, the field equations of the theory reduce to the massive Klein-Gordon type equation with a curvature-squared source term and to a constraint equation. Under a certain relation between the source tensor and the traceless Ricci tensor, fulfilled for constant scalar curvature, the field equations of topologically massive gravity (TMG) can be thought of as the "square-root" of the massive Klein-Gordon type equation. Using this fact, we establish a simple framework for mapping all known algebraic types D and N solutions of TMG into NMG. We also present new exact solutions of algebraic types D and N which are only inherent in NMG.
