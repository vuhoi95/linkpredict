Title: Stable Bound Orbits around Black Rings
Authors: Takahisa Igata and Hideki Ishihara and Yohsuke Takamori
Abstract: We examine bound orbits of particles around singly rotating black rings. We show that there exist stable bound orbits in toroidal spiral shape near the axis of the ring, and also exist stable circular orbits on the axis as special cases. The stable bound orbits can have arbitrary large size if the thickness of the ring is less than a critical value.
