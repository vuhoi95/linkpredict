Title: Particles with anomalous magnetic moment in external e.m. fields: the  proper time formulation
Authors: A. Barducci and R. Giachetti and G. Pettini
Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the expression for the Green function of a pseudo-classical spinning particle interacting with constant electromagnetic external fields by taking into account the anomalous magnetic and electric moments of the particle. The spin degrees of freedom are described in terms of Grassmann variables and the evolution operator is obtained through the Fock-Schwinger proper time method.
