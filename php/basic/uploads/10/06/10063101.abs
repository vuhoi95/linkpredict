Title: Charge Orbits of Extremal Black Holes in Five Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Bianca L. Cerchiai and Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We derive the U-duality charge orbits, as well as the related moduli spaces, of "large" and "small" extremal black holes in non-maximal ungauged Maxwell-Einstein supergravities with symmetric scalar manifolds in d=5 space-time dimensions. The stabilizer groups of the various classes of orbits are obtained by determining and solving suitable U-invariant sets of constraints, both in "bare" and "dressed" charges bases, with various methods. After a general treatment of attractors in real special geometry (also considering non-symmetric cases), the N=2 "magic" theories, as well as the N=2 Jordan symmetric sequence, are analyzed in detail. Finally, the half-maximal (N=4) matter-coupled supergravity is also studied in this context.
