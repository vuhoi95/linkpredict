Title: Kink dynamics, sinh-Gordon solitons and strings in AdS(3) from the  Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Andreas Klotzek and Michael Thies
Abstract: Guided by a study of kink-antikink scattering in the Gross-Neveu model and other known solutions of the Hartree-Fock approach of a particularly simple type, we demonstrate a quantitative relationship between three different problems: Quantized 1+1-dimensional fermions in the large N limit, solitons of the classical sinh-Gordon equation and classical strings moving in 3-dimensional anti de Sitter space. Aside from throwing light on the relationship between quantum field theory and classical physics, this points to the full solvability of the dynamical N-kink-antikink problem in the Gross-Neveu model.
