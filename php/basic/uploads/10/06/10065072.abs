Title: Do microscopic stable black holes contribute to dark matter?
Authors: P. Suranyi and C. Vaz and L. C. R. Wijewardhana
Abstract: We investigate some of the experimental, observational and theoretical consequences of hypothetical stable black holes in the mass range between the electro-weak scale and the Planck mass, 2.4$\times 10^{15}$ TeV. For the purpose of calculations we use Lovelock black holes in odd dimensions. If such black holes exist they contribute to dark matter. We show that the passage of the black holes through matter and the collision of black holes have a well defined experimental signature. Depending on their cross section and energy they also accumulate in stars and influence their development.
