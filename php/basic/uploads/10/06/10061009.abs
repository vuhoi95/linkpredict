Title: Location and Direction Dependent Effects in Collider Physics from  Noncommutativity
Authors: Mansour Haghighat and Nobuchika Okada and Allen Stern
Abstract: We examine the leading order noncommutative corrections to the differential and total cross sections for e+ e- --> q q-bar. After averaging over the earth's rotation, the results depend on the latitude for the collider, as well as the direction of the incoming beam. They also depend on scale and direction of the noncommutativity. Using data from LEP, we exclude regions in the parameter space spanned by the noncommutative scale and angle relative to the earth's axis. We also investigate possible implications for phenomenology at the future International Linear Collider.
