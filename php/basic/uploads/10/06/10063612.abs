Title: Nucleon Statistics in Holographic QCD : Aharonov-Bohm Effect in a Matrix  Model
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Norihiro Iizuka
Abstract: We show that the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the nuclear matrix model derives the statistical nature of nucleons in holographic QCD. For N_c= odd (even), the nucleon is shown to be a fermion (boson).
