Title: TBA for the Toda chain
Authors: K. K. Kozlowski and J. Teschner
Abstract: We give a direct derivation of a proposal of Nekrasov-Shatashvili concerning the quantization conditions of the Toda chain. The quantization conditions are formulated in terms of solutions to a nonlinear integral equation similar to the ones coming from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. This is equivalent to extremizing a certain function called Yang's potential. It is shown that the Nekrasov-Shatashvili formulation of the quantization conditions follows from the solution theory of the Baxter equation, suggesting that this way of formulating the quantization conditions should indeed be applicable to large classes of quantized algebraically integrable models.
