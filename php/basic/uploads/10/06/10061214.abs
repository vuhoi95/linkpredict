Title: Magnetic expansion of Nekrasov theory: the SU(2) pure gauge theory
Authors: Wei He and Yan-Gang Miao
Abstract: It is recently claimed by Nekrasov and Shatashvili that the $\mathcal {N}=2$ gauge theories in the $\Omega$ background with $\epsilon_1=\hbar, \epsilon_2=0$ are related to the quantization of certain algebraic integrable systems. We study the special case of SU(2) pure gauge theory, the corresponding integrable model is the A$_1$ Toda model, which reduces to the sine-Gordon quantum mechanics problem. The quantum effects can be expressed as the WKB series written analytically in terms of hypergeometric functions. We obtain the magnetic and dyonic expansions of the Nekrasov theory by studying the property of hypergeometric functions in the magnetic and dyonic regions on the moduli space. We also discuss the relation between the electric-magnetic duality of gauge theory and the action-action duality of the integrable system.
