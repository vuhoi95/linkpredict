Title: N=2 Generalized Superconformal Quiver Gauge Theory
Authors: Dimitri Nanopoulos and Dan Xie
Abstract: Four dimensional N=2 generalized superconformal field theory can be defined by compactifying six dimensional (0,2) theory on a Riemann surface with regular punctures. In previous studies, gauge coupling constant space is identified with the moduli space of punctured Riemann surface M_{g,n}. We show that the weakly coupled gauge group description corresponds to a stable nodal curve, and the coupling space is actually the Deligne-Mumford compactification \bar{M}_{g,n}. We also give an algorithm to determine the weakly coupled gauge group and matter content in any duality frame.
