Title: Deformations of quantum field theories on spacetimes with Killing vector  fields
Authors: Claudio Dappiaggi and Gandalf Lechner and Eric Morfa-Morales
Abstract: The recent construction and analysis of deformations of quantum field theories by warped convolutions is extended to a class of curved spacetimes. These spacetimes carry a family of wedge-like regions which share the essential causal properties of the Poincare transforms of the Rindler wedge in Minkowski space. In the setting of deformed quantum field theories, they play the role of typical localization regions of quantum fields and observables. As a concrete example of such a procedure, the deformation of the free Dirac field is studied.
