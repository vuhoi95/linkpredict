Title: Large-N volume independence in conformal and confining gauge theories
Authors: Mithat Unsal and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Consequences of large $N$ volume independence are examined in conformal and confining gauge theories. In the large $N$ limit, gauge theories compactified on $\R^{d-k} \times (S^1)^k$ are independent of the $S^1$ radii, provided the theory has unbroken center symmetry. In particular, this implies that a large $N$ gauge theory which, on $\R^d$, flows to an IR fixed point, retains the infinite correlation length and other scale invariant properties of the decompactified theory even when compactified on $\R^{d-k} \times (S^1)^k$. In other words, finite volume effects are $1/N$ suppressed. In lattice formulations of vector-like theories, this implies that numerical studies to determine the boundary between confined and conformal phases may be performed on one-site lattice models. In $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the center symmetry realization is a matter of choice: the theory on $\R^{4-k}\times (S^1)^k$ has a moduli space which contains points with all possible realizations of center symmetry. Large $N$ QCD with massive adjoint fermions and one or two compactified dimensions has a rich phase structure with an infinite number of phase transitions coalescing in the zero radius limit.
