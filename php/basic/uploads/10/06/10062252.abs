Title: The Width of the Color Flux Tube at 2-Loop Order
Authors: F. Gliozzi and M. Pepe and U. -J. Wiese
Abstract: The color flux tube connecting a static quark-anti-quark pair in Yang-Mills theory supports massless transverse fluctuations, which are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken translation invariance. Just as in chiral perturbation theory, the dynamics of these Goldstone bosons is described by a systematic low-energy effective field theory. We use the effective theory to calculate the width of the fluctuating string at the 2-loop level, using both cylindrical and toroidal boundary conditions. At zero temperature, the string width diverges logarithmically with the quark-anti-quark distance r. On the other hand, at low but non-zero temperature T = 1/\beta, for r >> \beta, the string width diverges linearly.
