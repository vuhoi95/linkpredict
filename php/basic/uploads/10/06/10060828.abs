Title: Seiberg-Witten theory, matrix model and AGT relation
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Kazunobu Maruyoshi
Abstract: We discuss the Penner-type matrix model which has been proposed to explain the AGT relation between the 2-dimensional Liouville theory and 4-dimensional N=2 superconformal gauge theories. In our previous communication we have obtained the spectral curve of the matrix model and showed that it agrees with that derived from M-theory. We have also discussed the decoupling limit of massive flavors and proposed new matrix models which describe Seiberg-Witten theory with flavors N_f=2,3. In this article we explicitly evaluate the free energy of these matrix models and show that they in fact reproduce the amplitudes of Seiberg-Witten theory.
