Title: Nonconcentration of energy for a semilinear Skyrme model
Authors: Dan-Andrei Geba and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We continue our investigation of a model introduced by Adkins and Nappi, in which omega mesons stabilize chiral solitons. The aim of this article is to show that the energy associated to equivariant solutions does not concentrate.
