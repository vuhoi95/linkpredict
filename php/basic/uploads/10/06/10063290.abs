Title: New AdS solitons and brane worlds with compact extra-dimensions
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We construct new static, asymptotically AdS solutions where the conformal infinity is the product of Minkowski spacetime $M_n$ and a sphere $S^m$. Both globally regular, soliton-type solutions and black hole solutions are considered. The black holes can be viewed as natural AdS generalizations of the Schwarzschild black branes in Kaluza-Klein theory. The solitons provide new brane-world models with compact extra-dimensions. Different from the Randall-Sundrum single-brane scenario, a Schwarzschild black hole on the Ricci flat part of these branes does not lead to a naked singularity in the bulk.
