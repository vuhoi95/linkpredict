Title: Low energy Quantum Gravity from the Effective Average Action
Authors: A. Satz and A. Codello and F. D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: Within the effective average action approach to quantum gravity, we recover the low energy effective action as derived in the effective field theory framework, by studying the flow of possibly non-local form factors that appear in the curvature expansion of the effective average action. We restrict to the one-loop flow where progress can be made with the aid of the non-local heat kernel expansion. We discuss the possible physical implications of the scale dependent low energy effective action through the analysis of the quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential.
