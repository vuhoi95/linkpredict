Authors: Pushpa and P. S. Bisht and Tianjun Li and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: We have made an attempt to develop the quaternionic formulation of Yang - Mill's field equations and octonion reformulation of quantum chromo dynamics (QCD). Starting with the Lagrangian density, we have discussed the field equations of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge fields for both cases of global and local gauge symmetries. It has been shown that the three quaternion units explain the structure of Yang- Mill's field while the seven octonion units provide the consistent structure of SU(3)_{C} gauge symmetry of quantum chromo dynamics.
