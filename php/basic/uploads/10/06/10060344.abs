Title: Geometric entropy and third order phase transition in d=4 N=2 SYM with  flavor
Authors: Mitsutoshi Fujita and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We analyze the phase structure of $d=4$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ large $N$ SYM theory with flavor on $S^1\times S^3$ by using geometric entropy as an order parameter. We introduce chemical potential conjugate to global U(1) symmetry and find the third order phase transition at finite density by using the geometric entropy as the order parameter. We also find that the geometric entropy at the finite density has an interesting behavior at low temperature and for large $N_f$.
