Title: A holographic view on physics out of equilibrium
Authors: Veronika E. Hubeny and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We review the recent developments in applying holographic methods to understand non-equilibrium physics in strongly coupled field theories. The emphasis will be on elucidating the relation between evolution of quantum field theories perturbed away from equilibrium and the dual picture of dynamics of classical fields in black hole backgrounds. In particular, we discuss the linear response regime, the hydrodynamic regime and finally the non-linear regime of interacting quantum systems. We also describe how the duality might be used to learn some salient aspects of black hole physics in terms of field theory observables.
