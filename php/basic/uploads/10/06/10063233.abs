Abstract: We apply the Schr\"odinger factorization method to the radial second-order equation for the relativistic Kepler-Coulomb problem. From these operators we construct two sets of one-variable radial operators which are realizations for the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We use this algebraic structure to obtain the energy spectrum and the supersymmetric ground state for this system.
