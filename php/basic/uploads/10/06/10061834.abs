Abstract: We study the holographic dark energy on the subject of Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity with a time dependent gravitational constant (G(t)), in the non-flat space-time. We obtain the differential equation that specify the evolution of the dark energy density parameter based on varying gravitational constant. we find out a relation for the state parameter of the dark energy equation to low redshifts which containing varying $G$ correction.
