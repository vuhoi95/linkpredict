Title: Heterotic Flux Attractors
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Finn Larsen and Ross O'Connell
Abstract: We find attractor equations describing moduli stabilization for heterotic compactifications with generic SU(3)-structure. Complex structure and K\"ahler moduli are treated on equal footing by using SU(3)xSU(3)-structure at intermediate steps. All independent vacuum data, including VEVs of the stabilized moduli, is encoded in a pair of generating functions that depend on fluxes alone. We work out an explicit example that illustrates our methods.
