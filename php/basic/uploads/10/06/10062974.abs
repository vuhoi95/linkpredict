Title: Low Energy Action of "Covariant" Superstring Field Theory in the NS-NS  pp-Wave Background
Authors: Yoichi Chizaki and Shigeaki Yahikozawa
Abstract: Exact construction of superstring field theory in some background fields is very important. We construct the low energy NS-NS sector of superstring field action in the pp-wave background with the flux of NS-NS antisymmetric tensor field (NS-NS pp-wave) without gauge fixing up to the second-order where the action is world-sheet BRST invariant. Here we use the word "covariant" in a invariant theory for a symmetric transformation of the pp-wave background which is not the Lorentz transformation in the flat background. Moreover we prove the exact correspondence between this low energy action and the second-order perturbation of supergravity action in the same background. We also prove the correspondence of the gauge transformation in both the actions. This construction is based on the BRST first quantization of superstrings in the pp-wave background in our previous paper.
