Abstract: Non-local field theories which arise from p-adic string theories have vacuum soliton solutions. We find the soliton solutions at finite temperature. These solutions become important for the partition function when the temperature exceeds m_s/g_o^2 where m_s is the string mass scale and g_o is the open string coupling.
