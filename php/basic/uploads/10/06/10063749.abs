Title: Torsion, Chern-Simons Term and Diffeomorphism Invariance
Authors: Prasanta Mahato and Partha Bhattacharya
Abstract: In the $torsion \otimes curvature$ approach of gravity Chern-Simons modification has been considered here. It has been found that Chern-Simons contribution to the bianchi identity has become cancelled from that of the scalar field part. But "homogeneity and isotropy" consideration of present day cosmology is a consequence of the "strong equivalence principle" and vice-versa.
