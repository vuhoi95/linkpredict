Title: Hopf solitons in the Nicole model
Authors: Mike Gillard and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: The Nicole model is a conformal field theory in three-dimensional space. It has topological soliton solutions classified by the integer-valued Hopf charge, and all currently known solitons are axially symmetric. A volume-preserving flow is used to numerically construct soliton solutions for all Hopf charges from one to eight. It is found that the known axially symmetric solutions are unstable for Hopf charges greater than two and new lower energy solutions are obtained that include knots and links. A comparison with the Skyrme-Faddeev model suggests many universal features, though there are some differences in the link types obtained in the two theories.
