Title: Heterotic compactifications on nearly Kähler manifolds
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Christoph Nölle and Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: We consider compactifications of heterotic supergravity on anti-de Sitter space, with a six-dimensional nearly K"ahler manifold as the internal space. Completing the model proposed by Frey and Lippert with the particular choice of SU(3)/U(1)xU(1) for the internal manifold, we show that it satisfies not only the supersymmetry constraints but also the equations of motion with string corrections of order alpha'. Furthermore, we present a non-supersymmetric model. In both solutions we find confirmed a recent result of Ivanov on the connection used for anomaly cancellation. Interestingly, the volume of the internal space is fixed by the supersymmetry constraints and/or the equations of motion.
