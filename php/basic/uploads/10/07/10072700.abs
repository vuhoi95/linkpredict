Title: Cosmology of a covariant Galileon field
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: We study the cosmology of a covariant scalar field respecting a Galilean symmetry in flat space-time. We show the existence of a tracker solution that finally approaches a de Sitter fixed point responsible for cosmic acceleration today. The viable region of model parameters is clarified by deriving conditions under which ghosts and Laplacian instabilities of scalar and tensor perturbations are absent. The field equation of state exhibits a peculiar phantom-like behavior along the tracker, which allows a possibility to observationally distinguish the Galileon gravity from the Lambda-CDM model.
