Title: Shaping up BPS States with Matrix Model Saddle Points
Authors: Diego H. Correa and Martin Wolf
Abstract: We provide analytical results for the probability distribution of a family of wavefunctions of a quantum mechanics model of commuting matrices in the large-N limit. These wavefunctions describe the strong coupling limit of 1/8 BPS states of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Therefore, in the large-N limit, they should be dual to classical solutions of type IIB supergravity that asymptotically approach AdS5xS5. Each probability distribution can be described as the partition function of a matrix model (different wavefunctions correspond to different matrix model potentials) which we study by means of a saddle point approximation. These saddle point solutions are given in terms of (five-dimensional) hypersurfaces supporting density distributions of eigenvalues.
