Title: Introductory lectures to loop quantum gravity
Authors: Pietro Don√° and Simone Speziale
Abstract: We give a standard introduction to loop quantum gravity, from the ADM variables to spin network states. We include a discussion on quantum geometry on a fixed graph and its relation to a discrete approximation of general relativity.
