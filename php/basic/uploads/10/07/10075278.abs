Title: Arbitrary p-form Galileons
Authors: C. Deffayet and S. Deser and G. Esposito-Farese
Abstract: We show that scalar, 0-form, Galileon actions --models whose field equations contain only second derivatives-- can be generalized to arbitrary even p-forms. More generally, they need not even depend on a single form, but may involve mixed p combinations, including equal p multiplets, where odd p-fields are also permitted: We construct, for given dimension D, general actions depending on scalars, vectors and higher p-form field strengths, whose field equations are of exactly second derivative order. We also discuss and illustrate their curved-space generalizations, especially the delicate non-minimal couplings required to maintain this order. Concrete examples of pure and mixed actions, field equations and their curved space extensions are presented.
