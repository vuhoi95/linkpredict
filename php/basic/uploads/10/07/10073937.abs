Title: The dynamics of generalized Palatini Theories of Gravity
Authors: Vincenzo Vitagliano and Thomas P. Sotiriou and Stefano Liberati
Abstract: It is known that in f(R) theories of gravity with an independent connection which can be both non-metric and non symmetric, this connection can always be algebraically eliminated in favour of the metric and the matter fields, so long as it is not coupled to the matter explicitly. We show here that this is a special characteristic of f(R) actions, and it is not true for actions that include other curvature invariants. This contradicts some recent claims in the literature. We clarify the reasons of this contradiction.
