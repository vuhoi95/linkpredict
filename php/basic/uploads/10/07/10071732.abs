Title: Partition Functions of Non-Abelian Quantum Hall States
Authors: Andrea Cappelli and Giovanni Viola
Abstract: Partition functions of edge excitations are obtained for non-Abelian Hall states in the second Landau level, such as the anti-Read-Rezayi state, the Bonderson-Slingerland hierarchy and the Wen non-Abelian fluid, as well as for the non-Abelian spin-singlet state. The derivation is straightforward and unique starting from the non-Abelian conformal field theory data and solving the modular invariance conditions. The partition functions provide a complete account of the excitation spectrum and are used to describe experiments of Coulomb blockade and thermopower.
