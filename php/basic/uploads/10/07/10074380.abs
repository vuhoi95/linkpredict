Abstract: Low-temperature thermal conductivity and thermopower of multiwalled carbon nanotubes considered within a bundle of nanotubes are calculated taking into account multiple scattering of electrons on the atoms of impurities (like single carbon atoms) and short-range order regions arising due to a some distribution of the impurities. The calculations are realized on a base of the temperature diagrammatic Feynman techniques and the results of our research are in a good quantitative and qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental data for multiwalled carbon nanotubes with diameter less or equal 10 nm at T<50K.
