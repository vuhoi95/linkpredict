Title: Liouville integrability of a class of integrable spin Calogero-Moser  systems and exponents of simple Lie algebras
Authors: Luen-Chau Li and Zhaohu Nie
Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a class of integrable spin Calogero-Moser systems associated with the classical dynamical r-matrices with spectral parameter, as classified by Etingof and Varchenko for simple Lie algebras. Here the main purpose is to establish the Liouville integrability of these systems by a uniform method.
