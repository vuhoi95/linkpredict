Title: Amplification of Curvature Perturbations in Cyclic Cosmology
Authors: Jun Zhang and Zhi-Guo Liu and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: We analytically and numerically show that through the cycles with nonsingular bounce the amplitude of curvature perturbation on large scale will be amplified and the power spectrum will be redden. In some sense, this amplification will eventually destroy the homogeneity of background, which will lead to the ultimate end of cycles of global universe. We argue that for the model with increasing cycles, it might be possible that a fissiparous multiverse will emerge after one or several cycles, in which the cycles will continue only at corresponding local regions.
