Title: Cosmological intersecting brane solutions
Authors: Masato Minamitsuji and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Kunihito Uzawa
Abstract: The recent discovery of an explicit dynamical description of p-branes makes it possible to investigate the existence of intersection of such objects. We generalize the solutions depending on the overall transverse space coordinates and time to those which depend also on the relative transverse space and satisfy new intersection rules. We give classification of these dynamical intersecting brane solutions involving two branes, and discuss the application of these solutions to cosmology and show that these give Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological solutions. Finally, we construct the brane world models, using the (cut-)copy-paste method after compactifying the trivial spatial dimensions. We then find that interesting brane world models can be obtained from codimension-one branes and several static branes with higher codimensions. We also classify the behaviors of the brane world near the future/past singularity.
