Title: Visible borders of spacetime generated by high-energy collisions
Authors: Ken-ichi Nakao and Tomohiro Harada and Umpei Miyamoto
Abstract: Several years ago, two of the present authors proposed the concept of the border of spacetime as a generalization of spacetime singularities. Visible borders of spacetime, which replace naked singularities of classical theory, are not only necessary for the mathematical completeness of general relativity but they also provide a window into new physics of strongly curved spacetime, which is observable in principle. By employing simple geometrical and dimensional arguments, we show that not only black holes but also visible borders of spacetime will be generated at, for example, the CERN Large Hadron Collider, provided that the energy scale of quantum gravity is near 1 TeV in the framework of the large extra-dimension scenario.
