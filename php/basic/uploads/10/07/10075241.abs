Title: $E_{11}$, Borcherds algebras and maximal supergravity
Authors: Marc Henneaux and Bernard L. Julia and Jérôme Levie
Abstract: The dynamical $p$-forms of torus reductions of maximal supergravity theory have been shown some time ago to possess remarkable algebraic structures. The set ("dynamical spectrum") of propagating $p$-forms has been described as a (truncation of a) real Borcherds superalgebra $\mf{V}_D$ that is characterized concisely by a Cartan matrix which has been constructed explicitly for each spacetime dimension $11 \geq D \geq 3.$ In the equations of motion, each differential form of degree $p$ is the coefficient of a (super-) group generator, which is itself of degree $p$ for a specific gradation (the $\mf{V}$-gradation). A slightly milder truncation of the Borcherds superalgebra enables one to predict also the "spectrum" of the non-dynamical $(D - 1)$ and $D$-forms. The maximal supergravity $p$-form spectra were reanalyzed more recently by truncation of the field spectrum of $E_{11}$ to the $p$-forms that are relevant after reduction from 11 to $D$ dimensions. We show in this paper how the Borcherds description can be systematically derived from the split ("maximally non compact") real form of $E_{11}$ for $D \geq 1.$ This explains not only why both structures lead to the same propagating $p$-forms and their duals for $p\leq (D - 2),$ but also why one obtains the same $(D - 1)$-forms and "top" $D$-forms. The Borcherds symmetries $\mf{V}_2$ and $\mf{V}_1$ are new too. We also introduce and use the concept of a presentation of a Lie algebra that is covariant under a given subalgebra.
