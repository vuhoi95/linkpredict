Title: Wall-crossing of D4-D2-D0 and flop of the conifold
Authors: Takahiro Nishinaka and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We discuss the wall-crossing of the BPS bound states of a non-compact holomorphic D4-brane with D2 and D0-branes on the conifold. We use the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula and analyze the BPS degeneracy in various chambers. In particular we obtain a relation between BPS degeneracies in two limiting attractor chambers related by a flop transition. Our result is consistent with known results and predicts BPS degeneracies in all chambers.
