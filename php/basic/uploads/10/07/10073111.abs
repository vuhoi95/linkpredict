Title: Proof of Gravity and Yang-Mills Amplitude Relations
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Poul H. Damgaard and Bo Feng and Thomas Sondergaard
Abstract: Using BCFW on-shell recursion techniques, we prove a sequence of explicit n-point Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations between gravity and Yang-Mills amplitudes at tree level.
