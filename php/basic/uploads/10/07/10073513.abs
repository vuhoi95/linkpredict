Title: Status of the Radial Schrodinger Equation
Authors: Anzor A. Khelashvili and Teimuraz P. Nadareishvili
Abstract: We show that equation for radial wave function in its traditional form is compatible with the full Schrodinger equation if and only if a definite additional constraint required. This constraint has a boundary condition form at the origin. Some of consequences are also discussed.
