Title: Scale-dependence of Non-Gaussianity in the Curvaton Model
Authors: Christian T. Byrnes and Kari Enqvist and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate the scale-dependence of f_NL in the self-interacting curvaton model. We show that the scale-dependence, encoded in the spectral index n_{f_NL}, can be observable by future cosmic microwave background observations, such as CMBpol, in a significant part of the parameter space of the model. We point out that together with information about the trispectrum g_NL, the self-interacting curvaton model parameters could be completely fixed by observations. We also discuss the scale-dependence of g_NL and its implications for the curvaton model, arguing that it could provide a complementary probe in cases where the theoretical value of n_{f_NL} is below observational sensitivity.
