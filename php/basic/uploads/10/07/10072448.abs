Abstract: We study deep inelastic scattering for vector and axial vector mesons in the holographic D4-D8 brane model. We consider tree level contributions with one particle in the final hadronic state. We obtain the unpolarized structure functions F1 and F2 for the rho and a1 mesons for q2 < 80 GeV2 and 0.2 < x < 1. We find that the ratio F2/(2xF1) is approximately equal to one for some ranges of x and q2, satisfying the Callan-Gross relation.
