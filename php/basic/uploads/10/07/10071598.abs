Title: Quantum finite-size effects for dyonic magnons in the AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Minkyoo Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We compute quantum corrections to finite-size effects for various dyonic giant magnons in the AdS_4 x CP^3 in two different approaches. The off-shell algebraic curve method is used to quantize the classical string configurations in semi-classical way and to compute the corrections to the string energies. These results are compared with the F-term L\"uscher formula based on the S-matrix of the AdS_4 / CFT_3. The fact that the two results match exactly provides another stringent test for the all-loop integrability conjecture and the exact S-matrix based on it.
