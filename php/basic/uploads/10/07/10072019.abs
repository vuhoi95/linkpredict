Title: Dynamical evolution of a scalar field coupling to Einstein's tensor in  the Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole spacetime
Authors: Songbai Chen and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of a scalar field coupling to Einstein's tensor in the background of Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. Our results show that the the coupling constant $\eta$ imprints in the wave dynamics of a scalar perturbation. In the weak coupling, we find that with the increase of the coupling constant $\eta$ the real parts of the fundamental quasinormal frequencies decrease and the absolute values of imaginary parts increase for fixed charge $q$ and multipole number $l$. In the strong coupling, we find that for $l\neq0$ the instability occurs when $\eta$ is larger than a certain threshold value $\eta_c$ which deceases with the multipole number $l$ and charge $q$. However, for the lowest $l=0$, we find that there does not exist such a threshold value and the scalar field always decays for arbitrary coupling constant.
