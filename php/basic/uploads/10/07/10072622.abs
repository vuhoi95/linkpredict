Title: The covariant perturbative string spectrum
Authors: Davide Forcella and Amihay Hanany and Jan Troost
Abstract: We provide generating functions for the perturbative massive string spectrum which are covariant with respect to the SO(9) little group, and which contain all the representation theoretic content of the spectrum. Generating functions for perturbative bosonic, Type II, Heterotic and Type I string theories are presented, and generalizations are discussed.
