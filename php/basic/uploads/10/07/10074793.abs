Title: The Leading Quantum Corrections to Stringy Kahler Potentials
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Callum Quigley and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: The structure of stringy quantum corrections to four-dimensional effective theories is particularly interesting for string phenomenology and attempts to stabilize moduli. We consider the heterotic string compactified on a Calabi-Yau space. For this case, we compute the leading corrections to the kinetic terms of moduli fields. The structure of these corrections is largely dictated by the underlying higher-dimensional extended supersymmetry. We find corrections generically of order (alpha')^2 rather than of order (alpha')^3 found in type II compactifications or heterotic compactifications with the standard embedding. We explore the implications of these corrections for breaking no-scale structure.
