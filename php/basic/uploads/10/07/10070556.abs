Title: Hidden Grassmann structure in the XXZ model V: sine-Gordon model
Authors: M. Jimbo and T. Miwa and F. Smirnov
Abstract: We study one-point functions of the sine-Gordon model on a cylinder. Our approach is based on a fermionic description of the space of descendent fields, developed in our previous works for conformal field theory and the sine-Gordon model on the plane. In the present paper we make an essential addition by giving a connection between various primary fields in terms of yet another kind of fermions. The one-point functions of primary fields and descendants are expressed in terms of a single function defined via the data from the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations.
