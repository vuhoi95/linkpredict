Title: A Holographic Fractional Topological Insulator
Authors: Carlos Hoyos-Badajoz and Kristan Jensen and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We give a holographic realization of the recently proposed low energy effective action describing a fractional topological insulator. In particular we verify that the surface of this hypothetical material supports a fractional quantum Hall current corresponding to half that of a Laughlin state.
