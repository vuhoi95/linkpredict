Title: Nonabelian (2,0) Tensor Multiplets and 3-algebras
Authors: Neil Lambert and Constantinos Papageorgakis
Abstract: Using 3-algebras we obtain a nonabelian system of equations that furnish a representation of the (2,0)-supersymmetric tensor multiplet. The on-shell conditions are quite restrictive so that the system can be reduced to five-dimensional gauge theory along with six-dimensional abelian (2,0) tensor multiplets. We briefly discuss possible applications to D4-branes using a spacelike reduction and M5-branes using a null reduction.
