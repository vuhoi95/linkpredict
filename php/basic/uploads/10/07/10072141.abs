Title: The Trace Anomaly and the Couplings of QED and QCD to Gravity
Authors: Roberta Armillis and Claudio Coriano and Luigi Delle Rose
Abstract: We report on the computation of the effective actions describing the interaction of gravity both for an abelian and a non-abelian gauge theory, mediated by the trace anomaly.
