Authors: Bin Liu and Yun-Chuan Dai and Xian-Ru Hu and Jian-Bo Deng
Abstract: Considering the results from Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory, a more precise relation between the number of bits and area in the holographic system is proposed. With this corrected relation and Debye model, two modified Friedmann equations are derived from the Hawking temperature and the Unruh temperature separately in entropic force. These equations could be better in describing the whole evolution of the universe.
