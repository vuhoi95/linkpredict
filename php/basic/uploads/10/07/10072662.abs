Title: Solving the Effective Field Equations for the Newtonian Potential
Authors: Sohyun Park and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: Loop corrections to the gravitational potential are usually inferred from scattering amplitudes, which seems quite different from how the linearized Einstein equations are solved with a static, point mass to give the classical potential. In this study we show how the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field equations can be used to compute loop corrections to the potential in a way which parallels the classical treatment. We derive explicit results for the one loop correction from the graviton self-energy induced by a massless, minimally coupled scalar.
