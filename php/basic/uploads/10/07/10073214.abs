Authors: Wu-Sheng Dai and Mi Xie
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an approach for the calculation of one-loop effective actions, vacuum energies, and spectral counting functions and discuss the application of this approach in some physical problems. Concretely, we construct the equations for these three quantities; this allows us to achieve them by directly solving equations. In order to construct the equations, we introduce shifted local one-loop effective actions, shifted local vacuum energies, and local spectral counting functions. We solve the equations of one-loop effective actions, vacuum energies, and spectral counting functions for free massive scalar fields in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, scalar fields in three-dimensional hyperbolic space $H_{3}$ (the Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space $AdS_{3}$), in $H_{3}/Z$ (the geometry of the Euclidean BTZ black hole), and in $S^{1}$, and the Higgs model in a $(1+1)$-dimensional finite interval. Moreover, in the above cases, we also calculate the spectra from the counting functions. Besides exact solutions, we give a general discussion on approximate solutions and construct the general series expansion for one-loop effective actions, vacuum energies, and spectral counting functions. In doing this, we encounter divergences. In order to remove the divergences, renormalization procedures are used. In this approach, these three physical quantities are regarded as spectral functions in the spectral problem.
