Title: Comment on `Supersymmetry, PT-symmetry and spectral bifurcation'
Authors: B. Bagchi and C. Quesne
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recent paper by Abhinav and Panigrahi entitled `Supersymmetry, PT-symmetry and spectral bifurcation' [Ann.\ Phys.\ 325 (2010) 1198], which considers two different types of superpotentials for the PT-symmetric complexified Scarf II potential, fails to take into account the invariance under the exchange of its coupling parameters. As a result, they miss the important point that for unbroken PT-symmetry this potential indeed has two series of real energy eigenvalues, to which one can associate two different superpotentials. This fact was first pointed out by the present authors during the study of complex potentials having a complex $sl(2)$ potential algebra.
