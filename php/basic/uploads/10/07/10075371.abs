Title: Note on nonsingular cyclic universes in the deformed Horava-Lifshitz  gravity
Authors: Edwin J. Son and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We perform the phase space analysis in terms of the linearization technique in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the softly broken detailed balance condition. It can be shown that the bouncing universe appears only for the positive spatial curvature of $k=+1$, and it is possible to obtain oscillating universe with the help of the negative dark radiation and the negative cosmological constant.
