Title: Graviton 1-loop partition function for 3-dimensional massive gravity
Authors: M. R. Gaberdiel and D. Grumiller and D. Vassilevich
Abstract: The graviton 1-loop partition function in Euclidean topologically massive gravity (TMG) is calculated using heat kernel techniques. The partition function does not factorize holomorphically, and at the chiral point it has the structure expected from a logarithmic conformal field theory. This gives strong evidence for the proposal that the dual conformal field theory to TMG at the chiral point is indeed logarithmic. We also generalize our results to new massive gravity.
