Title: Nuclear Physics in a Susy Universe
Authors: L. Clavelli and I. Perevalova
Abstract: We refine a previous zeroth order analysis of the nuclear properties of a supersymmetric (susy) universe with standard model particle content plus degenerate susy partners. No assumptions are made concerning the Higgs structure except we assume that the degenerate fermion/sfermion masses are non-zero. This alternate universe has been dubbed Susyria and it has been proposed that such a world may exist with zero vacuum energy in the string landscape.
