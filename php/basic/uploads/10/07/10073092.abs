Title: Variant Supercurrents and Linearized Supergravity
Authors: Sibo Zheng and Jia-Hui Huang
Abstract: In this paper the variant supercurrents based on consistency and completion in off-shell N=1 supergravity are studied. We formulate the embedding relations for supersymmetric current and energy tensor into supercurrent multiplet. Corresponding linearized supergravity is obtained with appropriate choice of Wess-Zumino gauge in each gravity supermultiplet.
