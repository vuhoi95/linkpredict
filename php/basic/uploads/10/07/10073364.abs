Title: On the pulsating strings in Sasaki-Einstein spaces
Authors: D. Arnaudov and H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We study the class of pulsating strings in AdS_5 x Y^{p,q} and AdS_5 x L^{p,q,r}. Using a generalized ansatz for pulsating string configurations, we find new solutions for this class in terms of Heun functions, and derive the particular case of AdS_5 x T^{1,1}, which was analyzed in arXiv:1006.1539 [hep-th]. Unfortunately, Heun functions are still little studied, and we are not able to quantize the theory quasi-classically and obtain the first corrections to the energy. The latter, due to AdS/CFT correspondence, is supposed to give the anomalous dimensions of operators of the gauge theory dual N=1 superconformal field theory.
