Title: Equidistribution Rates, Closed String Amplitudes, and the Riemann  Hypothesis
Authors: Sergio L. Cacciatori and Matteo Cardella
Abstract: We study asymptotic relations connecting unipotent averages of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$ automorphic forms to their integrals over the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. We obtain reformulations of the Riemann hypothesis as a class of problems concerning the computation of the equidistribution convergence rate in those asymptotic relations. We discuss applications of our results to closed string amplitudes. Remarkably, the Riemann hypothesis can be rephrased in terms of ultraviolet relations occurring in perturbative closed string theory.
