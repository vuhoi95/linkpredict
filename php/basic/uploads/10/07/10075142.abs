Title: Canonical pure spinor (Fermionic) T-duality
Authors: K. Sfetsos and K. Siampos and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We establish that the recently discovered fermionic T-duality can be viewed as a canonical transformation in phase space. This requires a careful treatment of constrained Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we show how the canonical transformation approach for bosonic T-duality can be extended to include Ramond--Ramond backgrounds in the pure spinor formalism.
