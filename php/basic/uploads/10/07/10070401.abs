Title: The classifying algebra for defects
Authors: Jurgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert and Carl Stigner
Abstract: We demonstrate that topological defects in a rational conformal field theory can be described by a classifying algebra for defects - a finite-dimensional semisimple unital commutative associative algebra whose irreducible representations give the defect transmission coefficients. We show in particular that the structure constants of the classifying algebra are traces of operators on spaces of conformal blocks and that the defect transmission coefficients determine the defect partition functions.
