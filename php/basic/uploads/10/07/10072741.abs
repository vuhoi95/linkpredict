Title: The low temperature corrections to the Casimir force between a sphere  and a plane
Authors: Michael Bordag and Irina G. Pirozhenko
Abstract: We calculate the low temperature corrections to the free energy for a sphere in front of a plane. First, the scalar field obeying Dirichet or Neumann boundary conditions is considered. Second, the electromagnetic field is studied, the sphere being perfectly conducting and being a dielectric ball with both, constant permittivity and permittivity of the plasma model.
