Title: Covariant power-counting renormalizable gravity: Lorentz symmetry  breaking and accelerating early-time FRW universe
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We continue the study of covariant power-counting renormalizable gravity constrained by scalar Lagrange multiplier. Lorentz symmetry breaking is investigated in such a theory in comparison with the one in ghost condensation model. Covariant power-counting renormalizable vector gravity which is invariant under $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is proposed. Several forms of vector Lagrange multiplier in this theory are discussed. It is shown that covariant scalar/vector gravity under consideration may have power-law or de Sitter accelerating cosmological solution corresponding to inflationary era. Simplest black hole solution is obtained and dispersion relations for graviton are presented.
