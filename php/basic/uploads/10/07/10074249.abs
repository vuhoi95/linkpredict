Title: Chiral and Parity Symmetry Breaking for Planar Fermions: Effects of a  Heat Bath and Uniform External Magnetic Field
Authors: Alejandro Ayala and Adnan Bashir and Enif Gutierrez and Alfredo Raya and Angel Sanchez
Abstract: We study chiral symmetry breaking for relativistic fermions, described by a parity violating Lagrangian in 2+1-dimensions, in the presence of a heat bath and a uniform external magnetic field. Working within their four-component formalism allows for the inclusion of both parity-even and -odd mass terms. Therefore, we can define two types of fermion anti-fermion condensates. For a given value of the magnetic field, there exist two different critical temperatures which would render one of these condensates identically zero, while the other would survive. Our analysis is completely general: it requires no particular simplifying hierarchy among the energy scales involved, namely, bare masses, field strength and temperature. However, we do reproduce some earlier results, obtained or anticipated in literature, corresponding to special kinematical regimes for the parity conserving case. Relating the chiral condensate to the one-loop effective Lagrangian, we also obtain the magnetization and the pair production rate for different fermion species in a uniform electric field through the replacement $B\to-iE$.
