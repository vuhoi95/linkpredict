Title: No-dipole-hair theorem for higher-dimensional static black holes
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Seiju Ohashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We prove that static black holes in n-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime cannot support non-trivial electric p-form field strengths when (n+1)/2<= p <= n-1. This implies in particular that static black holes cannot possess dipole hair under these fields.
