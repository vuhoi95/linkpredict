Title: Superstatistics approach to path integral for a relativistic particle
Authors: Petr Jizba and Hagen Kleinert
Abstract: Superstatistics permits the calculation of the Feynman propagator of a relativistic particle in a novel way from a superstatistical average over non-relativistic single-particle paths. We illustrate this for the Klein-Gordon particle in the Feshbach-Villars representation, and for the Dirac particle in the Schroedinger-Dirac representation. As a byproduct we recover the worldline representation of Klein-Gordon and Dirac propagators, and discuss the role of the smearing distributions in fixing the reparametrization freedom. The emergent relativity picture that follows from our approach together with a novel representation of the Lorentz group for the Feshbach-Villars particle are also discussed.
