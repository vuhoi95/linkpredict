Title: On Maximal Massive 3D Supergravity
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Olaf Hohm and Jan Rosseel and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We construct, at the linearized level, the three-dimensional (3D) N = 4 supersymmetric "general massive supergravity" and the maximally supersymmetric N = 8 "new massive supergravity". We also construct the maximally supersymmetric linearized N = 7 topologically massive supergravity, although we expect N = 6 to be maximal at the non-linear level.
