Title: Proton Hexality in Local Grand Unification
Authors: Stefan Forste and Hans Peter Nilles and Saul Ramos-Sanchez and Patrick K. S. Vaudrevange
Abstract: Proton hexality is a discrete symmetry that avoids the problem of too fast proton decay in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model. Unfortunately it is inconsistent with conventional grand unification. We show that proton hexality can be incorporated in the scheme of "Local Grand Unification" discussed in the framework of model building in (heterotic) string theory.
