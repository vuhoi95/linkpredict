Title: Thermodynamics of the Pauli oscillators and Lee-Wick partners of the  Standard Model particles
Authors: Kaushik Bhattacharya and Suratna Das
Abstract: The present article is about the statistical mechanics of non-trivial field configurations. The non-trivial fields arise from the negative sign of the commutators and the anticommutators of the bosonic and fermionic field excitations. These kinds of fields were previously studied by Pauli and Lee and Wick. The thermal distribution function of the above mentioned fields are calculated in the article and using the thermal distribution functions the energy density, pressure and entropy density of the non-trivial field configurations are found out. The results match exactly with a previous calculation done by Fornal et. al. for higher derivative Lee-Wick theories showing a deeper similarity with the earlier work. It is assumed that such kinds of non-trivial fields may have existed in the early universe and may have some cosmological relevance.
