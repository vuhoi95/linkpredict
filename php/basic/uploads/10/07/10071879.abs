Title: Two-component liquid model for the quark-gluon plasma
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Henri Verschelde and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We consider a two-component-liquid model, a la Landau, for the quark-gluon plasma. Qualitatively, the model fits well some crucial observations concerning the plasma properties. Dynamically, the model assumes the existence of an effective scalar field which is condensed. The existence of such a condensate is supported by lattice data. We indicate a possible crucial test of the model by lattice simulations.
