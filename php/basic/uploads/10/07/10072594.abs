Title: Coupling the inflaton to an expanding aether
Authors: William Donnelly and Ted Jacobson
Abstract: We consider a Lorentz-violating theory of inflation consisting of Einstein-aether theory with a scalar inflaton coupled bilinearly to the expansion of the aether. We determine the conditions for linearized stability, positive energy, and vanishing of preferred-frame post-Newtonian parameters, and find that all these conditions can be met. In homogeneous and isotropic cosmology, the inflaton-aether expansion coupling leads to a driving force on the inflaton that is proportional to the Hubble parameter. This force affects the slow-roll dynamics, but still allows for a natural end to inflation.
