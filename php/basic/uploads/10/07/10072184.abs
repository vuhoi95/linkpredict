Title: The particle number in Galilean holography
Authors: Koushik Balasubramanian and John McGreevy
Abstract: Recently, gravity duals for certain Galilean-invariant conformal field theories have been constructed. In this paper, we point out that the spectrum of the particle number operator in the examples found so far is not a necessary consequence of the existence of a gravity dual. We record some progress towards more realistic spectra. In particular, we construct bulk systems with asymptotic Schrodinger symmetry and only one extra dimension. In examples, we find solutions which describe these Schrodinger-symmetric systems at finite density. A lift to M-theory is used to resolve a curvature singularity. As a happy byproduct of this analysis, we realize a state which could be called a holographic Mott insulator.
