Title: Wilson Loops in N=2 Superconformal Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Roman Andree and Donovan Young
Abstract: We present a three-loop O(g^6) calculation of the difference between the expectation values of Wilson loops evaluated in N=4 and superconformal N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N) using dimensional reduction. We find a massive reduction of required Feynman diagrams, leaving only certain two-matter-loop corrections to the gauge field and associated scalar propagator. This "diagrammatic difference" leaves a finite result proportional to the bare propagators and allows the recovery of the zeta(3) term coming from the matrix model for the 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loop in the N=2 theory. The result is valid also for closed Wilson loops of general shape. Comments are made concerning light-like polygons and supersymmetric loops in the plane and on S^2.
