Title: Gravitons in Flatland
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Olaf Hohm and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We review some features of three-dimensional (3D) massive gravity theories. In particular, we stress the role of the Schouten tensor, explore an analogy with Lovelock gravity and discuss renormalizabilty.
