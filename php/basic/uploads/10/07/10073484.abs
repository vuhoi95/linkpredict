Title: Thermal effective action for 1+1 dimensional massive QED
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: In continuation of our earlier proposal for evaluating thermal effective actions, we determine the exact fermion propagator in 1+1 dimensional massive QED. This propagator is used to derive the finite temperature effective action of the theory which generates systematically all the one loop Feynman amplitudes calculated in thermal perturbation theory. Various aspects of the effective action including its imaginary part are discussed.
