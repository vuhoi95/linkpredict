Title: Violation of causality in f(R) gravity
Authors: M. J. Reboucas and J. Santos
Abstract: We examine the question as to whether the f(R) gravity theories, in both metric and in Palatini formalisms, permit space-times in which the causality is violated. We show that the field equations of these f(R) gravity theories admit solutions with violation of causality for a physically well-motivated perfect-fluid matter content.
