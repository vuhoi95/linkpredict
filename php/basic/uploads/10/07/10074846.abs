Title: On the equivalence principle and gravitational and inertial mass  relation of classical charged particles
Authors: Mario Goto and Paulo Laerte Natti and Erica Regina Takano Natti
Abstract: We show that the locally constant force necessary to get a stable hyperbolic motion regime for classical charged point particles, actually, is a combination of an applied external force and of the electromagnetic radiation reaction force. It implies, as the strong Equivalence Principle is valid, that the passive gravitational mass of a charged point particle should be slight greater than its inertial mass. An interesting new feature that emerges from the unexpected behavior of the gravitational and inertial mass relation, for classical charged particles, at very strong gravitational field, is the existence of a critical, particle dependent, gravitational field value that signs the validity domain of the strong Equivalence Principle. For electron and proton, these critical field values are $g_{c}\simeq 4.8\times 10^{31}m/s^{2}$ and $g_{c}\simeq 8.8\times 10^{34}m/s^{2}$, respectively.
