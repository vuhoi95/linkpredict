Title: 10 + 1 to 3 + 1 in an Early Universe with mutually BPS Intersecting  Branes
Authors: Samrat Bhowmick and S. Kalyana Rama
Abstract: We assume that the early universe is homogeneous, anisotropic, and is dominated by the mutually BPS 22'55' intersecting branes of M theory. The spatial directions are all taken to be toroidal. Using analytical and numerical methods, we study the evolution of such an universe. We find that, asymptotically, three spatial directions expand to infinity and the remaining spatial directions reach stabilised values. Any stabilised values can be obtained by a fine tuning of initial brane densities. We give a physical description of the stabilisation mechanism. Also, from the perspective of four dimensional spacetime, the effective four dimensional Newton's constant G_4 is now time varying. Its time dependence will follow from explicit solutions. We find in the present case that, asymptotically, G_4 exhibits characteristic log periodic oscillations.
