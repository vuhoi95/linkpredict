Abstract: We develop a previously proposed gauge-invariant method to integrate out infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of vector and axialvector mesons in a class of models of holographic QCD (HQCD). The HQCD is reduced by our method to the chiral perturbation theory with the hidden local symmetry (HLS) having only the lowest KK mode identified as the HLS gauge boson. We take the Sakai-Sugimoto model as a concrete HQCD, and completely determine the ${\cal O} (p^4)$ terms as well as the ${\cal O}(p^2)$ terms from the DBI part and the anomaly-related (intrinsic parity odd) gauge-invariant terms from the CS part. Effects of higher KK modes are fully included in these terms. To demonstrate power of our method, we compute momentum-dependences of several form factors such as the pion electromagnetic form factors, the $\pi^0$-$\gamma$ and $\omega$-$\pi^0$ transition form factors compared with experiment, which was not achieved before due to complication to handle infinite sums. We also study other anomaly-related quantities like $\gamma^*$-$\pi^0$-$\pi^+$-$\pi^-$ and $\omega$-$\pi^0$-$\pi^+$-$\pi^-$ vertex functions.
