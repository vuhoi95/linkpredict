Abstract: We construct an MSSM with three generations from the heterotic string compactified on a smooth 6D internal manifold using Abelian gauge fluxes only. The compactification space is obtained as a resolution of the T6/Z2xZ2xZ2-free orbifold. The Z2-free involution of such a resolution breaks the SU(5) GUT group down to the SM gauge group using a suitably chosen (freely acting) Wilson line. Surprisingly, the spectrum on a given resolution is larger than the one on the corresponding orbifold taking into account the branching and Higgsing due to the blow-up modes. The existence of extra resolution states is closely related to the fact that the resolution procedure is not unique. Rather, the various resolutions are connected to each other by flop transitions.
