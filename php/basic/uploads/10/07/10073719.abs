Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the understanding of the connection between five branes on resolved geometries and the corresponding generalizations of complex deformations in the context of the warped resolved deformed conifold, we consider the construction of five branes solutions on the resolved cone over Y^{p,q} spaces. We establish the existence of supersymmetric five branes solutions wrapped on two-cycles of the resolved cone over Y^{p,q} in the probe limit. We then use calibration techniques to begin the construction of fully back-reacted five branes; we present an Ansatz and the corresponding equations of motion. Our results establish a detailed framework to study back-reacted five branes wrapped on the resolved cone over Y^{p,q} and as a first step we find explicit solutions and construct an asymptotic expansion with the expected properties.
