Abstract: In this note we generalize entropy based on the quantum mechanical probability density distribution. Motivated by J. Munkhammar and the uncertainty of entropy we modified the origin wave function of the test particle. The corrected one acting on the quantum particle is subject to the uncertainty principle. Considering the uncertain relation, the corrected probability of the particle for measurement on holographic screen has been proposed. We also derivate the speed of information transfer described by wave function. Our quantum approach to entropy stress the information in a physical system is directly associated with its quantum mechanical entropy defined by the equality of the partition function.
