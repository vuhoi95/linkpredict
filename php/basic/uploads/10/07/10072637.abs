Title: Is BTZ a separate superselection sector of CTMG?
Authors: S. Deser and J. Franklin
Abstract: We exhibit exact solutions of (positive) matter coupled to cosmological TMG; they necessarily evolve to conical singularity/negative mass, rather than physical black hole, BTZ. By providing evidence that the latter constitutes a separate, "superselection", sector not reachable from the physical one, they also provide justification for retaining TMG's original "wrong" G-sign to ensure excitation stability here as well.
