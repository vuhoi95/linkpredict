Title: Massive Three-Dimensional Supergravity From R+R^2 Action in Six  Dimensions
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and E. Sezgin
Abstract: We obtain a three-parameter family of massive N=1 supergravities in three dimensions from the 3-sphere reduction of an off-shell N=(1,0) six-dimensional Poincare supergravity that includes a curvature squared invariant. The three-dimensional theory contains an off-shell supergravity multiplet and an on-shell scalar matter multiplet. We then generalise this in three dimensions to an eight-parameter family of supergravities. We also find a duality relationship between the six-dimensional theory and the N=(1,0) six-dimensional theory obtained through a T^4 reduction of the heterotic string effective action that includes the higher-order terms associated with the supersymmetrisation of the anomaly-cancelling \tr(R\wedge R) term.
