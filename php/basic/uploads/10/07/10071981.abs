Title: Gauge gravity duality for d-wave superconductors: prospects and  challenges
Authors: Francesco Benini and Christopher P. Herzog and Rakibur Rahman and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We write down an action for a charged, massive spin two field in a fixed Einstein background. Despite some technical problems, we argue that in an effective field theory framework and in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, this action can be used to study the properties of a superfluid phase transition with a d-wave order parameter in a dual strongly interacting field theory. We investigate the phase diagram and the charge conductivity of the superfluid phase. We also explain how possible couplings between the spin two field and bulk fermions affect the fermion spectral function.
