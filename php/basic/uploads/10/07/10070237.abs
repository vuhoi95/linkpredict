Title: Exponential suppression with four legs and an infinity of loops
Authors: David J. Broadhurst and Andrei I. Davydychev
Abstract: The L-loop 4-point ladder diagram of massless phi^3 theory is finite when all 4 legs are off-shell and is given in terms of polylogarithms with orders ranging from L to 2L. We obtain the exact solution of the linear Dyson-Schwinger equation that sums these ladder diagrams and show that this sum vanishes exponentially fast at strong coupling.
