Title: SU(m) non-Abelian anyons in the Jain hierarchy of quantum Hall states
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We show that different classes of topological order can be distinguished by the dynamical symmetry algebra of edge excitations. Fundamental topological order is realized when this algebra is the largest possible, the algebra of quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms, called $W_{1+\infty}$. We argue that this order is realized in the Jain hierarchy of fractional quantum Hall states and show that it is more robust than the standard Abelian Chern-Simons order since it has a lower entanglement entropy due to the non-Abelian character of the quasi-particle anyon excitations. These behave as SU($m$) quarks, where $m$ is the number of components in the hierarchy. We propose the topological entanglement entropy as the experimental measure to detect the existence of these quantum Hall quarks. Non-Abelian anyons in the $\nu = 2/5$ fractional quantum Hall states could be the primary candidates to realize qbits for topological quantum computation.
