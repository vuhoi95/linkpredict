Title: On smoothness of Black Saturns
Authors: Piotr T. Chruściel and Michał Eckstein and Sebastian J. Szybka
Abstract: We prove smoothness of the domain of outer communications (d.o.c.) of the Black Saturn solutions of Elvang and Figueras. We show that the metric on the d.o.c. extends smoothly across two disjoint event horizons with topology R x S^3 and R x S^1 x S^2. We establish stable causality of the d.o.c. when the Komar angular momentum of the spherical component of the horizon vanishes, and present numerical evidence for stable causality in general.
