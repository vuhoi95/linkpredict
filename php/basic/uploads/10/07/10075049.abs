Title: Gauge non-invariance as tests of emergent gauge symmetry
Authors: John F. Donoghue and Mohamed Anber and Ufuk Aydemir
Abstract: We motivate the concept of emergent gauge symmetry and discuss ways that this concept can be tested. The key idea is that if a symmetry is emergent, one should look for small violations of this symmetry because the underlying fundamental theory does not contain the symmetry. We describe our recent work implementing this idea in the gravity sector. We also describe the reasons why violations of gauge symmetry may well be linked to violations of Lorentz invariance.
