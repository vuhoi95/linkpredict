Authors: Hua-Bi Zeng and Zhe-Yong Fan and Hong-Shi Zong
Abstract: A d-wave holographic superconductor is studied under a constant magnetic field by perturbation method, we obtain both droplet and triangular vortex lattice solution. The results are the same as the s-wave holographic superconductor. The non-Abelian holographic superconductor with $p+ip$-wave background is also studied under magnetic field, unlike the d-wave and s-wave models, we find that the non-Abelian model has only droplet solution.
