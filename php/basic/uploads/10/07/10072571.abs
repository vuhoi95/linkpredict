Title: Perturbations in Matter Bounce with Non-minimal Coupling
Authors: Taotao Qiu and Kwei-Chou Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the perturbations in matter bounce induced from Lee-Wick lagrangian with the involvement of non-minimal coupling to the Einstein Gravity. We find that this extra non-minimal coupling term can cause a red-tilt on the primordial metric perturbation at extremely large scales. It can also lead to large enhancement of reheating of the normal field particles compared to the usual minimal coupling models.
