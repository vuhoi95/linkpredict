Title: Holographic Phase Transition to Topological Dyons
Authors: Davood Allahbakhshi and Farhad Ardalan
Abstract: The dynamical stability of a Julia-Zee solution in the AdS background in a four dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is studied. We find that the model with a vanishing scalar field develops a non-zero value for the field at a certain critical temperature which corresponds to a topological dyon in the bulk and a topological phase transition at the boundary.
