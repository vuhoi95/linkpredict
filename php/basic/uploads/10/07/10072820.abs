Title: Non-Canonical Perturbation Theory of Non-Linear Sigma Models
Authors: V. Aldaya and M. Calixto and F. F. LÃ³pez-Ruiz
Abstract: We explore the O(N)-invariant Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in a different perturbative regime from the usual relativistic-free-field one, by using non-canonical basic commutation relations adapted to the underlying O(N) symmetry of the system, which also account for the non-trivial (non-flat) geometry and topology of the target manifold.
