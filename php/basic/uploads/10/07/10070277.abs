Title: Chaos in the Gauge/Gravity Correspondence
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Cesar A. Terrero-Escalante
Abstract: We study the motion of a string in the background of the Schwarzschild black hole in AdS_5 by applying the standard arsenal of dynamical systems. Our description of the phase space includes: the power spectrum, the largest Lyapunov exponent, Poincare sections and basins of attractions. We find convincing evidence that the motion is chaotic. We discuss the implications of some of the quantities associated with chaotic systems for aspects of the gauge/gravity correspondence. In particular, we suggest some potential relevance for the information loss paradox.
