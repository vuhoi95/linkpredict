Title: Gravitational Instantons and Euclidean Supersymmetry
Authors: J. B. Gutowski and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: Supersymmetric instanton solutions in four dimensional Euclidean ungauged Einstein-Maxwell theory are analysed and classified according to the fraction of supersymmetry they preserve, using spinorial geometry techniques.
