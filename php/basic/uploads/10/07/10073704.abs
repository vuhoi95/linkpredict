Title: Topological insulating phases in mono and bilayer graphene
Authors: Alberto Cortijo and Adolfo G. Grushin and Maria A. H. Vozmediano
Abstract: We analyze the influence of different quadratic interactions giving rise to time reversal invariant topological insulating phases in mono and bilayer graphene. We make use of the effective action formalism to determine the dependence of the Chern Simons coefficient on the different interactions.
