Title: The asymmetry of the dimension 2 gluon condensate: the finite  temperature case
Authors: D. Vercauteren and H. Verschelde
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the work begun in a previous article. We compute, in the formalism of local composite operators, the value of the asymmetry in the dimension two condensate for finite temperatures. We find a positive value for the asymmetry, which disappears when the temperature is increased. We also compute the value of the full dimension two condensate for higher temperatures, and we find that it decreases in absolute value, finally disappearing for sufficiently high temperature. We also comment on the temperature dependence of the electric and magnetic components of the condensate separately. We compare our results with the corresponding lattice date found by Chernodub and Ilgenfritz.
