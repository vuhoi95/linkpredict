Title: Generic feature of future crossing of phantom divide in viable $f(R)$  gravity models
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Chao-Qiang Geng and Chung-Chi Lee
Abstract: We study the equation of state for dark energy and explicitly demonstrate that the future crossings of the phantom divide line $w_{\mathrm{DE}}=-1$ are the generic feature in the existing viable $f(R)$ gravity models. We also explore the future evolution of the cosmological horizon entropy and illustrate that the cosmological horizon entropy oscillates with time due to the oscillatory behavior of the Hubble parameter. The important cosmological consequence is that in the future, the sign of the time derivative of the Hubble parameter changes from negative to positive in these viable $f(R)$ gravity models.
