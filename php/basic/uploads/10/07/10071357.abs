Title: Hidden Conformal Symmetry of Self-Dual Warped AdS_3 Black Holes in  Topological Massive Gravity
Authors: Ran Li and Ming-Fan Li and Ji-Rong Ren
Abstract: We extend the recently proposal of hidden conformal symmetry to the self-dual warped AdS$_3$ black holes in topological massive gravity. It is shown that the wave equation of massive scalar field with sufficient small angular momentum can be reproduced by the SL(2, R) Casimir quadratic operator. Due to the periodic identification in the $\phi$ direction, it is found that only the left section of hidden conformal symmetry is broken to U(1), while the right section is unbroken, which only gives the left temperature of dual CFT. As a check of the dual CFT conjecture of self-warped AdS$_3$ black hole, we further compute the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and absorption cross section and quasinormal modes of scalar field perturbation and show these are just of the forms predicted by the dual CFT.
