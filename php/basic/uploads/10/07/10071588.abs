Abstract: We investigate BPS conditions preserving n/12 (n = 1,...,6) supersymmetries in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) model. The BPS equations are classified in terms of the number of preserved supercharges and remaining subgroups of the SU(4)_R symmetry. We study structures of a map between projection conditions for the supercharges in eleven dimensions and those in the ABJM model. The BPS configurations in the ABJM model can be interpreted as known BPS objects in eleven-dimensional Mtheory,such as intersecting M2, M5-branes, M-waves, KK-monopoles and M9-branes. We also show that these BPS conditions reduce to those in N = 8 super Yang-Mills theory via the standard D2-reduction procedure in a consistent way with the M-theory interpretation of the BPS conditions.
