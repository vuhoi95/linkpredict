Title: Analytic Results for MHV Wilson Loops
Authors: Paul Heslop and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We obtain concise analytic formulae for Wilson loops computed on special n-point polygonal contours through two-loops in weakly coupled N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory. The contours we consider can be embedded into a (1+1)-dimensional subspace of the 4-dimensional gauge theory, corresponding to the boundary of the AdS_3 on the string theory side. Our analytic results hold for any number of edges, thus generalising to arbitrary n the recently derived expressions for 2-dimensional octagons. These polygonal Wilson loops have been conjectured to be equivalent to MHV scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM.
