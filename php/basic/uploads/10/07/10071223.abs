Title: Open problems in hot QCD
Authors: Jan Moeller and York Schroder
Abstract: We try to give a comprehensive review of the main methods used in modern multi-loop calculations in finite-temperature field theory. While going through explicit examples, we point out similarities and differences with respect to the zero-temperature case, utilizing common techniques in a transparent way whenever possible.
