Title: A new family of shape invariantly deformed Darboux-PÃ¶schl-Teller  potentials with continuous \ell
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: We present a new family of shape invariant potentials which could be called a ``continuous \ell version" of the potentials corresponding to the exceptional (X_{\ell}) J1 Jacobi polynomials constructed recently by the present authors. In a certain limit, it reduces to a continuous \ell family of shape invariant potentials related to the exceptional (X_{\ell}) L1 Laguerre polynomials. The latter was known as one example of the `conditionally exactly solvable potentials' on a half line.
