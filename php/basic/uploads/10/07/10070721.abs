Title: Notes on TQFT Wire Models and Coherence Equations for SU(3) Triangular  Cells
Authors: Robert Coquereaux and Esteban Isasi and Gil Schieber
Abstract: After a summary of the TQFT wire model formalism we bridge the gap from Kuperberg equations for SU(3) spiders to Ocneanu coherence equations for systems of triangular cells on fusion graphs that describe modules associated with the fusion category of SU(3) at level k. We show how to solve these equations in a number of examples.
