Title: A matrix model for the topological string II: The spectral curve and  mirror geometry
Authors: Bertrand Eynard and Amir-Kian Kashani-Poor and Olivier Marchal
Abstract: In a previous paper, we presented a matrix model reproducing the topological string partition function on an arbitrary given toric Calabi-Yau manifold. Here, we study the spectral curve of our matrix model and thus derive, upon imposing certain minimality assumptions on the spectral curve, the large volume limit of the BKMP "remodeling the B-model" conjecture, the claim that Gromov-Witten invariants of any toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold coincide with the spectral invariants of its mirror curve.
