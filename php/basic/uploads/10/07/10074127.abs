Title: Characteristic Classes and Integrable Systems for Simple Lie Groups
Authors: A. Levin and M. Olshanetsky and A. Smirnov and A. Zotov
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our previous paper \cite{LOSZ}. For simple complex Lie groups with non-trivial center, i.e. classical simply-connected groups, $E_6$ and $E_7$ we consider elliptic Modified Calogero-Moser systems corresponding to the Higgs bundles with an arbitrary characteristic class. These systems are generalization of the classical Calogero-Moser (CM) systems related to a simple Lie groups and contain CM systems related to some (unbroken) subalgebras. For all algebras we construct a special basis, corresponding to non-trivial characteristic classes, the explicit forms of Lax operators and Hamiltonians.
