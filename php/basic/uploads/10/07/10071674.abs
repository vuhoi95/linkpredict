Title: Boundary Giant Magnons and Giant Gravitons
Authors: A. Ciavarella and P. Bowcock
Abstract: We construct the full set of boundary giant magnons on $\mathbb{R}\times S^{2}$ attached to the maximal $Z=0$ giant graviton by mapping from the general solution to static sine-Gordon theory on the interval and compute the values of $\Delta-J$ at finite $J$, including the leading order corrections when $J$ is large. We then consider the Born-Infeld theory of the giant graviton itself to construct BIon spike solutions that correspond to the world volume description of the boundary giant magnons at finite $J$.
