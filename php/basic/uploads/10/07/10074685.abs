Title: Generalized Zeta Function Regularization and the Multiplicative Anomaly
Authors: G. Cognola and S. Zerbini
Abstract: A brief survey of the zeta function regularization and multiplicative anomaly issues when the associated zeta function of fluctuation operator is the regular at the origin (regular case) as well as when it is singular at the origin (singular case) is presented. In the singular case, new results for the multiplicative anomaly are presented
