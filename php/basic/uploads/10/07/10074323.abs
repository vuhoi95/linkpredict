Title: Charged Black Holes in New Massive Gravity
Authors: Ahmad Ghodsi and Mohammad Moghadassi
Abstract: We construct charged black hole solutions to three-dimensional New Massive Gravity (NMG), by adding electromagnetic Maxwell and Chern-Simons actions. We find charged black holes in the form of warped AdS_3 and "log" solutions in specific critical point. The entropy, mass and angular momentum of these black holes are computed.
