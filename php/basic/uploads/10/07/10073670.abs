Authors: S. Capozziello and R. Cianci and M. De Laurentis and S. Vignolo
Abstract: We discuss the emergence of scalar gravitational waves in metric-affine f(R)-gravity. Such a component allows to discriminate between metric and metric-affine theories The intrinsic meaning of this result is that the geodesic structure of the theory can be discriminated. We extend the formalism of cross correlation analysis, including the additional polarization mode, and calculate the detectable energy density of the spectrum for cosmological relic gravitons. The possible detection of the signal is discussed against sensitivities of VIRGO, LIGO and LISA interferometers.
