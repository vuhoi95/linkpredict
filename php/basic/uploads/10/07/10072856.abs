Title: The supergravity fields for a D-brane with a travelling wave from string  amplitudes
Authors: William Black and Rodolfo Russo and David Turton
Abstract: We calculate the supergravity fields sourced by a D-brane with a null travelling wave from disk amplitudes in type IIB string theory compactified on T^4 x S^1. The amplitudes reproduce all the non-trivial features of the previously known two-charge supergravity solutions in the D-brane/momentum frame, providing a direct link between the microscopic bound states and their macroscopic descriptions.
