Title: E7 groups from octonionic magic square
Authors: Sergio L. Cacciatori and Francesco Dalla Piazza and Antonio Scotti
Abstract: In this paper we continue our program, started in [2], of building up explicit generalized Euler angle parameterizations for all exceptional compact Lie groups. Here we solve the problem for E7, by first providing explicit matrix realizations of the Tits construction of a Magic Square product between the exceptional octonionic algebra J and the quaternionic algebra H, both in the adjoint and the 56 dimensional representations. Then, we provide the Euler parametrization of E7 starting from its maximal subgroup U=(E6 x U(1))/Z3. Next, we give the constructions for all the other maximal compact subgroups.
