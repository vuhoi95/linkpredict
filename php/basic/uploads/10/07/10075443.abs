Title: A Phenomenological study on the wino radiative decay in anomalous  $U(1)'$ models
Authors: F. Fucito and A. Lionetto and A. Racioppi and D. Ricci Pacifici
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model by at least one extra U(1) gauge symmetry has been investigated by many authors. In this paper we explore the possibility that this extra U(1) is anomalous. One of the possible signatures of this model could be given by the photons produced in the decays of the NLSP into the LSP.
