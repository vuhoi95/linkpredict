Title: Heavy quark potential and QCD beta function from a deformed $AdS_5$  model
Authors: Song He and Mei Huang and Qi-shu Yan
Abstract: We show that in a deformed ${\rm AdS}_5$ model with an explicit infrared cutoff included in the logarithmic correction $-c_0\log[(z_{IR}-z)/z_{IR}]$, the heavy quark Cornell potential can be fitted very well, the corresponding beta-function agrees with the QCD beta-function at 2-loop level reasonably well, and its dual dilaton potential is bounded from below in infrared. The results are compared with those in the Andreev-Zakharov model and the Pirner-Galow model.
