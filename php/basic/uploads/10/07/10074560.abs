Title: Semi-classical monopole operators in Chern-Simons-matter theories
Authors: Hee-Cheol Kim and Seok Kim
Abstract: We construct classical solutions for magnetic monopole operators in N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theories. In particular, we explicitly find solutions with unequal magnetic flux contents in the two U(N) gauge groups, whose existence has been known only indirectly. We also study the ground state degeneracies of the U(2) x U(2) monopoles by quantizing the moduli of the solution.
