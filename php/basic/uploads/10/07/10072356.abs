Title: One-Loop Spectroscopy of Scalar Three-Point Functions in planar N=4  super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Andre Grossardt and Jan Plefka
Abstract: We report on a systematic study of scalar field three-point functions in planar SU(N) N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. The motivation for this work is to provide sufficient data for future conjectures on the higher-loop form of the structure constants possibly involving integrability. For this we have computed a sample of 70 structure constants at one-loop order involving primary operators of up to and including length five built entirely from scalar fields. We observe in all 17 cases occurring in our sample that the one-loop structure constant of two protected chiral primary operators and one unprotected operator is given by a simple linear function involving the anomalous scaling dimension of the latter. Moreover, a similar simple one-loop formula is proven for the three-point structure constants of the Konishi operator and two arbitrary protected or un-protected operators. It is again determined by the anomalous scaling dimensions of the operators involved.
