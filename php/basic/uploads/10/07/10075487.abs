Title: Radion production in exclusive processes at CERN LHC
Authors: V. P. Goncalves and W. K. Sauter
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario the compactification radius of the extra dimension is stabilized by the radion, which is a scalar field lighter than the graviton Kaluza-Klein states. It implies that the detection of the radion will be the first signature of the stabilized RS model. In this paper we study the exclusive production of the radion in electromagnetic and diffractive hadron - hadron collisions at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that the diffractive production of radion is dominant and should be feasible of study at CERN LHC.
