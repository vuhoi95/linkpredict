Title: Scalar tilt from broken conformal invariance
Authors: V. Rubakov and M. Osipov
Abstract: Within recently proposed scenario which explains flatness of the spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations by a combination of conformal and global symmetries, we discuss the effect of weak breaking of conformal invariance. We find that the scalar power spectrum obtains a small tilt which depends on both the strength of conformal symmetry breaking and the law of evolution of the scale factor.
