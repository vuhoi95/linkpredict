Title: Generating dynamical black hole solutions
Authors: A. K. Dawood and S. G. Ghosh
Abstract: We prove a theorem that characterizes a large family of non-static solutions to Einstein equations, representing, in general, spherically symmetric Type II fluid. It is shown that the best known dynamical black hole solutions to Einstein equations are particular cases from this family. Thus we extend a recent work of Salgado \cite{ms} to non-static case. The spherically symmetric static black hole solutions, for Type I fluid, are also retrieved.
