Abstract: Grand unified theories of fundamental forces predict that magnetic monopoles are inevitable in the Universe because the second homotopy group of the order parameter manifold is $\mathbb{Z}$. We point out that monopoles can annihilate in pairs due to an influence of Alice strings. As a consequence, a monopole charge is charactarized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ rather than $\mathbb{Z}$ if the Universe can accommodate Alice strings, which is the case of certain grand unified theories.
