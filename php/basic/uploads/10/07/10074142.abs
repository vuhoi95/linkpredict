Title: The Cardy-Verlinde equation in a spherical symmetric gravitational  collapse
Authors: Giuseppe Maiella and Cosimo Stornaiolo
Abstract: The Cardy-Verlinde formula is analyzed in the contest of the gravitational collapse. Starting from the holographic principle, we show how the equations for a homogeneous and isotropic gravitational collapse describe the formation of the black hole entropy. Some comments on the role of the entangled entropy and the connection with the c-theorem are made.
