Title: Effective Conformal Theory and the Flat-Space Limit of AdS
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Emanuel Katz and David Poland and David Simmons-Duffin
Abstract: We develop the idea of an effective conformal theory describing the low-lying spectrum of the dilatation operator in a CFT. Such an effective theory is useful when the spectrum contains a hierarchy in the dimension of operators, and a small parameter whose role is similar to that of 1/N in a large N gauge theory. These criteria insure that there is a regime where the dilatation operator is modified perturbatively. Global AdS is the natural framework for perturbations of the dilatation operator respecting conformal invariance, much as Minkowski space naturally describes Lorentz invariant perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Assuming that the lowest-dimension single-trace operator is a scalar, O, we consider the anomalous dimensions, gamma(n,l), of the double-trace operators of the form O (del^2)^n (del)^l O. Purely from the CFT we find that perturbative unitarity places a bound on these dimensions of |gamma(n,l)|<4. Non-renormalizable AdS interactions lead to violations of the bound at large values of n. We also consider the case that these interactions are generated by integrating out a heavy scalar field in AdS. We show that the presence of the heavy field "unitarizes" the growth in the anomalous dimensions, and leads to a resonance-like behavior in gamma(n,l) when n is close to the dimension of the CFT operator dual to the heavy field. Finally, we demonstrate that bulk flat-space S-matrix elements can be extracted from the large n behavior of the anomalous dimensions. This leads to a direct connection between the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in d-dimensional CFTs and flat-space S-matrix elements in d+1 dimensions. We comment on the emergence of flat-space locality from the CFT perspective.
