Title: On the geometry underlying supersymmetric flux vacua with intermediate  SU(2) structure
Authors: Anna Fino and Luis Ugarte
Abstract: We show that supersymmetric flux vacua with intermediate SU(2) structure is closely related to some special classes of half-flat structures. More concretely, solutions of the SUSY equations IIA possess a symplectic half-flat structure, whereas solutions of the SUSY equations IIB admit a half-flat structure which is in certain sense near to the balanced condition. Using this result we show that compact simply connected manifolds do not admit type IIB solutions. New solutions of the SUSY equations IIA and IIB are constructed from hyperk\"ahler 4-manifolds, special hypo 5-manifolds and 6-dimensional solvmanifolds.
