Title: Higher Derivative Brane Couplings from T-Duality
Authors: Katrin Becker and Guangyu Guo and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: The Wess-Zumino coupling on D-branes in string theory is known to receive higher derivative corrections which couple the Ramond-Ramond potential to terms involving the square of the spacetime curvature tensor. Consistency with T-duality implies that the branes should also have four-derivative couplings that involve the NS-NS B-field. We use T-duality to predict some of these couplings. We then confirm these results with string worldsheet computations by evaluating disc amplitudes with insertions of one R-R and two NS-NS vertex operators.
