Title: E7(7) symmetry in perturbatively quantised N=8 supergravity
Authors: Guillaume Bossard and Christian Hillmann and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We study the perturbative quantisation of N=8 supergravity in a formulation where its E7(7) symmetry is realised off-shell. Relying on the cancellation of SU(8) current anomalies we show that there are no anomalies for the non-linearly realised E7(7) either; this result extends to all orders in perturbation theory. As a consequence, the e7(7) Ward identities can be consistently implemented and imposed at all orders in perturbation theory, and therefore potential divergent counterterms must in particular respect the full non-linear E7(7) symmetry.
