Title: A dynamic correspondence between Bose-Einstein condensates and  Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker and Bianchi I cosmology with a  cosmological constant
Authors: Jennie D'Ambroise and Floyd L. Williams
Abstract: In some interesting work of James Lidsey, the dynamics of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology with positive curvature and a perfect fluid matter source is shown to be modeled in terms of a time-dependent, harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In the present work, we extend this dynamic correspondence to both FLRW and Bianchi I cosmologies in arbitrary dimension, especially when a cosmological constant is present.
