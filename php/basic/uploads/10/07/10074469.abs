Title: The quantum chiral Minkowski and conformal superspaces
Authors: D. Cervantes and R. Fioresi and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: We give a quantum deformation of the chiral super Minkowski space in four dimensions as the big cell inside a quantum super Grassmannian. The quantization is performed in such way that the actions of the Poincar\'e and conformal quantum supergroups on the quantum Minkowski and quantum conformal superspaces are presented.
