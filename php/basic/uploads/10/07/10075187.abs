Title: Intercepts of the momentum correlation functions in Î¼-Bose gas model  and their asymptotics
Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and A. P. Rebesh
Abstract: The so-called \mu-deformed oscillator (or \mu-oscillator) introduced by A.Jannussis, though possesses rather exotic properties with respect to other better known deformed oscillator models, also has good potential for diverse physical applications. In this paper, the corresponding \mu-Bose gas model based on \mu-oscillators is explored. Within this model, the intercepts \lambda^(2)(K) and \lambda^(3)(K) of two- and three-particle momentum correlation functions are calculated with the goal of possible application for modeling the non-Bose type behavior of the intercepts of two- and three-pion correlations, observed in the experiments on relativistic heavy ion collisions. In derivation of intercepts, different orders of approximation in the deformation parameter \mu are considered. Our analysis also yields asymptotical behavior of the intercepts \lambda^(2)(K) and \lambda^(3)(K). The results for \lambda^(2)(K) are compared with experimental data, and with earlier known results drawn using other deformed Bose gas models.
