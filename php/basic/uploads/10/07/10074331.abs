Title: Dynamics of Gravity as Thermodynamics on the Spherical Holographic  Screen
Authors: Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu
Abstract: The dynamics of general Lovelock gravity, viewed on an arbitrary spherically symmetric surface as a holographic screen, is recast as the form of some generalized first law of thermodynamics on the screen. From this observation together with other two distinct aspects, where exactly the same temperature and entropy on the screen arise, it is argued that the thermodynamic interpretation of gravity is physically meaningful not only on the horizon, but also on a general spherically symmetric screen.
