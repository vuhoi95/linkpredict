Title: The recovery of General Relativity in massive gravity via the Vainshtein  mechanism
Authors: E. Babichev and C. Deffayet and R. Ziour
Abstract: We study in detail static spherically symmetric solutions of non linear Pauli-Fierz theory. We obtain a numerical solution with a constant density source. This solution shows a recovery of the corresponding solution of General Relativity via the Vainshtein mechanism. This result has already been presented by us in a recent letter, and we give here more detailed information on it as well as on the procedure used to obtain it. We give new analytic insights upon this problem, in particular for what concerns the question of the number of solutions at infinity. We also present a weak field limit which allows to capture all the salient features of the numerical solution, including the Vainshtein crossover and the Yukawa decay.
