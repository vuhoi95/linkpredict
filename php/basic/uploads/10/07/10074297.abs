Title: The Structure of Multiloop Amplitudes in Gauge and Gravity Theories
Authors: Z. Bern and J. J. M. Carrasco and H. Johansson
Abstract: We review the recently discovered duality between color and kinematics in gauge theories. This duality leads to a remarkably simple double-copy relation between diagrammatic numerators of gravity scattering amplitudes and gauge-theory ones. We summarize nontrivial evidence that the duality and double-copy property holds to all loop orders. We also comment on other developments, including a proof that the gauge-theory duality leads to the gravity double-copy property, and the identification of gauge-theory Lagrangians whose double copies yield gravity Lagrangians.
