Title: Critical amplitude ratios of the Baxter-Wu model
Authors: Lev N. Shchur and Wolfhard Janke
Abstract: A Monte Carlo simulation study of the critical and off-critical behavior of the Baxter-Wu model, which belongs to the universality class of the 4-state Potts model, was performed. We estimate the critical temperature window using known analytical results for the specific heat and magnetization. This helps us to extract reliable values of universal combinations of critical amplitudes with reasonable accuracy. Comparisons with approximate analytical predictions and other numerical results are discussed.
