Title: Ultracold horizons in gauged N=1 d=4 supergravity
Authors: P. Meessen and T. Ortin
Abstract: We show that the near-horizon limit of ultracold magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom-De Sitter black holes, whose geometry is the direct product of 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and a 2-sphere, preserves half of the supersymmetries of minimal R-gauged N=1 d=4 supergravity.
