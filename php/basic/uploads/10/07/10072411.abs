Title: Highlights and Conclusions of the Chalonge Meudon Workshop Dark Matter  in the Universe
Authors: H. J. de Vega and N. G. Sanchez
Abstract: The CIAS Chalonge Workshop `Dark Matter in the Universe and Universal Properties of Galaxies: Theory and Observations', was held at the Meudon Ch^ateau of Observatoire de Paris on 8-11 June 2010. The Workshop approached DM in a fourfold way: astronomical observations of DM structures (galaxy properties, halos, rotation curves and density profiles), DM numerical simulations (with and without baryons), theoretical astrophysics and cosmology (kinetic theory, Boltzmann-Vlasov evolution), astroparticle physics. Peter Biermann, Alfonso Cavaliere, Hector J. de Vega, Gianfranco Gentile, Chandra Jog, Andrea Lapi, Paolo Salucci, Norma G. Sanchez, Pasquale Serpico, Rainer Stiele, Janine van Eymeren and Markus Weber present here their highlights of the Workshop. The summary and conclusions by H. J. de Vega and N. G. Sanchez stress among other points the growing evidence that DM particles have a mass in the keV scale and that those keV scale particles naturally produce the small scale structures observed in galaxies. Wimps (DM particles heavier than 1 GeV) are strongly disfavoured combining theory with galaxy astronomical observations. Peter Biermann presents his live minutes of the Workshop and concludes that a right-handed sterile neutrino of mass of a few keV is the most interesting DM candidate. Photos of the Workshop are included.
