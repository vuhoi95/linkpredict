Title: On the noncommutative eikonal
Authors: J. M. Isidro and P. Fernandez de Cordoba and J. M. Rivera-Rebolledo and J. L. G. Santander
Abstract: We study the eikonal approximation to quantum mechanics on the Moyal plane. Instead of using a star product, the analysis is carried out in terms of operator-valued wavefunctions depending on noncommuting, operator-valued coordinates.
