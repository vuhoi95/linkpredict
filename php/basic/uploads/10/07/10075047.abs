Title: Quantum Corrections to Heterotic Moduli Potentials
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Callum Quigley
Abstract: In a recent paper, we derived the leading alpha' corrections to the Kahler potentials for moduli in (0,2) heterotic compactifications. In the same spirit as the LARGE volume stabilization scenario for type IIB orientifolds, we examine whether these quantum corrections, together with a combination of tree-level and non-perturbative superpotentials, are sufficient to stabilize the overall volume modulus at large values. This is not a priori obvious, since the corrections we found are of a lower order than those used in the type IIB setting. Nevertheless, we find that stabilizing the volume at (exponentially) large values may be possible (under certain conditions) in these heterotic backgrounds.
