Title: The Six-Point NMHV amplitude in Maximally Supersymmetric Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: D. A. Kosower and R. Roiban and C. Vergu
Abstract: We present an integral representation for the parity-even part of the two-loop six-point planar NMHV amplitude in terms of Feynman integrals which have simple transformation properties under the dual conformal symmetry. We probe the dual conformal properties of the amplitude numerically, subtracting the known infrared divergences. We find that the subtracted amplitude is invariant under dual conformal transformations, confirming existing conjectures through two-loop order. We also discuss the all-loop structure of the six-point NMHV amplitude and give a parametrization whose dual conformal invariant building blocks have a simple physical interpretation.
