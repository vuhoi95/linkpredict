Title: Time-Dependent Attractor for the Oscillon Equation
Authors: Francesco Di Plinio and Gregory S. Duane and Roger Temam
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the nonautonomous evolution problem generated by the Klein-Gordon equation in an expanding background, in one space dimension with periodic boundary conditions, with a nonlinear potential of arbitrary polynomial growth. After constructing a suitable dynamical framework to deal with the explicit time dependence of the energy of the solution, we establish the existence of a regular, time-dependent global attractor. The sections of the attractor at given times have finite fractal dimension.
