Title: Extreme Technicolor & The Walking Critical Temperature
Authors: Matti Jarvinen and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We map the phase diagram of gauge theories of fundamental interactions in the flavor-temperature plane using chiral perturbation theory to estimate the relation between the pion decaying constant and the critical temperature above which chiral symmetry is restored. We then investigate the impact of our results on models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and therefore on the electroweak early universe phase transition.
