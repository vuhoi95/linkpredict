Title: A numerical algorithm for the explicit calculation of SU(N) and SL(N,C)  Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
Authors: Arne Alex and Matthias Kalus and Alan Huckleberry and Jan von Delft
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the explicit numerical calculation of SU(N) and SL(N,C) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, based on the Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern calculus. Our algorithm is well-suited for numerical implementation; we include a computer code in an appendix. Our exposition presumes only familiarity with the representation theory of SU(2).
