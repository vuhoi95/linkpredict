Title: Charge conjugation from space-time inversion in QED: discrete and  continuous groups
Authors: B. Carballo PÃ©rez and M. Socolovsky
Abstract: We show that the CPT groups of QED emerge naturally from the PT and P (or T) subgroups of the Lorentz group. We also find relationships between these discrete groups and continuous groups, like the connected Lorentz and Poincar\'e groups and their universal coverings.
