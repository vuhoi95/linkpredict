Title: Zero Sound in Effective Holographic Theories
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Da-Wei Pang and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We investigate zero sound in $D$-dimensional effective holographic theories, whose action is given by Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton terms. The bulk spacetimes include both zero temperature backgrounds with anisotropic scaling symmetry and their near-extremal counterparts obtained in 1006.2124 [hep-th], while the massless charge carriers are described by probe D-branes. We discuss thermodynamics of the probe D-branes analytically. In particular, we clarify the conditions under which the specific heat is linear in the temperature, which is a characteristic feature of Fermi liquids. We also compute the retarded Green's functions in the limit of low frequency and low momentum and find quasi-particle excitations in certain regime of the parameters. The retarded Green's functions are plotted at specific values of parameters in $D=4$, where the specific heat is linear in the temperature and the quasi-particle excitation exists. We also calculate the AC conductivity in $D$-dimensions as a by-product.
