Title: Chiral fermions in noncommutative electrodynamics: renormalizability and  dispersion
Authors: M. Buric and D. Latas and V. Radovanovic and J. Trampetic
Abstract: We analyze quantization of noncommutative chiral electrodynamics in the enveloping algebra formalism in linear order in noncommutativity parameter $\theta$. Calculations show that divergences exist and cannot be removed by ordinary renormalization, however they can be removed by the Seiberg-Witten redefinition of fields. Performing the redefinitions explicitly, we obtain renormalizable lagrangian and discuss the influence of noncommutativity on field propagation. Noncommutativity affects the propagation of chiral fermions only: half of the fermionic modes become massive and birefringent.
