Title: One Monopole with k Singularities
Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis and Chris D. A. Blair
Abstract: We present all charge one monopole solutions of the Bogomolny equation with k prescribed Dirac singularities for the gauge groups U(2), SO(3), or SU(2). We analyze these solutions comparing them to the previously known expressions for the cases of one or two singularities.
