Title: Surplus Angle and Sign-flipped Coulomb Force in Projectable  Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Hang Bae Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We obtain the static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory, imposing the detailed balance condition only in the UV limit. We find the solutions in two different coordinate systems, the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates and the Poincare coordinates, to examine the consequences of imposing the projectability condition. The solutions in two coordinate systems are distinct due to the non-relativistic nature of the HL gravity. In the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates complying with the projectability condition, the solution involves an additional integration constant which yields surplus angle and implies attractive Coulomb force between same charges.
