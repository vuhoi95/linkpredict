Abstract: We show that the soft breaking of the BRST symmetry arising in the Gribov-Zwanziger theory can be converted into a linear breaking upon introduction of a set of BRST quartets of auxiliary fields. Due to its compatibility with the Quantum Action Principle, the linearly broken BRST symmetry can be directly converted into a suitable set of useful Slavnov-Taylor identities. As a consequence, it turns out that the renormalization aspects of the Gribov-Zwanziger theory can be addressed by means of the cohomology of a nilpotent local operator
