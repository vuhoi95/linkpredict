Abstract: The Chalonge 14th Paris Cosmology Colloquium was held on 22-24 July 2010 in Paris Observatory on the Standard Model of the Universe: News from WMAP7, BICEP, QUAD, SPT, AMI, ACT, Planck, QUIJOTE and Herschel; dark matter (DM) searches and galactic observations; related theory and simulations. %aiming synthesis, progress and clarification. P Biermann, D Boyanovsky, A Cooray, C Destri, H de Vega, G Gilmore, S Gottlober, E Komatsu, S McGaugh, A Lasenby, R Rebolo, P Salucci, N Sanchez and A Tikhonov present here their highlights of the Colloquium. Inflection points emerged: LambdaWDM (Warm DM) emerges impressively over LambdaCDM whose galactic scale problems are ever-increasing. Summary and conclusions by H. J. de Vega, M. C. Falvella and N. G. Sanchez stress among other points: (i) Primordial CMB gaussianity is confirmed. Inflation effective theory predicts a tensor to scalar ratio 0.05-0.04 at reach/border line of next CMB observations, early fast-roll inflation provides lowest multipoles depression. SZ amplitudes are smaller than expected: CMB and X-ray data agree but intracluster models need revision and relaxed/non-relaxed clusters distinction. (ii) cosmic ray positron excess is explained naturally by astrophysical processes, annihilating/decaying dark matter needs growing tailoring. (iii) Cored (non cusped) DM halos and warm (keV scale mass) DM are increasingly favored from theory and observations, naturally producing observed small scale structures, wimps turn strongly disfavoured. LambdaWDM 1 keV simulations well reproduce observations. Evidence that LambdaCDM does not work at small scales is staggering. P Biermann presents his live minutes of the Colloquium and concludes that a keV sterile neutrino is the most interesting DM candidate. Photos of the Colloquium are included.
