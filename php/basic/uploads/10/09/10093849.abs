Title: The gravity of light
Authors: G. Sparano and G. Vilasi and S. Vilasi
Abstract: A solution of the old problem raised by Tolman, Ehrenfest, Podolsky and Wheeler, concerning the lack of attraction of two light pencils "moving parallel", is proposed, considering that the light can be source of nonlinear gravitational waves corresponding (in the would be quantum theory of gravity) to spin-1 massless particles.
