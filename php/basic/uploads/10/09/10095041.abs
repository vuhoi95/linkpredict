Title: Mixing-induced Spontaneous Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Antonio Capolupo and Marco Di Mauro and Alfredo Iorio
Abstract: It is conjectured that flavor mixing furnishes a universal mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. The conjecture is proved explicitly for the mixing of two Wess--Zumino $\mathcal{N}=1$ supermultiplets and arguments for its general validity are given. The mechanism relies on the fact that, despite mixing treats fermions and bosons symmetrically, both the fermionic and the bosonic zero point energies are shifted by a positive amount and this kind of shift does not respect supersymmetry.
