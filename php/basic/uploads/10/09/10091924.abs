Abstract: Using the PNJL model, we investigate C and P violations when theta =pi and Theta =mu/(iT)=\pi/3, where T, theta and mu are the temperature, the parameter of theta-vacuum and the quark number chemical potential, respectively. It is shown that the C violation and the P restoration happen almost simultaneously at theta=pi and Theta =pi/3, if the deconfinement and the chiral symmetry restoration happen almost simultaneously at theta =Theta =0.
