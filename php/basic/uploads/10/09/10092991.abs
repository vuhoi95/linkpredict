Title: Holographic fractional topological insulators in 2+1 and 1+1 dimensions
Authors: Andreas Karch and Joseph Maciejko and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We give field theory descriptions of the time-reversal invariant quantum spin Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the particle-hole symmetric insulator in 1+1 dimensions in terms of massive Dirac fermions. Integrating out the massive fermions we obtain a low-energy description in terms of a topological field theory, which is entirely determined by anomaly considerations. This description allows us to easily construct low-energy effective actions for the corresponding `fractional' topological insulators, potentially corresponding to new states of matter. We give a holographic realization of these fractional states in terms of a probe brane system, verifying that the expected topologically protected transport properties are robust even at strong coupling.
