Title: The holographic screen at low temperatures
Authors: V. V. Kiselev and S. A. Timofeev
Abstract: A permissible spectrum of transverse vibrations for the holographic screen modifies both a distribution of thermal energy over bits at low temperatures and the law of gravitation at small accelerations of free fall in agreement with observations of flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies. This modification relates holographic screen parameters in de Sitter space-time with the Milgrom acceleration in MOND.
