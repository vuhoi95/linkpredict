Title: f(T) modified teleparallel gravity models as an alternative for  holographic and new agegraphic dark energy models
Authors: K. Karami and A. Abdolmaleki
Abstract: In the present work, we reconstruct different f(T)-gravity models corresponding to the original and entropy-corrected version of the holographic and new agegraphic dark energy models. We also obtain the equation of state parameters of the corresponding f(T)-gravity models. We conclude that the holographic and new agegraphic f(T)-gravity models behave like phantom or quintessence model. Whereas in the entropy-corrected models, the equation of state parameter can justify the transition from the quintessence state to the phantom regime as indicated by the recent observations.
