Title: Improved AdS/QCD Model with Matter
Authors: Alexander Stoffers and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We study an improved AdS/QCD model at finite temperature and chemical potential. An Ansatz for the beta-function for the boundary theory allows for the derivation of a charged dilatonic black hole in bulk. The solution is asymptotically RN-AdS in the UV and AdS2 * R3 in the IR. We discuss the thermodynamical aspects of the solution. The fermionic susceptibilities are shown to deviate from the free fermionic limits at asymptotic temperatures despite the asymptotically free nature of the gauge coupling at the boundary. The Polyakov line, the temporal and spatial string tensions dependence on both temperature and chemical potential are also discussed.
