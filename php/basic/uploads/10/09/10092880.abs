Abstract: We discuss modifications of the thermal Dark Matter (DM) relic abundances in stringy cosmologies with D-particle space-time foamy backgrounds. As a result of back-reaction of massive DM on the background space-time, owing to its interaction with D-particle defects in the foam, quantum fluctuations are induced in the space-time metric. We demonstrate that these lead to the presence of extra source terms in the Boltzmann equation used to determine the thermal dark matter relic abundances. The source terms are determined by the specific form of the induced metric deformations; the latter depend on the momentum transfer of the DM particle during its interactions with the D-particle defects and so are akin to Finsler metrics. In the case of low string scales arising from large extra dimensions our results may have phenomenological implications for the search of viable supersymmetric models.
