Title: A pedagogical introduction to the Slavnov formulation of quantum  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Hossein Ghorbani and Giampiero Esposito
Abstract: Over the last few years, Slavnov has proposed a formulation of quantum Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb gauge which preserves simultaneously manifest Lorentz invariance and gauge invariance of the ghost field Lagrangian. This paper presents in detail some of the necessary calculations, i.e. those dealing with the functional integral for the S-matrix and its invariance under shifted gauge transformations. The extension of this formalism to quantum gravity in the Prentki gauge deserves consideration.
