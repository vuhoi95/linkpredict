Title: No-Ghost Theorem for Neveu-Schwarz String in 0-Picture
Authors: Maiko Kohriki and Hiroshi Kunitomo and Masaki Murata
Abstract: The no-ghost theorem for Neveu-Schwarz string is directly proved in 0-picture. The one-to-one correspondence between physical states in 0-picture and those in the conventional (-1)-picture are confirmed. It is shown that a non-trivial metric consistent with the BRST cohomology is needed to define a positive semi-definite norm in the physical Hilbert space. As a by-product, we find a new inverse picture changing operator, which is non-covariant but has non-singular operator product with itself. A possibility to construct a new gauge invariant superstring field theory is discussed.
