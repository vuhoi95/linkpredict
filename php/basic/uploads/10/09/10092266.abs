Title: On the fine structure constant in the Machian universe
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Igor Kanatchikov
Abstract: Within the Machian model of the universe the dark energy is identified with the Machian energy of collective gravitational interactions of all particles inside the horizon. It is shown that the fine structure constant can be expressed in terms of the observed radiative, baryon and dark energy densities of the universe and the densities of various matter components are interrelated via it.
