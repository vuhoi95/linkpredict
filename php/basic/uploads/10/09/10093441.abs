Title: The Weak Field Limit of Fourth Order Gravity
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Arturo Stabile
Abstract: We discuss Newtonian and the post-Newtonian limits of Fourth Order Gravity Theories pointing out, in details, their resemblances and differences with respect to General Relativity. Particular emphasis is placed on the exact solutions and methods used to obtain them.
