Abstract: We study the Laplacian on Stenzel spaces (generalized deformed conifolds), which are tangent bundles of spheres endowed with Ricci flat metrics. The (2d-2)-dimensional Stenzel space has SO(d) symmetry and can be embedded in C^d through the equation \sum_{i = 1}^d {z_i^2} = \epsilon^2. We discuss the Green's function with a source at a point on the S^{d-1} zero section of TS^{d-1}. Its calculation is complicated by mixing between different harmonics with the same SO(d) quantum numbers due to the explicit breaking by the \epsilon-deformation of the U(1) symmetry that rotates z_i by a phase. A similar mixing affects the spectrum of normal modes of warped deformed conifolds that appear in gauge/gravity duality. We solve the mixing problem numerically to determine certain bound state spectra in various representations of SO(d) for the d=4 and d=5 examples.
