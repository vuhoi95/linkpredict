Title: On the Tensionless Limit of String theory, Off - Shell Higher Spin  Interaction Vertices and BCFW Recursion Relations
Authors: A. Fotopoulos and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: We construct an off-shell extension of cubic interaction vertices between massless bosonic Higher Spin fields on a flat background which can be obtained from perturbative bosonic string theory. We demonstrate how to construct higher quartic interaction vertices using a simple particular example. We examine whether BCFW recursion relations for interacting Higher Spin theories are applicable. We argue that for several interesting examples such relations should exist, but consistency of the theories might require that we supplement Higher Spin field theories with extended and possibly non-local objects.
