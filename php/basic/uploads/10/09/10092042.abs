Title: Monopole-vortex complex in a theta vacuum
Authors: Kenichi Konishi and Alberto Michelini and Keisuke Ohashi
Abstract: We discuss aspects of the monopole-vortex complex soliton arising in a hierarchically broken gauge system, G to H to 1, in a theta vacuum of the underlying G theory. Here we focus our attention mainly on the simplest such system with G=SU(2) and H=U(1). A consistent picture of the effect of the theta parameter is found both in a macroscopic, dual picture and in a microscopic description of the monopole-vortex complex soliton.
