Abstract: We study a limit of the nearly-Peccei-Quinn-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model possessing novel Higgs and dark matter (DM) properties. In this scenario, there naturally co-exist three light singlet-like particles: a scalar, a pseudoscalar, and a singlino-like DM candidate, all with masses of order 0.1-10 GeV. The decay of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson to pairs of the light scalars or pseudoscalars is generically suppressed, avoiding constraints from collider searches for these channels. For a certain parameter window annihilation into the light pseudoscalar and exchange of the light scalar with nucleons allow the singlino to achieve the correct relic density and a large direct detection cross section consistent with the CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA preferred region simultaneously. This parameter space is consistent with experimental constraints from LEP, the Tevatron, and Upsilon- and flavor physics.
