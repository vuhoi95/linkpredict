Abstract: Because of its versatility, the 2-form field has been employed to describe a multitude of scenarios that range from high energy to condensed matter physics. Pushing forward in this endeavor we study the interaction energy, intermediated by this kind of field, between branes in a variety of configurations. Also, the so-called Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond model, which consists of the electromagnetic field coupled to the Kalb-Ramond gauge potential, is considered. It turns out that these models exhibit a much richer class of sources than usually thought, able to intermediate novel forms of interactions in different scenarios.
