Title: On primordial trispectrum from exchanging scalar modes in general  multiple field inflationary models
Authors: Xian Gao and Chunshan Lin
Abstract: We make an complementary investigation of the primordial trispectrum from exchanging intermediate scalar modes in multi-field inflation models with generalized kinetic terms. Together with the calculation of irreducible contributions to the primordial trispectrum in Ref.[103], we give the full leading-order primordial trispectrum in generalized multi-field models.
