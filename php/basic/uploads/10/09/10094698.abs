Title: Eternal inflation predicts that time will end
Authors: Raphael Bousso and Ben Freivogel and Stefan Leichenauer and Vladimir Rosenhaus
Abstract: Present treatments of eternal inflation regulate infinities by imposing a geometric cutoff. We point out that some matter systems reach the cutoff in finite time. This implies a nonzero probability for a novel type of catastrophe. According to the most successful measure proposals, our galaxy is likely to encounter the cutoff within the next 5 billion years.
