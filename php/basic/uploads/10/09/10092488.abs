Title: More on the duality correlators/amplitudes
Authors: Burkhard Eden and Gregory P. Korchemsky and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We continue the study of n-point correlation functions of half-BPS protected operators in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, in the limit where the positions of the adjacent operators become light-like separated. We compute the l-loop corrections by making l Lagrangian insertions. We argue that there exists a simple relation between the (n+l)-point tree-level correlator with l Lagrangian insertions and the integrand of the n-particle l-loop MHV scattering amplitude, as obtained by the recent momentum twistor construction of Arkani-Hamed et al. We present several examples of this new duality, at one and two loops.
