Title: Central Charge Bounds in 4D Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Riccardo Rattazzi and Slava Rychkov and Alessandro Vichi
Abstract: We derive model-independent lower bounds on the stress tensor central charge C_T in terms of the operator content of a 4-dimensional Conformal Field Theory. More precisely, C_T is bounded from below by a universal function of the dimensions of the lowest and second-lowest scalars present in the CFT. The method uses the crossing symmetry constraint of the 4-point function, analyzed by means of the conformal block decomposition.
