Title: Mass and Angular momentum of Black Holes in New Massive Gravity
Authors: Soonkeon Nam and Jong-Dae Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We obtain mass and angular momentum of black holes as conserved charges in three dimensional new massive gravity, after presenting the explicit expression for the potential of the conserved charges. This confirms the expression of those charges obtained in several ways, in particular through AdS/CFT correspondence, and shows us that the first law of black hole thermodynamics is valid in these black holes. We also comment about conserved charges in new type black holes with the emphasis on the AdS/CFT correspondence as guiding principle.
