Title: Separation of variables for symplectic characters
Authors: Jan de Gier and Anita Ponsaing
Abstract: We perform separation of variables for the symplectic Weyl character using Sklyanin's scheme. Viewing the characters as eigenfunctions of a quantum integrable system, we explicitly construct the separating operator using the Q-operator method. We also construct the inverse of the separating operator, as well as the factorised Hamiltonian.
