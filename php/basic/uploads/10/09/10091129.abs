Title: On Generalized Monopole Spherical Harmonics and the Wave Equation of a  Charged Massive Kerr Black Hole
Authors: Shabnam Beheshti and Floyd L. Williams
Abstract: We find linearly independent solutions of the Goncharov-Firsova equation in the case of a massive complex scalar field on a Kerr black hole. The solutions generalize, in some sense, the classical monopole spherical harmonic solutions previously studied in the massless cases.
