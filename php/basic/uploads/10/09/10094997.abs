Title: Asymptotically Schroedinger Space-Times: TsT Transformations and  Thermodynamics
Authors: Jelle Hartong and Blaise Rollier
Abstract: We study the complete class of 5-dimensional asymptotically Schroedinger space-times that can be obtained as the TsT transform of a 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS space-time. Based on this we identify a conformal class of Schroedinger boundaries. We use a Fefferman-Graham type expansion to study the on-shell action for this class of asymptotically Schroedinger space-times and we show that its value is TsT invariant. In the second part we focus on black hole space-times and prove that black hole thermodynamics is also TsT invariant. We use this knowledge to argue that thermal global Schroedinger space-time at finite chemical potential undergoes a Hawking-Page type phase transition.
