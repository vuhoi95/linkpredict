Title: Gravitational string-membrane hedgehog and internal structure of black  holes
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Toshihiro Matsuo
Abstract: We investigate charged Nambu-Goto strings/membrane systems in the Einstein-Maxwell theory in 3+1 dimensions. We first construct a charged string hedgehog solution that has a single horizon and conical singularity. Then we examine a charged membrane system, and give a simple derivation of its self energy. We find that the membrane may form an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, but its interior is a flat spacetime. Finally by combining the charged strings and the membrane we construct black hole solutions that have no singularities inside the horizons. We study them in detail by varying the magnitude of the two parameters, namely, the charge times the membrane tension and the string tension. We also argue that the strings have, due to the large redshift inside the system, a fair amount of degrees of freedom that may explain the entropy of the corresponding black holes.
