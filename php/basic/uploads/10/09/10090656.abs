Title: Yang-Baxter operators from algebra structures and Lie superalgebras
Authors: Florin F. Nichita and Bogdan P. Popovici
Abstract: We present solutions for the (constant and spectral-parameter) Yang-Baxter equations and Yang-Baxter systems arising from algebra structures and discuss about their symmetries. In the last section, we present some applications.
