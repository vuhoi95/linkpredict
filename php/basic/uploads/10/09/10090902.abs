Abstract: In the context of the so-called Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the gravitational action includes function of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, we study cosmological solutions, especially the well-known $\Lambda$CDM model. It is shown that the dark energy contribution and even the inflationary epoch can be explained in the frame of this kind of theories with no need of any other kind of component. Other cosmological solutions are constructed and the rich properties that this kind of theories provide are explored.
