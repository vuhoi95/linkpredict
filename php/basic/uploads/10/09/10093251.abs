Title: Matrix Norms, BPS Bounds and Marginal Stability in N=8 Supergravity
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani
Abstract: We study the conditions of marginal stability for two-center extremal black holes in N-extended supergravity in four dimensions, with particular emphasis on the N=8 case. This is achieved by exploiting triangle inequalities satisfied by matrix norms. Using different norms and relative bounds among them, we establish the existence of marginal stability and split attractor flows both for BPS and some non-BPS solutions. Our results are in agreement with previous analysis based on explicit construction of multi-center solutions.
