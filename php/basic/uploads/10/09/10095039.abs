Title: Microscopic Realization of the Kerr/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Monica Guica and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Supersymmetric M/string compactifications to five dimensions contain BPS black string solutions with magnetic graviphoton charge P and near-horizon geometries which are quotients of AdS_3 x S^2. The holographic duals are typically known 2D CFTs with central charges c_L=c_R=6P^3 for large P. These same 5D compactifications also contain non-BPS but extreme Kerr-Newman black hole solutions with SU(2)_L spin J_L and electric graviphoton charge Q obeying Q^3 \leq J_L^2. It is shown that in the maximally charged limit Q^3 -> J_L^2, the near-horizon geometry coincides precisely with the right-moving temperature T_R=0 limit of the black string with magnetic charge P=J_L^{1/3}. The known dual of the latter is identified as the c_L=c_R=6J_L CFT predicted by the Kerr/CFT correspondence. Moreover, at linear order away from maximality, one finds a T_R \neq 0 quotient of the AdS_3 factor of the black string solution and the associated thermal CFT entropy reproduces the linearly sub-maximal Kerr-Newman entropy. Beyond linear order, for general Q^3<J_L^2, one has a finite-temperature quotient of a warped deformation of the magnetic string geometry. The corresponding dual deformation of the magnetic string CFT potentially supplies, for the general case, the c_L=c_R=6J_L CFT predicted by Kerr/CFT.
