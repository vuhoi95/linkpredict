Title: Multipole moments for black objects in five dimensions
Authors: Kentaro Tanabe and Seiju Ohashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: In higher dimensions than four, conventional uniqueness theorem in asymptotically flat space-times does not hold, i.e., black objects can not be classified only by the mass, angular momentum and charge. In this paper, we define multipole moments for black objects and show that Myers-Perry black hole and black ring can be distinguished by quadrupole moments. This consideration gives us a new insight for the uniqueness theorem for black objects in higher dimensions.
