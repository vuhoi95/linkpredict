Title: Remarks on the Myers-Perry and Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Rotating Solutions
Authors: A. Anabalon and N. Deruelle and D. Tempo and R. Troncoso
Abstract: The Kerr-type solutions of the five-dimensional Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet equations look pretty similar when written in Kerr-Schild form. However the Myers-Perry spacetime is circular whereas the rotating solution of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory is not. We explore some consequences of this difference in particular regarding the (non) existence of Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates and the extension of the manifold.
