Title: Quantum Isometries of the finite noncommutative geometry of the Standard  Model
Authors: Jyotishman Bhowmick and Francesco D'Andrea and Ludwik Dabrowski
Abstract: We compute the quantum isometry group of the finite noncommutative geometry F describing the internal degrees of freedom in the Standard Model of particle physics. We show that this provides genuine quantum symmetries of the spectral triple corresponding to M x F where M is a compact spin manifold. We also prove that the bosonic and fermionic part of the spectral action are preserved by these symmetries.
