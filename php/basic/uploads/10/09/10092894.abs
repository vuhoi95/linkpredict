Title: Scaling relations for the entire spectrum in mass-deformed conformal  gauge theories
Authors: Luigi Del Debbio and Roman Zwicky
Abstract: We consider mass-deformed conformal gauge theories (mCGT) and investigate the scaling behaviour of hadronic observables as a function of the fermion mass. Applying renormalization group arguments directly to matrix elements, we find m_H ~ m^{1/(1+gamma*)} and F ~ m^{\eta_F(gamma*)} for the decay constants, thereby generalizing our results from a previous paper to the entire spectrum. We derive the scaling law m_H \~m^{1/(1+gamma*)} using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, and thus provide a derivation which does not rely on renormalization group arguments. Using the new results we reiterate, on the phenomenologically important, S-parameter. Finally, we discuss how spectral representations can be used to relate the mass and decay constant trajectories.
