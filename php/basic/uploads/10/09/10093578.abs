Title: Canonical Analysis of Scalar Fields in Two Dimensional Curved Space
Authors: D. G. C. McKeon and Alexander Patrushev
Abstract: Scalar fields on a two dimensional curved surface are considered and the canonical structure of this theory analyzed. Both the first and second order forms of the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action for the metric are used (these being inequivalent in two dimensions). The Dirac constraint formalism is used to find the generator of the gauge transformation, using the formalisms of Henneaux, Teitelboim and Zanelli (HTZ) and of Castellani (C). The HTZ formalism is slightly modified in the case of the first order EH action to accommodate the gauge transformation of the metric; this gauge transformation is unusual as it mixes the affine connection with the scalar field.
