Abstract: The energy density and angular distribution of power radiated by a quark undergoing circular motion in strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory is computed using gauge/gravity duality. The results are qualitatively similar to that of synchrotron radiation produced by an electron in circular motion in classical electrodynamics: At large velocities the quark emits radiation in a narrow beam along its velocity vector with a characteristic opening angle $\alpha \sim 1/\gamma$ and radial thickness scaling like $\sim 1/\gamma^3$.
