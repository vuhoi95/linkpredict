Title: New invariants for entangled states
Authors: Roman V. Buniy and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: We propose new algebraic invariants that distinguish and classify entangled states. Considering qubits as well as higher spin systems, we obtained complete entanglement classifications for cases that were either unsolved or only conjectured in the literature.
