Title: Warped General Gauge Mediation
Authors: Moritz McGarrie and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We develop the formalism of "General gauge mediation" for five dimensional theories in a slice of AdS space. A set of current correlators encodes the effect of a supersymmetry breaking hidden sector localised on the IR brane. These current correlators provide a tree-level gaugino mass and loop-level sfermion masses on the UV brane. We also use this formalism to calculate the Casimir energy and masses for bulk hyperscalars. To illustrate this general construction we consider a perturbative hidden sector of generalised messengers coupled to a spurion. For models with large warping, we find that when the AdS warp factor $k$ is less than the characteristc mass scale $M$ of the hidden sector, the whole Kaluza-Klein tower of vector superfields propagate supersymmetry breaking effects to the UV brane. When $M$ is less than $k$, the zero modes dominate.
