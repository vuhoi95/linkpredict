Title: A Constraint-Based Approach to the Chiral Magnetic Effect
Authors: Lionel Brits and James Charbonneau
Abstract: We propose a way to introduce the currents responsible for the Chiral Magnetic Effect, and similar phenomena, into the AdS/CFT description. Such currents are thought to occur in heavy ion collisions due to topologically non-trivial field configurations and in dense stars due to beta decay. They may be responsible for the P and CP odd effects seen at RHIC and the anomalously large velocities observed in some pulsars. We discuss the boundary conditions that allow the phenomenon to exist in real systems and show how one would introduce similar boundary conditions into a holographic model of QCD such that the current is reproduced.
