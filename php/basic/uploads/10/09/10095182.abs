Title: Semiclassical short strings in AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini and Alin Tirziu
Abstract: We present results for the one-loop correction to the energy of a class of string solutions in AdS_5 x S^5 in the short string limit. The computation is based on the observation that, as for rigid spinning string elliptic solutions, the fluctuation operators can be put into the single-gap Lame' form. Our computation reveals a remarkable universality of the form of the energy of short semiclassical strings. This may help to understand better the structure of the strong coupling expansion of the anomalous dimensions of dual gauge theory operators.
