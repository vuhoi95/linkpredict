Title: Seiberg-Witten curve via generalized matrix model
Authors: Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: We study the generalized matrix model which corresponds to the n-point toric Virasoro conformal block. This describes four-dimensional N=2 SU(2)^n gauge theory with circular quiver diagram by the AGT relation. We first verify that it is obtained from the perturbative calculation of the Liouville correlation function. We derive the Seiberg-Witten curve for N=2 gauge theory as a spectral curve of the generalized matrix model.
