Title: Quantized Black Hole and Heun function
Authors: D. Momeni and Koblandy Yerzhanov and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: Following the simple proposal by He and Ma for quantization of a black hole(BH) by Bohr's idea about the atoms, we discussed the solvability of the wave equation for such a BH. We superficial solved the associated Schrodinger equation. The eigenfunction problem reduces to HeunB $H$ differential equation which is a natural generalization of the hypergeometric differential equation. In other words, the spectrum can be determined by solving the Heun's differential equation.
