Title: Fate of the False Vacuum Revisited
Authors: Shigeki Matsumoto and Keiko I. Nagao and Makoto Nakamura and Masato Senami
Abstract: We find the novel effect on the decay of a false vacuum in view of quantum field theory, which is induced by a field coupling to the scalar field related to a first-order phase transition. This effect of the environment can never be included in the traditional method using the effective potential, and, in fact, acts as dissipative and fluctuation effects on tunneling phenomena. We show that the decay of the false vacuum is drastically either enhanced or suppressed. It is also clarified what kind of interaction enhance or suppress the tunneling probability.
