Abstract: In this work we consider the issue of localization of antisymmetric tensor fields of arbitrary rank in a D dimensional Space-time with a codimension two. A string-like defect is used to simulate the membrane. The localization of massless and massive fields is found. The mass spectrum is infinitely degenerate for each mass level and this is solved by coupling the $q-$form to fermions.
