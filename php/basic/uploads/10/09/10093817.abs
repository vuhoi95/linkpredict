Title: Undecidability as solution to the problem of measurement: fundamental  criterion for the production of events
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Luis Pedro Garcia-Pintos and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: In recent papers we put forth a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, colloquially known as ``the Montevideo interpretation''. This interpretation is based on taking into account fundamental limits that gravity imposes on the measurement process. As a consequence one has that situations develop where a reduction process is undecidable from an evolution operator. When such a situation is achieved, an event has taken place. In this paper we sharpen the definition of when and how events occur, more precisely we give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of events. We probe the new definition in an example. In particular we show that the concept of undecidability used is not ``FAPP'' (for all practical purposes), but fundamental.
