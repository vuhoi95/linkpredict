Title: A Near Horizon CFT Dual for Kerr-Newman-$AdS$
Authors: Bradly K. Button and Leo Rodriguez and Catherine A. Whiting and Tuna Yildirim
Abstract: We show that the near horizon regime of a Kerr-Newman-$AdS$ (KN$AdS$) black hole, given by its two dimensional analogue $a la$ Robinson and Wilczek (2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 011303), is asymptotically $AdS_2$ and dual to a one dimensional quantum conformal field theory (CFT). The s-wave contribution of the resulting CFT's energy-momentum-tensor together with the asymptotic symmetries, generate a centrally extended Virasoro algebra, whose central charge reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy via Cardy's Formula. Our derived central charge also agrees with the near extremal Kerr/CFT Correspondence (2009 Phys. Rev. D 80, 124008) in the appropriate limits. We also compute the Hawking temperature of the KN$AdS$ black hole by coupling its Robinson and Wilczek two dimensional analogue (RW2DA) to conformal matter.
