Title: On Moduli Stabilisation and de Sitter Vacua in MSSM Heterotic Orbifolds
Authors: Susha L. Parameswaran and Saul Ramos-Sanchez and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: We study the problem of moduli stabilisation in explicit heterotic orbifold compactifications, whose spectra contain the MSSM plus some vector-like exotics that can be decoupled. Considering all the bulk moduli, we obtain the 4D low energy effective action for the compactification, which has contributions from various, computable, perturbative and non-perturbative effects. Hidden sector gaugino condensation and string worldsheet instantons result in a combination of racetrack, KKLT and cusp-form contributions to the superpotential, which lift all the bulk moduli directions. We point out the properties observed in our concrete models, which tend to be missed when only "generic" features of a model are assumed. We search for interesting vacua and find several de Sitter solutions, but -- so far -- they all turn out to be unstable.
