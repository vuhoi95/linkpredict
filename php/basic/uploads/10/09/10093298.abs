Title: Relating the Komargodski-Seiberg and Akulov-Volkov actions: Exact  nonlinear field redefinition
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Simon J. Tyler
Abstract: This paper constructs an exact field redefinition that maps the Akulov-Volkov action to that recently studied by Komargodski and Seiberg in arXiv:0907.2441. It is also shown that the approach advocated in arXiv:1003.4143v2 and arXiv:1009.2166 for deriving such a relationship is inconsistent.
