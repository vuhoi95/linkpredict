Abstract: Calculable single-sector models provide an elegant framework for generating the flavor textures via compositeness, breaking supersymmetry, and explaining the electroweak scale. Such models may be realized naturally in supersymmetric QCD with additional gauge singlets (SSQCD), though it remains challenging to construct models without a surfeit of light exotic states where the Standard Model index emerges naturally. We classify possible single-sector models based on Sp confining SSQCD according to their Standard Model index and number of composite messengers. This leads to simple, calculable models that spontaneously break supersymmetry, reproduce the fermion flavor hierarchy, and explain the Standard Model index dynamically with little or no additional matter. At low energies these theories realize a "more minimal" soft spectrum with direct mediation and a gravitino LSP.
