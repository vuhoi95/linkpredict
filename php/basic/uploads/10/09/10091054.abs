Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Karapet Mkrtchyan and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: We present an off-shell generating function for all cubic interactions of Higher Spin gauge fields constructed in arXiv:1003.2877. It is a generalization of the on-shell generating function proposed in arXiv:1006.5242, is written in a very compact way, and turns out to have a remarkable structure.
