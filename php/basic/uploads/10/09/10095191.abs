Title: Observation of a hadronic interference effect in annihilation processes
Authors: Eef van Beveren and George Rupp
Abstract: We present evidence for small oscillations we observe in electron-positron and proton-antiproton annihilation data, with a periodicity of 76+-2 MeV, independent of the beam energy. We discuss some possible scenarios to explain the phenomenon.
