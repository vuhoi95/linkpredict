Title: Classical theta constants vs. lattice theta series, and super string  partition functions
Authors: Francesco Dalla Piazza and Davide Girola and Sergio Luigi Cacciatori
Abstract: Recently, various possible expressions for the vacuum-to-vacuum superstring amplitudes has been proposed at genus $g=3,4,5$. To compare the different proposals, here we will present a careful analysis of the comparison between the two main technical tools adopted to realize the proposals: the classical theta constants and the lattice theta series. We compute the relevant Fourier coefficients in order to relate the two spaces. We will prove the equivalence up to genus 4. In genus five we will show that the solutions are equivalent modulo the Schottky form and coincide if we impose the vanishing of the cosmological constant.
