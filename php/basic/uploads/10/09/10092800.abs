Title: A Finite Quantum Gravity Field Theory Model
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Pablo Gonz√°lez and Ricardo Avila
Abstract: We discuss the quantization of Delta gravity, a two symmetric tensors model of gravity. This model, in Cosmology, shows accelerated expansion without a cosmological constant. We present the $\tilde{\delta}$ transformation which defines the geometry of the model. Then we show that all delta type models live at one loop only. We apply this to General Relativity and we calculate the one loop divergent part of the Effective Action showing its null contribution in vacuum, implying a finite model. Then we proceed to study the existence of ghosts in the model. Finally, we study the form of the finite quantum corrections to the classical action of the model.
