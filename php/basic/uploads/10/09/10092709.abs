Title: On a class of n-Leibniz deformations of the simple Filippov algebras
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and J. M. Izquierdo
Abstract: We study the problem of the infinitesimal deformations of all real, simple, finite-dimensional Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras, considered as a class of n-Leibniz algebras characterized by having an n-bracket skewsymmetric in its n-1 first arguments. We prove that all n>3 simple finite-dimensional Filippov algebras are rigid as n-Leibniz algebras of this class. This rigidity also holds for the Leibniz deformations of the semisimple n=2 Filippov (i.e., Lie) algebras. The n=3 simple FAs, however, admit a non-trivial one-parameter infinitesimal 3-Leibniz algebra deformation. We also show that the $n\geq 3$ simple Filippov algebras do not admit non-trivial central extensions as n-Leibniz algebras of the above class.
