Title: Automorphism Properties of Adinkras
Authors: B. L. Douglas and S. James Gates Jr. and Jingbo B. Wang
Abstract: Adinkras are a graphical tool for studying off-shell representations of supersymmetry. In this paper we efficiently classify the automorphism groups of Adinkras relative to a set of local parameters. Using this, we classify Adinkras according to their equivalence and isomorphism classes. We extend previous results dealing with characterization of Adinkra degeneracy via matrix products, and present algorithms for calculating the automorphism groups of Adinkras and partitioning Adinkras into their isomorphism classes.
