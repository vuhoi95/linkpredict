Title: Geometry of Topological Defects of Two-dimensional Sigma Models
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Kevin Setter
Abstract: A topological defect separating a pair of two-dimensional CFTs is a codimension one interface along which all components of the stress-energy tensor glue continuously. We study topological defects of the bosonic, (0,1)- and (0,2)-supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions. We find a geometric classification of such defects closely analogous to that of A-branes of symplectic manifolds, with the role of symplectic form played instead by a neutral signature metric. Alternatively, we find a compact description in terms of a generalized metric on the product of the targets. In the (0,1) case, we describe the target space geometry of a bundle in which the fermions along the defect take values. In the (0,2) case, we describe the defects as being simultaneously A-branes and B-branes.
