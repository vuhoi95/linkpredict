Title: Lifshitz solutions in supergravity and string theory
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Susha L. Parameswaran and Gianmassimo Tasinato and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: We derive Lifshitz configurations in string theory for general dynamical exponents z \geq 1. We begin by obtaining simple Li x Omega solutions to supergravities in diverse dimensions, with Omega a compact constant curvature manifold. Then we uplift the solutions to ten dimensions, providing configurations that correspond to warped compactifications in Type II string theory.
