Title: Massive Pions, Anomalies and Baryons in Holographic QCD
Authors: Oriol Dom√©nech and Giuliano Panico and Andrea Wulzer
Abstract: We consider a holographic model of QCD, obtained by a very simple modification of the original construction, which describes at the same time the pion mass, the QCD anomalies and the baryons as topological solitons. We study in detail its phenomenological implications in both the mesonic and baryonic sectors and compare with the observations.
