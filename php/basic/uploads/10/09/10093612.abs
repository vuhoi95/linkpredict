Title: Delta function singularity in the Reduction of Radial Schrodinger  Equation
Authors: A. Khelashvili and T. Nadareishvili
Abstract: We obtain the extra delta-like singularity while reduction of the Laplace operator in spherical coordinates, elimination of which restricts the radial wave functions at the origin. This restriction has the form of boundary condition for the radial wave function.
