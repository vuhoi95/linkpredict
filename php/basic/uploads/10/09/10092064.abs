Title: Fermion perturbations in string-theory black holes
Authors: Owen Pavel Fern√°ndez Piedra and Jeferson de Oliveira
Abstract: In this paper we study fermion perturbations in four dimensional black holes of string theory, obtained either from a non-extreme configuration of three intersecting five-branes with a boost along the common string or from a non-extreme intersecting system of two two-branes and two five-branes. The Dirac equation for the massless neutrino field, after conformal re-scaling of the metric, is written as a wave equation suitable to study the time evolution of the perturbation. With the aid of Prony fitting of time-domain profile we calculate the complex frequencies that dominate the quasinormal ringing stage, and also determine this quantities by the semi-analytical sixth order WKB method. We also find numerically the decay factor of fermion fields at very late times, and show that the falloff is identical to those appeared for massless fields in other four dimensional black hole spacetimes.
