Title: Galileon inflation
Authors: Clare Burrage and Claudia de Rham and David Seery and Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: Galileon inflation is a radiatively stable higher derivative model of inflation. The model is determined by a finite number of relevant operators which are protected by a covariant generalization of the Galileon shift symmetry. We show that the nongaussianity of the primordial density perturbation generated during an epoch of Galileon inflation is a particularly powerful observational probe of these models and that, when the speed of sound is small, fNL can be larger than the usual result fNL ~ 1/c_s^2.
