Title: Spectral dimension of Horava-Snyder spacetime and the $AdS_2\times S^2$  momentum space
Authors: F. A. Brito and E. Passos
Abstract: We show that the UV-regime at the Lifshitz point $z=3$ is equivalent to work with a momenta manifold whose topology is the same as that of an $AdS_2\times S^2$ space. According to Snyder's theory, curved momentum space is related to non-commutative quantized spacetime. In this sense, our analysis suggests an equivalence between Horava-Lifshitz and Snyder's theory.
