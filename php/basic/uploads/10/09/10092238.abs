Title: Feynman perturbation theory for gauge theory on transverse lattice
Authors: M. S. Karnevskiy and S. A. Paston
Abstract: Feynman perturbation theory for nonabelian gauge theory in light-like gauge is investigated. A lattice along two space-like directions is used as a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization. For preservation of the polinomiality of action we use as independent variables arbitrary (non-unitary) matrices related to the link of the lattice. The action of the theory is selected in such a way to preserve as much as possible the rotational invariance, which remains after introduction of the lattice, as well as to make superfluous degrees of freedom vanish in the limit of removing the regularization. Feynman perturbation theory is constructed and diagrams which does not contain ultraviolet divergences are analyzed. The scheme of renormalization of this theory is discussed.
