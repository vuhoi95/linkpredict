Title: The Einstein-Maxwell-Particle System in the York Canonical Basis of ADM  Tetrad Gravity: III) The Post-Minkowskian N-Body Problem, its Post-Newtonian  Limit in Non-Harmonic 3-Orthogonal Gauges and Dark Matter as an Inertial  Effect
Authors: David Alba and Luca Lusanna
Abstract: We conclude the study of the Post-Minkowskian linearization of ADM tetrad gravity in the York canonical basis for asymptotically Minkowskian space-times in the family of non-harmonic 3-orthogonal gauges parametrized by the York time ${}^3K(\tau, \vec \sigma)$ (the inertial gauge variable, not existing in Newton gravity, describing the general relativistic remnant of the freedom in clock synchronization in the definition of the instantaneous 3-spaces). As matter we consider only N scalar point particles with a Grassmann regularization of the self-energies and with a ultraviolet cutoff making possible the PM linearization and the evaluation of the PM solution for the gravitational field. We study in detail all the properties of these PM space-times emphasizing their dependence on the gauge variable ${}^3{\cal K}_{(1)} = {1\over {\triangle}}\, {}^3K_{(1)}$ (the non-local York time): Riemann and Weyl tensors, 3-spaces, time-like and null geodesics, red-shift and luminosity distance. Then we study the Post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the PM equations of motion of the particles. We find that in the two-body case at the 0.5PN order there is a damping (or anti-damping) term depending only on ${}^3{\cal K}_{(1)}$. This open the possibility to explain dark matter in Einstein theory as a relativistic inertial effect: the determination of ${}^3{\cal K}_{(1)}$ from the masses and rotation curves of galaxies would give information on how to find a PM extension of the existing PN Celestial frame (ICRS) used as observational convention in the 4-dimensional description of stars and galaxies. Dark matter would describe the difference between the inertial and gravitational masses seen in the non-Euclidean 3-spaces, without a violation of their equality in the 4-dimensional space-time as required by the equivalence principle.
