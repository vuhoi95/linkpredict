Title: Hourava-Lifshitz Gravity on Primordial Black Holes
Authors: Hikoya Kasari and Takehiko T. Fujishiro
Abstract: We tested the Ho\u{r}ava Lifshitz (HL) quantum gravity model by using the L{\" u}, Mei and Pope solutions for primordial black holes (PBHs) and the observational upper bounds of the PBH density parameters. We found that, although the HL model is severely constrained, it is not ruled out. When our analysis is combined with that of Dutta and Saridakis the observed value of the density parameter $\Omega_{PBH}$ might rise by several percent as the running energy parameter $\lambda$ increases.
