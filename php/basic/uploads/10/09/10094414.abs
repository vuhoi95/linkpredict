Title: Lattice String Field Theory
Authors: Francis Bursa and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: String field theory is a candidate for a full non-perturbative definition of string theory. We aim to define string field theory on a space-time lattice to investigate its behaviour at the quantum level. Specifically, we look at string field theory in a one dimensional linear dilaton background. We report the first results of our simulations.
