Title: Symmetries of Abelian Orbifolds
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Rak-Kyeong Seong
Abstract: Using the Polya Enumeration Theorem, we count with particular attention to C^3/Gamma up to C^6/Gamma, abelian orbifolds in various dimensions which are invariant under cycles of the permutation group S_D. This produces a collection of multiplicative sequences, one for each cycle in the Cycle Index of the permutation group. A multiplicative sequence is controlled by its values on prime numbers and their pure powers. Therefore, we pay particular attention to orbifolds of the form C^D/Gamma where the order of Gamma is p^alpha. We propose a generalization of these sequences for any D and any p.
