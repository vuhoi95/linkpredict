Title: Gauss-Bonnet Holographic Superconductors
Authors: Luke Barclay and Ruth Gregory and Sugumi Kanno and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: We study holographic superconductors in five dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity both numerically and analytically. We find the critical temperature of the superconductor decreases as backreaction is increased, although the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling is more subtle: the critical temperature first decreases then increases as the coupling tends towards the Chern-Simons value in a backreaction dependent fashion. We compute the conductivity of the system, finding the energy gap, and show that the effect of both backreaction and higher curvature is to increase the gap ratio $\omega_g/T_c$, thus there is no universal relation for these superconductors.
