Title: Quantum Gravity Effects in the Kerr Spacetime
Authors: M. Reuter and E. Tuiran
Abstract: We analyze the impact of the leading quantum gravity effects on the properties of black holes with nonzero angular momentum by performing a suitable renormalization group improvement of the classical Kerr metric within Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG). In particular we explore the structure of the horizons, the ergosphere, and the static limit surfaces as well as the phase space avilable for the Penrose process. The positivity properties of the effective vacuum energy momentum tensor are also discussed and the "dressing" of the black hole's mass and angular momentum are investigated by computing the corresponding Komar integrals. The pertinent Smarr formula turns out to retain its classical form. As for their thermodynamical properties, a modified first law of black hole thermodynamics is found to be satisfied by the improved black holes (to second order in the angular momentum); the corresponding Bekenstein-Hawking temperature is not proportional to the surface gravity.
