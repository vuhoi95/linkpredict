Title: Band-aid for information loss from black holes
Authors: Werner Israel and Zinkoo Yun
Abstract: We summarize, simplify and extend recent work showing that small deviations from exact thermality in Hawking radiation, first uncovered by Kraus and Wilczek, have the capacity to carry off the maximum information content of a black hole. This goes a considerable way toward resolving a long-standing "information-loss paradox".
