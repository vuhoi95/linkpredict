Title: Quantum Gravity Model in the framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry
Authors: B. S. Park and D. G. Pak
Abstract: We study the Weyl vector fields which can play an important role in quantum gravity. The metric obtains its dynamical content after dynamical symmetry breaking in the phase of the effective Einstein gravity which is induced by quantum Weyl corrections. In low energy regime with scalar field there is a relation between the Weyl vector fields and the torsion fields. If this condition is given to Weyl vector fields and torsions, then the Lagrangian becomes like Maxwell type.
