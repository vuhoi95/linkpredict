Title: Brane worlds and dark matter
Authors: Shahab Shahidi and Hamid Reza Sepangi
Abstract: Two problems related to dark matter is considered in the context of a brane world model in which the confinement of gauge fields on the brane is achieved by invoking a confining potential. First, we show that the virial mass discrepancy can be addressed if the conserved geometrical term appearing in this model is considered as an energy momentum tensor of an unknown type of matter, the so-called X-matter whose equation of state is also obtained. Second, the galaxy rotation curves are explained by assuming an anisotropic energy momentum tensor for the X-matter.
