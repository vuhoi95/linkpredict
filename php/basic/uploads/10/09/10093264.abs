Title: Conserved charges and quantum-group transformations in noncommutative  field theories
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Giulia Gubitosi and Flavio Mercati and Giacomo Rosati
Abstract: The recently-developed techniques of Noether analysis of the quantum-group spacetime symmetries of some noncommutative field theories rely on the {\it ad hoc} introduction of some peculiar auxiliary transformation parameters, which appear to have no role in the structure of the quantum group. We here show that it is possible to set up the Noether analysis directly in terms of the quantum-group symmetry transformations, and we therefore establish more robustly the attribution of the conserved charges to the symmetries of interest. We also characterize the concept of "time independence" (as needed for conserved charges) in a way that is robust enough to be applicable even to theories with space/time noncommutativity, where it might have appeared that any characterization of time independence should be vulnerable to changes of ordering convention.
