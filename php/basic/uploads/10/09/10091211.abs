Title: Constraints on Flows in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity by Classical Solutions
Authors: Taekyung Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We find exact static stringy solutions of Horava-Lifshitz gravity with the projectability condition but imposing the detailed balance condition near the UV fixed point, and propose a method on constraining the possible pattern of flows in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by using the obtained classical solutions. In the obtained vacuum solutions, the parameters related to the speed of the graviton and the coefficients of quartic spatial derivative terms lead to intriguing effects: the change of graviton speed yields a surplus angle and the quartic derivatives make the square of effective electric charge negative. The result of a few tests based on the geometries of a cone, an excess cone, a black string, and a charged (black) string seems suggestive. For example, the flow of constant graviton speed and variable Newton's coupling can be favored in the vicinity of IR fixed point, but the conclusion is indistinct and far from definite yet. Together with the numerous classical solutions, static or time-dependent, which have already been found, the accumulated data from various future tests will give some hints in constraining the flow patterns more deterministic.
