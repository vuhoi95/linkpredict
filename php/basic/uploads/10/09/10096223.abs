Title: The Conformal Manifold of Chern-Simons Matter Theories
Authors: Marco S. Bianchi and Silvia Penati
Abstract: We determine perturbatively the conformal manifold of N=2 Chern-Simons matter theories with the aim of checking in the three dimensional case the general prescription based on global symmetry breaking, recently introduced. We discuss in details few remarkable cases like the N=6 ABJM theory and its less supersymmetric generalizations with/without flavors. In all cases we find perfect agreement with the predictions of global symmetry breaking prescription.
