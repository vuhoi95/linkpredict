Title: Reciprocity of higher conserved charges in the sl(2) sector of N=4 SYM
Authors: Guido Macorini and Matteo Beccaria
Abstract: We extend the anlysis of the generalized Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity to the higher conserved charges of type IIB superstring on AdS5 x S5. The property is shown to hold for twist 2, and 3 operators in the sl(2) subsector.
