Title: Einstein's action and the harmonic gauge in terms of Newtonian fields
Authors: Barak Kol and Michael Smolkin
Abstract: The "Newtonian" or non-relativistic decomposition of Einstein's gravitational field is useful in the post-Newtonian approximation. We obtain the full non-quadratic Einstein-Hilbert action in terms of these fields as well as the harmonic gauge fixing term and find fairly simple expressions. We discuss alternatives to the harmonic gauge.
