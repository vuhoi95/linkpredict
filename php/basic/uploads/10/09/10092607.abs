Title: Dirac Particles in a Gravitational Field
Authors: Pierre Gosselin and Herve Mohrbach
Abstract: The semiclassical approximation for the Hamiltonian of Dirac particles interacting with an arbitrary gravitational field is investigated. The time dependence of the metrics leads to new contributions to the in-band energy operator in comparison to previous works on the static case. In particular we find a new coupling term between the linear momentum and the spin, as well as couplings which contribute to the breaking of the particle - antiparticle symmetry.
