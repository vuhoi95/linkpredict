Title: Calculi, Hodge operators and Laplacians on a quantum Hopf fibration
Authors: Giovanni Landi and Alessandro Zampini
Abstract: We describe Laplacian operators on the quantum group SUq (2) equipped with the four dimensional bicovariant differential calculus of Woronowicz as well as on the quantum homogeneous space S2q with the restricted left covariant three dimensional differential calculus. This is done by giving a family of Hodge dualities on both the exterior algebras of SUq (2) and S2q . We also study gauged Laplacian operators acting on sections of line bundles over the quantum sphere.
