Title: Gauge theory duals of black hole - black string transitions of  gravitational theories on a circle
Authors: Simon Catterall and Anosh Joseph and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: We study the black hole - black string phase transitions of gravitational theories compactified on a circle using the holographic duality conjecture. The gauge theory duals of these theories are maximally supersymmetric and strongly coupled 1 + 1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theories compactified on a circle, in the large $N$ limit. We perform the strongly coupled finite temperature gauge theory calculations on a lattice, using the recently developed exact lattice supersymmetry methods based on topological twisting and orbifolding. The spatial Polyakov line serves as relevant order parameter of the confinement - deconfinement phase transitions in the gauge theory duals.
