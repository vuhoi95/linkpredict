Abstract: We consider the 3-dimensional massive Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature as an effective theory for strong interactions. Using the Matsubara imaginary time formalism, we derive a closed form for the renormalized $T$-dependent four-point function. This gives a singularity, suggesting a phase transition. Considering the free energy we obtain the $T$-dependent mass, which goes to zero for some temperature. These results lead us to the conclusion that there is a second-order phase transition.
