Title: Global SO(10) F-theory GUTs
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and Johanna Knapp and Maximilian Kreuzer and Christoph Mayrhofer
Abstract: Making use of toric geometry we construct a class of global F-theory GUT models. The base manifolds are blowups of Fano threefolds and the Calabi-Yau fourfold is a complete intersection of two hypersurfaces. We identify possible GUT divisors and construct SO(10) models on them using the spectral cover construction. We use a split spectral cover to generate chiral matter on the 10 curves in order to get more degrees of freedom in phenomenology. We use abelian flux to break SO(10) to SU(5)\times U(1) which is interpreted as a flipped SU(5) model. With the GUT Higgses in the SU(5)\times U(1) model it is possible to further break the gauge symmetry to the Standard Model. We present several phenomenologically attractive examples in detail.
