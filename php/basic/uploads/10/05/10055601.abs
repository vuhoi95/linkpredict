Title: Greybody factor for a scalar field coupling to Einstein's tensor
Authors: Songbai Chen and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We study the greybody factor and Hawking radiation for a scalar field coupling to Einstein's tensor in the background of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-energy approximation. We find that the presence of the coupling terms modifies the standard results in the greybody factor and Hawking radiation. Our results show that both the absorption probability and Hawking radiation increase with the coupling constant. Moreover, we also find that for the stronger coupling, the charge of black hole enhances the absorption probability and Hawking radiation of the scalar field, which is different from those of ones without coupling to Einstein's tensor in the black hole spacetime.
