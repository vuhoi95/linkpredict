Title: Gravity and Yang-Mills Amplitude Relations
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Poul H. Damgaard and Bo Feng and Thomas Sondergaard
Abstract: Using only general features of the S-matrix and quantum field theory, we prove by induction the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations that link products of gauge theory amplitudes to gravity amplitudes at tree level. As a bonus of our analysis, we provide a novel and more symmetric form of these relations. We also establish an infinite tower of new identities between amplitudes in gauge theories.
