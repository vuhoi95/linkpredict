Title: Crossing the phantom divide with Ricci-like holographic dark energy
Authors: Samuel Lepe and Francisco Pena
Abstract: We study a holographic model for the dark energy considered recently in the literature which postulates an energy density $\rho \sim R$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar curvature. We obtain a cosmological scenario that comes from considering two non-interacting fluids along a reasonable Ansatz for the cosmic coincidence parameter. We adjust the involved parameters in the model according to the observational data and we show that the equation of state for the dark energy experience a cross through the -1 barrier. In addition, we find a disagreement in these parameters with respect to an approach from a scalar field theory.
