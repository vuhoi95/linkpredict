Abstract: We study small hairy black holes in a consistent truncation of ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity that consists of a single charged scalar field interacting with the metric and a U(1) gauge field. Small very near extremal RNAdS black holes in this system are unstable to decay by superradiant emission. The end point of this instability is a small hairy black hole that we construct analytically in a perturbative expansion in its charge. Unlike their RNAdS counterparts, hairy black hole solutions exist all the way down to the BPS bound, demonstrating that ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory has an ${\cal O}(N^2)$ entropy at all energies above supersymmetry. At the BPS bound these black holes reduce to previously discussed regular, supersymmetric horizon free solitons. We use numerical methods to continue the construction of these solitons to large charges and find that the line of soliton solutions terminates at a singular solution $S$ at a finite charge. We conjecture that a one parameter family of singular supersymmetric solutions, which emerges out of $S$, constitutes the BPS limit of hairy black holes at larger values of the charge. At leading order in their charge, the thermodynamics of the small hairy black holes constructed in this paper turns out to be correctly reproduced by modeling these objects as a non interacting mix of an RNAdS black hole and the supersymmetric soliton in thermal equilibrium. Assuming that a similar non interacting model continues to apply upon turning on angular momentum, we also predict a rich family of rotating hairy black holes, including new hairy supersymmetric black holes. This analysis suggests interesting structure for the space of (yet to be constructed) hairy charged rotating black holes in $AdS_5\times S^5$, particularly in the near BPS limit.
