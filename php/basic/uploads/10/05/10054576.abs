Title: Lie prealgebras
Authors: Michel Dubois-Violette and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of Lie algebras within the theory of nonhomogeneous quadratic algebras and point out its relevance in the theory of quantum groups. In particular the relation between the differential calculus on quantum group and the Koszul duality due to Positselski is made apparent.
