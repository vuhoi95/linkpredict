Title: More on Massive 3D Supergravity
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Olaf Hohm and Jan Rosseel and Ergin Sezgin and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: Completing earlier work on three dimensional (3D) N=1 supergravity with curvature-squared terms, we construct the general supergravity extension of cosmological massive gravity theories. We expand about supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua, finding the conditions for bulk unitarity and the critical points in parameter space at which the spectrum changes. We discuss implications for the dual conformal field theory.
