Title: QCD Phase Transition in a Strong Magnetic Background
Authors: Massimo D'Elia and Swagato Mukherjee and Francesco Sanfilippo
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the deconfining/chiral restoring transition for two flavor QCD in presence of a uniform background magnetic field. We adopt a standard staggered discretization of the fermion action and a lattice spacing of the order of 0.3 fm. We explore different values of the bare quark mass, corresponding to pion masses in the range 200 - 480 MeV, and magnetic fields up to |e|B ~ 0.75 GeV^2. The deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration temperatures remain compatible with each other and rise very slightly (< 2 % for our largest magnetic field) as a function of the magnetic field. On the other hand, the transition seems to become sharper as the magnetic field increases.
