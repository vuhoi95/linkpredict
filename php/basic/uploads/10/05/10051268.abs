Title: Holographic quantum states
Authors: Tobias J. Osborne and Jens Eisert and Frank Verstraete
Abstract: We show how continuous matrix product states of quantum field theories can be described in terms of the dissipative non-equilibrium dynamics of a lower-dimensional auxiliary boundary field theory. We demonstrate that the spatial correlation functions of the bulk field can be brought into one-to-one correspondence with the temporal statistics of the quantum jumps of the boundary field. This equivalence: (1) illustrates an intimate connection between the theory of continuous quantum measurement and quantum field theory; (2) gives an explicit construction of the boundary field theory allowing the extension of real-space renormalization group methods to arbitrary dimensional quantum field theories without the introduction of a lattice parameter; and (3) yields a novel interpretation of recent cavity QED experiments in terms of quantum field theory, and hence paves the way toward observing genuine quantum phase transitions in such zero-dimensional driven quantum systems.
