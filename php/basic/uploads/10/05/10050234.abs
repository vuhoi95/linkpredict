Title: Un-graviton corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole

Abstract: We introduce an effective action smoothly extending the standard Einstein-Hilbert action to include un-gravity effects. The improved field equations are solved for the un-graviton corrected Schwarzschild geometry reproducing the Mureika result. This is an important test to confirm the original ``guess'' of the form of the Un-Schwarzschild metric. Instead of working in the weak field approximation and ``dressing'' the Newtonian potential with un-gravitons, we solve the ``effective Einstein equations'' including all order un-gravity effects. An unexpected ``bonus'' of accounting un-gravity effects is the fractalisation of the event horizon. In the un-gravity dominated regime the event horizon thermodynamically behaves as fractal surface of dimensionality twice the scale dimension d_U.
