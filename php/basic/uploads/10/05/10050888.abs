Title: Algebraic aspects of the correlation functions of the integrable  higher-spin XXZ spin chains with arbitrary entries
Authors: Tetsuo Deguchi and Chihiro Matsui
Abstract: We discuss some fundamental properties of the XXZ spin chain, which are important in the algebraic Bethe-ansatz derivation for the multiple-integral representations of the spin-s XXZ correlation function with an arbitrary product of elementary matrices. For instance, we construct Hermitian conjugate vectors in the massless regime and introduce the spin-s Hermitian elementary matrices.
