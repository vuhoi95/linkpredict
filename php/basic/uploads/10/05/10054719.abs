Title: An Algebraic Model for the su(2|2) Light-Cone String Field Theory
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: We investigate algebraic structure of light-cone string field theory which respects the spacetime supersymmetry su(2|2). Extracting building blocks from the explicit oscillator expressions of light-cone superstring field theory on the pp-wave and the flat background, we propose a model for more generic backgrounds by giving an algebraic procedure to construct supercharges and Hamiltonian without referring to explicit oscillator expressions. Based on this strategy, we systematically construct interaction terms of light-cone string field theory on the pp-wave background and some examples of its generalization. We also study the supergravity limit of the interaction terms on the pp-wave background.
