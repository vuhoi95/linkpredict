Title: Testing Hawking particle creation by black holes through correlation  measurements
Authors: R. Balbinot and I. Carusotto and A. Fabbri and A. Recati
Abstract: Hawking's prediction of thermal radiation by black holes has been shown by Unruh to be expected also in condensed matter systems. We show here that in a black hole-like configuration realised in a BEC this particle creation does indeed take place and can be unambiguously identified via a characteristic pattern in the density-density correlations. This opens the concrete possibility of the experimental verification of this effect.
