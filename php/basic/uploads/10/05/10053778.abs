Abstract: This paper investigates the information loss paradox in the WKB/tunneling picture of Hawking radiation. In the tunneling picture one can obtain the tunneling amplitude to all orders in $\hbar$. However all terms beyond the lowest, semi-classical term involve unknown constants. Despite this we find that one can still arrive at interesting restrictions on Hawking radiation to all orders in $\hbar$: (i) Taking into account only quantum corrections the spectrum remains thermal to all orders. Thus quantum corrections by themselves will not resolve the information loss paradox. (ii) The first quantum correction give a temperature for the radiation which goes to zero as the mass of the black hole goes to zero. Including higher order corrections changes this nice result of the first order corrections. (iii) Finally we show that by taking both quantum corrections and back reaction into account it is possible under specific conditions to solve the information paradox by having the black hole evaporate completely with the information carried away by the correlations of the outgoing radiation.
