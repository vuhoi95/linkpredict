Title: Rotating black ring on Kaluza-Klein bubbles
Authors: Petya G. Nedkova and Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev
Abstract: We construct a new exact solution to the 5D Einstein equations describing rotating black ring with a single angular momentum surrounded by two Kaluza-Klein bubbles. The solution is generated by 2-soliton B\"{a}cklund transformation. Its physical properties are computed and analyzed. The corresponding static solution, the rotating black string and the boosted black string are reproduced as limits.
