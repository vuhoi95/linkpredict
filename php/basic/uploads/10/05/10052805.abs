Title: Particle Probe of Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity is probed through particle geodesics. Gravitational force of KS black hole becomes weaker than that of Schwarzschild around horizon and interior space. Particles can be always scattered or trapped in new closed orbits, unlike those falling forever in Schwarzschild black. The properties of null and timelike geodesics are classified with values of coupling constants. The precession rates of the orbits are evaluated. The time trajectories are also classified under different values of coupling constants for both null and timelike geodesics. Physical phenomena that may be observable are discussed.
