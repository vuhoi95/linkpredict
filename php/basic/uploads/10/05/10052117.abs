Title: D-branes and matrix factorisations in supersymmetric coset models
Authors: Nicolas Behr and Stefan Fredenhagen
Abstract: Matrix factorisations describe B-type boundary conditions in N=2 supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg models. At the infrared fixed point, they correspond to superconformal boundary states. We investigate the relation between boundary states and matrix factorisations in the Grassmannian Kazama-Suzuki coset models. For the first non-minimal series, i.e. for the models of type SU(3)_k/U(2), we identify matrix factorisations for a subset of the maximally symmetric boundary states. This set provides a basis for the RR charge lattice, and can be used to generate (presumably all) other boundary states by tachyon condensation.
