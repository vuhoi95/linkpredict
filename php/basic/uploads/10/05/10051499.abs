Title: A Note on the Lower Bound of Black Hole Area Change in Tunneling  Formalism
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: In the framework of tunneling mechanism and employing Bekenstein's general expression for the variation of the black hole area, we determine the area quantum up to a constant. Depending on the value of this constant one can get either Bekenstein's lower bound or Hod's one for the change in the black hole area.
