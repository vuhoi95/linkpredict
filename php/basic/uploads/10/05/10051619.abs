Title: AdS Black Hole Solutions in the Extended New Massive Gravity
Authors: Soonkeon Nam and Jong-Dae Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We have obtained (warped) AdS black hole solutions in the three dimensional extended new massive gravity. We investigate some properties of black holes and obtain central charges of the two dimensional dual CFT. To obtain the central charges, we use the relation between entropy and temperature according to the AdS/CFT dictionary. For AdS black holes, one can also use the central charge function formalism which leads to the same results.
