Title: Calculating the jet-quenching parameter in STU background
Authors: K. Bitaghsir Fadafan and B. Pourhassan and J. Sadeghi
Abstract: In this paper we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the jet-quenching parameter in a N=2 thermal plasma. We consider the general three-charge black hole and discuss some special cases. We add a constant electric field to the background and find the effect of the electric field on the jet-quenching parameter. Also we include higher derivative terms and obtain the first-order correction for the jet-quenching parameter.
