Title: Phase Transition of NLSUSY Space-Time and Unity of Nature
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: The mysterious relation between the large scale structure of the universe and the tiny (Planck) scale structure of the particle physics, e.g. the observed mysterious relation between the (dark) energy density (and the dark matter) of the universe and the origin of the tiny neutrino mass (and the SUSY breaking mass scale) of the particle physics may be explained simply by the nonlinear supersymmmetric general relativity theory (NLSUSY GR).
