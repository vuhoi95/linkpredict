Title: A 5D noncompact Kaluza -Klein cosmology in the presence of Null perfect  fluid
Authors: H. Farajollahi and H. Amiri
Abstract: For the description of the early inflation, and acceleration expansion of the Universe, compatible with observational data, the 5D noncompact Kaluza--Klein cosmology is investigated. It is proposed that the 5D space is filled with a null perfect fluid, resulting a perfect fluid in 4D universe, plus one along the fifth dimension. By analyzing the reduced field equations for flat FRW model, we show the early inflationary behavior and current acceleration of the universe.
