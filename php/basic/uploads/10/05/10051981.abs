Title: Large $N$ reduction with the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model
Authors: Antonio Gonz√°lez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: We examine the breaking of $Z_N$ symmetry recently reported for the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model (TEK). We analyse the origin of this behaviour and propose simple modifications of twist and lattice action that could avoid the problem. Our results show no sign of symmetry breaking and allow us to obtain values of the large $N$ infinite volume string tension in agreement with extrapolations from results based upon straightforward methods.
