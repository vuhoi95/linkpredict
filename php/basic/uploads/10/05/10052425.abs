Title: Preheating in Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation
Authors: Nazim Bouatta and Anne-Christine Davis and Raquel H. Ribeiro and David Seery
Abstract: We study how the universe reheats following an era of chaotic Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation, and compare the rate of particle production with that in models based on canonical kinetic terms. Particle production occurs through non-perturbative resonances whose structure is modified by the nonlinearities of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We investigate these modifications and show that the reheating process may be efficient. We estimate the initial temperature of the subsequent hot, radiation-dominated phase.
