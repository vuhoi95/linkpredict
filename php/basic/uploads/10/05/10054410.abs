Title: Non-gaussianity in axion Nflation models
Authors: Soo A Kim and Andrew R Liddle and David Seery
Abstract: We study perturbations in the multi-field axion Nflation model, taking account of the full cosine potential. We find significant differences with previous analyses which made a quadratic approximation to the potential. The tensor-to-scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index move to lower values, which nevertheless provide an acceptable fit to observation. Most significantly, we find that the bispectrum non-gaussianity parameter f_NL may be large, typically of order 10 for moderate values of the axion decay constant, increasing to of order 100 for decay constants slightly smaller than the Planck scale. Such a non-gaussian fraction is detectable. We argue that this property is generic in multi-field models of hilltop inflation.
