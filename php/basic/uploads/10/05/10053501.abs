Abstract: With the use of the general covariant matrix 10-dimensional Petiau -- Duffin -- Kemmer formalism in cylindrical coordinates and tetrad there are constructed exact solutions of the quantum-mechanical equation for a particle with spin 1 in presence of an external homogeneous magnetic field. There are separated three linearly independent types of solutions; in each case the formula for energy levels has been found.
