Authors: D. Arnaudov and H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We study the class of pulsating strings on $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$. Using a generalized ansatz for pulsating string configurations we find new solutions of this class. Further we quasi-classically quantize the theory and obtain the first corrections to the energy. The latter, due to AdS/CFT correspondence, is supposed to give the anomalous dimensions of operators of the gauge theory dual ${\cal N}=1$ superconformal field theory.
