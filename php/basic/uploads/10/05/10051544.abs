Title: Holographic Renormalization of New Massive Gravity
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Ali Naseh
Abstract: We study holographic renormalization for three dimensional new massive gravity (NMG). By studying the general fall off conditions for the metric allowed by the model at infinity, we show that at the critical point where the central charges of the dual CFT are zero it contains a leading logarithmic behavior. In the context of AdS/CFT correspondence it can be identified as a source for an irrelevant operator in the dual CFT. The presence of the logarithmic fall off may be interpreted as the fact that the dual CFT would be a LCFT.
