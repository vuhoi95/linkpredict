Title: Quantum Gravity and Turbulence
Authors: Vishnu Jejjala and Djordje Minic and Y. Jack Ng and Chia-Hsiung Tze
Abstract: We apply recent advances in quantum gravity to the problem of turbulence. Adopting the AdS/CFT approach we propose a string theory of turbulence that explains the Kolmogorov scaling in 3+1 dimensions and the Kraichnan and Kolmogorov scalings in 2+1 dimensions. In the gravitational context, turbulence is intimately related to the properties of spacetime, or quantum, foam.
