Title: Cosmological evolution in exponential gravity
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Chao-Qiang Geng and Chung-Chi Lee
Abstract: We explore the cosmological evolution in the exponential gravity $f(R)=R +c_1 (1-e^{- c_2 R})$ ($c_{1, 2} = \mathrm{constant}$). We summarize various viability conditions and explicitly demonstrate that the late-time cosmic acceleration following the matter-dominated stage can be realized. We also study the equation of state for dark energy and confirm that the crossing of the phantom divide from the phantom phase to the non-phantom (quintessence) one can occur. Furthermore, we illustrate that the cosmological horizon entropy globally increases with time.
