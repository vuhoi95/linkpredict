Abstract: We consider the self-potential and the self-force for an electrically charged particle at rest in the massive wormhole space-time. We develop general approach for the renormalization of electromagnetic field of such particle in the static space-times and apply it to the space-time of the wormhole with parameter of the mass, $m$. The self-force is found in manifest form; it is an attractive force. We discus the peculiarities due to massive parameter of the wormhole.
