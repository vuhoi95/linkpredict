Title: PT-symmetric operators and metastable states of the 1D relativistic  oscillators
Authors: Riccardo Giachetti and Vincenzo Grecchi
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Dirac equation for the harmonic oscillator and the associated second order separated operators giving the resonances of the problem by complex dilation. The same operators have unique extensions as closed PT-symmetric operators defining infinite positive energy levels converging to the Schroedinger ones as c tends to infinity. Such energy levels and their eigenfunctions give directly a definite choice of metastable states of the problem. Precise numerical computations shows that these levels coincide with the positions of the resonances up to the order of the width. Similar results are found for the Klein-Gordon oscillators, and in this case there is an infinite number of dynamics and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the PT-symmetric operators give metastable states for each dynamics.
