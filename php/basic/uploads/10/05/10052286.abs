Title: Image formation in weak gravitational lensing by tidal charged black  holes
Authors: Zsolt Horváth and László Árpád Gergely and David Hobill
Abstract: We derive a generic weak lensing equation and apply it for the study of images produced by tidal charged brane black holes. We discuss the similarities and point out the differences with respect to the Schwarzschild black hole weak lensing, to both first and second order accuracy, when either the mass or the tidal charge dominates. In the case of mass dominated weak lensing, we analyze the position of the images, the magnification factors and the flux ratio, as compared to the Schwarzschild lensing. The most striking modification appears in the flux ratio. When the tidal charge represents the dominating lensing effect, the number and orientation of the images with respect to the optical axis resembles the lensing properties of a Schwarzschild geometry, where the sign associated with the mass is opposite to that for the tidal charge. Finally it is found that the ratio of the brightness of images as a function of image separation in the case of tidal charged black holes obeys a power-law relation significantly different from that for Schwarzschild black holes. This might provide a means for determining the underlying spacetime structure.
