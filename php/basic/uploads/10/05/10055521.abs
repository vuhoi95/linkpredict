Title: Massless Particles plus Matter in the Rest-Frame Instant Form of  Dynamics
Authors: David Alba and Horace W. Crater and Luca Lusanna
Abstract: After introducing the parametrized Minkowski theory describing a positive-energy scalar massless particle, we study the rest-frame instant form of dynamics of such a particle in presence of another massive one (to avoid the front form of dynamics). Then we describe massless particles with Grassmann-valued helicity and their quantization.
