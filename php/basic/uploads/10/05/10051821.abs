Title: U(1)-decoupling, KK and BCJ relations in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM
Authors: Yin Jia and Rijun Huang and Chang-Yong Liu
Abstract: We proved the color reflection relation, U(1)-decoupling, Kleiss-Kuijf and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relation for color-ordered $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory using $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM version BCFW recursion relation, which depends only on the general properties of super-amplitudes. This verified the conjectured matter fields BCJ relation. We also show that color reflection relation and U(1)-decoupling relation are special cases of KK relation, if we consider the KK relation as a general relation, then the former two relations come out naturally as the special cases.
