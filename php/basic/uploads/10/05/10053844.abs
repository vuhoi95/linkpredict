Title: Study of an Alternate Mechanism for the Origin of Fermion Generations
Authors: Thomas A. Ryttov and Robert Shrock
Abstract: In usual extended technicolor (ETC) theories based on the group ${\rm{SU}(N_{ETC}})_{ETC}$, the quarks of charge 2/3 and -1/3 and the charged leptons of all generations arise from ETC fermion multiplets transforming according to the fundamental representation. Here we investigate a different idea for the origin of SM fermion generations, in which quarks and charged leptons of different generations arise from ETC fermions transforming according to different representations of ${\rm{SU}(N_{ETC}})_{ETC}$. Although this mechanism would have the potential, {\it a priori}, to allow a reduction in the value of $N_{ETC}$ relative to conventional ETC models, we show that, at least in simple models, it is excluded by the fact that the technicolor sector is not asymptotically free or by the appearance of fermions with exotic quantum numbers which are not observed.
