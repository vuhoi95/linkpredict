Title: Matter power spectrum in f(R) gravity with massive neutrinos
Authors: Hayato Motohashi and Alexei A. Starobinsky and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: The effect of massive neutrinos on matter power spectrum is discussed in the context of $f(R)$ gravity. It is shown that the anomalous growth of density fluctuations on small scales due to the scalaron force can be compensated by free streaming of neutrinos. As a result, models which predict observable deviation of the equation-of-state parameter $w_\DE$ from $w_\DE=-1$ can be reconciled with observations of matter clustering if the total neutrino mass is $O(0.5 \eV)$.
