Title: Tolman mass, generalized surface gravity, and entropy bounds
Authors: Gabriel Abreu and Matt Visser
Abstract: In any static spacetime the quasi-local Tolman mass contained within a volume can be reduced to a Gauss-like surface integral involving the flux of a suitably defined generalized surface gravity. By introducing some basic thermodynamics and invoking the Unruh effect one can then develop elementary bounds on the quasi-local entropy that are very similar in spirit to the holographic bound, and closely related to entanglement entropy.
