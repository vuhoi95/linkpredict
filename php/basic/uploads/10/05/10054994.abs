Title: Unexpected Features of Supersymmetry with Central Charges
Authors: R. Campoamor-Stursberg and M. Rausch de Traubenberg
Abstract: It is shown that N=2 supersymmetric theories with central charges present some hidden quartic symmetry. This enables us to construct representations of the quartic structure induced by superalgebra representations.
