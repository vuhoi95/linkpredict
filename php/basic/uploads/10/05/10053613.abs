Title: Discrete R Symmetries and Domain Walls
Authors: Michael Dine and Fuminobu Takahashi and Tsutomu T. Yanagida
Abstract: Discrete R symmetries are interesting from a variety of points of view. They raise the specter, however, of domain walls, which may be cosmologically problematic. In this note, we describe some of the issues. In many schemes for supersymmetry breaking, as we explain, satisfying familiar constraints such as suppression of gravitino production, insures that the domain walls are readily inflated away. However, in others, they form after inflation. In these cases, it is necessary that they annihilate. We discuss possible breaking mechanisms for the discrete symmetries, and the constraints they must satisfy so that the walls annihilate effectively.
