Title: Lagrangian generators of the Poincare gauge symmetries
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Debraj Roy and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: We have systematically computed the generators of the symmetries arising in Poincare gauge theory formulation of gravity, both in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. This was done using a completely Lagrangian approach. The results are expected to be valid in any dimensions, as seen through lifting the results of the 2+1 dimensional example into the 3+1 dimensional one.
