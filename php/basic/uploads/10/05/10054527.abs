Title: Supersymmetric AdS3 X S2 M-theory geometries with fluxes
Authors: Eoin Ó Colgáin and Jun-Bao Wu and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: Motivated by a recent observation that the LLM geometries admit 1/4-BPS M5-brane probes with worldvolume AdS3 X \Sigma_2 X S1 preserving the R-symmetry, we initiate a classification of the most general AdS3 X S2 geometries in M-theory. We retain all field strengths consistent with symmetry and derive the torsion conditions for M_6 in terms of two linearly independent spinors. Surprisingly, we identify three Killing directions for M_6, but only two of these generate isometries of the overall ansatz. We show that the existence of this third direction depends on the norm of the spinors. Then, specialising to the case where the spinors define an SU(2)-structure and the class of solutions is 1/4-BPS, we note that supersymmetry dictates that all magnetic fluxes necessarily thread the S2. Finally, by assuming that the two remaining Killing directions are parallel and aligned with one of the two vectors defining the SU(2)-structure, we derive a general relationship for the two spinors before extracting a known class of solutions from the torsion conditions.
