Abstract: We present the detailed calculations of the asymptotics of two-site correlation functions for height variables in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model. By using combinatorial methods for the enumeration of spanning trees, we extend the well-known result for the correlation $\sigma_{1,1} \simeq 1/r^4$ of minimal heights $h_1=h_2=1$ to $\sigma_{1,h} = P_{1,h}-P_1P_h$ for height values $h=2,3,4$. These results confirm the dominant logarithmic behaviour $\sigma_{1,h} \simeq (c_h\log r + d_h)/r^4 + {\cal O}(r^{-5})$ for large $r$, predicted by logarithmic conformal field theory based on field identifications obtained previously. We obtain, from our lattice calculations, the explicit values for the coefficients $c_h$ and $d_h$ (the latter are new).
