Title: AdS/CFT and large-N volume independence
Authors: Erich Poppitz and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: We study the Eguchi-Kawai reduction in the strong-coupling domain of gauge theories via the gravity dual of N=4 super-Yang-Mills on R^3xS^1. We show that D-branes geometrize volume independence in the center-symmetric vacuum and give supergravity predictions for the range of validity of reduced large-N models at strong coupling.
