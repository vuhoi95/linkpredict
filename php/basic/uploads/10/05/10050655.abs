Title: Mesons as Open Strings in a Holographic Dual of QCD
Authors: Toshiya Imoto and Tadakatsu Sakai and Shigeki Sugimoto
Abstract: We study meson spectrum obtained from massive open string modes in a holographic dual of QCD constructed on the basis of a D4/D8-brane configuration in type IIA string theory. The spectrum includes mesons with spin higher than one. Taking into account the effect of curved background perturbatively, we obtain a mass formula for these mesons, which exhibits the linear Regge behavior at the leading order with subleading non-linear corrections. We argue that the string spectrum captures some features of the observed meson spectrum. For example, a_2(1320), b_1(1235), \pi(1300), a_0(1450), etc., are identified as the first excited massive open string states and \rho_3(1690), \pi_2(1670), etc., are identified as the second excited states.
