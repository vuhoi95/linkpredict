Title: Baryogenesis and Late-Decaying Moduli
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Bhaskar Dutta and Kuver Sinha
Abstract: Late-decaying string moduli dilute the baryon asymmetry of the universe created in any previous era. The reheat temperature for such moduli is below a GeV, thus motivating baryogenesis at very low temperatures. We present an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with TeV-scale colored fields that can yield the correct baryon asymmetry of the universe in this context. Modulus decay, which reheats the universe at a temperature below GeV, produces the visible sector fields and neutralino dark matter in non-thermal fashion. We discuss various possibilities for baryogenesis from TeV scale colored fields and show that they can generate an acceptable baryon asymmetry, while being compatible with phenomenological constraints like neutron-antineutron oscillation.
