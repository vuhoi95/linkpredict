Authors: C. Furtado and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. F. Santos
Abstract: We study the conditions for the consistency of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric with the dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity. It turns out to be that in this situation the accelerated expansion of the Universe takes place, with the time dependence of the scale factor turns out to be similar to the case of presence of the Chaplygin gas. Also we found that this modification changes the total density of the Universe and therefore gives a nontrivial impact to a cosmological scenario.
