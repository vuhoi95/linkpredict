Title: Metamaterials Mimicking Dynamic Spacetime, D-brane and Noncommutativity  in String Theory
Authors: Rong-Xin Miao and Rui Zheng and Miao Li
Abstract: We propose an executable scheme to mimic the expanding cosmos in 1+2 dimensions in laboratory. Furthermore, we develop a general procedure to use nonlinear metamaterials to mimic D-brane and noncommutativity in string theory.
