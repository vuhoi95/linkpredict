Abstract: A string-inspired 3-form-dilaton-gravity model is studied in a Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario. As expected, the rank-3 antisymmetric field is exponentially suppressed. For each mass level, the mass spectrum is bigger than the one for the Kalb-Ramond field. The coupling between the dilaton and the massless Kaluza-Klein mode of the 3-form is calculated and the coupling constant of the cubic interactions obtained numerically. This coupling are of the order of Tev$^{-1}$, therefore there exist a possibility to find some signal of it at Tev scale.
