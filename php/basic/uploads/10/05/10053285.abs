Title: Hyperfine Splitting and the Zeeman Effect in Holographic Heavy-Light  Mesons
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Stefan A. Stricker and Aleksi Vuorinen
Abstract: We inspect the mass spectrum of heavy-light mesons in deformed N=2 super Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We demonstrate how some of the degeneracies of the supersymmetric meson spectrum can be removed upon breaking the supersymmetry, thus leading to the emergence of hyperfine structure. The explicit SUSY breaking scenarios we consider involve on one hand tilting one of the two fundamental D7 branes inside the internal R^6 space, and on the other hand applying an external magnetic field on the (untilted) branes. The latter scenario leads to the well-known Zeeman effect, which we inspect for both weak and strong magnetic fields.
