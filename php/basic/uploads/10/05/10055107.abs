Title: On NCQFT and dimensionless insertions
Authors: Manfred Schweda and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: In these notes, we aim at a precise definition of the tree level action for the noncommutative scalar and gauge field theories on four-dimensional canonically deformed Euclidean space. As tools to achieve this goal we employ power counting and normalization conditions.
