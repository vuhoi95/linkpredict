Title: Goldstinos, Supercurrents and Metastable SUSY Breaking in N=2  Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Matthew Buican
Abstract: We construct an N=2 supersymmetric generalization of the N=1 supercurrent formalism of Komargodski and Seiberg (KS) and use it to show that N=2 theories with linear superconformal anomalies cannot break SUSY under certain broad assumptions. This result suggests that there are no metastable SUSY breaking vacua in a large class of theories that includes N=2 Super Yang-Mills (SYM).
