Title: Multi-State Dark Matter from Spherical Extra Dimensions
Authors: Peter T. Winslow and Kris Sigurdson and John N. Ng
Abstract: We demonstrate a new model which uses an ADD type braneworld scenario to produce a multi-state theory of dark matter. Compactification of the extra dimensions onto a sphere leads to the association of a single complex scalar in the bulk with multiple Kaluza-Klein towers in an effective four-dimensional theory. A mutually interacting multi-state theory of dark matter arises naturally within which the dark matter states are identified with the lightest Kaluza-Klein particles of fixed magnetic quantum number. These states are protected from decay by a combination of a global U(1) symmetry and the continuous rotational symmetry about the polar axis of the spherical geometry. We briefly discuss the relic abundance calculation and investigate the spin-independent elastic scattering off nucleons of the lightest and next-to-lightest dark matter states.
