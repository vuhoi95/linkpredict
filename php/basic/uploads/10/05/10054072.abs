Abstract: We initiate a comprehensive study of a set of solutions of topologically massive gravity known as null warped anti-de Sitter spacetimes. These are pp-wave extensions of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We first perform a careful analysis of the linearized stability of black holes in these spacetimes. We find two qualitatively different types of solutions to the linearized equations of motion: the first set has an exponential time dependence, the second - a polynomial time dependence. The solutions polynomial in time induce severe pathologies and moreover survive at the non-linear level. In order to make sense of these geometries, it is thus crucial to impose appropriate boundary conditions. We argue that there exists a consistent set of boundary conditions that allows us to reject the above pathological modes from the physical spectrum. The asymptotic symmetry group associated to these boundary conditions consists of a centrally-extended Virasoro algebra. Using this central charge we can account for the entropy of the black holes via Cardy's formula. Finally, we note that the black hole spectrum is chiral and prove a Birkoff theorem showing that there are no other stationary axisymmetric black holes with the specified asymptotics. We extend most of the analysis to a larger family of pp-wave black holes which are related to Schr\"odinger spacetimes with critical exponent z.
