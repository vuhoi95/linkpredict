Title: Modes with variable mass as an alternative in AdS / QCD models with  chiral symmetry breaking
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: We consider a new possibility of incorporating chiral symmetry breaking in soft wall models with a quadratic dilaton and AdS metric. In particular, we allow the mass of the scalar modes propagating in the bulk to have a dependence on the holographical coordinate. In one of the models that we discuss, it is possible obtain a good meson spectra considering current quark masses, and in the other two models considered, good results can be obtained at the expense of considering rather large quark masses.
