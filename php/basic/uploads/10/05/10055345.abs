Title: Weyl Equation and (Non)-Commutative SU(n+1) BPS Monopoles
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Theodora Ioannidou
Abstract: We apply the ADHMN construction to obtain the SU(n+1)(for generic values of n) spherically symmetric BPS monopoles with minimal symmetry breaking. In particular, the problem simplifies by solving the Weyl equation, leading to a set of coupled equations, whose solutions are expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. Next, this construction is generalized for non-commutative SU(n+1) BPS monopoles, where the corresponding solutions are given in terms of the Heun B functions.
