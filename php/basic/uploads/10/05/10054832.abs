Title: Second Order Phase Transition and Thermodynamic Geometry in Kerr-AdS  Black Hole
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sujoy Kumar Modak and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: We discuss a scheme based on Ehrenfest like equations to exhibit and classify transitions between two phases (with "smaller" and "larger" masses) of Kerr AdS black holes. We show that for fixed angular velocity this phase transition is of second order as both Ehrenfest's equations are satisfied. Finally we make a close connection of the results found from this analysis with those obtained from the thermodynamic state space geometry approach.
