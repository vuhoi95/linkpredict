Title: A note on the implementation of Poincaré symmetry in noncommutative  field theory
Authors: Ignacio Cortese and J. Antonio García
Abstract: We argue that Poincar\'e symmetry can be implemented in NCFT if we allow the parameter of noncommutitive deformation $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ to change as a two-tensor under the corresponding space-time symmetry. The implementation is consistent with the definition of $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ in terms of space-time coordinates and with the Moyal star product. Inspired from the standard definition of a variational symmetry we found a universal way to correct the implementation of the Poincar\'e symmetry by a term proportional to the variation of $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ in such a way that the new transformation define a symmetry of the theory. Finally we present as an example the case of NCYM theory and comment about the obstructions to implement generalized space-time symmetries in NCFT like conformal or diffeomorphism transformations.
