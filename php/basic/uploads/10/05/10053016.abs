Title: Extended Y-system for the $AdS_5/CFT_4$ correspondence
Authors: Andrea Cavagli√† and Davide Fioravanti and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: We study the analytic properties of the $AdS_5/CFT_4$ Y functions. It is shown that the TBA equations, including the dressing factor, can be obtained from the Y-system with some additional information on the square-root discontinuities across semi-infinite segments in the complex plane. The Y-system extended by the discontinuity relations constitutes a fundamental set of local functional constraints that can be easily transformed into integral form through Cauchy's theorem.
