Title: Two dimensional fermions in three dimensional YM
Authors: R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger
Abstract: Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation of SU(N) live on the surface of a cylinder embedded in $R^3$ and interact with a three dimensional SU(N) Yang Mills vector potential preserving a global chiral symmetry at finite $N$. As the circumference of the cylinder is varied from small to large, the chiral symmetry gets spontaneously broken in the infinite $N$ limit at a typical bulk scale. Replacing three dimensional YM by four dimensional YM introduces non-trivial renormalization effects.
