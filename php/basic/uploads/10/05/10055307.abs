Title: Precision Spectroscopy and Higher Spin symmetry in the ABJM model
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Rubik Poghossian and Marine Samsonyan
Abstract: We revisit Kaluza-Klein compactification of 11-d supergravity on S^7/Z_k using group theory techniques that may find application in other flux vacua with internal coset spaces. Among the SO(2) neutral states, we identify marginal deformations and fields that couple to the recently discussed world-sheet instanton of Type IIA on CP^3. We also discuss charged states, dual to monopole operators, and the Z_k projection of the Osp(4|8) singleton and its tensor products. In particular, we show that the doubleton spectrum may account for N=6 higher spin symmetry enhancement in the limit of vanishing 't Hooft coupling in the boundary Chern-Simons theory.
