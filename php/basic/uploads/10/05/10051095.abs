Title: A continuity argument for a semilinear Skyrme model
Authors: Dan-Andrei Geba and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We investigate a semilinear modification for the wave map problem proposed by Adkins and Nappi, and prove that in the equivariant case the solution remain continuous at the first possible singularity.
