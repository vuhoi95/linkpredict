Title: Deformations of Maxwell Superalgebras and Their Applications
Authors: Sotirios Bonanos and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We describe the Lie algebra deformations of D=4 Maxwell superalgebra that was recently introduced as the symmetry algebra of a kappa-symmetric massless superparticle in a supersymmetric constant electromagnetic background. Further we introduce the D=3 Maxwell superalgebra and present all its possible deformations. Finally the deformed superalgebras are used to derive via a contraction procedure the complete set of Casimir operators for D=4 and D=3 Maxwell superalgebras.
