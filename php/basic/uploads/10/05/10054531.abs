Title: Trigonometric Sutherland systems and their Ruijsenaars duals from  symplectic reduction
Authors: L. Feher and V. Ayadi
Abstract: Besides its usual interpretation as a system of $n$ indistinguishable particles moving on the circle, the trigonometric Sutherland system can be viewed alternatively as a system of distinguishable particles on the circle or on the line, and these 3 physically distinct systems are in duality with corresponding variants of the rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. We explain that the 3 duality relations, first obtained by Ruijsenaars in 1995, arise naturally from the Kazhdan-Kostant-Sternberg symplectic reductions of the cotangent bundles of the group U(n) and its covering groups $U(1) \times SU(n)$ and ${\mathbb R}\times SU(n)$, respectively. This geometric interpretation enhances our understanding of the duality relations and simplifies Ruijsenaars' original direct arguments that led to their discovery.
