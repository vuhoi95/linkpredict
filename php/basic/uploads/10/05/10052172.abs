Title: Semitransparent pistons
Authors: P. Morales and K. Kirsten
Abstract: We consider semitransparent pistons in the presence of extra dimensions. It is shown that the piston is always attracted to the closest wall irrespective of details of the geometry and topology of the extra dimensions and of the cross section of the piston. Furthermore, we evaluate the zeta regularized determinant for this configuration.
