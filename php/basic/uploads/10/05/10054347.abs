Title: On Non-Canonical Kinetic Terms and the Tilt of the Power Spectrum
Authors: Sera Cremonini and Zygmunt Lalak and Krzysztof Turzynski
Abstract: We argue that in models of inflation with two scalar fields and non-canonical kinetic terms there is a possibility of obtaining a red tilt of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations from noncanonicality-induced interactions between the curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We describe an extremely simple model realizing this idea, study numerically its predictions for the perturbations and discuss applications in realistic scenarios of inflation. We discuss to what extent in this model the scale of the inflationary potential can be decoupled from the amplitude of the density fluctuations.
