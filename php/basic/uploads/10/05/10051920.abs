Title: A Naturally Minute Quantum Correction to the Cosmological Constant  Descended from the Hierarchy
Authors: Shu-Heng Shao and Pisin Chen
Abstract: We demonstrate that an extremely small but positive quantum correction, or the Casimir energy, to the cosmological constant can arise from a massive bulk fermion field in the Randall-Sundrum model. Specifically, a cosmological constant doubly descended from the Planck-electroweak hierarchy and as minute as the observed dark energy scale can be naturally achieved without fine-tuning of the bulk fermion mass. To ensure the stabilization of the system, we discuss two stabilization mechanisms under this setup. It is found that the Goldberger-Wise mechanism can be successfully introduced in the presence of a massive bulk fermion, without spoiling the smallness of the quantum correction.
