Title: On the geometry of loop quantum gravity on a graph
Authors: Carlo Rovelli and Simone Speziale
Abstract: We discuss the meaning of geometrical constructions associated to loop quantum gravity states on a graph. In particular, we discuss the "twisted geometries" and derive a simple relation between these and Regge geometries.
