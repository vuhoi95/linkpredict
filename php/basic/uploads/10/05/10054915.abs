Title: Four-qubit entanglement from string theory
Authors: L. Borsten and D. Dahanayake and M. J. Duff and A. Marrani and W. Rubens
Abstract: We invoke the black hole/qubit correspondence to derive the classification of four-qubit entanglement. The U-duality orbits resulting from timelike reduction of string theory from D=4 to D=3 yield 31 entanglement families, which reduce to nine up to permutation of the four qubits.
