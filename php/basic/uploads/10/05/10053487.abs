Authors: E. M. Ovsiyuk and V. V. Kisel and V. M. Red'kov
Abstract: There are constructed exact solutions of the quantum-mechanical Dirac equation for a spin S=1/2 particle in Riemannian space of constant negative curvature, hyperbolic Lobachevsky space, in presence of an external magnetic field, analogue of the homogeneous magnetic field in the Minkowski space. A generalized formula for energy levels, describing quantization of the motion of the particle in magnetic field on the background of the Lobachevsky space geometry, has been obtained.
