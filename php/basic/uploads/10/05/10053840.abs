Title: Geometric Representation of the generator of duality in massless and  massive $p-$form field theories
Authors: Ernesto Contreras and Lorenzo Leal and Yisely Martinez
Abstract: We study the invariance under duality transformations in massless and massive $p-$form field theories and obtain the Noether generators of the infinitesimal transformations that correspond to this symmetry. These generators are realized in geometrical representations that generalize the Loop Representation of the Maxwell field, allowing for a geometrical interpretation which is studied.
