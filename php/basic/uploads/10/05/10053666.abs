Title: A note on testing pre-inflationary times with gravitational-waves
Authors: Carlos Marques Afonso and Alfredo Barbosa Henriques and Paulo Vargas Moniz
Abstract: A simple inflationary model based on loop quantum cosmology is considered. Within this framework, we show that inflation does not necessarily erase the infor- mation prior to its onset, but that such information may leave its imprint in the energy-spectrum of the gravitational-waves generated at these earliest of times.
