Title: Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics on the Event Horizon for  Interacting Dark Energy
Authors: Nairwita Mazumder and Subenoy Chakraborty
Abstract: Here we are trying to find the conditions for the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) assuming the first law of thermodynamics on the event horizon in both cases when the FRW universe is filled with interacting two fluid system- one in the form of cold dark matter and the other is either holographic dark energy or new age graphic dark energy. Using the recent observational data we have found that GSLT holds both in quintessence era as well as in phantom era for new age graphic model while for holographic dark energy GSLT is valid only in phantom era.
