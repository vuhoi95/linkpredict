Title: Constraints on dark energy equation of state parameters from cosmic  topology
Authors: M. J. Reboucas and A. F. F. Teixeira
Abstract: Despite our present-day inability to predict the topology of the universe it is expected that we should be able to detect it in the near future. A nontrivial detectable topology of the space section of the universe can be probed for all homogeneous and isotropic universes through the circles-in-the-sky. We discuss briefly how one can use this observable attribute to set constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameters.
