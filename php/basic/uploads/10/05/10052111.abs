Title: One-dimensional Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Anton Alekseev and Pavel Mnev
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional toy version of the Chern-Simons theory. We construct its simplicial version which comprises features of a low-energy effective gauge theory and of a topological quantum field theory in the sense of Atiyah.
