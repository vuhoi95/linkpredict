Title: Phenomenological Aspects of Dirichlet Higgs Model from Extra-Dimension
Authors: Naoyuki Haba and Kin-ya Oda and Ryo Takahashi
Abstract: We study a simple five-dimensional extension of the Standard Model, compactified on a flat line segment in which there propagate Higgs and gauge bosons of the Standard Model. We impose a Dirichlet boundary condition on the Higgs field to realize its vacuum expectation value. Since a flat Nambu-Goldstone zero-mode of the bulk Higgs is eliminated by the Dirichlet boundary condition, a superposition of the Higgs Kaluza-Klein modes play the role of the Nambu-Goldstone boson except at the boundaries. We discuss phenomenology of our model at the LHC, namely the top Yukawa deviation and the production and decay of the physical Higgs field, as well as the constraints from the electroweak precision measurements.
