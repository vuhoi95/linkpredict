Title: The Hilbert Series of the One Instanton Moduli Space
Authors: Sergio Benvenuti and Amihay Hanany and Noppadol Mekareeya
Abstract: The moduli space of k G-instantons on R^4 for a classical gauge group G is known to be given by the Higgs branch of a supersymmetric gauge theory that lives on Dp branes probing D(p + 4) branes in Type II theories. For p = 3, these (3 + 1) dimensional gauge theories have N = 2 supersymmetry and can be represented by quiver diagrams. The F and D term equations coincide with the ADHM construction. The Hilbert series of the moduli spaces of one instanton for classical gauge groups is easy to compute and turns out to take a particularly simple form which is previously unknown. This allows for a G invariant character expansion and hence easily generalisable for exceptional gauge groups, where an ADHM construction is not known. The conjectures for exceptional groups are further checked using some new techniques like sewing relations in Hilbert Series. This is applied to Argyres-Seiberg dualities.
