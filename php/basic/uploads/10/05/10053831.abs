Abstract: We investigate the effects of (Curvature)$^{2}$- and (Torsion)$^{2}$- terms in the Einstein-Hilbert-Chern-Simons Lagrangian. The purposes are two-fold: (i) to show the efficacy of an orthogonal basis of degree-of-freedom projection operators recently proposed and to ascertain its adequacy for obtaining propagators of general parity-breaking gravity models in three dimensions; (ii) to analyze the role of the topological Chern-Simons term for the unitarity and the particle spectrum of the model squared-curvature terms in connection with dynamical torsion. Our conclusion is that the Chern-Simons term does not influence the unitarity conditions imposed on the parameters of the Lagrangian, but significantly modifies the particle spectrum.
