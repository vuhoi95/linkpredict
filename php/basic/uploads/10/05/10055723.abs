Title: Quantum Field Theory on quantized Bergman domain
Authors: Harald Grosse and Peter Pre≈°najder and Zhituo Wang
Abstract: We present an oscillator realization of discrete series representations of group SU(2,2). We give formulas for the coherent state star-product quantization of a Bergman domain $D$. A formulation of a (regularized) non-commutative scalar field on a quantized $D$ is given.
