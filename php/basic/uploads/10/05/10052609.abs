Title: The 1/N Expansion in Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: A. F. Ferrari and M. Gomes and C. A. Stechhahn
Abstract: We study the 1/N expansion in noncommutative quantum mechanics for the anharmonic and Coulombian potentials. The expansion for the anharmonic oscillator presented good convergence properties, but for the Coulombian potential, we found a divergent large N expansion when using the usual noncommutative generalization of the potential. We proposed a modified version of the noncommutative Coulombian potential which provides a well-behaved 1/N expansion.
