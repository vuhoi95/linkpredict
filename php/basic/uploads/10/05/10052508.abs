Title: Finite-Size Dyonic Giant Magnons in TsT-transformed $AdS_5\times S^5$
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Plamen Bozhilov
Abstract: We investigate dyonic giant magnons propagating on $\gamma$-deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$ by Neumann-Rosochatius reduction method with a twisted boundary condition. We compute finite-size effect of the dispersion relations of dyonic giant magnons which generalizes the previously known case of the giant magnons with one angular momentum found by Bykov and Frolov.
