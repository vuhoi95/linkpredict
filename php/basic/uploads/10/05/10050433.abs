Title: $Om$ Diagnostic for Dilaton Dark Energy
Authors: Z. G. Huang and H. Q. Lu
Abstract: $Om$ diagnostic can differentiate between different models of dark energy without the accurate current value of matter density. We apply this geometric diagnostic to dilaton dark energy(DDE) model and differentiate DDE model from LCDM. We also investigate the influence of coupled parameter $\alpha$ on the evolutive behavior of $Om$ with respect to redshift $z$. According to the numerical result of $Om$, we get the current value of equation of state $\omega_{\sigma0}$=-0.952 which fits the WMAP5+BAO+SN very well.
