Title: Hawking Radiation of Fermionic Field and Anomaly in 2+1 Dimensional  Black Holes
Authors: Ran Li and Shi Li and Ji-Rong Ren
Abstract: The method of anomaly cancellation to derive Hawking radiation initiated by Robinson and Wilczek is applied to 2+1 dimensional stationary black holes. Using the dimensional reduction technique, we find that the near-horizon physics for the fermionic field in the background of the general 2+1 dimensional stationary black hole can be approximated by an infinite collection of two component fermionic fields in 1+1 dimensional spacetime background coupled with dilaton field and U(1) gauge field. By restoring the gauge invariance and the general coordinate covariance for the reduced two dimensional theory, Hawking flux and temperature of black hole are obtained. We apply this method to two types of black holes in three dimensional spacetime, which are BTZ black hole in Einstein gravity and a rotating black hole in Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend (BHT) massive gravity.
