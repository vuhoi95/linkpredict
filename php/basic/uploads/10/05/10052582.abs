Title: A Note on Schwinger Mechanism and a Nonabelian Instability in a  Nonabelian Plasma
Authors: V. P. Nair and Alexandr Yelnikov
Abstract: We point out that there is a nonabelian instability for a nonabelian plasma which does not allow both for a net nonzero color charge and the existence of field configurations which are coherent over a volume $v$ whose size is determined by the chemical potential. The basic process which leads to this result is the Schwinger decay of chromoelectric fields, for the case where the field arises from commutators of constant potentials, rather than as the curl of spacetime dependent potentials. In terms of the fields, instability is obtained when Tr(DF)^2 > 0.
