Title: Cosmological diagrammatic rules
Authors: Steven B. Giddings and Martin S. Sloth
Abstract: A simple set of diagrammatic rules is formulated for perturbative evaluation of ``in-in" correlators, as is needed in cosmology and other nonequilibrium problems. These rules are both intuitive, and efficient for calculational purposes.
