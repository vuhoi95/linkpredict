Title: Non-topological Domain Walls in a Model with Broken Supersymmetry
Authors: Leonardo Campanelli and Marco Ruggieri
Abstract: We study non-topological, charged planar walls (Q-walls) in the context of a particle physics model with supersymmetry broken by low-energy gauge mediation. Analytical properties are derived within the flat-potential approximation for the flat-direction raising potential, while a numerical study is performed using the full two-loop supersymmetric potential. We analyze the energetics of finite-size Q-walls and compare them to Q-balls, non-topological solitons possessing spherical symmetry and arising in the same supersymmetric model. This allow us to draw a phase diagram in the charge-transverse length plane, which shows a region where Q-wall solutions are more stable than Q-balls.
