Title: Non-perturbative QEG Corrections to the Yang-Mills Beta Function
Authors: J. -E. Daum and U. Harst and M. Reuter
Abstract: We discuss the non-perturbative renormalization group evolution of the gauge coupling constant by using a truncated form of the functional flow equation for the effective average action of the Yang-Mills-gravity system. Our result is consistent with the conjecture that Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is asymptotically safe and has a vanishing gauge coupling constant at the non-trivial fixed point.
