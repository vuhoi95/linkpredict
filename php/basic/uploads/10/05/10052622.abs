Title: Color Sextet Scalars in Early LHC Experiments
Authors: Edmond L. Berger and Qing-Hong Cao and Chuan-Ren Chen and Gabe Shaughnessy and Hao Zhang
Abstract: We explore the potential for discovery of an exotic color sextet scalar in same-sign top quark pair production in early running at the LHC. We present the first phenomenological analysis at colliders of color sextet scalars with full top quark spin correlations included. We demonstrate that one can measure the scalar mass, the top quark polarization, and confirm the scalar resonance with 1 inverse fb of integrated luminosity. The top quark polarization can distinguish gauge triplet and singlet scalars.
