Abstract: Heavy fermion alloys at critical doping typically exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures, including a logarithmic or power law rise in the ratio of specific heat to temperature as the temperature is lowered. Anomalous specific heat of this type is also observed in a simple class of gravitational dual models that exhibit anisotropic scaling with dynamical critical exponent z > 1.
