Abstract: The quantum nonrelativistic spin-1/2 planar systems in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field are known to possess the N=2 supersymmetry. We consider such a system in the field of a magnetic vortex, and find that there are just two self-adjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian that are compatible with the standard N=2 supersymmetry. We show that only in these two cases one of the subsystems coincides with the original spinless Aharonov-Bohm model and comes accompanied by the super-partner Hamiltonian which allows a singular behavior of the wave functions. We find a family of additional, nonlocal integrals of motion and treat them together with local supercharges in the unifying framework of the tri-supersymmetry. The inclusion of the dynamical conformal symmetries leads to an infinitely generated superalgebra, that contains several representations of the superconformal osp(2|2) symmetry. We present the application of the results in the framework of the two-body model of identical anyons. The nontrivial contact interaction and the emerging N=2 linear and nonlinear supersymmetries of the anyons are discussed.
