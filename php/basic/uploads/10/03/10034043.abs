Title: Self-consistency in relativistic theory of infinite statistics fields
Authors: Chao Cao and Yi-Xin Chen and Jian-Long Li
Abstract: Infinite statistics in which all representations of the symmetric group can occur is known as a special case of quon theory. Our previous work has built a relativistic quantum field theory which allows interactions involving infinite statistics particles. In this paper, a more detailed analysis of this theory is available. Topics discussed include cluster decomposition, CPT symmetry and renormalization.
