Title: A note on black hole entropy, area spectrum, and evaporation
Authors: C. A. S. Silva and R. R. Landim
Abstract: We argue that a process where a fuzzy space splits in two others can be used to explain the origin of the black hole entropy, and why a "generalized second law of thermodynamics" appears to hold in the presence of black holes. We reach the Bekenstein-Hawking formula from the count of the microstates of a black hole modeled by a fuzzy space. In this approach, a discrete area spectrum for the black hole, which becomes increasingly spaced as the black hole approaches the Planck scale, is obtained. We show that, as a consequence of this, the black hole radiation becomes less and less entropic as the black hole evaporates, in a way that some information about its initial state could be recovered.
