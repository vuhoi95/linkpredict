Title: Non-thermal Leptogenesis in a simple 5D SO(10) GUT
Authors: Takeshi Fukuyama and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: We discuss the non-thermal leptogenesis in the scheme of 5D orbifold SO(10) GUT with the smooth hybrid inflation. With an unambiguously determined Dirac Yukawa couplings and an assumption for the neutrino mixing matrix of the tri-bimaximal from, we analyze baryon asymmetry of the universe via non-thermal leptogenesis in two typical cases for the light neutrino mass spectrum, the normal and inverted hierarchical cases. The resultant baryon asymmetry is obtained as a function of the lightest mass eigenvalue of the light neutrinos, and we find that a suitable amount of baryon asymmetry of the universe can be produced in the normal hierarchical case, while in the inverted hierarchical case the baryon asymmetry is too small to be consistent with the observation.
