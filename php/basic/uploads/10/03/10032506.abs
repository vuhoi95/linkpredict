Authors: R. Catenacci and M. Debernardi and P. A. Grassi and D. Matessi
Abstract: We present a study on the integral forms and their Cech/de Rham cohomology. We analyze the problem from a general perspective of sheaf theory and we explore examples in superprojective manifolds. Integral forms are fundamental in the theory of integration in supermanifolds. One can define the integral forms introducing a new sheaf containing, among other objects, the new basic forms delta(dtheta) where the symbol delta has the usual formal properties of Dirac's delta distribution and acts on functions and forms as a Dirac measure. They satisfy in addition some new relations on the sheaf. It turns out that the enlarged sheaf of integral and "ordinary" superforms contains also forms of "negative degree" and, moreover, due to the additional relations introduced, its cohomology is, in a non trivial way, different from the usual superform cohomology.
