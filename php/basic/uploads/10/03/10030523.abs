Title: Metastable Vacua in Superconformal SQCD-like Theories
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Luciano Girardello and Alberto Mariotti and Massimo Siani
Abstract: We study dynamical supersymmetry breaking in vector-like superconformal N=1 gauge theories. We find appropriate deformations of the superpotential to overcome the problem of the instability of the non supersymmetric vacuum. The request for long lifetime translates into constraints on the physical couplings which in this regime can be controlled through efficient RG analysis.
