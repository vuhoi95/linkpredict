Title: An Investigation of Hadronization Mechanism at $Z^{0}$ Factory
Authors: Yi Jin and Zongguo Si and Qubing Xie and Tao Yao
Abstract: We briefly review the hadronization pictures adopted in the LUND String Fragmentation Model(LSFM), Webber Cluster Fragmentation Model(WCFM) and Quark Combination Model(QCM), respectively. Predictions of hadron multiplicity, baryon to meson ratios and baryon-antibaryon flavor correlations, especially related to heavy hadrons at $Z^0$ factory obtained by LSFM and QCM are reported.
