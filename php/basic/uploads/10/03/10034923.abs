Title: Noncommutative Thermofield Dynamics
Authors: Marcelo L. Costa and Amilcar R. Queiroz and Ademir E. Santana
Abstract: The real-time operator formalism for thermal quantum field theories, thermofield dynamics, is formulated in terms of a path-integral approach in non-commutative spaces. As an application, the two-point function for a thermal non-commutative $\lambda \phi^4$ theory is derived at the one-loop level. The effect of temperature and the non-commutative parameter, competing with one another, is analyzed.
