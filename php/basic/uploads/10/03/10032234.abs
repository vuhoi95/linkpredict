Title: Quaternionic Kaehler Detour Complexes & N=2 Supersymmetric Black Holes
Authors: David Cherney and Emanuele Latini and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric spinning particle models derived from the radial quantization of stationary, spherically symmetric black holes of four dimensional N= 2 supergravities. By virtue of the c-map, these spinning particles move in quaternionic Kaehler manifolds. Their spinning degrees of freedom describe mini-superspace-reduced supergravity fermions. We quantize these models using BRST detour complex technology. The construction of a nilpotent BRST charge is achieved by using local (worldline) supersymmetry ghosts to generating special holonomy transformations. (An interesting byproduct of the construction is a novel Dirac operator on the superghost extended Hilbert space.) The resulting quantized models are gauge invariant field theories with fields equaling sections of special quaternionic vector bundles. They underly and generalize the quaternionic version of Dolbeault cohomology discovered by Baston. In fact, Baston's complex is related to the BPS sector of the models we write down. Our results rely on a calculus of operators on quaternionic Kaehler manifolds that follows from BRST machinery, and although directly motivated by black hole physics, can be broadly applied to any model relying on quaternionic geometry.
