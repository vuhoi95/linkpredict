Title: Background independent quantization and the uncertainty principle
Authors: Golam Mortuza Hossain and Viqar Husain and Sanjeev S. Seahra
Abstract: It is shown that polymer quantization leads to a modified uncertainty principle similar to that obtained from string theory and non-commutative geometry. When applied to quantum field theory on general background spacetimes, corrections to the uncertainty principle acquire a metric dependence. For Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology this translates to a scale factor dependence which gives a large effect in the early universe.
