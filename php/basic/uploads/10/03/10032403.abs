Title: Monodromy and Jacobi-like Relations for Color-Ordered Amplitudes
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Poul H. Damgaard and Thomas Sondergaard and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We discuss monodromy relations between different color-ordered amplitudes in gauge theories. We show that Jacobi-like relations of Bern, Carrasco and Johansson can be introduced in a manner that is compatible with these monodromy relations. The Jacobi-like relations are not the most general set of equations that satisfy this criterion. Applications to supergravity amplitudes follow straightforwardly through the KLT-relations. We explicitly show how the tree-level relations give rise to non-trivial identities at loop level.
