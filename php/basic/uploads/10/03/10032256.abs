Title: Exact quasinormal modes for a special class of black holes
Authors: Julio Oliva and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: Analytic exact expressions for the quasinormal modes of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations around a special class of black holes are found in d\ge3 dimensions. It is shown that, the size of the black hole provides a bound for the angular momentum of the perturbation. Quasinormal modes appear when this bound is fulfilled, otherwise the excitations become purely damped.
