Title: O-BTZ: Orientifolded BTZ Black Hole
Authors: F. Loran and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes are constructed by orbifolding AdS3 geometry by boost transformations of its O(2,2) isometry group. Here we construct a new class of solutions to AdS3 Einstein gravity, orientifolded BTZ or O-BTZ for short, which in general, besides the usual BTZ orbifolding, involve orbifolding (orientifolding) by a Z_2 part of O(2,2) isometry group. This Z_2 is chosen such that it changes the orientation on AdS3 while keeping the orientation on its 2D conformal boundary. O-BTZ solutions exhaust all un-oriented AdS3 black hole solutions, as BTZ black holes constitute all oriented AdS3 black holes. O-BTZ, similarly to BTZ black holes, are stationary, axisymmetric asymptotically AdS3 geometries with two asymptotic charges, mass and angular momentum..
