Title: Towards the MSSM from F-theory
Authors: Kang-Sin Choi and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Abstract: We study the MSSM in F-theory. Its group is the commutant to a structure group SU(5) x U(1)_Y of a gauge bundle in E_8. The spectrum contains three generations of quarks and leptons plus vectorlike electroweak and colored Higgses. The minimal MSSM Yukawa couplings with matter parity is obtained at the renormalizable level.
