Title: SU(2|2) for Theories with Sixteen Supercharges at Weak and Strong  Coupling
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal and Donovan Young
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reductions of N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R x S^3 to the three-dimensional theory on R x S^2, the orbifolded theory on R x S^3/Z_k, and the plane-wave matrix model. With explicit emphasis on the three-dimensional theory, we demonstrate the realization of the SU(2|3) algebra in a radial Hamiltonian framework. Using this structure we constrain the form of the spin chains, their S-matrices, and the corresponding one- and two-loop Hamiltonian of the three dimensional theory and find putative signs of integrability up to the two-loop order. The string duals of these theories admit the IIA plane-wave geometry as their Penrose limit. Using known results for strings quantized on this background, we explicitly construct the strong-coupling dual extended SU(2|2) algebra and discuss its implications for the gauge theories.
