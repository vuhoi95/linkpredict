Abstract: A so-called "entropy-corrected holographic dark energy" (ECHDE), was recently proposed to explain the dark energy-dominated universe with the help of quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation in the setup of loop quantum cosmology. Using this new definition, we investigate its thermodynamical features including entropy and energy conservation. We describe the thermodynamical interpretation of the interaction between ECHDE and dark matter in a non-flat universe. We obtain a relation between the interaction term of the dark components and thermal fluctuation. Our study further generalizes the earlier works [M.R. Setare and E.C. Vagenas, Phys. Lett. B 666 (2008) 111; B. Wang et al., Phys. Lett. B 662 (2008) 1] in this direction.
