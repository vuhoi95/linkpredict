Authors: Yongqing Huang and Anzhong Wang and Qiang Wu
Abstract: The stability of de Sitter spacetime in Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity with projectability but without detailed balance condition is studied. It is found that, in contrast to the case of the Minkowski background, the spin-0 graviton now is stable for any given $\xi$, and free of ghost for $\xi \le 0$ in the infrared limit, where $\xi$ is the dynamical coupling constant.
