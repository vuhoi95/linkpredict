Title: New Model of Inflation with Non-minimal Derivative Coupling of Standard  Model Higgs Boson to Gravity
Authors: Cristiano Germani and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: In this letter we show that there is a unique non-minimal derivative coupling of the Standard Model Higgs boson to gravity such that: it propagates no more degrees of freedom than General Relativity sourced by a scalar field, reproduces a successful inflating background within the Standard Model Higgs parameters and, finally, does not suffer from dangerous quantum corrections.
