Title: Ultradistributions and The Fractionary Schr√∂dinger Equation
Authors: A. L. De Paoli and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the results of Naber about the Fractionary Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with the use of the theory of Tempered Ultradistributions. Several examples of the use of this theory are given. In particular we evaluate the Green's function for a free particle in the general case.
