Title: Warped anti-de Sitter spaces from brane intersections in type II string  theory
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Linda I. Uruchurtu
Abstract: We consider explicit type II string constructions of backgrounds containing warped and squashed anti de Sitter spaces. These are obtained via T duality from brane intersections including dyonic black strings, plane waves and monopoles. We also study the supersymmetry of these solutions and discuss special values of the deformation parameters.
