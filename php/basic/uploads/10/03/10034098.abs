Abstract: We present the new agegraphic dark energy model by introducing the quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation in the setup of loop quantum gravity. Employing this new form of dark energy, we investigate the model of interacting dark energy and derive its equation of state. We study the correspondence between the tachyon, K-essence and dilaton scalar field models with the interacting entropy-corrected new agegraphic dark energy model in the non-flat FRW universe. Moreover, we reconstruct the corresponding scalar potentials which describe the dynamics of the scalar field models.
