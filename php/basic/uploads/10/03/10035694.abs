Title: Nonperturbative Tests of Three-Dimensional Dualities
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Brian Willett and Itamar Yaakov
Abstract: We test several conjectural dualities between strongly coupled superconformal field theories in three dimensions by computing their exact partition functions on a three-sphere as a function of Fayet-Iliopoulos and mass parameters. The calculation is carried out using localization of the path integral and the matrix model previously derived for superconformal N = 2 gauge theories. We verify that the partition functions of quiver theories related by mirror symmetry agree provided the mass parameters and the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters are exchanged, as predicted. We carry out a similar calculation for the mirror of N = 8 super-Yang-Mills theory and show that its partition function agrees with that of the ABJM theory at unit Chern-Simons level. This provides a nonperturbative test of the conjectural equivalence of the two theories in the conformal limit.
