Title: Augmented Recursion For One-loop Gravity Amplitudes
Authors: David C. Dunbar and James H. Ettle and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We present a semi-recursive method for calculating the rational parts of one-loop gravity amplitudes which utilises axial gauge diagrams to determine the non-factorising pieces of the amplitude. This method is used to compute the one-loop amplitudes M(1-,2+,3+,4+,5+) and M(1-,2+,3+,4+,5+,6+).
