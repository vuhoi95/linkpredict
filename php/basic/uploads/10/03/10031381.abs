Title: Chern-Simons black holes: scalar perturbations, mass and area spectrum  and greybody factors
Authors: Pablo Gonzalez and Eleftherios Papantonopoulos and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: We study the Chern-Simons black holes in d-dimensions and we calculate analytically the quasi-normal modes of the scalar perturbations and we show that they depend on the highest power of curvature present in the Chern-Simons theory. We obtain the mass and area spectrum of these black holes and we show that they have a strong dependence on the topology of the transverse space and they are not evenly spaced. We also calculate analytically the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absorption cross section and we show that at low frequency limit there is a range of modes which contributes to the absorption cross section.
