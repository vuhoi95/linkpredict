Title: Quantum and pseudoclassical descriptions of nonrelativistic spinning  particles in noncommutative space
Authors: T. C. Adorno and M. C. Baldiotti and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: We construct a nonrelativistic wave equation for spinning particles in the noncommutative space (in a sense, a $\theta$-modification of the Pauli equation). To this end, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of the $\theta$-modified Dirac equation. To complete the consideration, we present a pseudoclassical model (\`a la Berezin-Marinov) for the corresponding nonrelativistic particle in the noncommutative space. To justify the latter model, we demonstrate that its quantization leads to the $\theta$-modified Pauli equation. Then, we extract $\theta$-modified interaction between a nonrelativistic spin and a magnetic field from the $\theta$-modified Pauli equation and construct a $\theta$-modification of the Heisenberg model for two coupled spins placed in an external magnetic field. In the framework of such a model, we calculate the probability transition between two orthogonal EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) states for a pair of spins in an oscillatory magnetic field and show that some of such transitions, which are forbidden in the commutative space, are possible due to the space noncommutativity.
