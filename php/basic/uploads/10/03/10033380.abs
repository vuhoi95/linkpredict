Abstract: The low-energy quasi-excitations in graphene are known to be described as Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Adopting field-theoretical approach we investigate the interaction of these quasi-particles with 3+1 dimensional electromagnetic field focusing on the optical properties of suspended graphene layers and their Casimir interaction with ideal conductor. The magnitude of predicted effects (the rotation of polarization of light and the Casimir force) appears to be well within modern experimental capabilities.
