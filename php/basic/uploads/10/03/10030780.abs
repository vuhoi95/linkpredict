Title: Consistency of field-theoretical and kinetic calculations of viscous  transport coefficients for a relativistic fluid
Authors: Gabriel S. Denicol and Xu-Guang Huang and Tomoi Koide and Dirk H. Rischke
Abstract: The transport coefficients of causal relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics are calculated both in a field-theoretical and a kinetic approach. We find that the results from the traditional kinetic calculation by Israel and Stewart are modified. The new expressions for the viscous transport coefficients agree with the results obtained in the field-theoretical approach when the contributions from pair creation and annihilation are neglected.
