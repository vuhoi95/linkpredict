Title: Surface gravity and Hawking temperature from entropic force viewpoint
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Myungseok Eune and Kyoungtae Kimm and Daeho Lee
Abstract: We consider a freely falling holographic screen for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes and evaluate the entropic force \`a la Verlinde. When the screen crosses the event horizon, the temperature of the screen agrees to the Hawking temperature and the entropic force gives rise to the surface gravity for both of the black holes.
