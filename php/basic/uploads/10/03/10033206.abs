Title: Wiggles in the cosmic microwave background radiation: echoes from  non-singular cyclic-inflation
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Anupam Mazumdar and Arman Shafieloo
Abstract: In this paper we consider a unique model of inflation where the universe undergoes rapid asymmetric oscillations, each cycle lasting millions of Planck time. Over many-many cycles the space-time expands to mimic the standard inflationary scenario. Moreover, these rapid oscillations leave a distinctive periodic signature in ln(k) in the primordial power spectrum, where k denotes the comoving scale. The best fit parameters of the cyclic-inflation model provides a very good fit to the 7-year WMAP data.
