Title: Looking for a Matrix model of ABJM
Authors: Asadig Mohammed and Jeff Murugan and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: Encouraged by the recent construction of fuzzy sphere solutions in the ABJM theory, we re-analyze the latter from the perspective of a Matrix-like model. In particular, we argue that a vortex solution exhibits properties of a supergraviton, while a kink represents a 2-brane. Other solutions are also consistent with the Matrix-type interpretation. We study vortex scattering and compare with graviton scattering in the massive ABJM background, however our results are inconclusive. We speculate on how to extend our results to construct a Matrix theory of ABJM.
