Title: On QCD and Effective Locality
Authors: H. M. Fried and M. Gattobigio and T. Grandou and Y. -M. Sheu
Abstract: In a recent paper it was shown how quark scattering in a quenched, eikonal model led to a momentum-transfer dependent amplitude expressed in terms of Halpern's functional integral; and how the requirement of manifest gauge invariance converted that functional integral into a local integral, capable of being evaluated with precision by a finite set of numerical integrations. We here prove that this property of "effective locality" holds true for all quark processes, without approximation and without exception.
