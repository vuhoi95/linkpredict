Title: Holographic superconductors in a model of non-relativistic gravity
Authors: M. R. Setare and Davood Momeni and N. Majd
Abstract: We have studied holographic superconductors with spherical symmetry in the Ho$\check{\textbf{r}}$ava-Lifshitz gravity by using a semi analytical method, and also we have calculated the critical temperature and shown when the condensation will appear in a similar pattern as in the Einstein-Gauss- Bonnet gravity. We have computed the dependency of the conductivity as a function of frequency in this new non-relativistic model of quantum gravity.
