Title: Coupled inflaton and electromagnetic fields from Gravitoelectromagnetic  Inflation with Lorentz and Feynman gauges
Authors: Federico Agustin Membiela and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Using a semiclassical approach to Gravitoelectromagnetic Inflation (GEMI), we study the origin and evolution of seminal inflaton and electromagnetic fields in the early inflationary universe from a 5D vacuum state. We use simultaneously the Lorentz and Feynman gauges. Our formalism is naturally not conformal invariant on the effective 4D de Sitter metric, which make possible the super adiabatic amplification of electric and magnetic field modes during the early inflationary epoch of the universe on cosmological scales. This is the first time that solutions for the electric field fluctuations are investigated in a systematic way as embeddings for inflationary models in 4D. An important and new result here obtained is that the spectrum of the electric field fluctuations depend with the scale, such that the spectral index increases quadratically as the scale decreases.
