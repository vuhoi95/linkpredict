Title: Universal Kaluza-Klein reductions of type IIB to N=4 supergravity in  five dimensions
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Oscar Varela
Abstract: We construct explicit consistent Kaluza-Klein reductions of type IIB supergravity on HK_4 x S^1, where HK_4 is an arbitrary four-dimensional hyper-Kaehler manifold, and on SE5, an arbitrary five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold. In the former case we obtain the bosonic action of D=5 N=4 (ungauged) supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets. For the SE_5 case we extend a known reduction, which leads to minimal D=5 N=2 gauged supergravity, to also include a multiplet of massive fields, containing the breathing mode of the SE_5. We show that the resulting D=5 action is also consistent with N=4 gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets. This theory has a supersymmetric AdS_5 vacuum, which uplifts to the class of supersymmetric AdS_5 x SE_5 solutions, that spontaneously breaks N=4 to N=2, and also a non-supersymmetric AdS_5 vacuum which uplifts to a class of solutions first found by Romans.
