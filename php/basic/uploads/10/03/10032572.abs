Title: Affect of brane thickness on microscopic tidal-charged black holes
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Benjamin Harms and Octavian Micu
Abstract: We study the phenomenological implications stemming from the dependence of the tidal charge on the brane thickness $L$ for the evaporation and decay of microscopic black holes. In general, the larger $L$, the longer are the black hole life-times and the greater their maximum mass for those cases in which the black hole can grow. In particular, we again find that tidal-charged black holes might live long enough to escape the detectors and even the gravitational field of the Earth, thus resulting in large amounts of missing energy. However, under no circumstances could TeV-scale black holes grow enough to enter the regime of Bondi accretion.
