Title: Newton's Equation on the kappa space-time and the Kepler problem
Authors: E. Harikumar and A. K. Kapoor
Abstract: We study the modification of Newton's second law, upto first order in the deformation parameter $a$, in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive the deformed Hamiltonian, expressed in terms of the commutative phase space variables, describing the particle moving in a central potential in the $\kappa$-space-time. Using this, we find the modified equations of motion and show that there is an additional force along the radial direction. Using Pioneer anomaly data, we set a bond as well as fix the sign of $a$. We also analyse the violation of equivalence principle predicted by the modified Newton's equation, valid up to first order in $a$ and use this also to set an upper bound on $a$.
