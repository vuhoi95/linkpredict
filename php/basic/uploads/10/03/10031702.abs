Title: The Two-Loop Hexagon Wilson Loop in N = 4 SYM
Authors: Vittorio Del Duca and Claude Duhr and Vladimir A. Smirnov
Abstract: In the planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the conformal symmetry constrains multi-loop n-edged Wilson loops to be given in terms of the one-loop n-edged Wilson loop, augmented, for n greater than 6, by a function of conformally invariant cross ratios. That function is termed the remainder function. In a recent paper, we have displayed the first analytic computation of the two-loop six-edged Wilson loop, and thus of the corresponding remainder function. Although the calculation was performed in the quasi-multi-Regge kinematics of a pair along the ladder, the Regge exactness of the six-edged Wilson loop in those kinematics entails that the result is the same as in general kinematics. We show in detail how the most difficult of the integrals is computed, which contribute to the six-edged Wilson loop. Finally, the remainder function is given as a function of uniform transcendental weight four in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. We consider also some asymptotic values of the remainder function, and the value when all the cross ratios are equal.
