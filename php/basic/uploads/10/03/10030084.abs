Title: Approximate R-symmetries and the mu term
Authors: Felix Brummer and Rolf Kappl and Michael Ratz and Kai Schmidt-Hoberg
Abstract: We discuss the role of approximate U(1)_R symmetries for the understanding of hierarchies in Nature. Such symmetries may explain a suppressed expectation value of the superpotential and provide us with a solution to the MSSM mu problem. We present various examples in field theory and string-derived models.
