Title: BRST Lagrangian construction for spin-3/2 field in Einstein space
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. A. Krykhtin
Abstract: We explore a hidden possibility of BRST approach to higher spin field theory to obtain a consistent Lagrangian for massive spin-3/2 field in Einstein space. Also, we prove that in the space under consideration the propagation of spin-3/2 field is hyperbolic and causal.
