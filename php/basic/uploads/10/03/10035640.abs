Title: Imperfect fluids, Lorentz violations and Finsler Cosmology
Authors: A. P. Kouretsis and M. Stathakopoulos and P. C. Stavrinos
Abstract: We construct a cosmological toy model based on a Finslerian structure of space-time. In particular, we are interested in a specific Finslerian Lorentz violating theory based on a curved version of Cohen and Glashow's Very Special Relativity. The osculation of a Finslerian manifold to a Riemannian leads to the limit of Relativistic Cosmology, for a specified observer. A modified flat FRW cosmology is produced. The analogue of a zero energy particle unfolds some special properties of the dynamics. The kinematical equations of motion are affected by local anisotropies. Seeds of Lorentz Violations may trigger density inhomogeneities to the cosmological fluid.
