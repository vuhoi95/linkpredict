Title: Paired quantum Hall states on noncommutative two-tori
Authors: Vincenzo Marotta and Adele Naddeo
Abstract: By exploiting the notion of Morita equivalence for field theories on noncommutative tori and choosing rational values of the noncommutativity parameter theta (in appropriate units), a one-to-one correspondence between an abelian noncommutative field theory (NCFT) and a non-abelian theory of twisted fields on ordinary space can be established. Starting from this general result, we focus on the conformal field theory (CFT) describing a quantum Hall fluid (QHF) at paired states fillings nu =m/pm+2, recently obtained by means of m-reduction procedure, and show that it is the Morita equivalent of a NCFT. In this way we extend the construction proposed in a previous work (V. Marotta, A. Naddeo, Nucl. Phys. B 810(2009) 575) for the Jain series nu =m/2pm+1. The case m=2 is explicitly discussed and the role of noncommutativity in the physics of quantum Hall bilayers is emphasized. Our results represent a step forward the construction of a new effective low energy description of certain condensed matter phenomena and help to clarify the relationship between noncommutativity and quantum Hall fluids.
