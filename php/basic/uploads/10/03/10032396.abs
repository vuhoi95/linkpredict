Title: Monodromy and Kawai-Lewellen-Tye Relations for Gravity Amplitudes
Authors: N. E. J. Bjerrum-Bohr and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We are still learning intriguing new facets of the string theory motivated Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations linking products of amplitudes in Yang-Mills theories and amplitudes in gravity. This is very clearly displayed in computations of N=8 supergravity where the perturbative expansion show a vast number of similarities to that of N=4 super-Yang-Mills. We will here investigate how identities based on monodromy relations for Yang-Mills amplitudes can be very useful for organizing and further streamlining the KLT relations yielding even more compact results for gravity amplitudes.
