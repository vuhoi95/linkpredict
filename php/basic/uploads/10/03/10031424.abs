Title: Neutron-Antineutron Oscillations in a Warped Extra Dimension
Authors: Peter T. Winslow and John N. Ng
Abstract: We investigate neutron-antineutron oscillations in the Randall-Sundrum warped extra dimensional scenario. The four dimensional effective strengths of the relevant operators that induce the oscillations are calculated up to an arbitrary coupling along with their corresponding enhancements due to QCD 1-loop running effects. We find that the $\Delta B = 2$ operators can be geometrically suppressed without fine tuning to within current experimental limits with a warped down four dimensional mass scale which can be as low as a fraction of a TeV.
