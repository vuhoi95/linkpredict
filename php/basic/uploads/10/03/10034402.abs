Title: Breathing Vacuum Bubbles in Five-Dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Feng-Li Lin and Chien-Hsun Wang and Chen-Pin Yeh
Abstract: We study the dynamics of bubble wall in five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the thin-wall approximation. The motion of the domain wall is determined by the generalized Israel junction condition. We find a solution where the wall of true vacuum bubble is oscillating, the breathing bubbles. We briefly comment on how this breathing vacuum bubble can affect the analysis of the string theory landscape.
