Title: Chern-Simons matrix models, two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory and the  Sutherland model
Authors: Richard J. Szabo and Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We derive some new relationships between matrix models of Chern-Simons gauge theory and of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We show that q-integration of the Stieltjes-Wigert matrix model is the discrete matrix model that describes q-deformed Yang-Mills theory on the 2-sphere. We demonstrate that the semiclassical limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model is equivalent to the Gross-Witten model in the weak coupling phase. We study the strong coupling limit of the unitary Chern-Simons matrix model and show that it too induces the Gross-Witten model, but as a first order deformation of Dyson's circular ensemble. We show that the Sutherland model is intimately related to Chern-Simons gauge theory on the 3-sphere, and hence to q-deformed Yang-Mills theory on the 2-sphere. In particular, the ground state wavefunction of the Sutherland model in its classical equilibrium configuration describes the Chern-Simons free energy. The correspondence is extended to Wilson line observables and to arbitrary simply-laced gauge groups.
