Title: Lorentz symmetry from a random Hamiltonian
Authors: Andreas Albrecht and Alberto Iglesias
Abstract: We match the density of energy eigenstates of a local field theory with that of a random Hamiltonian order by order in a Taylor expansion. In our previous work we assumed Lorentz symmetry of the field theory, which entered through the dispersion relation. Here we extend that work to consider a generalized dispersion relation and show that the Lorentz symmetric case is preferred, in that the Lorentz symmetric dispersion relation gives a better approximation to a random Hamiltonian than the other local dispersion relations we considered.
