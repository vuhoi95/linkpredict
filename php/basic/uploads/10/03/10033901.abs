Title: Do Evaporating 4D Black Holes Form Photospheres and/or Chromospheres?
Authors: Jane H. MacGibbon and B. J. Carr and D. N. Page
Abstract: Several authors have claimed that the observable Hawking emission from a microscopic black hole is significantly modified by the formation of a photosphere or chromosphere around the black hole due to QED or QCD interactions between the emitted particles. Analyzing these models we identify a number of physical and geometrical effects which invalidate them. In all cases, we find that the observational signatures of a cosmic or Galactic background of black holes or an individual black hole remain essentially those of the standard Hawking model, with little change to the detection probability.
