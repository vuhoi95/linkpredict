Title: Stabilizing All Kahler Moduli in Type IIB Orientifolds
Authors: Konstantin Bobkov and Volker Braun and Piyush Kumar and Stuart Raby
Abstract: We describe a simple and robust mechanism that stabilizes all Kahler moduli in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. This is shown to be possible with just one non-perturbative contribution to the superpotential coming from either a D3-instanton or D7-branes wrapped on an ample divisor. This moduli-stabilization mechanism is similar to and motivated by the one used in the fluxless G_2 compactifications of M-theory. After explaining the general idea, explicit examples of Calabi-Yau orientifolds with one and three Kahler moduli are worked out. We find that the stabilized volumes of all two- and four-cycles as well as the volume of the Calabi-Yau manifold are controlled by a single parameter, namely, the volume of the ample divisor. This feature would dramatically constrain any realistic models of particle physics embedded into such compactifications. Broad consequences for phenomenology are discussed, in particular the dynamical solution to the strong CP-problem within the framework.
