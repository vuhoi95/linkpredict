Title: Various forms of BRST symmetry in Abelian 2-form gauge theory
Authors: Sumit Kumar Rai and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We derive the various forms of BRST symmetry using Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach in the case of Abelian 2-form gauge theory. We show that the so-called dual BRST symmetry is not an independent symmetry but the generalization of BRST symmetry obtained from the canonical transformation in the bosonic and ghost sector. We further obtain the new forms of both BRST and dual-BRST symmetry by making a general transformation in the Lagrange multipliers of the bosonic and ghost sector of the theory.
