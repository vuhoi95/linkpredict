Title: Crossing of Phantom Divide in $F(R)$ Gravity
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Chao-Qiang Geng and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: An explicit model of $F(R)$ gravity with realizing a crossing of the phantom divide is reconstructed. In particular, it is shown that the Big Rip singularity may appear in the reconstructed model of $F(R)$ gravity. Such a Big Rip singularity could be avoided by adding $R^2$ term or non-singular viable $F(R)$ theory to the model because phantom behavior becomes transient.
