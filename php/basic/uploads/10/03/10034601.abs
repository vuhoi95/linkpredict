Title: Nonabelian Bosonic Currents in Cosmic Strings
Authors: Marc Lilley and Fabrizio Di Marco and Jerome Martin and Patrick Peter
Abstract: A nonabelian generalization of the neutral Witten current-carrying string model is discussed in which the bosonic current-carrier belongs to a two dimensional representation of SU(2). We find that the current-carrying solutions can be of three different kinds: either the current spans a U(1) subgroup, and in which case one is left with an abelian current-carrying string, or the three currents are all lightlike, travelling in the same direction (only left or right movers). The third, genuinely nonabelian situation, cannot be handled within a cylindrically symmetric framework, but can be shown to depend on all possible string Lorentz invariant quantities that can be constructed out of the phase gradients.
