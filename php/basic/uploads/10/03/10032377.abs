Title: An AdS/QCD model from Sen's tachyon action
Authors: Ioannis Iatrakis and Elias Kiritsis and Angel Paredes
Abstract: We construct a new, simple phenomenological model along the lines of AdS/QCD. The essential new ingredient is the brane-antibrane effective action including the open string tachyon proposed by Sen. Chiral symmetry breaking happens because of tachyon dynamics. We fit a large number of low-spin meson masses at the 10%-15% level. The only free parameters involved in the fits correspond to the overall QCD-scale and the quark masses. Several aspects of previous models are qualitatively improved.
