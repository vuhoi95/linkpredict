Title: The Overall Coefficient of the Two-loop Superstring Amplitude Using Pure  Spinors
Authors: Humberto Gomez and Carlos R. Mafra
Abstract: Using the results recently obtained for computing integrals over (non-minimal) pure spinor superspace, we compute the coefficient of the massless two-loop four-point amplitude from first principles. Contrasting with the mathematical difficulties in the RNS formalism where unknown normalizations of chiral determinant formulae force the two-loop coefficient to be determined only indirectly through factorization, the computation in the pure spinor formalism can be smoothly carried out.
