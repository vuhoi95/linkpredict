Title: Conserved charges in 3D gravity
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: The covariant canonical expression for the conserved charges, proposed by Nester, is tested on several solutions in 3D gravity with or without torsion and topologically massive gravity. In each of these cases, the calculated values of energy-momentum and angular momentum are found to satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics.
