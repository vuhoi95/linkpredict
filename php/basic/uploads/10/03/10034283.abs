Title: Type IIB supergravity on squashed Sasaki-Einstein manifolds
Authors: Davide Cassani and Gianguido Dall'Agata and Anton F. Faedo
Abstract: We provide a consistent N=4 Kaluza-Klein truncation of type IIB supergravity on general 5-dimensional squashed Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. Our reduction ansatz keeps all and only the supergravity modes dual to the universal gauge sector of the associated conformal theories, via the gauge/gravity correspondence. The reduced 5-dimensional model displays remarkable features: it includes both zero-modes as well as massive iterations of the Kaluza-Klein operators on the internal manifold; it contains tensor fields dual to vectors charged under a non-abelian gauge group; it has a scalar potential with a non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum in addition to the supersymmetric one.
