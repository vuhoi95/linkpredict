Title: Intermediate inflation in Gauss-Bonnet braneworld
Authors: Ramon Herrera and Nelson Videla
Abstract: In this article we study an intermediate inflationary universe models using the Gauss-Bonnet brane. General conditions required for these models to be realizable are derived and discussed. We use recent astronomical observations to constraint the parameters appearing in the model.
