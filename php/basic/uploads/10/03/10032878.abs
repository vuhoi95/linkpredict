Title: Holographic interpretation of two-dimensional O(N) models coupled to  quantum gravity
Authors: Wolfhard Janke and Adriaan M. J. Schakel
Abstract: Various two-dimensional O(N) models coupled to Euclidean quantum gravity, whose intrinsic dimension is four, are shown to belong to universality classes of nongravitating statistical models in a lower number of dimensions. It is speculated that the matching critical behaviors in the gravitating and dimensionally reduced models may be manifestations of the holographic principle.
