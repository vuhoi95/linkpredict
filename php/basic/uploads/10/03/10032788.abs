Title: A New Type of Dark Energy Model
Authors: Yi Zhang and Hui Li
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general form of the equation of state (EoS) which is the function of the fractional dark energy density $\Omega_{d}$. At least, five related models, the cosmological constant model, the holographic dark energy model, the agegraphic dark energy model, the modified holographic dark energy model and the Ricci scalar holographic dark energy model are included in this form. Furthermore, if we consider proper interactions, the interactive variants of those models can be included as well. The phase-space analysis shows that the scaling solutions may exist both in the non-interacting and interacting cases. And the stability analysis of the system could give out the attractor solution which could alleviate the coincidence problem.
