Title: Quantum phase transitions in holographic models of magnetism and  superconductors
Authors: Nabil Iqbal and Hong Liu and MÃ¡rk Mezei and Qimiao Si
Abstract: We study a holographic model realizing an "antiferromagnetic" phase in which a global SU(2) symmetry representing spin is broken down to a U(1) by the presence of a finite electric charge density. This involves the condensation of a neutral scalar field in a charged AdS black hole. We observe that the phase transition for both neutral and charged (as in the standard holographic superconductor) order parameters can be driven to zero temperature by a tuning of the UV conformal dimension of the order parameter, resulting in a quantum phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. We also characterize the antiferromagnetic phase and an externally forced ferromagnetic phase by showing that they contain the expected spin waves with linear and quadratic dispersions respectively.
