Title: Polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering Off the "Neutron" From Gauge/String  Duality
Authors: Jian-Hua Gao and Zong-Gang Mou
Abstract: We investigate deep inelastic scattering off the polarized "neutron" using gauge/string duality. The "neutron" corresponds to a supergravity mode of the neutral dilatino. Through introducing the Pauli interaction term into the action in $\textrm{AdS}_{5}$ space, we calculate the polarized deep inelastic structure functions of the "neutron" in supergravity approximation at large t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$ and finite $x$ with $\lambda^{-1/2}\ll x<1$. In comparison with the charged dilatino "proton," which has been obtained in the previous work by Gao and Xiao, we find the structure functions of the "neutron" are power suppressed at the same order as the ones of the "proton." Especially, we find the Burkhardt-Cottingham-like sum rule, which is satisfied in the work by Gao and Xiao, is broken due to the Pauli interaction term. We also illustrate how such a Pauli interaction term can arise naturally from higher dimensional fermion-graviton coupling through the usual Kaluza-Klein reduction.
