Title: Emergent Gravity at a Lifshitz Point from a Bose Liquid on the Lattice
Authors: Cenke Xu and Petr Horava
Abstract: We propose a model with quantum bosons on the fcc lattice, which has a stable algebraic Bose liquid phase at low energy. We show that this phase is described by emergent quantum gravity at the Gaussian z = 3 Lifshitz fixed point in 3+1 dimensions. The stability of this algebraic Bose liquid phase is guaranteed by the gauge symmetry of gravitons and self-duality of the low energy field theory. By tuning one parameter in the lattice boson model we can drive a phase transition between the z = 3 Lifshitz gravity and another algebraic Bose liquid phase, described by gravity at the z = 2 Lifshitz point.
