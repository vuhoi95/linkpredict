Title: On entanglement in neutrino mixing and oscillations
Authors: M. Blasone and F. Dell'Anno and S. De Siena and F. Illuminati
Abstract: We report on recent results about entanglement in the context of particle mixing and oscillations. We study in detail single-particle entanglement arising in two-flavor neutrino mixing. The analysis is performed first in the context of Quantum Mechanics, and then for the case of Quantum Field Theory.
