Title: Dynamics of tachyon field in spatially curved FRW universe
Authors: Jian-Li Li and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: The dynamics of a tachyon field plus a barotropic fluid is investigated in spatially curved FRW universe. We perform a phase-plane analysis and obtain scaling solutions accompanying with a discussion on their stability. Furthermore, we construct the form of scalar potential which may give rise to stable solutions for spatially open and closed universe separately.
