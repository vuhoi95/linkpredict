Title: Statistical Origin of Gravity
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: Starting from the definition of entropy used in statistical mechanics we show that it is proportional to the gravity action. For a stationary black hole this entropy is expressed as $S = E/ 2T$, where $T$ is the Hawking temperature and $E$ is shown to be the Komar energy. This relation is also compatible with the generalised Smarr formula for mass.
