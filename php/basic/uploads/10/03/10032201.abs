Title: Entanglement of two qubits in a relativistic orbit
Authors: Jason Doukas and Benedict Carson
Abstract: The creation and destruction of entanglement between a pair of interacting two-level detectors accelerating about diametrically opposite points of a circular path is investigated. It is found that any non-zero acceleration has the effect of suppressing the vacuum entanglement and enhancing the acceleration radiation thereby reducing the entangling capacity of the detectors. Given that for large accelerations the acceleration radiation is the dominant effect, we investigate the evolution of a two detector system initially prepared in a Bell state using a perturbative mater equation and treating the vacuum fluctuations as an unobserved environment. A general function for the concurrence is obtained for stationary and symmetric worldlines in flatspace. The entanglement sudden death time is computed.
