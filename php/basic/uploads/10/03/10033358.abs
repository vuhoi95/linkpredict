Abstract: The next to leading order chiral corrections to the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GMOR) relation are obtained using the pseudoscalar correlator to five-loop order in perturbative QCD, together with new finite energy sum rules (FESR) incorporating polynomial, Legendre type, integration kernels. The purpose of these kernels is to suppress hadronic contributions in the region where they are least known. This reduces considerably the systematic uncertainties arising from the lack of direct experimental information on the hadronic resonance spectral function. Three different methods are used to compute the FESR contour integral in the complex energy (squared) s-plane, i.e. Fixed Order Perturbation Theory, Contour Improved Perturbation Theory, and a fixed renormalization scale scheme. We obtain for the corrections to the GMOR relation, $\delta_\pi$, the value $\delta_\pi = (6.2, \pm 1.6)%$. This result is substantially more accurate than previous determinations based on QCD sum rules; it is also more reliable as it is basically free of systematic uncertainties. It implies a light quark condensate $<0|\bar{u} u|0> \simeq <0|\bar{d} d|0> \equiv <0|\bar{q} q|0>|_{2\,\mathrm{GeV}} = (- 267 \pm 5 MeV)^3$. As a byproduct, the chiral perturbation theory (unphysical) low energy constant $H^r_2$ is predicted to be $H^r_2 (\nu_\chi = M_\rho) = - (5.1 \pm 1.8)\times 10^{-3}$, or $H^r_2 (\nu_\chi = M_\eta) = - (5.7 \pm 2.0)\times 10^{-3}$.
