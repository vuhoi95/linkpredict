Title: A (0,2) Mirror Map
Authors: Ilarion V. Melnikov and M. Ronen Plesser
Abstract: We study the linear sigma model subspace of the moduli space of (0,2) superconformal world-sheet theories obtained by deforming (2,2) theories based on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in reflexively plain toric varieties. We describe a set of algebraic coordinates on this subspace, formulate a (0,2) generalization of the monomial-divisor mirror map, and show that the map exchanges principal components of singular loci of the mirror half-twisted theories. In non-reflexively plain examples the proposed map yields a mirror isomorphism between subfamilies of linear sigma models.
