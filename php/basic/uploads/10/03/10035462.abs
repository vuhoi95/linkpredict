Authors: Defu Hou and Jia-rong Li and Hui Liu and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: The momentum plane analyticity of two point function of a relativistic thermal field theory at zero chemical potential is explored. A general principle regarding the location of the singularities is extracted. In the case of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at large $N_c$, a qualitative change in the nature of the singularity (branch points versus simple poles) from the weak coupling regime to the strong coupling regime is observed with the aid of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
