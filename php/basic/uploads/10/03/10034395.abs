Abstract: We show how taking into account the kinematical effect of extra dimensions can have a significant impact on the gravity wave emission from cosmic strings. Additional dimensions both round off cusps, as well as reduce the probability of their formation. We recompute the cusp gravity wave burst with these factors and find a significant dimension dependent damping of the gravity waves.
