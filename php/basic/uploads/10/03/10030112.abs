Title: Why does the Unruh effect rely on Lorentz invariance, while Hawking  radiation does not ?
Authors: David Campo and Nathaniel Obadia
Abstract: We show that without Lorentz invariance, the Unruh effect does not exist. We use modified dispersion relations and describe in turn: the non-thermal nature of the vacuum (defined in the preferred frame) restricted to the Rindler wedge, the loss of the KMS property of the Wigthman function, the transition amplitudes and transition rates of a uniformaly accelerated detector. This situation seems to contrast with the Hawking radiation of acoustic black holes, which under certain assumptions has been shown to be robust to a breaking of Lorentz symmetry. We explain this discrepancy.
