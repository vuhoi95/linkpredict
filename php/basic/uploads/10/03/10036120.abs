Title: Symmetries of Tree-level Scattering Amplitudes in N=6 Superconformal  Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Till Bargheer and Florian Loebbert and Carlo Meneghelli
Abstract: Constraints of the osp(6|4) symmetry on tree-level scattering amplitudes in N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory are derived. Supplemented by Feynman diagram calculations, solutions to these constraints, namely the four- and six-point superamplitudes, are presented and shown to be invariant under Yangian symmetry. This introduces integrability into the amplitude sector of the theory.
