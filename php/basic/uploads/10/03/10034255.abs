Title: From qubits to E7
Authors: Bianca L. Cerchiai and Bert van Geemen
Abstract: There is a intriguing relation between quantum information theory and super gravity, discovered by M.J. Duff and S. Ferrara. It relates entanglement measures for qubits to black hole entropy, which in a certain case involves the quartic invariant on the 56-dimensional representation of the Lie group E7. In this paper we recall the relatively straightforward manner in which three-qubits lead to E7, or at least to the Weyl group of E7. We also show how the Fano plane emerges in this context.
