Title: Resummed corrections to the œÅparameter due to a finite width of the  top quark
Authors: D. Bettinelli and J. J. van der Bij
Abstract: We perform an all-order calculation of the \rho parameter in a simplified framework, where the top propagator can be calculated exactly. Special emphasis is placed on the question of gauge invariance and the treatment of non-perturbative cut-off effects.
