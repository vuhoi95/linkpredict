Title: Entropy of the FRW universe based on the generalized uncertainty  principle
Authors: Wontae Kim and Young-Jai Park and Myungseok Yoon
Abstract: The statistical entropy of the FRW universe described by time-dependent metric is newly calculated using the brick wall method based on the general uncertainty principle with the minimal length. We can determine the minimal length with the Plank scale to obtain the entropy proportional to the area of the cosmological apparent horizon.
