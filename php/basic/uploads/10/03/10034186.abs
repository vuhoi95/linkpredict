Abstract: We study gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in ${\cal F}$-SU(5) and its low-energy supersymmetric phenomenology. The gaugino masses are not unified at the traditional grand unification scale, but we nonetheless have the same one-loop gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale as minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). We introduce parameters testable at the colliders to measure the small second loop deviation from the mSUGRA gaugino mass relation at the electroweak scale. In the minimal SU(5) model with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking, we show that the deviations from the mSUGRA gaugino mass relations are within 5%. However, in ${\cal F}$-SU(5), we predict the deviations from the mSUGRA gaugino mass relations to be larger due to the presence of vector-like particles, which can be tested at the colliders. We determine the viable parameter space that satisfies all the latest experimental constraints and find it is consistent with the CDMS II experiment. Further, we compute the cross-sections of neutralino annihilations into gamma-rays and compare to the first published Fermi-LAT measurement. Finally, the corresponding range of proton lifetime predictions is calculated and found to be within reach of the future Hyper-Kamiokande and DUSEL experiments.
