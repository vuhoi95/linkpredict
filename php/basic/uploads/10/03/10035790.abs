Title: Method of Matched Expansions & the Singularity Structure of the Green  Function
Authors: Marc Casals and Sam Dolan and Adrian C. Ottewill and Barry Wardell
Abstract: We present the first successful application of the method of Matched Expansions for the calculation of the self-force on a point particle in a curved spacetime. We investigate the case of a scalar charge in the Nariai spacetime, which serves as a toy model for a point mass moving in the Schwarzschild black hole background. We discuss the singularity structure of the Green function beyond the normal neighbourhood and the interesting effect of caustics on null wave propagation.
