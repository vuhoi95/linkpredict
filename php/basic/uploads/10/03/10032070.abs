Title: Modular categories from finite crossed modules
Authors: Jennifer Maier and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: It is known that finite crossed modules provide premodular tensor categories. These categories are in fact modularizable. We construct the modularization and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a finite Drinfeld double.
