Title: Black Hole Entropy Prediction without Immirzi Parameter
Authors: Brian Kong and Youngsub Yoon
Abstract: In our earlier paper "Corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the Hawking radiation spectrum", arXiv:0910.2755, we provided two concrete numerical evidences for the new area spectrum based on the Einstein-Kaufman pseudo tensor as opposed to the Ashtekar variables: namely, the reproduction of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy without fixing Immirzi parameter and the reproduction of the Hawking radiation spectrum. In this article, we provide another concrete, numerical evidence for this new area spectrum; there was a constant in our earlier article, which was inversely proportional to the density of state, and which we could not fix a priori. Nevertheless, in our earlier article, we obtained this constant to be around 172~173 by fitting it to the Planck radiation spectrum. In this article, we calculate this value using another method. We obtain 172.87...which implies consistency.
