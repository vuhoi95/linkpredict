Title: An Alternative Formulation of Hall Effect and Quantum Phases in  Noncommutative Space
Authors: O. F. Dayi and B. Yapiskan
Abstract: A recent method of constructing quantum mechanics in noncommutative coordinates, alternative to implying noncommutativity by means of star product is discussed. Within this approach we study Hall effect as well as quantum phases in noncommutative coordinates. The $\theta$--deformed phases which we obtain are velocity independent.
