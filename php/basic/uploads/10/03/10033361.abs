Title: Yangian symmetry and bound states in AdS/CFT boundary scattering
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We consider the problem of boundary scattering for Y=0 maximal giant graviton branes. We show that the boundary S-matrix for the fundamental excitations has a Yangian symmetry. We then exploit this symmetry to determine the boundary S-matrix for two-particle bound states. We verify that this boundary S-matrix satisfies the boundary Yang-Baxter equations.
