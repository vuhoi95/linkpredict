Title: B-mode polarization induced by gravitational waves from kinks on  infinite cosmic strings
Authors: Masahiro Kawasaki and Koichi Miyamoto and Kazunori Nakayama
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background produced by kinks on infinite cosmic strings, whose spectrum was derived in our previous work, on the B-mode power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. We find that the B-mode polarization due to kinks is comparable to that induced by the motion of the string network and hence the contribution of GWs from kinks is important for estimating the B-mode power spectrum originating from cosmic strings. If the tension of cosmic strings \mu is large enough i.e., G\mu >~ 10^{-8}, B-mode polarization induced by cosmic strings can be detected by future CMB experiments.
