Title: Ostrogradsky's Hamilton formalism and quantum corrections
Authors: J. Gegelia and S. Scherer
Abstract: By means of a simple scalar field theory it is demonstrated that the Lagrange formalism and Ostrogradsky's Hamilton formalism in the presence of higher derivatives, in general, do not lead to the same results. While the two approaches are equivalent at the classical level, differences appear due to the quantum corrections.
