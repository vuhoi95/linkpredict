Title: Is it possible to relate MOND with Horava Gravity?
Authors: Juan M. Romero and R. Bernal-Jaquez and O. Gonzalez-Gaxiola
Abstract: In this work we present a scalar field theory invariant under space-time anisotropic transformations with a dynamic exponet $z$. It is shown that this theory possess symmetries similar to Horava gravity and that in the limit $z=0$ the equations of motion of the non-relativistic MOND theory are obtained. This result allow us to conjecture the existence of a Horava type gravity that in the limit $z=0$ is consistent with MOND.
