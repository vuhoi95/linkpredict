Title: Thermal Correlation Functions of Twisted Quantum Fields
Authors: Prasad Basu and Rahul Srivastava and Sachindeo Vaidya
Abstract: We derive the thermal correlators for twisted quantum fields on noncommutative spacetime. We show that the thermal expectation value of the number operator is same as in commutative spacetime, but that higher correlators are sensitive to the noncommutativity parameters $\theta^{\mu\nu}$.
