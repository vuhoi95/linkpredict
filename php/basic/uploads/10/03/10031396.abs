Title: Scalar tachyons in the de Sitter universe
Authors: Jacques Bros and Henri Epstein and Ugo Moschella
Abstract: We provide a construction of a class of local and de Sitter covariant tachyonic quantum fields which exist for discrete negative values of the squared mass parameter and which have no Minkowskian counterpart. These quantum fields satisfy an anomalous non-homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation. The anomaly is a covariant field which can be used to select the physical subspace (of finite codimension) where the homogeneous tachyonic field equation holds in the usual form. We show that the model is local and de Sitter invariant on the physical space. Our construction also sheds new light on the massless minimally coupled field, which is a special instance of it.
