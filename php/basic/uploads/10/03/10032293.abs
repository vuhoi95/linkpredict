Title: On the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Soft-Wall AdS/QCD
Authors: A. Gorsky and P. N. Kopnin and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: The essence of the chiral magnetic effect is generation of an electric current along an external magnetic field. Recently it has been studied by Rebhan et al. within the Sakai--Sugimoto model, where it was shown to be zero. As an alternative, we calculate the chiral magnetic effect in soft-wall AdS/QCD and find a non-zero result with the natural boundary conditions. The mechanism of the dynamical neutralization of the chiral chemical potential via the string production is discussed in the dual two-form representation.
