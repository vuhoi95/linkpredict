Title: On the classical geometry of embedded manifolds in terms of Nambu  brackets
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Jens Hoppe and Gerhard Huisken
Abstract: We prove that many aspects of the differential geometry of embedded Riemannian manifolds can be formulated in terms of a multi-linear algebraic structure on the space of smooth functions. In particular, we find algebraic expressions for Weingarten's formula, the Ricci curvature and the Codazzi-Mainardi equations.
