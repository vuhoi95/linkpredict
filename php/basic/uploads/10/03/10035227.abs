Authors: Dongsu Bak and Kazem Bitaghsir Fadafan and Hyunsoo Min
Abstract: Using gravity description, we compute various static length scales of N=6 Chern Simons plasma in a strongly coupled regime. For this, we consider the CP3 compactification of the type IIA supergravity down to four dimensions, and identify all the low-lying bosonic modes up to masses corresponding to the operator dimension 3 together with all the remaining CP3 invariant modes. We find the true mass gap, the Debye screening mass and the corresponding dual operators to be probed in the field theory side.
