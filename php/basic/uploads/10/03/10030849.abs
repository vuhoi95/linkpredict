Title: Braided algebras and the kappa-deformed oscillators
Authors: Jerzy Lukierski and Mariusz Woronowicz
Abstract: Recently there were presented several proposals how to formulate the binary relations describing kappa-deformed oscillator algebras. In this paper we shall consider multilinear products of kappa-deformed oscillators consistent with the axioms of braided algebras. In general case the braided triple products are quasi-associative and satisfy the hexagon condition depending on the coassociator $Phi \in A\otimes A\otimes A$. We shall consider only the products of kappa-oscillators consistent with co-associative braided algebra, with Phi =1. We shall consider three explicite examples of binary kappa-deformed oscillator algebra relations and describe briefly their multilinear coassociative extensions satisfying the postulates of braided algebras. The third example, describing kappa-deformed oscillators in group manifold approach to kappa-deformed fourmomenta, is a new result.
