Title: Probing the Gravitational Wave Signature from Cosmic Phase Transitions  at Different Scales
Authors: Lawrence M. Krauss and Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur and James Dent
Abstract: We present a new signature by which to one could potentially discriminate between a spectrum of gravitational radiation generated by a self-ordering scalar field vs that of inflation, specifically a comparison of the magnitude of a flat spectrum at frequencies probed by future direct detection experiments to the magnitude of a possible polarization signal in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. In the process we clarify several issues related to the proper calculation of such modes, focusing on the effect of post-horizon-crossing evolution.
