Title: The timelike half-supersymmetric backgrounds of N=2, D=4 supergravity  with Fayet-Iliopoulos gauging
Authors: Dietmar Klemm and Emanuele Zorzan
Abstract: Subject to some relatively mild assumptions, we derive the complete form of all timelike half-supersymmetric solutions to N=2, D=4 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets. This is done using spinorial geometry techniques. Explicit examples are given for a simple prepotential. Among the solutions, there are near-horizon geometries of extremal rotating BPS black holes still to be discovered, with a nontrivial dependence of the scalar fields on one of the horizon coordinates.
