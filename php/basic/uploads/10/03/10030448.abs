Title: Anomaly Constraints on Monopoles and Dyons
Authors: Csaba Csaki and John Terning and Yuri Shirman
Abstract: Fermions with magnetic charges can contribute to anomalies. We derive the axial anomaly and gauge anomalies for monopoles and dyons, and find eight new gauge anomaly cancelation conditions in a general theory with both electric and magnetic charges. As a byproduct we also extend the Zwanziger two-potential formalism to include the theta parameter, and elaborate on the condition for CP invariance in theories with fermionic dyons.
