Title: Geodesic motions in extraordinary string geometry
Authors: Bogeun Gwak and Bum-Hoon Lee and Wonwoo Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim
Abstract: The geodesic properties of the extraordinary vacuum string solution in (4+1) dimensions are analyzed by using Hamilton-Jacobi method. The geodesic motions show distinct properties from those of the static one. Especially, any freely falling particle can not arrive at the horizon or singularity. There exist stable null circular orbits and bouncing timelike and null geodesics. To get into the horizon {or singularity}, a particle need to follow a non-geodesic trajectory. We also analyze the orbit precession to show that the precession angle has distinct features for each geometry such as naked singularity, black string, and wormhole.
