Title: A conical deficit in the AdS4/CFT3 correspondence
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Cristine N. Ferreira and V. J. Vasquez Otoya
Abstract: Inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence we propose a new duality that allow the study of strongly coupled field theories living in a 2+1 conical space-time. Solving the 4-d Einstein equations in the presence of an infinite static string and negative cosmological constant we obtain a conical AdS4 space-time whose boundary is identified with the 2+1 cone found by Deser, Jackiw and 't Hooft. Using the AdS4/CFT3 correspondence we calculate retarded Green's functions of scalar operators living in the cone.
