Title: Physical non-equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames
Authors: S. Capozziello and P. Martin-Moruno and C. Rubano
Abstract: We show, considering a specific f(R)-gravity model, that the Jordan frame and the Einstein frame are physically non-equivalent, although they are connected by a conformal transformation which yields a mathematical equivalence. Since all the calculations are performed analytically, this non-equivalence is shown in an unambiguous way.
