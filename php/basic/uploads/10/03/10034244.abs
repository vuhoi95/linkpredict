Title: The Superconformal Index of the E_6 SCFT
Authors: Abhijit Gadde and Leonardo Rastelli and Shlomo S. Razamat and Wenbin Yan
Abstract: We derive an integral representation for the superconformal index of the strongly-coupled N=2 superconformal field theory with E_6 flavor symmetry. The explicit expression of the index allows highly non-trivial checks of Argyres-Seiberg duality and of a class of S-dualities conjectured by Gaiotto.
