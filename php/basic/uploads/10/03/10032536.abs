Title: On Exact Symmetries and Massless Vectors in Holographic Flows and other  Flux Vacua
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Wayne de Paula
Abstract: We analyze the isometries of Type IIB flux vacua based on the Papadopolous-Tseytlin ansatz and identify the related massless bulk vector fields. To this end we devise a general ansatz, valid in any flux compactification, for the fluctuations of the metric and p-forms that diagonalizes the coupled equations. We then illustrate the procedure in the simple case of holographic flows driven by the RR 3-form flux only. Specifically we study the fate of the isometries of the Maldacena-Nunez solution associated to wrapped D5-branes.
