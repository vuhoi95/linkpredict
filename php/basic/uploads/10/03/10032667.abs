Title: On the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem for Supermatrices
Authors: Sotirios Bonanos and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: We present a conjecture for expressing the coefficients in the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for supermatrices in terms of supertraces. The conjecture is tested for several supermatrix dimensions and unique results are obtained. Generating functions for determining these coefficients are also given.
