Title: Strong gravitational lensing in a squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole  spacetime
Authors: Yue Liu and Songbai Chen and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing in a Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed horizons. We find the size of the extra dimension imprints in the radius of the photon sphere, the deflection angle, the angular position and magnification of the relativistic images. Supposing that the gravitational field of the supermassive central object of the Galaxy can be described by this metric, we estimated the numerical values of the coefficients and observables for gravitational lensing in the strong field limit.
