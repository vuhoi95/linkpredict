Title: Supersymmetric dualities beyond the conformal window
Authors: V. P. Spiridonov and G. S. Vartanov
Abstract: Using the superconformal (SC) indices techniques, we construct Seiberg type dualities for $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories outside the conformal windows. These theories are physically distinguished by the presence of chiral superfields with small or negative $R$-charges.
