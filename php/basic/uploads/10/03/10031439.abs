Title: Massless Thirring model in canonical quantization scheme
Authors: S. E. Korenblit and V. V. Semenov
Abstract: It is shown that the exact solvability of the massless Thirring model in the canonical quantization scheme originates from the intrinsic linearizability of its Heisenberg equations in the method of dynamical mappings. The corresponding role of inequivalent representations of free massless Dirac field is elucidated.
