Title: The quantum Cartan algebra associated to a bicovariant differential  calculus
Authors: Lucio S. Cirio and Chiara Pagani and Alessandro Zampini
Abstract: We associate to any (suitable) bicovariant differential calculus on a quantum group a Cartan Hopf algebra which has a left, respectively right, representation in terms of left, respectively right, Cartan calculus operators. The example of the Hopf algebra associated to the $4D_+$ differential calculus on $SU_q(2)$ is described.
