Title: The QCD Phase Structure at High Baryon Density
Authors: P. Castorina and R. V. Gavai and H. Satz
Abstract: We consider the possibility that color deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration do not coincide in dense baryonic matter at low temperature. As a consequence, a state of massive "constituent" quarks would exist as an intermediate phase between confined nuclear matter and the plasma of deconfined massless quarks and gluons. We discuss the properties of this state and its relation to the recently proposed quarkyonic matter.
