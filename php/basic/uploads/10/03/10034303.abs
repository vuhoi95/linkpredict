Title: The Bajnok-Janik formula and wrapping corrections
Authors: Janos Balog and Arpad Hegedus
Abstract: We write down the simplified TBA equations of the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ string sigma-model for minimal energy twist-two operators in the sl(2) sector of the model. By using the linearized version of these TBA equations it is shown that the wrapping corrected Bethe equations for these states are identical, up to O(g^8), to the Bethe equations calculated in the generalized L\"uscher approach (Bajnok-Janik formula). Applications of the Bajnok-Janik formula to relativistic integrable models, the nonlinear O(n) sigma models for n=2,3,4 and the SU(n) principal sigma models, are also discussed.
