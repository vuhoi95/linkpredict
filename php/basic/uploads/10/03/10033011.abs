Title: Delayed Reheating and the Breakdown of Coherent Oscillations
Authors: Richard Easther and Raphael Flauger and James B. Gilmore
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of the perturbations in the inflaton field and metric following the end of inflation. We present accurate analytic approximations for the perturbations, showing that the coherent oscillations of the post-inflationary condensate necessarily break down long before any current phenomenological constraints require the universe to become radiation dominated. Further, the breakdown occurs on length-scales equivalent to the comoving post-inflationary horizon size. This work has implications for both the inflationary "matching" problem, and the possible generation of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the post-inflationary universe.
