Title: Taming open/closed string duality with a Losev trick
Authors: Giulio Bonelli and Andrea Prudenziati and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: A target space string field theory formulation for open and closed B-model is provided by giving a Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization of the holomorphic Chern-Simons theory with off-shell gravity background. The target space expression for the coefficients of the holomorphic anomaly equation for open strings are obtained. Furthermore, open/closed string duality is proved from a judicious integration over the open string fields. In particular, by restriction to the case of independence on continuous open moduli, the shift formulas of [7] are reproduced and shown therefore to encode the data of a closed string dual.
