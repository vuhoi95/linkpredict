Title: Large-N Solution of the Heterotic N=(0,1) Two-Dimensional O(N) Sigma  Model
Authors: Peter Koroteev and Alexander Monin
Abstract: In this paper we build a family of heterotic deformations of the O(N) sigma model. These deformations break (1,1) supersymmetry down to (0,1) symmetry. We solve this model at large N. We also find an alternative superfield formulation of the heterotic CP^N sigma model which was discussed in the literature before.
