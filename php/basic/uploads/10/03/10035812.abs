Title: Non-abelian gauge structure in neutrino mixing
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Marco Di Mauro and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We discuss the existence of a non-abelian gauge structure associated with flavor mixing. In the specific case of two flavor mixing of Dirac neutrino fields, we show that this reformulation allows to define flavor neutrino states which preserve the Poincar\'e structure. Phenomenological consequences of our analysis are explored.
