Title: Kalb-Ramond field and Dirac-Kahler equation
Authors: V. A. Pletyukhov and V. I. Strazhev
Abstract: Matrix and tensor formulations of the relativistic wave equation providing description both an electromagnetic field (photon) and a massless Kalb-Ramond field with the zero helicity (notoph) are given. It is shown that this equation is a particular case of the Dirac-Kahler system.
