Title: Transition to sub-Planck structures through the superposition of  q-oscillator stationary states
Authors: E. I. Jafarov and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: We investigate the superposition of four different quantum states based on the $q$-oscillator. These quantum states are expressed by means of Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials. We show that such a superposition has the properties of the quantum harmonic oscillator when $q\to 1$, and those of a compass state with the appearance of chessboard-type interference patterns when $q \to 0$.
