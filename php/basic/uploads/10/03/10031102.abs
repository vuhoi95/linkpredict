Title: On the topological reduction from the affine to the orthogonal gauge  theory of gravity
Authors: R. F. Sobreiro and V. J. Vasquez Otoya
Abstract: Making use of the fibre bundle theory to describe metric-affine gauge theories of gravity we are able to show that metric-affine gauge theory can be reduced to the Riemann-Cartan one. The price we pay for simplifying the geometry is the presence of matter fields associated with the nonmetric degrees of freedom of the original setup. Also, a possible framework for the construction of a quantum gravity theory is developed along the text.
