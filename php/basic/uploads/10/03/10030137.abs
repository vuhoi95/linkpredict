Title: Dynamical supersymmetry of spin particle-magnetic field interaction
Authors: J. -P. Ngome and P. A. Horv√°thy and J. W. van Holten
Abstract: We study the super and dynamical symmetries of a fermion in a monopole background. The Hamiltonian also involves an additional spin-orbit coupling term, which is parameterized by the gyromagnetic ratio. We construct the superinvariants associated with the system using a SUSY extension of a previously proposed algorithm, based on Grassmann-valued Killing tensors. Conserved quantities arise for certain definite values of the gyromagnetic factor: $\N=1$ SUSY requires $g=2$; a Kepler-type dynamical symmetry only arises, however, for the anomalous values $g=0$ and $g=4$. The two anomalous systems can be unified into an $\N=2$ SUSY system built by doubling the number of Grassmann variables. The planar system also exhibits an $\N=2$ supersymmetry without Grassmann variable doubling.
