Title: Spin and the Honeycomb Lattice: Lessons from Graphene
Authors: Matthew Mecklenburg and B. C. Regan
Abstract: Spin-1/2 particles such as the electron are described by the Dirac equation, which allows for two spin eigenvalues (up or down) and two types of energy eigenvalues (positive or negative, corresponding to the electron and the positron). A model of electrons hopping from atom to atom in graphene's honeycomb lattice gives low-energy electronic excitations that obey a relation formally identical to a 2+1 dimensional Dirac equation. Graphene's spin equivalent, "pseudospin", arises from the degeneracy introduced by the honeycomb lattice's two inequivalent atomic sites per unit cell. Previously it has been thought that the usual electron spin and the pseudospin indexing the graphene sublattice state are merely analogues. Here we show that the pseudospin is also a real angular momentum. This identification explains the suppression of electron backscattering in carbon nanotubes and the angular dependence of light absorption by graphene. Furthermore, it demonstrates that half-integer spin like that carried by the quarks and leptons can derive from hidden substructure, not of the particles themselves, but rather of the space in which these particles live.
