Title: Holographic Superconductors in 3+1 dimensions away from the probe limit
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We study holographic superconductors in 3+1 dimensions away from the probe limit, i.e. taking back-reaction of the space-time into account. We consider the case of pure Einstein- and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, respectively. Similar to the probe limit we observe that the critical temperature at which condensation sets in decreases with increasing Gauss-Bonnet coupling. The decrease is however stronger when taking back-reaction of the space-time into account. We observe that the critical temperature becomes very small, but stays positive for all values of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling no matter how strong the back-reaction of the space-time is.
