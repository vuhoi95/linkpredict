Title: Note on an action for a particle in the Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We reconsider a recently proposed action for a free particle which is compatible with Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, and then obtain the subluminal and the superluminal limits without gauge ambiguity in terms of Hamiltonian formulation.
