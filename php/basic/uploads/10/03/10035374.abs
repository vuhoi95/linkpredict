Title: Consistent massive truncations of IIB supergravity on Sasaki-Einstein  manifolds
Authors: James T. Liu and Phillip Szepietowski and Zhichen Zhao
Abstract: Recent work on holographic superconductivity and gravitational duals of systems with non-relativistic conformal symmetry have made use of consistent truncations of D=10 and D=11 supergravity retaining some massive modes in the Kaluza-Klein tower. In this paper we focus on reductions of IIB supergravity to five dimensions on a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, and extend these previous truncations to encompass the entire bosonic sector of gauged D=5, N=2 supergravity coupled to massive multiplets up to the second Kaluza-Klein level. We conjecture that a necessary condition for the consistency of massive truncations is to only retain the lowest modes in the massive trajectories of the Kaluza-Klein mode decomposition of the original fields. This is an extension of the well-known result that consistent truncations may be obtained by restricting to the singlet sector of the internal symmetry group.
