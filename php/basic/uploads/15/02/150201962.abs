Title: Dual descriptions of massive spin-3 particles in $D=2+1$ via Noether  gauge embedment
Authors: E. L. Mendon√ßa and D. Dalmazi
Abstract: We present here a relationship among massive self-dual models for spin-3 particles in $D=2+1$ via the Noether Gauge Embedment $(NGE)$ procedure. Starting with a first order model (in derivatives) $S_{SD(1)}$ we have obtained a sequence of four self-dual models $S_{SD(i)}$ where $i=1,2,3,4$. We demonstrate that the $NGE$ procedure generate the correct action for the auxiliary fields automatically. We obtain the whole action for the $4th$ order self-dual model including all the needed auxiliary fields to get rid of the ghosts of the theory.
