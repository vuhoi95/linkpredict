Title: Planck, LHC, and $Î±$-attractors
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde
Abstract: We describe a simple class of cosmological models called $\alpha$ attractors, which provide an excellent fit to the latest Planck data. These theories are most naturally formulated in the context of supergravity with logarithmic Kahler potentials. We develop generalized versions of these models which can describe not only inflation but also dark energy and supersymmetry breaking.
