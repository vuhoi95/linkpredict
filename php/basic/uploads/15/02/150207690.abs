Title: Viscosities and shift in a chiral superfluid: a holographic study
Authors: Siavash Golkar and Matthew M. Roberts
Abstract: We consider a holographic model of chiral superfluidity whose bulk is Einstein Yang-Mills and compute viscosity and conductivity responses away from the probe limit. We calculate Hall viscosity and analyze its relationship to the superfluid density and the shift. We find that the relationship between these quantities derived from effective field theory at zero temperature persists for all temperatures: for $p\pm ip$ their ratio is equal to $\mp1/2$. At low temperatures the system develops a Lifshitz throat, indicating an anisotropic scaling symmetry in the infrared dynamics.
