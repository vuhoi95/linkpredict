Title: Dynamical construction of Horava-Lifshitz geometry
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: We derive the projectable version of Horava - Lifshitz gravity from the localisation of the Galilean symmetry. Specifically we provide a dynamical construction of the metric, from first principles, that reproduces the transformations of the physical variables - lapse, shift and spatial component of the metric. Also, the measure defining the action is reproduced. The geometrical basis of the Horava-Lifshitz gravity is thereby revealed which also elucidates its difference from the Newton-Cartan geometry - the spacetime of Newtonian gravity. The connection of Newton's gravity with Horava-Lifshitz gravity is elucidated.
