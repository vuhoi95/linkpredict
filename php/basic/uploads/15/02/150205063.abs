Abstract: We study the existence of self-dual nontopological vortices in generalized Maxwell-Higgs models recently introduced in Ref. \cite{gv}. Our investigation is explicitly illustrated by choosing a sixth-order self-interaction potential, which is the simplest one allowing the existence of nontopological structures. We specify some Maxwell-Higgs models yielding BPS nontopological vortices having energy proportional to the magnetic flux, $\Phi_{B}$, and whose profiles are numerically achieved. Particularly, we investigate the way the new solutions approach the boundary values, from which we verify their nontopological behavior. Finally, we depict the profiles numerically found, highlighting the main features they present.
