Abstract: The quantum entanglement measure is determined, for the first time, for antiferromagnetic trimer spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains. The physical quantity proposed to measure the entanglement is the distance between states by adopting the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The method is applied to the new magnetic Cu(II) trimer system, 2b.3CuCl_2.2H_2O, and to the trinuclear Cu(II) halide salt, (3MAP)_2Cu_2Cl_8. The decoherence temperature, above which the entanglement is suppressed, is determined for the both systems. A correlation among their decoherence temperatures and their respective exchange coupling constants is established.
