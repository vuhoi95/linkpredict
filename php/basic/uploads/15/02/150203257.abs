Title: Leading low-energy effective action in the 6D hypermultiplet theory on a  vector/tensor background
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: We consider a six dimensional (1,0) hypermultiplet model coupled to an external field of vector/tensor system and study the structure of the low-energy effective action of this model. Manifestly a (1,0) supersymmetric procedure of computing the effective action is developed in the framework of the superfield proper-time technique. The leading low-energy contribution to the effective action is calculated.
