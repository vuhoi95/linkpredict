Title: A Hidden Symmetry of AdS Resonances
Authors: Oleg Evnin and Chethan Krishnan
Abstract: Recent investigations have revealed powerful selection rules for resonant energy transfer between modes of non-linear perturbations in global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. It is likely that these selection rules are due to the highly symmetric nature of the underlying AdS background, though the precise relation has remained unclear. In this article, we demonstrate that the equation satisfied by the scalar field mode functions in AdS(d+1) has a hidden SU(d) symmetry, and explicitly specify the multiplets of this SU(d) symmetry furnished by the mode functions. We also comment on the role this structure might play in explaining the selection rules.
