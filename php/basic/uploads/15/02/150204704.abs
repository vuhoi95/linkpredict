Title: Memory matrix theory of magnetotransport in strange metals
Authors: Andrew Lucas and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We model strange metals as quantum liquids without quasiparticle excitations, but with slow momentum relaxation, and with slow diffusive dynamics of a conserved charge and energy. General expressions are obtained for electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport in the presence of an applied magnetic field using the memory matrix formalism. In the appropriate limits, our expressions agree with previous hydrodynamic and holographic results. We discuss the relationship of such results to thermoelectric and Hall transport measurements in the strange metal phase of the hole-doped cuprates.
