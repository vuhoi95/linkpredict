Title: Driven Holographic CFTs
Authors: Mukund Rangamani and Moshe Rozali and Anson Wong
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of strongly coupled field theories, initially in thermal equilibrium, under the influence of an external driving force. We model the field theory holographically using classical gravitational dynamics in an asymptotically AdS spacetime. The system is driven by a source for a (composite) scalar operator. We focus on a scenario where the external source is periodic in time and chart out the response of several observables. We find an interesting phase structure in the response as a function of the amplitude of the source and driving frequency. Specifically the system transitions from a dissipation dominated phase, via a dynamical crossover to a highly resonant amplification phase. The diagnostics of these phases include the response of the operator in question, entropy production, energy fluctuations, and the temporal change of entanglement entropy for small subsystems. We comment on evidence for a potential phase transition in the energy fluctuations of the system.
