Title: He-McKellar-Wilkens-type effect from the Lorentz symmetry breaking  effects
Authors: A. G. de Lima and H. Belich and K. Bakke
Abstract: From the effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation in the CPT-even gauge sector of Standard Model Extension, we establish a possible scenario where an analogue of the He-McKellar-Wilkens effect can stem from. Besides, we build quantum holonomies associated with the analogue of the He-McKellar-Wilkens effect and discuss a possible analogy with the holonomic quantum computation [P. Zanardi and M. Rasetti, Phys. Lett. A {\bf264}, 94 (1999)]. Finally, we investigate the dependence of the energy levels on the He-McKellar-Wilkens geometric phase induced by Lorentz symmetry breaking effects when the particle is confined to a hard-wall confining potential.
