Title: (1+1)D Calculation provides evidence that quantum entanglement survives  a firewall
Authors: Eduardo Martin-Martinez and Jorma Louko
Abstract: We analyze how pre-existing entanglement between two Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors evolves when one of the detectors falls through a Rindler firewall in (1+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. The firewall effect is minor and does not wash out the detector-detector entanglement, in some regimes even preserving the entanglement better than Minkowski vacuum. The absence of cataclysmic events should continue to hold for young black hole firewalls. A firewall's prospective ability to resolve the information paradox must hence hinge on its detailed gravitational structure, presently poorly understood.
