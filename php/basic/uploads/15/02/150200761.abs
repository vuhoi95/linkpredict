Title: Spinors on a curved noncommutative space: coupling to torsion and the  Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Maja Buric and John Madore and Luka Nenadovic
Abstract: We analyse the spinor action on a curved noncommutative space, the so-called truncated Heisenberg algebra, and in particular, the nonminimal coupling of spinors to the torsion. We find that dimensional reduction of the Dirac action gives the noncommutative extension of the Gross-Neveu model, the model which is, as shown by Vignes-Tourneret, fully renormalisable.
