Title: $Λ$CDM Bounce Cosmology without $Λ$CDM: the case of modified  gravity
Authors: S. D. Odintsov and V. K. Oikonomou
Abstract: We provide an $F(R)$ gravity description of a $\Lambda$CDM bouncing model, without the need for matter fluids or for cosmological constant. As we explicitly demonstrate, the two cosmological eras that constitute the $\Lambda$CDM bouncing model, can be generated by $F(R)$ gravity which can lead to accelerating cosmologies. The resulting F(R) gravity has Einstein frame inflationary properties that have concordance to the latest Planck observational data. Both the $F(R)$ gravity stability properties are thoroughly investigated and also, the gravitational particle production, a feature necessary for the viability of the $\Lambda$CDM bounce scenario, is also addressed. As we will show, the $\Lambda$CDM bounce model can be successfully described by pure $F(R)$ gravity, with appealing phenomenological attributes, which we extensively discuss.
