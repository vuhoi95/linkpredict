Title: Wake Potential in Strong Coupling Plasma from AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Lian Liu and Hui Liu
Abstract: With the dielectric function computed from AdS/CFT correspondence, we studied the wake potential induced by a fast moving charge in strong coupling plasma, and compared it with the weak coupling wake potential for different particle velocities as $v=0.55c$ and $v=0.99c$. The most prominent difference between strong and weak wake potential is that when $v=0.99c$ the remarkable oscillation due to Cerenkov-like radiation and Mach cone in weak coupling disappears in strong coupling, which implies that the plasmon mode with phase velocity lower than the speed of light dose not exist in strong coupling plasma.
