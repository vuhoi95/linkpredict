Title: On the groundstate of octonionic matrix models in a ball
Authors: L. Boulton and M. P. Garcia del Moral and A. Restuccia
Abstract: In this work we examine the existence and uniqueness of the groundstate of a SU(N)x G2 octonionic matrix model on a bounded domain of R^N. The existence and uniqueness argument of the groundstate wavefunction follows from the Lax-Milgram theorem. Uniqueness is shown by means of an explicit argument which is drafted in some detail.
