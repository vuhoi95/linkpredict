Abstract: We construct black holes with a Ricci flat horizon in Einstein--Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant, which approach asymptotically an AdS$_d$ spacetime background (with $d\geq 4$). These solutions are isotropic, $i.e.$ all space directions in a hypersurface of constant radial and time coordinates are equivalent, and possess both electric and magnetic fields. We find that the basic properties of the non-Abelian solutions are similar to those of the dyonic isotropic branes in Einstein-Maxwell theory (which, however, exist in even spacetime dimensions only). These black branes possess a nonzero magnetic field strength on the flat boundary metric, which leads to a divergent mass of these solutions, as defined in the usual way. However, a different picture is found for odd spacetime dimensions, where a non-Abelian Chern-Simons term can be incorporated in the action. This allows for black brane solutions with a magnetic field which vanishes asymptotically.
