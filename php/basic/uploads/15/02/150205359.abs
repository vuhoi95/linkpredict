Title: Global symmetries of Yang-Mills squared in various dimensions
Authors: A. Anastasiou and L. Borsten and M. J. Hughes and S. Nagy
Abstract: Tensoring two on-shell super Yang-Mills multiplets in dimensions $D\leq 10$ yields an on-shell supergravity multiplet, possibly with additional matter multiplets. Associating a (direct sum of) division algebra(s) $\mathbb{D}$ with each dimension $3\leq D\leq 10$ we obtain formulae for the algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ of the U-duality group $G$ and its maximal compact subgroup $H$, respectively, in terms of the internal global symmetry algebras of each super Yang-Mills theory. We extend our analysis to include supergravities coupled to an arbitrary number of matter multiplets by allowing for non-supersymmetric multiplets in the tensor product.
