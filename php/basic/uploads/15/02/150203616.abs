Title: Conductivity and entanglement entropy of high dimensional holographic  superconductors
Authors: Aurelio Romero-Bermúdez and Antonio M. García-García
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the conductivity and the entanglement entropy on the space-time dimensionality $d$ in two holographic superconductors: one dual to a quantum critical point with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the other modeled by a charged scalar that condenses at a sufficiently low temperature in the presence of a Maxwell field. In both cases the gravity background is asymptotically Anti de Sitter (AdS). In the large $d$ limit we obtain explicit analytical results for the conductivity at zero temperature and the entanglement entropy by a $1/d$ expansion. We show that the entanglement entropy is always smaller in the broken phase. As dimensionality increases, the entanglement entropy decreases, the coherence peak in the conductivity becomes narrower and the ratio between the energy gap and the critical temperature decreases. These results suggest that the condensate interactions become weaker in high spatial dimensions.
