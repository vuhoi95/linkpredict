Title: Magnetothermoelectric Response from Holography
Authors: Mike Blake and Aristomenis Donos and Nakarin Lohitsiri
Abstract: In this note we study the effects of a magnetic field on transport using holographic models with broken translational invariance. We show that, after carefully subtracting off non-trivial magnetisation currents, it is possible to express the DC transport currents of the boundary theory in terms of properties of a black hole horizon. This allows us to obtain simple analytic expressions for the electrical, thermoelectric and heat conductivity tensors. Our results apply to both isotropic and anisotropic models, including holographic Q-lattices and to certain theories where translational invariance is broken by linear sources for axions.
