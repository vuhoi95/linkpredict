Title: The Montevideo Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: a short review
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: The Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics, which consists in supplementing environmental decoherence with fundamental limitations in measurement stemming from gravity, has been described in several publications. However, some of them appeared before the full picture provided by the interpretation was developed. As such it can be difficult to get a good understanding via the published literature. Here we summarize it in a self contained brief presentation including all its principal elements.
