Title: Vaidya-like exact solutions with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: Starting from the Oliva--Tempo--Troncoso black hole, a solution of the Bergshoeff--Hohm--Townsend massive gravity, a class of the Vaidya-like exact vacuum solutions with torsion is constructed in the three-dimensional Poincar\'e gauge theory. A particular subclass of these solutions is shown to possess the asymptotic conformal symmetry. The related canonical energy contains a contribution stemming from torsion.
