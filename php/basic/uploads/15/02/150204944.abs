Title: Discrete Holomorphicity in the Chiral Potts Model
Authors: Yacine Ikhlef and Robert Weston
Abstract: We construct lattice parafermions for the $Z(N)$ chiral Potts model in terms of quasi-local currents of the underlying quantum group. We show that the conservation of the quantum group currents leads to twisted discrete-holomorphicity (DH) conditions for the parafermions. At the critical Fateev-Zamolodchikov point the parafermions are the usual ones, and the DH conditions coincide with those found previously by Rajabpour and Cardy. Away from the critical point, we show that our twisted DH conditions can be understood as deformed lattice current conservation conditions for an underlying perturbed conformal field theory in both the general $N\geq 3$ and $N=2$ Ising cases.
