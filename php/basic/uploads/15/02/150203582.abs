Title: D-brane instanton induced mu-terms and their hierarchical structure
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Yoshiyuki Tatsuta and Shohei Uemura
Abstract: We study the mu-term matrix of Higgs pairs induced by the D-brane instanton effects in intersecting D6-brane models compactified on T6. It is found that the mu-term matrix has a certain permutation symmetry and its eigenvalues have large hierarchical structure without fine tuning.
