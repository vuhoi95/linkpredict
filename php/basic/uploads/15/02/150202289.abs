Title: What We Can Learn from the Running of the Spectral Index if no Tensors  are Detected in the Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy
Authors: Matteo Biagetti and Alex Kehagias and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: In this paper we operate under the assumption that no tensors from inflation will be measured in the future by the dedicated experiments and argue that, while for single-field slow-roll models of inflation the running of the spectral index will be hard to be detected, in multi-field models the running can be large due to its strong correlation with non-Gaussianity. A detection of the running might therefore be related to the presence of more than one active scalar degree of freedom during inflation.
