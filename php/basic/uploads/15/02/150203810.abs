Title: Constraining Higher Derivative Supergravity with Scattering Amplitudes
Authors: Yifan Wang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We study supersymmetry constraints on higher derivative deformations of type IIB supergravity by consideration of superamplitudes. Combining constraints of on-shell supervertices and basic results from string perturbation theory, we give a simple argument for the non-renormalization theorem of Green and Sethi, and some of its generalizations.
