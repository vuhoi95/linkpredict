Title: Elliptic solutions in the Neumann-Rosochatius system with mixed flux
Authors: Rafael Hernandez and Juan Miguel Nieto
Abstract: Closed strings spinning in AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 with mixed R-R and NS-NS three-form fluxes are described by a deformation of the one-dimensional Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system. In this article we find general solutions to this system that can be expressed in terms of elliptic functions. We consider closed strings rotating either in S^3 with two different angular momenta or in AdS_3 with one spin. In order to find the solutions we will need to extend the Uhlenbeck integrals of motion of the Neumann-Rosochatius system to include the contribution from the flux. In the limit of pure NS-NS flux, where the problem can be described by a supersymmetric WZW model, we find exact expressions for the classical energy in terms of the spin and the angular momenta of the spinning string.
