Title: Schr√∂dinger geometries arising from Yang-Baxter deformations
Authors: Takuya Matsumoto and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We present further examples of the correspondence between solutions of type IIB supergravity and classical $r$-matrices satisfying the classical Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE). In the previous works, classical $r$-matrices have been composed of generators of only one of either $\mathfrak{so}(2,4)$ or $\mathfrak{so}(6)$. In this paper, we consider some examples of $r$-matrices with both of them. The $r$-matrices of this kind contain (generalized) Schr\"odinger spacetimes and gravity duals of dipole theories. It is known that the generalized Schr\"odinger spacetimes can also be obtained via a certain class of TsT transformations called null Melvin twists. The metric and NS-NS two-form are reproduced by following the Yang-Baxter sigma-model description.
