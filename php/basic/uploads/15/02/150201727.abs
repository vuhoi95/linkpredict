Abstract: We consider Grand Unified Theories based on $SO(10)$ which originate from string/$M$ theory on $G_2$ manifolds or Calabi-Yau spaces with discrete symmetries. In this framework we are naturally led to a novel solution of the doublet-triplet splitting problem previously considered by Dvali which involves an extra vector-like Standard Model family and light, but weakly coupled colour triplets. These additional states are predicted to be accessible at the LHC and also induce R-parity violation. Gauge coupling unification occurs with a larger GUT coupling.
