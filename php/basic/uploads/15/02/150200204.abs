Title: Minimal Length Effects on Entanglement Entropy of Spherically Symmetric  Black Holes in Brick Wall Model
Authors: Peng Wang and Haitang Yang and Shuxuan Ying
Abstract: We compute the black hole horizon entanglement entropy for a massless scalar field in the brick wall model by incorporating the minimal length. Taking the minimal length effects on the occupation number $n(\omega,l)$ and the Hawking temperature into consideration, we obtain the leading UV divergent term and the subleading logarithmic term in the entropy. The leading divergent term scales with the horizon area. The subleading logarithmic term is the same as that in the usual brick wall model without the minimal length.
