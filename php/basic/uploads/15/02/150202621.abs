Title: Knot invariants from Virasoro related representation and pretzel knots
Authors: D. Galakhov and D. Melnikov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: We remind the method to calculate colored Jones polynomials for the plat representations of knot diagrams from the knowledge of modular transformation (monodromies) of Virasoro conformal blocks with insertions of degenerate fields. As an illustration we use a rich family of pretzel knots, lying on a surface of arbitrary genus g, which was recently analyzed by the evolution method. Further generalizations can be to generic Virasoro modular transformations, provided by integral kernels, which can lead to the Hikami invariants.
