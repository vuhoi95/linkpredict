Title: On the Amplitude/Wilson Loop duality in $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCQCD
Authors: Marta Leoni and Andrea Mauri and Alberto Santambrogio
Abstract: We compute the four-point amplitude with external adjoint particles in $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCQCD at two loops using $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace Feynman diagrams, extending the results of arXiv:1406.7283. We consider the diagrammatic difference with the corresponding process of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM finding a non vanishing result, which is a non trivial function of the kinematic variables. This demonstrates that in $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCQCD, even in the sector with external particles in the vector multiplet, the amplitude/Wilson loop duality is inevitably broken at two loops.
