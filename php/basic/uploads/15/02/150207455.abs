Title: Group theoretic approach to rationally extended shape invariant  potentials
Authors: Rajesh Kumar Yadav and Nisha Kumari and Avinash Khare and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: The exact bound state spectrum of rationally extended shape invariant real as well as $PT$ symmetric complex potentials are obtained by using potential group approach. The generators of the potential groups are modified by introducing a new operator $U (x, J_3 \pm 1/2 )$ to express the Hamiltonian corresponding to these extended potentials in terms of Casimir operators. Connection between the potential algebra and the shape invariance is elucidated.
