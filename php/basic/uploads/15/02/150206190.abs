Abstract: We investigate the low-lying eigenmodes of the Dirac matrix with the aim to gain more insight into the temperature dependence of the anomalous $U_A(1)$ symmetry. We use the overlap operator to probe dynamical QCD configurations generated with (2+1)-flavors of highly improved staggered quarks. We find no evidence of a gap opening up in the infrared region of the eigenvalue spectrum even at $1.5\,T_c$, $T_c$ being the chiral crossover temperature. Instead, we observe an accumulation of near-zero eigenmodes. We argue that these near-zero eigenmodes are primarily responsible for the anomalous breaking of the axial symmetry still being effective. At $1.5\,T_c$, these near-zero eigenmodes remain localized and their distribution is consistent with the dilute instanton gas picture. At this temperature, the average size of the instantons is $0.223(8)\,\text{fm}$ and their density is $0.147(7)\,\text{fm}^{-4}$.
