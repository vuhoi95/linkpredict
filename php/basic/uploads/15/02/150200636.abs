Title: Adiabatic hydrodynamics: The eightfold way to dissipation
Authors: Felix M. Haehl and R. Loganayagam and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We provide a complete solution to hydrodynamic transport at all orders in the gradient expansion compatible with the second law constraint. The key new ingredient we introduce is the notion of adiabaticity, which allows us to take hydrodynamics off-shell. Adiabatic fluids are such that off-shell dynamics of the fluid compensates for entropy production. The space of adiabatic fluids is quite rich, and admits a decomposition into seven distinct classes. Together with the dissipative class this establishes the eightfold way of hydrodynamic transport. Furthermore, recent results guarantee that dissipative terms beyond leading order in the gradient expansion are agnostic of the second law. While this completes a transport taxonomy, we go on to argue for a new symmetry principle, an Abelian gauge invariance that guarantees adiabaticity in hydrodynamics. We suggest that this symmetry is the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic KMS invariance. We demonstrate its utility by explicitly constructing effective actions for adiabatic transport. The theory of adiabatic fluids, we speculate, provides a useful starting point for a new framework to describe non-equilibrium dynamics, wherein dissipative effects arise by Higgsing the Abelian symmetry.
