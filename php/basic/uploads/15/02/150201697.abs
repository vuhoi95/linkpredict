Title: Renormalization group approach for Lorentz-violating scalar field theory  at all loop orders
Authors: William C. Vieira and Paulo R. S. Carvalho
Abstract: We compute, both explicitly up to next-to-leading order and in a proof by induction for all loop levels, the critical exponents for thermal Lorentz-violating O($N$) self-interacting scalar field theory. They are evaluated in a massless theory renormalized at arbitrary external momenta, where a reduced number of Feynman diagrams is eeded. The results are presented and shown to be identical to that found previously in distinct theories renormalized at different renormalization schemes. At the end we give both mathematical explanation and physical interpretation for them based on coordinates redefinition techniques and symmetry ideas, respectively.
