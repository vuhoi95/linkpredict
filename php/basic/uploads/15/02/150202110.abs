Title: Quantum particle confined to a thin-layer volume: Non-uniform  convergence toward the curved surface
Authors: Yong-Long Wang and Hong-Shi Zong
Abstract: We clearly refine the fundamental framework of the thin-layer quantization procedure, and further develop the procedure by taking the proper terms of degree one in $q_3$ ($q_3$ denotes the curvilinear coordinate variable perpendicular to curved surface) back into the surface quantum equation. The well-known geometric potential and kinetic term are modified by the surface thickness. Applying the developed formalism to a toroidal system obtains the modification for the kinetic term and the modified geometric potential including the influence of the surface thickness.
