Title: Discrete Abelian gauge symmetries and axions
Authors: Gabriele Honecker and Wieland Staessens
Abstract: We combine two popular extensions of beyond the Standard Model physics within the framework of intersecting D6-brane models: discrete Zn symmetries and Peccei-Quinn axions. The underlying natural connection between both extensions is formed by the presence of massive U(1) gauge symmetries in D-brane model building. Global intersecting D6-brane models on toroidal orbifolds of the type T6/Z2N and T6/Z2xZ2M with discrete torsion offer excellent playgrounds for realizing these extensions. A generation-dependent Z2 symmetry is identified in a global Pati-Salam model, while global left-right symmetric models give rise to supersymmetric realizations of the DFSZ axion model. In one class of the latter models, the axion as well as Standard Model particles carry a non-trivial Z3 charge.
