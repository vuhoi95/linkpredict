Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy Close to Quantum Phase Transitions
Authors: Yi Ling and Peng Liu and Chao Niu and Jian-Pin Wu and Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) of a strip geometry in four dimensional Q-lattice backgrounds, which exhibit metal-insulator transitions in the dual field theory. Remarkably, we find that the HEE always displays a peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical points. Our model provides the first direct evidence that the HEE can be used to characterize the quantum phase transition (QPT). We also conjecture that the maximization behavior of HEE at quantum critical points would be universal in general holographic models.
