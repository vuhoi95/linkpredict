Title: Elko and mass dimension one field of spin one half: causality and Fermi  statistics
Authors: Dharam Vir Ahluwalia and Alekha Chandra Nayak
Abstract: We review how Elko arise as an extension of complex valued four-component Majorana spinors. This is followed by a discussion that constrains certain elements of phase freedom. A proof is reviewed that unambiguously establishes that Elko, and for that matter the indicated Majorana spinors, cannot satisfy Dirac equation. They, however do, as they must, satisfy spinorial Klein-Gordon equation. We then introduce a quantum field with Elko as its expansion coefficients and show that it is causal, satisfies Fermi statistics, and then refer to the existing literature to remind that its mass dimensionally is one. We conclude by providing an up-to-date bibliography on the subject.
