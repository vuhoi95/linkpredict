Title: One loop radiative corrections to the translation-invariant  noncommutative Yukawa Theory
Authors: Karim Bouchachia and Smain Kouadik and Mahmoud Hachemane and Manfred Schweda
Abstract: We elaborate in this paper a translation-invariant model for fermions in 4-dimensional noncommutative Euclidean space. The construction is done on the basis of the renormalizable noncommutative translation-invariant Phi4 theory introduced by R. Gurau et al. We combine our model with the scalar model, in order to study the noncommutative pseudo-scalar Yukawa theory. After we derive the Feynman rules of the theory, we perform an explicit calculation of the quantum corrections at one loop level to the propagators and vertices.
