Title: Non-Abelian (Hyperscaling Violating) Lifshitz Black Holes in General  Dimensions
Authors: Xing-Hui Feng and Wei-Jian Geng
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravities coupled to a cosmological constant and multiple $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in general dimensions and find that the theories admit colored Lifshitz solutions with dynamic exponents $z>1$. We also introduce a Maxwell field and construct exact electric charged black holes that asymptote to the $z=D-1$ colored Lifshitz spacetimes and analyse their thermodynamical first law. Furthermore, we introduce a dilaton to the system and construct Lifshitz spacetimes with hyperscaling violations. After turning on the Maxwell field, we obtain a class of hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes when $\theta=\frac{2}{D-2}[z-(D-1)]$.
