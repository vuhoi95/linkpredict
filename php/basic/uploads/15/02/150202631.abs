Title: Magneto-transport from momentum dissipating holography
Authors: Andrea Amoretti and Daniele Musso
Abstract: We obtain explicit expressions for the thermoelectric transport coefficients of a strongly coupled, planar medium in the presence of an orthogonal magnetic field and momentum-dissipating processes. The computations are performed within the gauge/gravity framework where the momentum dissipation mechanism is introduced by including a mass term for the bulk graviton. Relying on the structure of the computed transport coefficients and promoting the parameters to become dynamical functions, we propose a holography inspired phenomenology open to a direct comparison with experimental data from the cuprates.
