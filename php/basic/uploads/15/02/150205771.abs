Title: Seiberg Duality, Quiver Gauge Theories, and Ihara Zeta Function
Authors: Da Zhou and Yan Xiao and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: We study Ihara zeta function for graphs in the context of quivers arising from gauge theories, especially under Seiberg duality transformations. The distribution of poles is studied as we proceed along the duality tree, in light of the weak and strong graph versions of the Riemann Hypothesis. As a by-product, we find a refined version of Ihara zeta function to be the generating function for the generic superpotential of the gauge theory.
