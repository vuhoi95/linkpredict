Title: Small black holes in $AdS_5\times S^5$
Authors: Alex Buchel and Luis Lehner
Abstract: We consider small black holes in $AdS_5\times S^5$, smeared on $S^5$. We compute the spectrum of $\ell \in [1,10]$ $S^5$-quasinormal modes corresponding to fluctuations leading to localization of these black holes on $S^5$. We recover the zero mode found by Hubeny and Rangamani (HR) previously \cite{Hubeny:2002xn}, and explicitly demonstrate that a Gregory-Laflamme type instability is at play in this system. The instability is associated with the expectation value of a dimension-5 operator.
