Title: Field Theory on Newton-Cartan Backgrounds and Symmetries of the Lifshitz  Vacuum
Authors: Jelle Hartong and Elias Kiritsis and Niels A. Obers
Abstract: Holography for Lifshitz space-times corresponds to dual field theories on a fixed torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) background. We examine the coupling of non-relativistic field theories to TNC backgrounds and uncover a novel mechanism by which a global U(1) can become local. This involves the TNC vector $M_\mu$ which sources a particle number current, and which for flat NC space-time satisfies $M_{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}M$ with a Schroedinger symmetry realized on $M$. We discuss various toy model field theories on flat NC space-time for which the new mechanism leads to extra global space-time symmetries beyond the generic Lifshitz symmetry, allowing for an enhancement to Schroedinger symmetry. On the holographic side, the source $M$ also appears in the Lifshitz vacuum with exactly the same properties as for flat NC space-time. In particular, the bulk diffeomorphisms that preserve the boundary conditions realize a Schroedinger algebra on $M$, allowing for a conserved particle number current. Finally, we present a probe action for a complex scalar field on the Lifshitz vacuum, which exhibits Schroedinger invariance in the same manner as seen in the field theory models.
