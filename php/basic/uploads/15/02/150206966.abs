Title: Collisions in Chiral Kinetic Theory
Authors: Jing-Yuan Chen and Dam T. Son and Mikhail A. Stephanov
Abstract: Using a covariant formalism, we construct a chiral kinetic theory Lorentz invariant to order $\mathcal O(\hbar)$ which includes collisions. We find a new contribution to the particle number current due to the side jumps required by the conservation of angular momentum during collisions. We also find a conserved symmetric stress-energy tensor as well as the $H$-function obeying Boltzmann's $H$-theorem. We demonstrate their use by finding a general equilibrium solution and the values of the anomalous transport coefficients characterizing chiral vortical effect.
