Title: The collision of two-kinks defects
Authors: T. S. Mendon√ßa and H. P. de Oliveira
Abstract: We have investigated the head-on collision of a two-kink and a two-antikink pair that arises as a generalization of the $\phi^4$ model. We have evolved numerically the Klein-Gordon equation with a new spectral algorithm whose accuracy and convergence were attested by the numerical tests. As a general result, the two-kink pair is annihilated radiating away most of the scalar field. It is possible the production of oscillons-like configurations after the collision that bounce and coalesce to form a small amplitude oscillon at the origin. The new feature is the formation of a sequence of quasi-stationary structures that we have identified as lump-like solutions of non-topological nature. The amount of time these structures survives depends on the fine-tuning of the impact velocity.
