Title: Analytic vortex solutions on compact hyperbolic surfaces
Authors: R. Maldonado and N. S. Manton
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, Abelian-Higgs vortices on certain compact surfaces of constant negative curvature. Such surfaces are represented by a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by regular polygons. The Higgs field is given implicitly in terms of Schwarz triangle functions and analytic solutions are available for certain highly symmetric configurations.
