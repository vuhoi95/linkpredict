Title: Robustness of the O($N$) universality class
Authors: William C. Vieira and Paulo R. S. Carvalho
Abstract: We calculate the critical exponents for Lorentz-violating O($N$) $\lambda\phi^{4}$ scalar field theories by using two independent methods. In the first situation we renormalize a massless theory by utilizing normalization conditions. An identical task is fulfilled in the second case in a massive version of the same theory, previously renormalized in the BPHZ method in four dimensions. We show that although the renormalization constants, the $\beta$ and anomalous dimensions acquire Lorentz-violating quantum corrections, the outcome for the critical exponents in both methods are identical and furthermore they are equal to their Lorentz-invariant counterparts. Finally we generalize the last two results for all loop levels and we provide symmetry arguments for justifying the latter.
