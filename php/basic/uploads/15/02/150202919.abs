Title: Noncommutative spectral geometry, Bogoliubov transformations and  neutrino oscillations
Authors: Maria Vittoria Gargiulo and Mairi Sakellariadou and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: In this report we show that neutrino mixing is intrinsically contained in Connes' noncommutative spectral geometry construction, thanks to the introduction of the doubling of algebra, which is connected to the Bogoliubov transformation. It is known indeed that these transformations are responsible for the mixing, turning the mass vacuum state into the flavor vacuum state, in such a way that mass and flavor vacuum states are not unitary equivalent. There is thus a red thread that binds the doubling of algebra of Connes' model to the neutrino mixing.
