Abstract: Background fermion condensates in a landscape dominated by global SUSY are reassessed in connection with a scenario where Lorentz symmetry is violated in the bosonic sector (actually, the photon sector) by a $CPT$-even $k_F$-term. An effective photonic action is discussed that originates from the supersymmetric background fermion condensates. Also, the photino mass emerges in terms of a particular condensate contrary to what happens in the $k_{AF}$-violation. Finally, the interparticle potential induced by the effective photonic action is investigated and a confining profile is identified.
