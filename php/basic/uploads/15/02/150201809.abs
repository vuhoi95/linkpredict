Abstract: By employing the gradient/Wilson flow, we derive a universal formula that expresses a correctly normalized flavor non-singlet axial-vector current of quarks. The formula is universal in the sense that it holds independently of regularization and especially holds with lattice regularization. It is also confirmed that, in the lowest non-trivial order of perturbation theory, the triangle diagram containing the formula and two flavor non-singlet vector currents possesses non-local structure that is compatible with the triangle anomaly.
