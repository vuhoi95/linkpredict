Abstract: This work considers aspects of almost holomorphic and meromorphic Siegel modular forms from the perspective of physics and mathematics. The first part is concerned with (refined) topological string theory and the direct integration of the holomorphic anomaly equations. Here, a central object to compute higher genus amplitudes, which serve as the generating functions of various enumerative invariants, is provided by the so-called propagator. We derive a universal expression for the propagator for geometries that have mirror curves of genus two which is given by the derivative of the logarithm of Igusa's cusp form of weight 10. In addition, we illustrate our findings by solving the refined topological string on the resolutions of the three toric orbifolds of order three, five and six. In the second part, we give explicit expressions for lowering and raising operators on Siegel modular forms, and define almost holomorphic Siegel modular forms based on them. Extending the theory of Fourier-Jacobi expansions to almost holomorphic Siegel modular forms and building up on recent work by Pitale, Saha, and Schmidt, we can show that there is no analogue of the almost holomorphic elliptic second Eisenstein series. In the case of genus 2, we provide an almost meromorphic substitute for it. This, in particular, leads us to a generalization of Ramanujan's differential equation for the second Eisenstein series. The two parts are intertwined by the observation that the meromorphic analogue of the almost holomorphic second Eisenstein series coincides with the physical propagator. In addition, the generalized Ramanujan identities match precisely the physical consistency conditions that need to be imposed on the propagator.
