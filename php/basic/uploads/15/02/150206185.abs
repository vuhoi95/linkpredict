Title: One-loop partition function of three-dimensional flat gravity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Hernan A. Gonzalez and Alexander Maloney and Blagoje Oblak
Abstract: In this note we point out that the one-loop partition function of three-dimensional flat gravity, computed along the lines originally developed for the anti-de Sitter case, reproduces characters of the BMS3 group.
