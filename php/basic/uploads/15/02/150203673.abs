Title: Higher Order Deformations of Complex Structures
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and Duong H. Phong
Abstract: Deformations of complex structures by finite Beltrami differentials are considered on general Riemann surfaces. Exact formulas to any fixed order are derived for the corresponding deformations of the period matrix, Green's functions, and correlation functions in conformal field theories with vanishing total central charge. The stress tensor is shown to give a simple representation of these deformations valid to all orders. Such deformation formulas naturally enter into the evaluation of superstring amplitudes at two-loop order with Ramond punctures, and at higher loop order, in the supergravity formulation of the RNS superstring.
