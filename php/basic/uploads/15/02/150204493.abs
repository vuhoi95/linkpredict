Title: Holographic mesons in global Pilch-Warner background geometry
Authors: R. C. Rashkov and T. Vetsov
Abstract: In this paper we study D-brane scalar fluctuations in global Pilch-Warner background geometry. We consider configurations of the probe branes compatible with the kappa symmetry preserving condition and the brane classical equations of motion. The corresponding meson spectra, obtained by the fluctuations along the transverse brane directions, admit equidistant structure for the higher modes, but some of them show additional shifts in their ground states.
