Title: Graviton Amplitudes from Collinear Limits of Gauge Amplitudes
Authors: Stephan Stieberger and Tomasz R. Taylor
Abstract: We express all tree-level graviton amplitudes in Einstein's gravity as the collinear limits of a linear combination of pure Yang-Mills amplitudes in which each graviton is represented by two gauge bosons, each of them carrying exactly one half of graviton's momentum and helicity.
