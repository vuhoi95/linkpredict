Title: Power spectra in extended tachyon cosmologies
Authors: Iván E. Sánchez G. and Osvaldo P. Santillán
Abstract: In the present work the power spectrum of a particular class of tachyon fields is compared with the one corresponding to a cosmological constant model. This is done for different barotropic indexes $\gamma_0$ and the background space time is assumed to be of the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker type. The differential equation describing the perturbations is solved numerically and the power spectrum at the scale factor value $a=1$ is plotted for each case. The result is that the power spectrum of the standard tachyon field differs in many magnitude orders from the $\Lambda$CDM. However, the one with $\gamma_0=1.91$, which corresponds to a complementary tachyon field, coincides fairly well with the concordance model. Therefore, we conclude that the perturbed solutions constitute an effective method to distinguish between the different $\gamma_0$ values for the tachionization $\Lambda$CDM model and the fiducial model. The Statefinder parameters $\{r, s\}$, measuring the deviations of the analysed model from the concordance model, are also explicitly calculated. Our result suggest that, depending on the value of $\gamma_0$, these models can explain the observed expansion history or the perturbation power spectrum of the universe, but they may have problems in describing both features simultaneously.
