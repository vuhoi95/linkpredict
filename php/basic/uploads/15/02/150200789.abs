Title: Gauge extension of non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetry
Authors: Florian Beye and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Shogo Kuwakino
Abstract: We investigate a gauge theory realization of non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries and apply the gauge enhancement mechanism in heterotic orbifold models to field-theoretical model building. Several phenomenologically interesting non-Abelian discrete symmetries are realized effectively from a $U(1)$ gauge theory with a permutation symmetry. We also construct a concrete model for the lepton sector based on a $U(1)^2 \rtimes S_3$ symmetry.
