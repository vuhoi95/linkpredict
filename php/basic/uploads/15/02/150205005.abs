Abstract: The supergravity (SUGRA) theories with exact global $U(1)$ symmetry or shift symmetry in K\"ahler potential provide the natural frameworks for inflation. However, the quadratic inflation is disfavoured by the new results on primordial tensor fluctuations from the Planck Collaboration. To be consistent with the new Planck data, we point out that the explicit symmetry breaking is needed, and study these two SUGRA inflation in details. For the SUGRA inflation with global $U(1)$ symmetry, the symmetry breaking term leads to a trigonometric modulation on inflaton potential. The coefficient of the $U(1)$ symmetry breaking term is of the order $10^{-2}$, which is sufficient large to improve the inflationary predictions while its higher order corrections are negligible. Such models predict sizeable tensor fluctuations and highly agree with the Planck results. In particular, the model with a linear $U(1)$ symmetry breaking term predicts the tensor-to-scalar ratio around $\textbf{r}\sim0.01$ and running spectral index $\alpha_s\sim-0.004$, which comfortably fit with the Planck observations. For the SUGRA inflation with breaking shift symmetry, the inflaton potential is modulated by an exponential factor. The modulated linear and quadratic models are consistent with the Planck observations. In both kinds of models the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be of the order $10^{-2}$, which will be tested by the near future observations.
