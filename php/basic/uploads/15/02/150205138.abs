Title: Inflation with Massive Vector Fields
Authors: Junyu Liu and Yi Wang and Siyi Zhou
Abstract: We investigate the coupling between the inflaton and massive vector fields. All renormalizable couplings with shift symmetry of the inflaton are considered. The massive vector can be decomposed into a scalar mode and a divergence-free vector mode. We show that the former naturally interacts with the inflaton and the latter decouples at tree level. The model in general predicts $f_{NL}^\mathrm{equil} = \mathcal{O}(1)$, while in some regions of the parameter space large non-Gaussianity can arise.
