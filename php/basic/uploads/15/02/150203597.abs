Abstract: We investigate two classes of models of quintessential inflation, based upon canonical as well as noncanonical scalar fields. In particular, introducing potentials steeper than the standard exponential, we construct models that can give rise to a successful inflationary phase, with signatures consistent with Planck 2015 results. Additionally, using nonminimal coupling of the scalar field with massive neutrino matter, we obtain the standard thermal history of the Universe, with late-time cosmic acceleration as the last stage of evolution. In both cases, inflation and late-time acceleration are connected by a tracker solution.
