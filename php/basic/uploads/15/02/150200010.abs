Title: Notes on the BMS group in three dimensions: II. Coadjoint representation
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Blagoje Oblak
Abstract: The coadjoint representation of the BMS$_3$ group, which governs the covariant phase space of three-dimensional asymptotically flat gravity, is investigated. In particular, we classify coadjoint BMS$_3$ orbits and show that intrinsic angular momentum is free of supertranslation ambiguities. Finally, the link with induced representations upon geometric quantization is discussed.
