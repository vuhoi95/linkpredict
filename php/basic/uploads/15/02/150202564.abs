Abstract: In this work we deal with the presence of braneworld solutions in a five-dimensional space-time with a single extra spatial dimension of infinite extent. The braneworld scenario is built under the presence of a single real scalar field, and we modify the gravity sector to include generic function of the Gauss-Bonnet term. We study several specific models, and we construct exact braneworld solutions, in particular for including the Gauss-Bonnet term at first and second order power. As an interesting result, we show that the brane tends to split for a specific modification in the gravity sector, in the presence of non constant Gauss-Bonnet term.
