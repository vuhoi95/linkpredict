Title: Moduli Space Dynamics of Noncommutative U(2) Instantons
Authors: Andrew Iskauskas and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We consider the low energy dynamics of charge two instantons on noncommutative $\mathbb{R}^{2}_{NC}\times\mathbb{R}^{2}_{NC}$ in U(2) 5-dimensional super-Yang-Mills, using the Manton approximation for slow-moving instantons to calculate the moduli space metric. By employing the ADHM construction, we are able to understand some aspects of the geometry and topology of the system. We also consider the effect of adding a potential to the moduli space, giving scattering results for noncommutative dyonic instantons.
