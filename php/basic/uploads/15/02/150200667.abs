Title: Galilean invariance at quantum Hall edge
Authors: Sergej Moroz and Carlos Hoyos and Leo Radzihovsky
Abstract: We construct the theory of a chiral Luttinger liquid that lives on the boundary of a Galilean invariant quantum Hall fluid. In contrast to previous studies, Galilean invariance of the total (bulk plus edge) theory is guaranteed. We consider electromagnetic response at the edge and calculate momentum- and frequency-dependent electric conductivity and argue that its experimental measurement can provide a new means to determine the shift and bulk Hall viscosity.
