Title: Smeared antibranes polarise in AdS
Authors: Fridrik Freyr Gautason and Brecht Truijen and Thomas Van Riet
Abstract: In the recent literature it has been questioned whether the local backreaction of antibranes in flux throats can induce a perturbative brane-flux decay. Most evidence for this can be gathered for D6 branes and Dp branes smeared over 6-p compact directions, in line with the absence of finite temperature solutions for these cases. The solutions in the literature have flat worldvolume geometries and non-compact transversal spaces. In this paper we consider what happens when the worldvolume is AdS and the transversal space is compact. We show that in these circumstances brane polarisation smoothens out the flux singularity, which is an indication that brane-flux decay is prevented. This is consistent with the fact that the cosmological constant would be less negative after brane-flux decay. Our results extend recent results on AdS_7 solutions from D6 branes to AdS_(p+1) solutions from Dp branes. We show that supersymmetry of the AdS solutions depend on p non-trivially.
