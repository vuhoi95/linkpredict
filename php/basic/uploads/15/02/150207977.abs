Title: RÃ©nyi generalizations of quantum information measures
Authors: Mario Berta and Kaushik P. Seshadreesan and Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Quantum information measures such as the entropy and the mutual information find applications in physics, e.g., as correlation measures. Generalizing such measures based on the R\'enyi entropies is expected to enhance their scope in applications. We prescribe R\'enyi generalizations for any quantum information measure which consists of a linear combination of von Neumann entropies with coefficients chosen from the set {-1,0,1}. As examples, we describe R\'enyi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information, some quantum multipartite information measures, and the topological entanglement entropy. Among these, we discuss the various properties of the R\'enyi conditional quantum mutual information and sketch some potential applications. We conjecture that the proposed R\'enyi conditional quantum mutual informations are monotone increasing in the R\'enyi parameter, and we have proofs of this conjecture for some special cases.
