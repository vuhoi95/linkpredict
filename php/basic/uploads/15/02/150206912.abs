Title: Scalar perturbations in cosmological models with dark energy - dark  matter interaction
Authors: Maxim Eingorn and Claus Kiefer
Abstract: Scalar cosmological perturbations are investigated in the framework of a model with interacting dark energy and dark matter. In addition to these constituents, the inhomogeneous Universe is supposed to be filled with the standard noninteracting constituents corresponding to the conventional $\Lambda$CDM model. The interaction term is chosen in the form of a linear combination of dark sector energy densities with evolving coefficients. The methods of discrete cosmology are applied, and strong theoretical constraints on the parameters of the model are derived. A brief comparison with observational data is performed.
