Title: OPE of the stress tensors and surface operators
Authors: Xing Huang and Ling-Yan Hung and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We demonstrate that the divergent terms in the OPE of a stress tensor and a surface operator of general shape cannot be constructed only from local geometric data depending only on the shape of the surface. We verify this holographically at d=3 for Wilson line operators or equivalently the twist operator corresponding to computing the entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We discuss possible implications of this result.
