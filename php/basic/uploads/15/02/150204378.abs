Title: A physical version of the QCD confinement scale(s)
Authors: H. M. Fried and P. H. Tsang
Abstract: We suggest a physical definition of the confinement mass scale in QCD in the framework of non-perturbative, gauge invariant QCD, where all possible gluons exchanged between any pair of quark lines are included; and we insist that a stable, quark bound state should not and must not have transverse quark fluctuations larger than the Compton wavelength of the bound state particle itself. This is possible in our QCD formulation because there are two parameters which describe confinement, a mass scale $\mu$, and a "deformation parameter" $\xi$, which shrinks the transverse-quark-coordinate separation distribution $\varphi(b)$ away from Gaussian. With the mass scale $\mu$ defined as equal to the mass of each quark bound state, we show that $\xi$ decreases with increasing bound state mass, $m_{BS}$, using order-of-magnitude estimates which agree with obvious intuition. Our $\xi$-values, including a calculation for the recently detected 4-quark system, display the predicted behavior: $\xi$ decreases with increasing $m_{BS}$. Our results for $\varphi(b)$, when the quark bound state is a nucleon or heavier, then show agreement with the form of Gaussian momentum-space fall-offs in recent Light-Front holographic analyses.
