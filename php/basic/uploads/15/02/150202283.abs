Title: Configurational Entropy in Brane-world Models: A New Approach to  Stability
Authors: R. A. C. Correa and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: In this work we investigate the entropic information on thick brane-worlds scenarios and its consequences. The brane-world entropic information is studied for the sine-Gordon model is and hence the brane-world entropic information measure is shown an accurate way for providing the most suitable values for the bulk AdS curvature. Besides, the brane-world configurational entropy is employed to demonstrate a high organisational degree in the structure of the system configuration, for large values of a parameter of the sine-Gordon model but the one related to the AdS curvature. The Gleiser and Stamatopoulos procedure is finally applied in order to achieve a precise correlation between the energy of the system and the brane-world configurational entropy.
