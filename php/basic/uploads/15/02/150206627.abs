Title: Integrability and unitarity
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Brenda Penante and Gabriele Travaglini and Donovan Young
Abstract: We show how generalised unitarity can be used to determine the one-loop dilatation operator in N=4 super Yang-Mills. Our analysis focuses on two sectors, namely the bosonic SO(6) sector and the SU(2|3) sector. The calculation is performed on shell, with no off-shell information introduced at any stage. In this way, we establish a direct connection between scattering amplitudes and the dilatation operator of the N=4 theory.
