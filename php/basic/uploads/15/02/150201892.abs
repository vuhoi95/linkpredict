Title: Breakdown of the semiclassical approximation during the early stages of  preheating
Authors: Paul R. Anderson and Carmen Molina-Paris and Dillon H. Sanders
Abstract: The validity of the semiclassical approximation is investigated during the preheating phase in models of chaotic inflation using a modification of a criterion previously proposed for semiclassical gravity. If the modified criterion is violated then fluctuations of the two-point function for the quantum fields are large and the semiclassical approximation is not valid. Evidence is provided that the semiclassical approximation breaks down during the early stages of preheating, well before either scattering effects or backreaction effects are important.
