Title: Decay of False Vacuum via Fuzzy Monopole in String Theory
Authors: Aya Kasai and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We investigate dielectric branes in false vacua in Type IIB string theory. The dielectric branes are supported against collapsing by lower energy vacua inside spherical or tube-like branes. We claim that such branes can be seeds for semi-classical (or quantum mechanical) decay of the false vacua, which makes the life-time of the false vacua shorter. Also, we discuss a topology change of a bubble corresponding to the fuzzy monopole triggered by dissolving fundamental strings.
