Title: Analytic solutions of the relativistic Boltzmann equation
Authors: Yoshitaka Hatta and Mauricio Martinez and Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: We present new analytic solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation. We first obtain spherically expanding solutions which are the kinetic counterparts of the exact solutions of the Israel-Stewart equation in the literature. This allows us to compare the solutions of the kinetic and hydrodynamic equations at an analytical level. We then derive a novel boost-invariant solution of the Boltzmann equation which has an unconventional dependence on the proper time. The existence of such a solution is also suggested in second order hydrodynamics and fluid-gravity correspondence.
