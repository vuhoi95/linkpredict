Title: Determining an asymptotically AdS spacetime from data on its conformal  boundary
Authors: Alberto Enciso and Niky Kamran
Abstract: An outstanding question lying at the core of the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory is the holographic prescription problem for Einstein metrics, which asserts that one can slightly perturb the conformal geometry at infinity of the anti-de Sitter space and still obtain an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime that satisfies the Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant. The purpose of this paper is to address this question by providing a precise quantitative statement of the real-time holographic principle for Einstein spacetimes, to outline its proof and to discuss its physical implications.
