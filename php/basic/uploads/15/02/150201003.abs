Title: Cosmological black holes and white holes with time-dependent mass
Authors: Alan M. da Silva and Daniel C. Guariento and C. Molina
Abstract: We consider the causal structure of generalized uncharged McVittie spacetimes with increasing central mass $m (t)$ and positive Hubble factor $H (t)$. Under physically reasonable conditions, namely, a big bang singularity in the past, a positive cosmological constant and an upper limit to the central mass, we prove that the patch of the spacetime described by the cosmological time and areal radius coordinates is always geodesically incomplete, which implies the presence of event horizons in the spacetime. We also show that, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the $m$ and $H$ functions, the generalized McVittie spacetime can have a single black hole, a black-hole/white-hole pair or, differently from classic fixed-mass McVittie, a single white hole. A simple criterion is given to distinguish the different causal structures.
