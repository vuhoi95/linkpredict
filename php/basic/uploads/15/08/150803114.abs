Title: Chiral anomaly in Dirac semimetals due to dislocations
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Mikhail Zubkov
Abstract: The dislocation in Dirac semimetal carries an emergent magnetic flux parallel to the dislocation axis. We show that due to the emergent magnetic field the dislocation accommodates a single fermion massless mode of the corresponding low-energy one-particle Hamiltonian. The mode is propagating along the dislocation with its spin directed parallel to the dislocation axis. In agreement with the chiral anomaly observed in Dirac semimetals, an external electric field results in the spectral flow of the one-particle Hamiltonian, in pumping of the fermionic quasiparticles out from the vacuum, and in creating a nonzero axial (chiral) charge in the vicinity of the dislocation.
