Title: Supersymmetry Constraints and String Theory on K3
Authors: Ying-Hsuan Lin and Shu-Heng Shao and Yifan Wang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We study supervertices in six dimensional (2,0) supergravity theories, and derive supersymmetry non-renormalization conditions on the 4- and 6-derivative four-point couplings of tensor multiplets. As an application, we obtain exact non-perturbative results of such effective couplings in type IIB string theory compactified on K3 surface, extending previous work on type II/heterotic duality. The weak coupling limit thereof, in particular, gives certain integrated four-point functions of half-BPS operators in the nonlinear sigma model on K3 surface, that depend nontrivially on the moduli, and capture worldsheet instanton contributions.
