Abstract: We find a new type of topological vortex solution in the $U(1)_Z \times U(1)_A$ Chern Simons gauge theory in the presence of a $U(1)_A$ magnetic field background. In this theory $U(1)_Z$ is broken spontaneously by the $U(1)_A$ magnetic field. These vortices exhibit long range interactions as they are charged under the unbroken $U(1)_A$. They deplete the $U(1)_A$ magnetic field near their core and also break both $C$ and $P$ symmetries. Understanding the nature of these vortices sheds light on the ground state structure of the superconductivity studied in [1]. We also study the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in this class of theories and point out that superconductivity can be achieved at high temperatures by increasing the $U(1)_A$ magnetic field.
