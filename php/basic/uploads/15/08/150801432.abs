Title: Proof of the fundamental BCJ relations for QCD amplitudes
Authors: Leonardo de la Cruz and Alexander Kniss and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: The fundamental BCJ-relation is a linear relation between primitive tree amplitudes with different cyclic orderings. The cyclic orderings differ by the insertion place of one gluon. The coefficients of the fundamental BCJ-relation are linear in the Lorentz invariants $2 p_i p_j$. The BCJ-relations are well established for pure gluonic amplitudes as well as for amplitudes in ${\mathcal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. Recently, it has been conjectured that the BCJ-relations hold also for QCD amplitudes. In this paper we give a proof of this conjecture. The proof is valid for massless and massive quarks.
