Title: Vacuum currents in braneworlds on AdS bulk with compact dimensions
Authors: S. Bellucci and A. A. Saharian and V. Vardanyan
Abstract: The two-point function and VEV of the current density are investigated for a massive charged scalar field with arbitrary curvature coupling in the geometry of a brane on background of AdS spacetime with partial toroidal compactification.The presence of a gauge field flux enclosed by compact dimensions is assumed.On the brane the field obeys Robin boundary condition and along compact dimensions periodicity conditions with general phases are imposed.There is a range in the space of values for the coefficient in the boundary condition where Poincare vacuum is unstable.This range depends on the brane location.In models with compact dimensions the stability condition is less restrictive than for AdS bulk with trivial topology.Vacuum charge density and components of current along non-compact dimensions vanish. VEV of the current density along compact dimensions is a periodic function of the gauge field flux with a period equal to the flux quantum.It is decomposed into the boundary-free and brane-induced contributions.The asymptotic behavior of the latter is investigated near the brane, AdS boundary and horizon.In contrast to VEVs of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor, current density is finite on brane and vanishes for the special case of Dirichlet boundary condition.Both boundary-free and brane-induced contributions vanish on AdS boundary.Brane-induced contribution vanishes on the horizon and for points near the horizon the current is dominated by the boundary-free part.In the near-horizon limit, the latter is connected to the corresponding quantity for a massless field in the Minkowski bulk by a simple conformal relation.Depending on the value of the Robin coefficient, the presence of the brane can either increase or decrease the vacuum currents. Applications are given for a higher-dimensional version of the Randall-Sundrum 1-brane model
