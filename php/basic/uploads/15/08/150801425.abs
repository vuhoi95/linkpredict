Title: Gamma Lines from Majorana Dark Matter
Authors: Michael Duerr and Pavel Fileviez Perez and Juri Smirnov
Abstract: We discuss simple models which predict the existence of significant gamma-ray fluxes from dark matter annihilation. In this context the dark matter candidate is a Majorana fermion with velocity-suppressed tree-level annihilation into Standard Model fermions but unsuppressed annihilation into photons. These gamma lines can easily be distinguished from the continuum and provide a possibility to test these models.
