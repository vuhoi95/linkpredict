Abstract: We formulate new integration rules for one-loop scattering equations analogous to those at tree-level, and test them in a number of non-trivial cases for amplitudes in scalar $\phi^3$-theory. This formalism greatly facilitates the evaluation of amplitudes in the CHY representation at one-loop order, without the need to explicitly sum over the solutions to the loop-level scattering equations.
