Title: Canonical Realization of BMS Symmetry. Quadratic Casimir
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Giorgio Longhi
Abstract: We study the canonical realization of BMS symmetry for a massive scalar field introduced in reference \cite{LM}. We will construct an invariant scalar product for the generalized momenta. As a consequence we will introduce a quadratic Casimir with the supertranslations.
