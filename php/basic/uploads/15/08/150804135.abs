Title: Gravity duals of N=(0,2) SCFTs from M5-branes
Authors: Ibrahima Bah and Vasilis Stylianou
Abstract: We describe the general BPS system that governs the gravity duals of N=(0,2) two-dimensional superconformal field theories in the low-energy limit of M5-branes on a four-manifold, M4. In order to preserve supersymmetry, we restrict to cases where the four-manifold is embedded in a Calabi-Yau fourfold that is a sum of two line bundles over M4. We further reduce the N=(0,2) system to describe the gravity duals of SCFTs with N=(0,4) and N=(2,2) supersymmetry. In the first case, the solutions fit in the larger class of AdS3xS2xCY3 solutions of M-theory dual to N=(0,4) SCFTs. In the case of the N=(2,2) theories, the near-horizon limit of M4 is necessarily a product of two constant curvature Riemann surfaces whose metrics are governed by a pair of Liouville equations.
