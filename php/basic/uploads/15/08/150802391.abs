Title: Revisiting N=4 superconformal blocks
Authors: Agnese Bissi and Tomasz Lukowski
Abstract: We study four-point correlation functions of four generic half-BPS supermultiplets of N=4 SCFT in four dimensions. We use the two-particle Casimir of four-dimensional superconformal algebra to derive superconformal blocks which contribute to the partial wave expansion of such correlators. The derived blocks are defined on analytic superspace and allow us in principle to find any component of the four-point correlator. The lowest component of the result agrees with the superconformal blocks found by Dolan and Osborn.
