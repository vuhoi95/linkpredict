Authors: Xian-Hui Ge and Jia-Rui Sun and Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: With the attempt to find the holographic description of usual acoustic black holes in fluid, we construct an acoustic black hole formed in the $d$-dimensional fluid located at the timelike cutoff surface of a neutral black brane in asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ spacetime, the bulk gravitational dual of the acoustic black hole is presented at first order of the hydrodynamic fluctuation. Moreover, the Hawking-like temperature of the acoustic black hole horizon is showed to be connected to the Hawking temperature of the real AdS black brane in the bulk, and the duality between the phonon scattering in the acoustic black hole and the sound channel quasinormal mode propagating in the bulk perturbed AdS black brane is extracted. We thus point out that, the acoustic black hole appeared in fluid, which was originally proposed as an analogous model to simulate Hawking radiation of the real black hole, is not merely an analogy, it can indeed be used to describe specific properties of the real AdS black holes, in the spirits of the fluid/gravity duality.
