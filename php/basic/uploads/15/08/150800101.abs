Abstract: In terms of Sturm's theorem, we reexamine a marginal stable circular orbit (MSCO) such as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a timelike geodesic in any spherically symmetric and static spacetime. MSCOs for some of exact solutions to the Einstein's equation are discussed. Strum's theorem is explicitly applied to the Kottler (often called Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetime. Moreover, we analyze MSCOs for a spherically symmetric, static and vacuum solution in Weyl conformal gravity.
