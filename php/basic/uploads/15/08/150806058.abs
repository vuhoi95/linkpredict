Title: Noncommutative de Sitter and FRW spaces
Authors: Maja Buric and John Madore
Abstract: Several versions of fuzzy four-dimensional de Sitter space are constructed using the noncommutative frame formalism. Although all noncommutative spacetimes which are found have commutative de Sitter metric as a classical limit, the algebras and the differential calculi which define them have many differences which we derive and discuss.
