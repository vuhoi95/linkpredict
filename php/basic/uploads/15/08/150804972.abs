Title: From Petrov-Einstein-Dilaton-Axion to Navier-Stokes equation in  anisotropic model
Authors: Wen-Jian Pan and Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the previous works to the case that the near-horizon dynamics of the Einstein-Dilaton-Axion theory can be governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation via imposing the Petrov-like boundary condition on hypersurfaces in the non-relativistic and near-horizon limit. The dynamical shear viscosity $\eta$ of such dual horizon fluid in our scenario, which isotropically saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinet (KSS) bound, is independent of both the dilaton field and axion field in that limit.
