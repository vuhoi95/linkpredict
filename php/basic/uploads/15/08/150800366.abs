Title: Complete action for open superstring field theory
Authors: Hiroshi Kunitomo and Yuji Okawa
Abstract: We construct a complete action for open superstring field theory that includes the Neveu-Schwarz sector and the Ramond sector. For the Neveu-Schwarz sector, we use the string field in the large Hilbert space of the superconformal ghost sector, and the action in the Neveu-Schwarz sector is the same as the Wess-Zumino-Witten-like action of the Berkovits formulation. For the Ramond sector, it is known that the BRST cohomology on an appropriate subspace of the small Hilbert space reproduces the correct spectrum, and we use the string field projected to this subspace. We show that the action is invariant under gauge transformations that are consistent with the projection for the string field in the Ramond sector.
