Abstract: We study the Hawking radiation of 3D rotating hairy black holes. More concretely, we compute the transition probability of a bosonic and fermionic particle in such backgrounds. Thew, we show that the transition probability is independent of the nature of the particle. It is observed that the charge of the scalar hair B and the rotation parameter a control such a probability.
