Title: Scaling symmetry and scalar hairy rotating AdS_3 black holes
Authors: Byoungjoon Ahn and Seungjoon Hyun and Sang-A Park and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: By using the scaling symmetry in the reduced action formalism, we derive the novel Smarr relation which holds even for the hairy rotating AdS_3 black holes. And then, by using the Smarr relation we argue that the hairy rotating AdS_3 black holes are stable thermodynamically, compared to the non-hairy ones.
