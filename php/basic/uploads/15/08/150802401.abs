Title: A Stueckelberg Approach to Quadratic Curvature Gravity and its  Decoupling Limits
Authors: Kurt Hinterbichler and Mehdi Saravani
Abstract: Curvature squared terms, when added to the Einstein-Hilbert action and treated non-perturbatively, generically result in the propagation of an extra massive scalar state and an extra massive spin-2 ghost state. Using the Stueckelberg trick, we study the high-energy limit in which the mass of the spin-2 state is taken to zero, with strong- coupling scales held fixed. The Stueckelberg approach makes transparent the interplay between the ghost graviton and the healthy graviton which allows the theory to evade the usual lambda-3 strong coupling scale of massive gravity and become renormalizable, at the expense of stability.
