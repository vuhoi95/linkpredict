Title: Lorentz Symmetry Breaking in $\mathcal{N} =2$ Superspace
Authors: Mir Faizal and Prince A. Ganai
Abstract: In this paper, we will study the deformation of a three dimensional theory with $\mathcal{N} =2$ supersymmetry. This theory will be deformed by the presence of a constant vector field. This deformation will break the Lorentz symmetry. So, we will analyse this theory using $\mathcal{N} =2$ aether superspace. The $\mathcal{N} =2$ aether superspace will be obtained from a deformation of the usual $\mathcal{N} =2$ superspace. This will be done by deforming the generators of the three dimensional $\mathcal{N} =2$ supersymmetry. After analysing this deformed superalgebra, we will derive an explicit expression for the superspace propagators in this deformed superspace. Finally, we will use these propagators for performing perturbative calculations.
