Abstract: We study the $T^2$ compactification of a class of 6d $\mathcal{N}{=}(1,0)$ theories that is Higgsable to $\mathcal{N}{=}(2,0)$ theories. We show that the resulting 4d $\mathcal{N}{=}2$ theory at the origin of the Coulomb branch and the parameter space is generically given by two superconformal matter sectors coupled by an infrared-free gauge multiplet and another conformal gauge multiplet. Our analysis utilizes the 5d theories obtained by putting the same class of 6d theories on $S^1$. Our class includes, among others, the 6d theories describing multiple M5 branes on an ALE singularity, and we analyze them in detail. The resulting 4d theory has manifestly both the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and the full flavor symmetry. We also discuss in detail the special cases of 6d theories where the infrared-free gauge multiplet is absent. In an appendix, we give a field-theoretical argument for an F-theoretic constraint that forbids a particular 6d anomaly-free matter content, as an application of our analysis.
