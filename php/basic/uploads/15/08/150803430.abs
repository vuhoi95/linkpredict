Title: A note on oscillating strings in $AdS_3 \times S^3$ with mixed  three-form fluxes
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Kamal L. Panigrahi and Manoranjan Samal
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the pulsating string solutions in AdS3 x S3 supported by both RR and NS-NS fluxes. This background has recently been proved to be integrable. We find the dispersion relation between the energy, oscillation number and other conserved charges when the NS-NS flux turned on is small. We further discuss the fate of the string solutions in pure RR and NS-NS cases.
