Title: Cohomological Hall algebras, semicanonical bases and Donaldson-Thomas  invariants for $2$-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories (with an appendix by Ben  Davison)
Authors: Jie Ren and Yan Soibelman
Abstract: We discuss semicanonical bases from the point of view of Cohomological Hall algebras via the "dimensional reduction" from 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories to 2-dimensional ones. Also, we discuss the notion of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants (as defined by M. Kontsevich and Y. Soibelman) in the framework of 2-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories. In particular we propose a conjecture which allows one to define Kac polynomials for a 2-dimensional Calabi-Yau category (this is a theorem of S. Mozgovoy in the case of preprojective algebras).
