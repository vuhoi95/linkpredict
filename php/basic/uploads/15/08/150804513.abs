Title: Vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction in radiative processes of  entangled states
Authors: G. Menezes and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We investigate radiative processes of inertial two-level atoms in an entangled state interacting with a quantum electromagnetic field. Our intention is to clarify and to analyze the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the decay rate of the entangled state. The possible relevance of the findings in the present work is discussed.
