Title: P-wave holographic superconductor/insulator phase transitions affected  by dark matter sector
Authors: Marek Rogatko and Karol I. Wysokinski
Abstract: The holographic approach to building the p-wave superconductors results in three different models: the Maxwell-vector, the SU(2) Yang-Mills and the helical. In the probe limit approximation, we analytically examine the properties of the first two models in the theory with {\it dark matter} sector. It turns out that the effect of {\it dark matter} on the Maxwell-vector p-wave model is the same as on the s-wave superconductor studied earlier. For the non-Abelian model we study the phase transitions between p-wave holographic insulator/superconductor and metal/superconductor. Studies of marginally stable modes in the theory under consideration allow us to determine features of p-wave holographic droplet in a constant magnetic field. The dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on the coupling constant $\alpha$ to the {\it dark matter} sector is affected by the {\it dark matter} density $\rho_D$. For $\rho_D>\rho$ the transition temperature is a decreasing function of $\alpha$. The critical chemical potential $\mu_c$ for the quantum phase transition between insulator and metal depends on the chemical potential of dark matter $\mu_D$ and for $\mu_D=0$ is a decreasing function of $\alpha$.
