Title: On the Global Structure of Deformed Yang-Mills Theory and QCD(adj) on  $\mathbb R^3 \times \mathbb S^1$
Authors: Mohamed M. Anber and Erich Poppitz
Abstract: Spatial compactification on $\mathbb R^{3} \times \mathbb S^1_L$ at small $\mathbb S^1$-size $L$ often leads to a calculable vacuum structure, where various "topological molecules" are responsible for confinement and the realization of the center and discrete chiral symmetries. Within this semiclassically calculable framework, we study how distinct theories with the same $SU(N_c)/\mathbb Z_k$ gauge group (labeled by "discrete $\theta$-angles") arise upon gauging of appropriate $\mathbb Z_k$ subgroups of the one-form global center symmetry of an $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory. We determine the possible $\mathbb Z_k$ actions on the local electric and magnetic effective degrees of freedom, find the ground states, and use domain walls and confining strings to give a physical picture of the vacuum structure of the different $SU(N_c)/\mathbb Z_k$ theories. Some of our results reproduce ones from earlier supersymmetric studies, but most are new and do not invoke supersymmetry. We also study a further finite-temperature compactification to $\mathbb R^{2}\times \mathbb S^1_\beta\times\mathbb S^1_L$. We argue that, in deformed Yang-Mills theory, the effective theory near the deconfinement temperature $\beta_c \gg L$ exhibits an emergent Kramers-Wannier duality and that it exchanges high- and low-temperature theories with different global structure, sharing features with both the Ising model and $S$-duality in ${\cal N}$$=$$4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
