Title: Fractional Mellin Transform -- A possible application in CFT
Authors: R. A. Treumann and W. Baumjohann
Abstract: We propose a fractional variant of Mellin's transform which may find an application in the Conformal Field Theory. Its advantage is the presence of an arbitrary parameter which may substantially simplify calculations and help adjusting convergence.
