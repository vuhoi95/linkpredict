Title: Supermembrane limit of Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: We consider Yang-Mills theory with $N{=}1$ super translation group in eleven auxiliary dimensions as the structure group. The gauge theory is defined on a direct product manifold $\Sigma_3\times S^1$, where $\Sigma_3$ is a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold and $S^1$ is a circle. We show that in the infrared limit, when the metric on $S^1$ is scaled down, the Yang-Mills action supplemented by a Wess-Zumino-type term reduces to the action of an M2-brane.
