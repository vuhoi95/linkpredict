Title: Four-loop strong coupling beta-function in the Standard Model
Authors: A. V. Bednyakov and A. F. Pikelner
Abstract: In this letter we present our results for the four-loop beta-function of the strong coupling in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions. We take top-Yukawa and self-Higgs interactions into account, but neglect electroweak gauge couplings.
