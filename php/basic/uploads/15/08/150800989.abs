Title: Critical mass renormalization in renormalized phi4 theories in two and  three dimensions
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We consider the O(N)-symmetric phi4 theory in two and three dimensions and determine the nonperturbative mass renormalization needed to obtain the phi4 continuum theory. The required nonperturbative information is obtained by resumming high-order perturbative series in the massive renormalization scheme, taking into account their Borel summability and the known large-order behavior of the coefficients. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in lattice calculations.
