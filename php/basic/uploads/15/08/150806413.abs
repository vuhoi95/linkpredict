Title: Nonminimal derivative coupling scalar-tensor theories: odd-parity  perturbations and black hole stability
Authors: Adolfo Cisterna and Miguel Cruz and TÃ©rence Delsate and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: We derive the odd parity perturbation equation in scalar-tensor theories with a non minimal kinetic coupling sector of the general Horndeski theory, where the kinetic term is coupled to the metric and the Einstein tensor. We derive the potential of the perturbation, by identifying a master function and switching to tortoise coordinates. We then prove the mode stability under linear odd- parity perturbations of hairy black holes in this sector of Horndeski theory, when a cosmological constant term in the action is included. Finally, we comment on the existence of slowly rotating black hole solutions in this setup and discuss their implications on the physics of compact objects configurations, such as neutron stars.
