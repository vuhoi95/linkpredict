Title: The Effect of Primordial Non-Gaussianities on the Seeds of Super-Massive  Black Holes
Authors: Zeinab Sherkatghanad and Robert H. Brandenberger
Abstract: The origin of the seeds which develop into the observed super-massive black holes at high redshifts may be hard to interpret in the context of the standard $\Lambda CDM$ of early universe cosmology based on Gaussian primordial perturbations. Here we consider the modification of the halo mass function obtained by introducing skewness and kurtosis of the primordial fluctuations. We show that such primordial non-Gaussianities constrained by the current observational bounds on the nonlinearity parameters of $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$ are not effective at greatly increasing the number density of seeds which could develop into super-massive black holes at high redshifts. This is to be contrasted with the role which cosmic string loops could play in seeding super-massive black holes.
