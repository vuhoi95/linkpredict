Title: Thawing in a coupled quintessence model
Authors: M. Honardoost and H. Mohseni Sadjadi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We consider the thawing model in the framework of coupled quintessence model. The effective potential has $Z_2$ symmetry which is broken spontaneously when the dark matter density becomes less than a critical value leading the quintessence equation of state parameter to deviate from -1. Conditions required for this procedure are obtained and analytical solution for the equation of state parameter is derived.
