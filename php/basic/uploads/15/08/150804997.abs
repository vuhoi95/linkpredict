Abstract: Based on the inhomogeneous T-Q relation and the associated Bethe Ansatz equations obtained via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz, we construct the Bethe-type eigenstates of the SU(2)-invariant spin-s chain with generic non-diagonal boundaries by employing certain orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space.
