Title: Streched String with Self-Interaction at the Hagedorn Point: Spatial  Sizes and Black Hole
Authors: Yachao Qian and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We analyze the length, mass and spatial distribution of a discretized transverse string in $D_\perp$ dimensions with fixed end-points near its Hagedorn temperature. We suggest that such a string may dominate the (holographic) Pomeron kinematics for dipole-dipole scattering at intermediate and small impact parameters. Attractive self-string interactions cause the transverse string size to contract away from its diffusive size, a mechanism reminiscent of the string-black-hole transmutation. The string shows sizable asymmetries in the transverse plane that translate to primordial azimuthal asymmetries in the stringy particle production in the Pomeron kinematics for current pp and pA collisions at collider energies.
