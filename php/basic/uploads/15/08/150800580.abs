Title: The Quantum Hall Effect in Supersymmetric Chern-Simons Theories
Authors: David Tong and Carl Turner
Abstract: We introduce a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory whose low energy physics is that of the fractional quantum Hall effect. The supersymmetry allows us to solve the theory analytically. We quantise the vortices and, by relating their dynamics to a matrix model, show that their ground state wavefunction is in the same universality class as the Laughlin state. We further construct coherent state representations of the excitations of a finite number of vortices. These are quasi-holes. By an explicit computation of the Berry phase, without resorting to a plasma analogy, we show that these excitations have fractional charge and spin.
