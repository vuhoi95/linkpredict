Title: String duality transformations in $f(R)$ gravity from Noether symmetry  approach
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and S. J. Gabriele Gionti and Daniele Vernieri
Abstract: We select $f(R)$ gravity models that undergo scale factor duality transformations. As a starting point, we consider the tree-level effective gravitational action of bosonic String Theory coupled with the dilaton field. This theory inherits the Busher's duality of its parent String Theory. Using conformal transformations of the metric tensor, it is possible to map the tree-level dilaton-graviton string effective action into $f(R)$ gravity, relating the dilaton field to the Ricci scalar curvature. Furthermore, the duality can be framed under the standard of Noether symmetries and exact cosmological solutions are derived. Using suitable changes of variables, the string-based $f(R)$ Lagrangians are shown in cases where the duality transformation becomes a parity inversion.
