Title: Dirac equation and the Melvin Metric
Authors: Luis C. Nunes dos Santos and Celso C. Barros Jr
Abstract: A relativistic wave equation for spin 1/2 particles in the Melvin space-time, a space-time where the metric is determined by a magnectic field, is obtained. The effects of very intense magnetic fields in the energy levels, as intense as the ones expected to be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, are investigated.
