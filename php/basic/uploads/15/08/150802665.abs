Title: About the cosmological constant in geometric scalar theory of gravity
Authors: I. C. Jardim and R. R. Landim
Abstract: In this paper we study how to include the cosmological constant in geometric scalar theory of gravity (GSG). Firstly we show that the cosmological constant could not be modeled by a matter field, unlike in General Relativity. We also show that a spherically symmetric matter distribution, over the de Sitter vacuum, does not produce the Kottler solution and no black hole. To circumvent this problem we introduce an coupling term between the scalar field and the vacuum curvature in way to provide the Kottler solution. We also apply the original (GSGI) and the modified (GSGII) geometric scalar theory of gravity to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. A numerical analysis indicates that GSGII is most sensible to the cosmological constant them GSGI.
