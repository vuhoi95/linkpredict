Abstract: Starting from three minimal off-shell 4D, $\cal N$ = 1 supermultiplets, using constructions solely defined within the confines of the four dimensional field theory we show the existence of a "gadget" - a member of a class of metrics on the representation space of the supermultiplets - whose values directly and completely correspond to the values of a metric defined on the 1d, $N$ = 4 adinkra networks adjacency matrices corresponding to the projections of the four dimensional supermultiplets.
