Title: Gravity theory on Poisson manifold with $R$-flux
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Hisayoshi Muraki and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: A novel gravity theory based on Poisson Generalized Geometry is investigated. A gravity theory on a Poisson manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric is constructed from a contravariant version of the Levi-Civita connection, which is based on the Lie algebroid of a Poisson manifold. Then, we show that in Poisson Generalized Geometry the $R$-fluxes are consistently coupled with such a gravity. An $R$-flux appears as a torsion of the corresponding connection in a similar way as an $H$-flux which appears as a torsion of the connection for- mulated in the standard Generalized Geometry. We give an analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled with an $R$-flux, and show that it is invariant under both $\beta$-diffeomorphisms and $\beta$-gauge transformations.
