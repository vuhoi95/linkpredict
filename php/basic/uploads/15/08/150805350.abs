Title: Twistors and the massive spinning particle
Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Alasdair J. Routh and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: Gauge-invariant twistor variables are found for the massive spinning particle with N-extended local worldline supersymmetry, in spacetime dimensions D=3,4,6. The twistor action is manifestly Lorentz invariant but the anticommuting spin variables appear exactly as in the non-relativistic limit. This allows a simple confirmation that the quantum N=2 spinning particle has either spin one or spin zero, and that N>2 is quantum inconsistent for D=4,6.
