Title: On the new version of Generalized Zwei-Dreibein Gravity
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Adami
Abstract: In this paper we consider a generalization of zwei-dreibein gravity with a chern-Simons term associated to a constraint term which fixed the torsion. We count the local degrees of freedom of this model using Hamiltonian analysis and show that in contrast to the usual GZDG which has 2 bulk local degrees of freedom, our model has 3 propagating modes. Then by looking at the quadratic Lagrangian, we determine that these propagating modes are 3 massive graviton with different masses. Finally we obtain AdS wave solution as an example solution for this model.
