Title: Fluxes in F-theory Compactifications on Genus-One Fibrations
Authors: Ling Lin and Christoph Mayrhofer and Oskar Till and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We initiate the construction of gauge fluxes in F-theory compactifications on genus-one fibrations which only have a multi-section as opposed to a section. F-theory on such spaces gives rise to discrete gauge symmetries in the effective action. We generalize the transversality conditions on gauge fluxes known for elliptic fibrations by taking into account the properties of the available multi-section. We test these general conditions by constructing all vertical gauge fluxes in a bisection model with gauge group SU(5) x Z2. The non-abelian anomalies are shown to vanish. These flux solutions are dynamically related to fluxes on a fibration with gauge group SU(5) x U(1) by a conifold transition. Considerations of flux quantization reveal an arithmetic constraint on certain intersection numbers on the base which must necessarily be satisfied in a smooth geometry. Combined with the proposed transversality conditions on the fluxes these conditions are shown to imply cancellation of the discrete Z2 gauge anomalies as required by general consistency considerations.
