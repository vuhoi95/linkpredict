Title: New Spinor Fields on Lorentzian 7-Manifolds
Authors: L. Bonora and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: This paper deals with the classification of spinor fields according to the bilinear covariants in 7 dimensions. The previously investigated Riemannian case is characterized by either one spinor field class, in the real case of Majorana spinors, or three non-trivial classes in the most general complex case. In this paper we show that by imposing appropriate conditions on spinor fields in 7d manifolds with Lorentzian metric, the formerly obtained obstructions for new classes of spinor fields can be circumvented. New spinor fields classes are then explicitly constructed. In particular, on 7-manifolds with asymptotically flat black hole background, these spinors can define a generalized current density which further defines a time Killing vector at the spatial infinity.
