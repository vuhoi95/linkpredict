Title: Killing-Yano forms and Killing tensors on a warped space
Authors: Pavel Krtous and David Kubiznak and Ivan Kolar
Abstract: We formulate several criteria under which the symmetries associated with the Killing and Killing-Yano tensors on the base space can be lifted to the symmetries of the full warped geometry. The procedure is explicitly illustrated on several examples, providing new prototypes of spacetimes admitting such tensors. In particular, we study a warped product of two Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetimes and show that it gives rise to a new class of highly symmetric vacuum (with cosmological constant) black hole solutions that inherit many of the properties of the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS geometry.
