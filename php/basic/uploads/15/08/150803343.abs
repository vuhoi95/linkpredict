Title: Does three dimensional electromagnetic field inherit the spacetime  symmetries?
Authors: Maro Cvitan and Predrag Dominis Prester and Ivica SmoliÄ‡
Abstract: We prove that the electromagnetic field in a (1+2)-dimensional spacetime necessarily inherits the symmetries of the spacetime metric in a large class of generalized Einstein-Maxwell theories. The Lagrangians of the studied theories have general diff-covariant gravitational part and include both the gravitational and the gauge Chern-Simons terms.
