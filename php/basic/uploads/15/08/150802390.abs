Title: Evolution of Holographic Fermi Arcs from a Mott Insulator
Authors: Garrett Vanacore and Srinidhi T. Ramamurthy and Philip W. Phillips
Abstract: We study fermions in an electrically-probed and asymptotically anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild spacetime which interact via a novel chiral symmetry-preserving interaction. Computing the dual fermion two-point correlator, we show that this bulk interaction anisotropically gaps Fermi surfaces of the boundary spectrum. Consequently, the interaction we devise provides a holographic model for Fermi arcs seen ubiquitously in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates. Our interaction is a modification of the chiral symmetry-breaking Pauli coupling, which has previously been proposed as the holographic realization of Mott physics. The onset of Mott insulation and pseudogap physics are respectively discussed in the context of bulk chiral and boundary parity symmetry breaking, and the Mott transition is interpreted as a deconfinement transition of non-Fermi liquid excitations.
