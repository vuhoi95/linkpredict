Title: Thermofield Duality for Higher Spin Rindler Gravity
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kenta Suzuki
Abstract: We study the Thermo-field realization of the duality between the Rindler-AdS higher spin theory and $O(N)$ vector theory. The CFT represents a decoupled pair of free $O(N)$ vector field theories. It is shown how this decoupled domain CFT is capable of generating the connected Rindler-AdS background with the full set of Higher Spin fields.
