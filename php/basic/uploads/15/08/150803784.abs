Title: Entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems
Authors: Wen Wei Ho and Dmitry A. Abanin
Abstract: We study entanglement growth in quantum many-body systems and propose a method to experimentally measure it. We show that entanglement growth is related to the spreading of local operators. In ergodic systems, linear spreading of operators results in a universal, linear in time growth of entanglement for initial product states, in contrast to the logarithmic growth of entanglement in many-body localized (MBL) systems. Furthermore, we show that entanglement growth is directly related to the decay of the Loschmidt echo in a composite system comprised of many copies of the original system, subject to a perturbation that reconnects different parts of the system. Exponential decay of the Loschmidt echo, characteristic of ergodic systems, implies linear growth of entanglement. Our proposal to experimentally measure entanglement growth uses a quantum switch (two-level system) which controls connections in the composite system. By measuring only the switch's dynamics, the growth of the R\'enyi entropies can be extracted. Our work provides a way to directly probe dynamical properties of many-body systems, in particular, allowing for a direct observation of many-body localization.
