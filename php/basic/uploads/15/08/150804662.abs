Title: Lorentz symmetry breaking effects on relativistic EPR correlations
Authors: H. Belich and C. Furtado and K. Bakke
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry breaking effects on relativistic EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) correlations are discussed. From the modified Maxwell theory coupled to gravity, we establish a possible scenario of the Lorentz symmetry violation and write an effective metric for the Minkowski spacetime. Then, we obtain the Wigner rotation angle via the Fermi-Walker transport of spinors and consider the WKB ((Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation in order to study the influence of Lorentz symmetry breaking effects on the relativistic EPR correlations.
