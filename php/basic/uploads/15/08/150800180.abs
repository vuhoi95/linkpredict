Title: Bosonization approach for "atomic collapse" in graphene
Authors: Aya Kagimura and Tetsuya Onogi
Abstract: We study quantum electrodynamics with 2+1 dimensional massless Dirac fermion around a Coulomb impurity. Around a large charge with atomic number Z > 137, the QED vacuum is expected to collapse due to the strong Coulombic force. While the relativistic quantum mechanics fails to make reliable predictions for the fate of the vacuum, the heavy ion collision experiment also does not give clear understanding of this system. Recently, the "atomic collapse" resonances were observed on graphene where an artificial nuclei can be made. In this paper, we present our nonperturbative study of the vacuum structure of the quasiparticles in graphene with a charge impurity which contains multi-body effect using bosonization method.
