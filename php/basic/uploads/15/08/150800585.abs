Title: An Analysis of B-L=-2 Operators from Matter-Higgs Interactions in a  Class of Supersymmetric SO(10) Models
Authors: Pran Nath and Raza M. Syed
Abstract: Recently interest in GUT baryogenesis has been resurrected due to the observation that B-violating dimension seven operators that arise in grand unified theories that also violate B-L produce baryon asymmetry that cannot be wiped out by sphaleron processes. While a general analysis of such higher dimensional operators from a bottom up approach exists in the literature, a full analysis of them derived from grand unification does not exist. In this work we present a complete analysis of B-L=-2 operators within a realistic SO(10) grand unification where the doublet-triplet splitting is automatic via a missing partner mechanism. Specifically we compute all allowed dimension five, dimension seven and dimension nine operators arising from matter-Higgs interactions. The relative strength of all the allowed B-L=-2 operators is given. Such interactions are useful in the study of neutrino masses, baryogenesis, proton decay and $n-\bar n$ oscillations within a common realistic grand unification framework.
