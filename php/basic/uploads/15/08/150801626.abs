Authors: Naoto Yokoi and Masafumi Ishihara and Koji Sato and Eiji Saitoh
Abstract: A holographic realization for ferromagnetic systems has been constructed. Owing to the holographic dictionary proposed on the basis of this realization, we obtained relevant thermodynamic quantities such as magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and free energy. This holographic model reproduces the behavior of the mean field theory near the critical temperature. At low temperatures, the results automatically incorporate the contributions from spin wave excitations and conduction electrons.
