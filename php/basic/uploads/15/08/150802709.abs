Title: Classes of Stable Initial Data for Massless and Massive Scalars in  Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Nils Deppe and Andrew R. Frey
Abstract: Since horizon formation in global anti-de Sitter spacetime is dual to thermalization of a conformal field theory on a compact space, whether generic initial data is stable or unstable against gravitational collapse is of great interest. We argue that all the known stable initial data for massless scalars are dominated by single scalar eigenmodes, specifically providing strong numerical evidence consistent with the interpretation that initial data with equal energies in two modes collapse on time scales of order the inverse square of the amplitude. We further scan the parameter space for massive scalar field initial data and present evidence for a novel class of stable or quasi-stable solutions for massive scalars with energy spread through several eigenmodes.
