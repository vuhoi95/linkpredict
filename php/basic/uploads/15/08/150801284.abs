Authors: Angélica González and Román Linares and Marco Maceda and Oscar Sánchez-Santos
Abstract: We analyze noncommutative deformations of a higher dimensional anti-de Sitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole. Two models based on noncommutative inspired distributions of mass and charge are discussed and their thermodynamical properties are calculated. In the (3+1)-dimensional case, the equation of state and the Gibbs energy function of each model are found.
