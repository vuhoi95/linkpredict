Title: Supersymmetric geometries of IIA supergravity II
Authors: Ulf Gran and George Papadopoulos and Christian von Schultz
Abstract: We solve the Killing spinor equations of standard and massive IIA supergravities for a Killing spinor whose isotropy subgroup in Spin(9, 1) is SU(4) and identify the geometry of the spacetime. We demonstrate that the Killing spinor equations impose some mild constraints on the geometry of the spacetime which include the existence of a time-like Killing vector field which leaves the fields and the Killing spinor invariant.
