Title: Probability Distributions for Quantum Stress Tensors Measured in a  Finite Time Interval
Authors: Christopher J. Fewster and L. H. Ford
Abstract: A meaningful probability distribution for measurements of a quantum stress tensor operator can only be obtained if the operator is averaged in time or in spacetime. This averaging can be regarded as a description of the measurement process. Realistic measurements can be expected to begin and end at finite times, which means that they are described by functions with compact support, which we will also take to be smooth. Here we study the probability distributions for stress tensor operators averaged with such functions of time, in the vacuum state of a massless free field. Our primary aim is to understand the asymptotic form of the distribution which describes the probability of large vacuum fluctuations. Our approach involves asymptotic estimates for the high moments of the distribution. These estimates in turn may be used to obtain estimates for the asymptotic form of the probability distribution. Our results show that averaging over a finite interval results in a probability distribution which falls more slowly than for the case of Lorentzian averaging, and both fall more slowly than exponentially. This indicates that vacuum fluctuations effects can dominate over thermal fluctuations in some circumstances.
