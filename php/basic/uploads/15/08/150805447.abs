Title: Large N limit of supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter model: breakdown of  superconformal symmetry
Authors: J. M. Queiruga and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: In this work we study some properties of the three dimensional $U(N)$ SUSY Chern-Simons coupled to a scalar field in the fundamental representation in the large $N$ limit. For large $N$ we show that the theory has two phases, one which is conformally invariant, and other where the superconformal symmetry is broken and masses for the matter fields are generated.
