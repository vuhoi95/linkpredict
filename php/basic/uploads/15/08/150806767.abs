Title: The coupling of Non-linear Supersymmetry to Supergravity
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Chrysoula Markou
Abstract: We study the coupling of non-linear supersymmetry to supergravity. The goldstino nilpotent superfield of global supersymmetry coupled to supergravity is described by a geometric action of the chiral curvature superfield R subject to the constraint (R-\lambda)^2=0 with an appropriate constant \lambda. This constraint can be found as the decoupling limit of the scalar partner of the goldstino in a class of f(R) supergravity theories.
