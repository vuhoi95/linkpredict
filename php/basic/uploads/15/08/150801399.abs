Title: Local realizations of anyon exchange symmetries without lattice  dislocations

Abstract: The global $e$-$m$ exchange symmetry of the toric code is realized locally through an exactly solvable Hamiltonian on a two dimensional lattice which has no lattice dislocations and their associated defect line. The Hamiltonian is still changed locally in selected sites where we wish to realize this anyon symmetry. We refer to these selected sites as defect sites in analogy with the usual lattice defects. The operators on the defect sites condense dyons of the toric code and are shown to support states which obey the fusion rules of Ising anyons just as the lattice dislocations thus achieving the transition to the Ising phase from the toric code phase. They can also be introduced in an entire region leading to an idea of non-localized defects. The method leads to a natural generalization for other Abelian groups where they help realize all the anyon exchange symmetries locally.
