Title: Warped Weyl fermion partition functions
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Diego M. Hofman and Gábor Sárosi
Abstract: Warped conformal field theories (WCFTs) are a novel class of non-relativistic theories. A simple, yet non-trivial, example of such theory is a massive Weyl fermion in $(1+1)$-dimensions, which we study in detail. We derive general properties of the spectrum and modular properties of partition functions of WCFTs. The periodic (Ramond) sector of this fermionic system is non-trivial, and we build two novel partition functions for this sector which have no counterpart in a CFT$_2$. The thermodynamical properties of WCFTs are revisited in the canonical and micro-canonical ensemble.
