Title: Partially twisted superconformal M5 brane in R-symmetry gauge field  backgrounds
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Andreas Gustavsson
Abstract: We obtain the action for a curved superconformal abelian M5 brane with the background R-symmetry gauge field turned on. We then restrict ourselves to superconformal M5 brane on a sphere times flat Minkowski space. We choose R-symmetry SO(1,4) instead of SO(5), which enables us to partially twist on Minkowski space and replace it by some curved Lorentzian manifold. We obtain M5 brane actions on $M_{1,1} \times S^4$ and $M_{1,2} \times S^3$ where actions and all fields, including the background gauge field, are real. Dimensional reduction along time gives real 5d SYM actions with nonabelian generalizations.
