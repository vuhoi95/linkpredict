Title: On Supersymmetric Lifshitz Field Theories
Authors: Shira Chapman and Yaron Oz and Avia Raviv-Moshe
Abstract: We consider field theories that exhibit a supersymmetric Lifshitz scaling with two real supercharges. The theories can be formulated in the language of stochastic quantization. We construct the free field supersymmetry algebra with rotation singlet fermions for an even dynamical exponent $z=2k$ in an arbitrary dimension. We analyze the classical and quantum $z=2$ supersymmetric interactions in $2+1$ and $3+1$ spacetime dimensions and reveal a supersymmetry preserving quantum diagrammatic cancellation. Stochastic quantization indicates that Lifshitz scale invariance is broken in the $(3+1)$-dimensional quantum theory.
