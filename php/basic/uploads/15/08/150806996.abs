Title: Supersymmetric D3/D7 for holographic flavors on curved space
Authors: Andreas Karch and Brandon Robinson and Christoph F. Uhlemann
Abstract: We derive a new class of supersymmetric D3/D7 brane configurations, which allow to holographically describe N=4 SYM coupled to massive N=2 flavor degrees of freedom on spaces of constant curvature. We systematically solve the $\kappa$-symmetry condition for D7-brane embeddings into AdS$_4$-sliced AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, and find supersymmetric embeddings in a simple closed form. Up to a critical mass, these embeddings come in surprisingly diverse families, and we present a first study of their (holographic) phenomenology. We carry out the holographic renormalization, compute the one-point functions and attempt a field-theoretic interpretation of the different families. To complete the catalog of supersymmetric D3/D7 configurations, we construct analogous embeddings for flavored N=4 SYM on S$^4$ and dS$_4$.
