Title: Spin vortices in the Abelian-Higgs model with cholesteric vacuum  structure
Authors: Adam Peterson and Mikhail Shifman and Gianni Tallarita
Abstract: We continue the study of $U(1)$ vortices with cholesteric vacuum structure. A new class of solutions is found which represent global vortices of the internal spin field. These spin vortices are characterized by a non-vanishing angular dependence at spatial infinity, or winding. We show that despite the topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ behavior of $SO(3)$ windings, the topological charge of the spin vortices is of the $\mathbb{Z}$ type in the cholesteric. We find these solutions numerically and discuss the properties derived from their low energy effective field theory in $1+1$ dimensions.
