Title: Hexagonal Wilson Loops in Planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM Theory at Finite  Coupling
Authors: Benjamin Basso and Amit Sever and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We report on the complete OPE series for the 6-gluon MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. Namely, we provide a finite coupling prediction for all the terms in the expansion of these amplitudes around the collinear limit. These furnish a non-perturbative representation of the full amplitudes.
