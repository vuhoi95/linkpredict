Title: Chemical potential driven phase transition of black holes in AdS space
Authors: Mario Galante and Gaston Giribet and Andres Goya and Julio Oliva
Abstract: Einstein-Maxwell theory conformally coupled to a scalar field in D dimensions may exhibit an instability at low temperature. We find an explicit solution that represents a charged asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black hole with a scalar field profile that is regular everywhere outside and on the horizon. This provides a tractable model to study the phase transition of hairy black holes in Anti-de Sitter space in which the backreaction on the geometry can be solved analytically.
