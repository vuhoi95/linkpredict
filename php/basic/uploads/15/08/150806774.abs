Title: Scalar mass stability bound in a simple Yukawa-theory from  renormalisation group equations
Authors: A. Jakovac and I. Kaposvari and A. Patkos
Abstract: Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) equations are constructed for a simple Yukawa-model with discrete chiral symmetry, including also the effect of a nonzero composite fermion background beyond the conventional scalar condensate. The evolution of the effective potential of the model, generically depending on two invariants, is explored with help of power series expansions. Systematic investigation of the effect of a class of irrelevant operators on the lower (stability) bound allows a non-perturbative extension of the maximal cut-off value consistent with any given mass of the scalar field.
