Title: Large-N ground state of the Lieb-Liniger model and Yang-Mills theory on  a two-sphere
Authors: Daniel Flassig and Andre Franca and Alexander Pritzel
Abstract: We derive the large particle number limit of the Bethe equations for the ground state of the attractive one-dimensional Bose gas (Lieb-Liniger model) on a ring and solve it for arbitrary coupling. We show that the ground state of this system can be mapped to the large-N saddle point of Euclidean Yang-Mills theory on a two-sphere with a U(N) gauge group, and the phase transition that interpolates between the homogeneous and solitonic regime is dual to the Douglas-Kazakov confimenent-deconfinement phase transition.
