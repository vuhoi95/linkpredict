Title: Maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills on the lattice
Authors: David Schaich and Simon Catterall
Abstract: We summarize recent progress in lattice studies of four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory and present preliminary results from ongoing investigations. Our work is based on a construction that exactly preserves a single supersymmetry at non-zero lattice spacing, and we review a new procedure to regulate flat directions by modifying the moduli equations in a manner compatible with this supersymmetry. This procedure defines an improved lattice action that we have begun to use in numerical calculations. We discuss some highlights of these investigations, including the static potential and an update on the question of a possible sign problem in the lattice theory.
