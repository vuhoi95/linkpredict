Title: Scale invariant Volkov-Akulov Supergravity
Authors: S. Ferrara and M. Porrati and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: A scale invariant Goldstino theory coupled to Supergravity is obtained as a standard supergravity dual of a rigidly scale invariant higher--curvature Supergravity with a nilpotent chiral scalar curvature. The bosonic part of this theory describes a massless scalaron and a massive axion in a de Sitter Universe.
