Title: Scale-invariant power spectra from a Weyl-invariant scalar-tensor theory
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We obtain scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from a Weyl-invariant scalar-tensor theory in de Sitter spacetime. This implies that the Weyl-invariance guarantees to implement the scale-invariance of power spectrum in de Sitter spacetime. We establish a deep connection between the Weyl-invariance of the action and scale-invariance of power spectrum in de Sitter spacetime.
