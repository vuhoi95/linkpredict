Abstract: We give explicit construction for massive higher spin supermultiplets for the case of minimal supersymmetry in d=3 and find the corresponding Lagrangian formulations. We show that all such massive supermultiplets can be straightforwardly constructed out of the appropriately chosen set of massless ones exactly in the same way as the gauge invariant description for the massive bosonic (fermionic) field with spin s can be obtained using a set of massless fields with spins s,s-1,...,0(1/2). Moreover, such construction for the massive supermultiplets turns out to be perfectly consistent with our previous results on the gauge invariant Lagrangian formulation for massive higher spin bosons and fermions in d=3.
