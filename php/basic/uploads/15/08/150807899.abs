Title: Charged and electromagnetic fields from relativistic quantum geometry
Authors: Marcos R. A. Arcod√≠a and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: In the Relativistic Quantum Geometry (RQG) formalism recently introduced, was explored the possibility that the variation of the tensor metric can be done in a Weylian integrable manifold using a geometric displacement, from a Riemannian to a Weylian integrable manifold, described by the dynamics of an auxiliary geometrical scalar field $\theta$, in order that the Einstein tensor (and the Einstein equations) can be represented on a Weyl-like manifold. In this framework we study jointly the dynamics of electromagnetic fields produced by quantum complex vector fields, which describes charges without charges. We demonstrate that complex fields act as a source of tetra-vector fields which describe an extended Maxwell dynamics.
