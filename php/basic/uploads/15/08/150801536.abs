Title: Towards the quantization of the non-relativistic D2-brane in the Pure  Spinor Formalism
Authors: A. Herrera-Aguilar and J. E. Paschalis
Abstract: The non-relativistic D2-brane is treated in the framework of pure spinor formalism. The fermionic constraints corresponding to the rescaled fermionic coordinates are given. Two commuting spinor fields are introduced, each one corresponding to a fermionic constraint. A BRST charge is constructed via the ansatz proposed by Nathan Berkovits. The nilpotency of the BRST charge leads to a set of constraints for the two spinor fields including pure spinor constraints. A nontrivial solution is given for one of the spinor fields.
