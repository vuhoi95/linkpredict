Title: de Sitter gravity/Euclidean conformal gravity correspondence
Authors: Atreya Chatterjee and David A. Lowe
Abstract: The holographic dual of a gravitational theory around the de Sitter background is argued to be a Euclidean conformal gravity theory in one fewer dimensions. The measure for the holographic theory naturally includes a sum over topologies as well as conformal structures.
