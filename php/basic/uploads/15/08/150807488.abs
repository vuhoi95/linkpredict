Title: Viable Mimetic $F(R)$ Gravity Compatible with Planck Observations
Authors: S. D. Odintsov and V. K. Oikonomou
Abstract: Using Mukhanov-Chamseddine mimetic approach, we study $F(R)$ gravity with scalar potential and Lagrange multiplier constraint. As we demonstrate, for a given $F(R)$ gravity and for suitably chosen mimetic potential, it is possible to realize inflationary cosmology consistent with Planck observations. We also investigate the de Sitter solutions of the mimetic $F(R)$ theory and study the stability of the solutions, when these exist, towards linear perturbations, with the unstable solutions, which can provide a mechanism for graceful exit from inflation. Finally, we describe a reconstruction method which can yield the $F(R)$ gravity that can generate realistic inflationary cosmological evolution, given the mimetic potential and the Hubble rate.
