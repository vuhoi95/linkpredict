Title: One-loop quantum electrodynamic correction to the gravitational  potentials on de Sitter spacetime
Authors: C. L. Wang and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We compute the one-loop photon contribution to the graviton self-energy on a de Sitter background and use it to solve the linearized Einstein equation for a point mass. Our results show that a comoving observer sees a logarithmic spatial running Newton's constant. Equivalently, a static observer reports a secular suppression of the Newtonian potential.
