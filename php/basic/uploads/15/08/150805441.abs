Title: Non-linear Holographic Entanglement Entropy Inequalities for Single  Boundary 2D CFT
Authors: Emory Brown and Ning Bao and Sepehr Nezami
Abstract: Significant work has gone into determining the minimal set of entropy inequalities that determine the holographic entropy cone. Holographic systems with three or more parties have been shown to obey additional inequalities that generic quantum systems do not. We consider a two dimensional conformal field theory that is a single boundary of a holographic system and find four additional non-linear inequalities which are derived from strong subadditivity and the formula for the entanglement entropy of a region on the conformal field theory. We also present an equality obtained by application of a hyperbolic extension of Ptolemy's theorem to a two dimensional conformal field theory.
