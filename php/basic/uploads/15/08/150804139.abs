Title: Higher Spin Interactions in Four Dimensions: Vasiliev vs. Fronsdal
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Pan Kessel and E. D. Skvortsov and Massimo Taronna
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional Higher-Spin Theory at the first nontrivial order corresponding to the cubic action. All Higher-Spin interaction vertices are explicitly obtained from Vasiliev's equations. In particular, we obtain the vertices that are not determined solely by the Higher-Spin algebra structure constants. The dictionary between the Fronsdal fields and Higher-Spin connections is found and the corrections to the Fronsdal equations are derived. These corrections turn out to involve derivatives of arbitrary order. We observe that the vertices not determined by the Higher-Spin algebra produce naked infinities, when decomposed into the minimal derivative vertices and improvements. Therefore, standard methods can only be used to check a rather limited number of correlation functions within the HS AdS/CFT duality. A possible resolution of the puzzle is discussed.
