Title: An Ultraviolet Chiral Theory of the Top for the Fundamental Composite  (Goldstone) Higgs
Authors: Giacomo Cacciapaglia and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We introduce a scalar-less anomaly free chiral gauge theory that serves as natural ultraviolet completion of models of fundamental composite (Goldstone) Higgs dynamics. The new theory is able to generate the top mass and furthermore features a built-in protection mechanism that naturally suppresses the bottom mass. At low energies the theory predicts new fractionally charged fermions, and a number of four-fermion operators that, besides being relevant for the generation of the top mass, also lead to an intriguing phenomenology for the new states predicted by the theory.
