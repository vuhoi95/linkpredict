Title: ABJM Amplitudes in U-gauge and a Soft Theorem
Authors: Seungbeom Chin and Sangmin Lee and Youngbin Yun
Abstract: We report progress in computing and analyzing all tree amplitudes in ABJM theory. Inspired by the isomorphism between the orthogonal Grassmannian and the pure spinor geometries, we adopt a new gauge, called u-gauge, for evaluating the orthogonal Grassmannian integral for ABJM amplitudes. We carry out the integral explicitly for the 8-point amplitude and obtain the complete supersymmetric amplitude. The physical and spurious poles arise from the integral as expected from on-shell diagrams. We also derive a double scalar soft theorem of ABJM amplitudes and verify it for known amplitudes.
