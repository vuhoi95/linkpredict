Abstract: In this work we investigate the entropic information-measure in the context of braneworlds with non-constant curvature. The braneworld entropic information is studied for gravity modified by the squared of the Ricci scalar, besides the usual Einstein-Hilbert term. We showed that the minimum value of the brane configurational entropy provides a stricter bound on the parameter that is responsible for the $F(R)$ model to differ from the Einstein-Hilbert standard one. Our results are moreover consistent to a negative bulk cosmological constant.
