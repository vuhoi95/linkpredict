Title: Proper time method in de Sitter space
Authors: Ashok K. Das and Pushpa Kalauni
Abstract: We use the proper time formalism to study a (non-self-interacting) massive Klein-Gordon theory in the two dimensional de Sitter space. We determine the exact Green's function of the theory by solving the DeWitt-Schwinger equation as well as by calculating the operator matrix element. We point out how the one parameter family of arbitrariness in the Green's function arises in this method.
