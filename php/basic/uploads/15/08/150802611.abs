Title: Quasinormal ringing on the brane
Authors: Hyeyoun Chung and Lisa Randall and Maria J. Rodriguez and Oscar Varela
Abstract: While the linear behavior of gravity in braneworld models is well understood, much less is known about full non-linear gravitational effects. These could be expected to distinguish braneworlds from a lower-dimensional theory with no brane. Black holes are a good testing ground for such studies, as they are nonlinear solutions that could in principle reflect the background geometry. In particular, we assess the role of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational experiments devised to determine the existence of the brane, in a lower- dimensional setting where we have analytical control. Remarkably, non-linear gravitational effects with and without brane turn out to be indistinguishable in some regimes, at least with the scattering problem at hand.
