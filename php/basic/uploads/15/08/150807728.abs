Title: Towards conformal cosmology
Authors: M. Libanov and V. Rubakov and G. Rubtsov
Abstract: Approximate de Sitter symmetry of inflating Universe is responsible for the approximate flatness of the power spectrum of scalar perturbations. However, this is not the only option. Another symmetry which can explain nearly scale-invariant power spectrum is conformal invariance. We give a short review of models based on conformal symmetry which lead to the scale-invariant spectrum of the scalar perturbations. We discuss also potentially observable features of these models.
