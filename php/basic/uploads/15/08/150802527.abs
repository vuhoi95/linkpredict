Title: Holographic entanglement entropy from minimal surfaces with/without  extrinsic curvature
Authors: Ahmad Ghodsi and Mohammad Moghadassi
Abstract: In this paper we show that in addition to the known minimal surfaces which appear in the literature for computing the entanglement entropy there are other minimal surfaces with non-zero extrinsic curvature. We use the approach of regularization procedure for computing the quadratic and cubic curvature invariants on manifolds with squashed cones. The results can be used to find the leading and universal terms of the holographic entanglement entropy to understand which solution corresponds to the actual minimal surface.
