Title: IR Horava-Lifshitz gravity coupled to Lorentz violating matter: A  spectral action approach
Authors: D. V. Lopes and A. Mamiya and A. Pinzul
Abstract: We continue our study of Horava-Lifshitz type theories using the methods of the spectral geometry. In this work we construct the infrared action of gravity and matter coupled to gravity in the most general way respecting the foliation preserving diffeomorphisms. This is done with the help of the spectral action principle based on some generalized Dirac operator. The gravity part reproduces the infrared limit of the Horava-Lifshitz gravity, while the matter part gives the generalization of the earlier suggested models. Due to the fact that the same Dirac operator is used in the construction of both sectors, the parameters of the gravity and matter parts are related. We expect that this potentially could naturally exclude fine tunings needed to get some desired properties as well as open new possibilities for the experimental tests of the model.
