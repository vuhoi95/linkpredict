Title: Emergent gravity in the cubic tight-binding model of Weyl semimetal in  the presence of elastic deformations
Authors: Alberto Cortijo and M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: We consider the tight-binding model with cubic symmetry that may be relevant for the description of a certain class of Weyl semimetals. We take into account elastic deformations of the semimetal through the modification of hopping parameters. This modification results in the appearance of emergent gauge field and the coordinate dependent anisotropic Fermi velocity. The latter may be interpreted as emergent gravitational field.
