Abstract: We discuss the relation between generalised fluxes and mixed-symmetry potentials. We first consider the NS fluxes, and point out that the `non-geometric' $R$ flux is dual to a mixed-symmetry potential with a set of nine antisymmetric indices. We then consider the T-duality family of fluxes whose prototype is the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of the S-dual of the RR scalar of IIB supergravity. Using the relation with mixed-symmetry potentials, we are able to give a complete classification of these fluxes, including the ones that are non-geometric. The non-geometric fluxes again turn out to be dual to potentials containing nine antisymmetric indices. Our analysis suggests that all these fluxes can be understood in the context of double field theory, although for the non-geometric ones one expects a violation of the strong constraint.
