Title: Surface/state correspondence and bulk local operators in pp-wave  holography
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: We apply the surface/state correspondence proposal of Miyaji et al. to IIB pp-waves and propose that the bulk local operators should be D-instantons. In line with ordinary AdS/CFT correspondence, the bulk local operators in pp-waves also create a hole, or a boundary, in the dual gauge theory as pointed out by H. Verlinde, and by Y. Nakayama and H. Ooguri. We also present simple calculations which illustrate how to extract the spacetime metric from D-instanton states.
