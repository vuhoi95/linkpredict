Title: Unidirectional Transport in Electronic and Photonic Weyl Materials by  Dirac Mass Engineering
Authors: Ren Bi and Zhong Wang
Abstract: Unidirectional transports have been observed in two-dimensional systems, however, so far they have not been experimentally observed in three-dimensional bulk materials. In this theoretical work we show that the recently discovered Weyl materials provide a platform for unidirectional transports inside bulk materials. With high experimental feasibility, a complex Dirac mass can be generated and manipulated in the photonic Weyl crystals, creating unidirectionally propagating modes observable in transmission experiments. Possible realization in (electronic) Weyl semimetals is also studied. We show in a lattice model that, with a short-range interaction, the desired form of the Dirac mass can be spontaneously generated in a first-order transition.
