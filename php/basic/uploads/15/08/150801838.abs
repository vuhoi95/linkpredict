Title: Singular Yamabe Problem Willmore Energies
Authors: Michael Glaros and A. Rod Gover and Matthew Halbasch and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: We develop the calculus for hypersurface variations based on variation of the hypersurface defining function. This is used to show that the functional gradient of a new Willmore-like, conformal hypersurface energy agrees exactly with the obstruction to smoothly solving the singular Yamabe problem for conformally compact four-manifolds. We give explicit hypersurface formulae for both the energy functional and the obstruction.
