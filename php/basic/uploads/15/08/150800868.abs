Title: Elementary results for the fundamental representation of SU(3)
Authors: Thomas L. Curtright and Cosmas K. Zachos
Abstract: A general group element for the fundamental representation of SU(3) is expressed as a second order polynomial in the hermitian generating matrix H, with coefficients consisting of elementary trigonometric functions dependent on the sole invariant det(H), in addition to the group parameter.
