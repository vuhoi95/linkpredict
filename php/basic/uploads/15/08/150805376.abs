Title: An ${\cal N}=3$ Solution in Dyonic ISO(7) Gauged Maximal Supergravity  and Its Uplift to Massive Type IIA
Authors: Yi Pang and Junchen Rong
Abstract: We consider a certain ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric, SO(3)$\times$SO(3) invariant, subsector of the dyonic ISO(7)-gauged maximal supergravity in four-dimensions. The theory contains two scalar fields and two pseudoscalar fields. We look for stationary points of the scalar potential, especially the one preserving ${\cal N}=3$ supersymmetry of the original ISO(7) gauged theory. The ${\cal N}=3$ stationary point corresponding to the $AdS$ vacuum in the $D=4$ theory is lifted to a warped $AdS_4\times X_6$ type solution in massive type IIA supergravity. This $D=10$ background should be the dual of a certain ${\cal N}=3$ Chern-Simons matter theory in three dimensions.
