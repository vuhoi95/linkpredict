Title: Bouncing universe with modified dispersion relation
Authors: Wen-Jian Pan and Yong-Chang Huang
Abstract: In this paper, employing the modified dispersion relation, we have derived the general modified Friedmann equations and the corresponding modified entropy relations for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. In this setup, we find that when the big bounce happens, its energy scale and its corresponding modified entropy behavior are sensitive to the value of $k$. In contrast to the previous work with $k=0$, our work mainly demonstrates that the bouncing behavior for the closed Universe with $k=1$ appears at the normal energy limit of the modified dispersion relation introduced, and when bouncing phenomenon is in presence, its modified entropy is just equal to zero. Surprisingly, when $k=-1$, the bouncing behavior is in absence.
