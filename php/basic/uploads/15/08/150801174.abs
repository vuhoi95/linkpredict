Title: Teleparallel Equivalent of Lovelock Gravity
Authors: P. A. Gonzalez and Yerko Vasquez
Abstract: There is a growing interest in modified gravity theories based on torsion, as these theories exhibit interesting cosmological implications. In this work, inspired by the teleparallel formulation of general relativity, we present its extension to Lovelock gravity known as the most natural extension of general relativity in higher-dimensional space-times. First, we review the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and then we construct the teleparallel equivalent of Lovelock gravity. In order to achieve this goal we use the vielbein and the connection without imposing the Weitzenb{\"o}ck connection. Then, we extract the teleparallel formulation of the theory by setting the curvature to null.
