Abstract: We investigate a string-inspired axion extension of the standard model obtained from Type II superstrings using quiver method. In the first part, we discuss intersecting Type IIA D6-branes wrapping non trivial 3-cycles in the presence of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry U(1)$_{PQ}$. Concretely, a complex scalar field $\phi =\rho exp(\frac{i\sigma}{f_{\sigma}})$, where $\sigma$ is a closed string axion generates a general fermion Yukawa coupling weighted by a flavor-dependent power $n_{f}$ taking specific values. Using string theory and standard model data, we find that the corresponding axion window is in the allowed range $10^{9}GeV\leq f_{\sigma}\leq 10^{12}GeV $ matching with the recent cosmological results. Then, we extend these results to the case of the hyperbolic quiver whose the moduli is related to the stringy axion using root systems of ADE Lie algebras. For the hyperbolic quiver case, we observe that the closed axion decay constant becomes disentangled from the string scale.
