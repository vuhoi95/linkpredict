Title: Baryon as Impurity for Phase Transition in String Landscape
Authors: Aya Kasai and Yuichiro Nakai and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We consider a decay of a false vacuum in flux compactifications of type IIB string theory and study a catalytic effect for a phase transition induced by a new type of impurities. We concentrate on the large N dual of a D5-brane/anti-D5-brane system which has a rich vacuum structure. We show that D3-branes wrapping the 3-cycles can form a dibaryon and make a bound state with a monopole. We find that these baryon-like objects can make the lifetime of the metastable vacuum shorter.
