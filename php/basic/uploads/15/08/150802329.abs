Title: Boundary scattering in the phi^4 model
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Aliaksei Halavanau and James Mercer and Tomasz Romanczukiewicz and Yasha Shnir
Abstract: We study boundary scattering in the phi^4 model on a half-line with a one-parameter family of Neumann-type boundary conditions. A rich variety of phenomena is observed, which extends previously-studied behaviour on the full line to include regimes of near-elastic scattering, the restoration of a missing scattering window, and the creation of a kink or oscillon through the collision-induced decay of a metastable boundary state.
