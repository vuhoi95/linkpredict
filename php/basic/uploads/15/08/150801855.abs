Title: Functional Renormalisation Group analysis of a Tensorial Group Field  Theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Riccardo Martini and Daniele Oriti
Abstract: We study a model of Tensorial Group Field Theory (TGFT) on $\mathbb{R}^3$ from the point of view of the Functional Renormalisation Group. This is the first attempt to apply a renormalisation procedure to a TGFT model defined over a non-compact group manifold. IR divergences (with respect to the metric on $\mathbb{R}$) coming from the non-compactness of the group are regularised via compactification, and a thermodynamic limit is then taken. We identify then IR and UV fixed points of the RG flow and find strong hints of a phase transition of the TGFT system from a symmetric to a broken or condensate phase in the IR.
