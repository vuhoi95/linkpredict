Title: Symmetries of higher-spin current interactions in four dimensions
Authors: O. A. Gelfond and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Current interaction of massless fields in four dimensions is shown to break sp (8) symmetry of free massless equations of all spins down to the conformal symmetry su (2,2). This breaking is in agreement with the form of nonlinear higher-spin field equations.
