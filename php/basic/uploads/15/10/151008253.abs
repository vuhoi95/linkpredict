Title: Spin precession in anisotropic cosmologies
Authors: A. Yu. Kamenshchik and O. V. Teryaev
Abstract: We consider the precession of a Dirac particle spin in some anisotropic Bianchi universes. This effect is present already in the Bianchi-I universe. We discuss in some detail the geodesics and the spin precession for both the Kasner and the Heckmann-Schucking solutions. In the Bianchi-IX universe the spin precession acquires the chaotic character due to the stochasticity of the oscillatory approach to the cosmological singularity. The related helicity flip of fermions in the very early Universe may produce the sterile particles contributing to dark matter.
