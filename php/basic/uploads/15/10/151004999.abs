Title: Towards the full N=4 conformal supergravity action
Authors: Franz Ciceri and Bindusar Sahoo
Abstract: Based on the known non-linear transformation rules of the Weyl multiplet fields, the action of $N=4$ conformal supergravity is constructed up to terms quadratic in the fermion fields. The bosonic sector corrects a recent result in the literature.
