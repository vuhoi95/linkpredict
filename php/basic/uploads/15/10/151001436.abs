Title: Intertial Frame Dragging in an Acoustic Analogue spacetime
Authors: Chandrachur Chakraborty and Oindrila Ganguly and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: We report an incipient exploration of the Lense-Thirring precession effect in a rotating {\it acoustic analogue black hole} spacetime. An exact formula is deduced for the precession frequency of a gyroscope due to inertial frame dragging, close to the ergosphere of a `Draining Bathtub' acoustic spacetime which has been studied extensively for acoustic Hawking radiation of phonons and also for `superresonance'. Prospects of experimental detection of this new effect in the Draining bathtub acoustic geometry, are discussed.
