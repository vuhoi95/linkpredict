Abstract: In the present article we study the Inverse Electrodynamics Model. This model is a gauge and parity invariant non-linear Electrodynamics theory, which respects the conformal invariance of standard Electrodynamics. This modified Electrodynamics model, when minimally coupled to General Relativity, is compatible with static and spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstrom-like black-hole solutions. However, these black-hole solutions present more complex thermodynamic properties than their Reissner-Nordstrom black-hole solutions counterparts in standard Electrodynamics. In particular, in the Inverse Model a new stability region, with both the heat capacity and the free energy negative, arises. Moreover, unlike the scenario in standard Electrodynamics, a sole transition phase is possible for a suitable choice in the set of parameters of these solutions.
