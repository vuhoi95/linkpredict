Title: Weyl and Ricci gauging from the coset construction
Authors: Georgios K. Karananas and Alexander Monin
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate how, using the coset construction, a theory can be systematically made Weyl invariant by gauging the scale symmetry. We show that an analog of the inverse Higgs constraint allows the elimination of the Weyl vector (gauge) field in favor of curvatures. We extend the procedure -- previously coined Ricci gauging -- and discuss its subtlety for the case of theories with higher derivatives of conformally variant fields.
