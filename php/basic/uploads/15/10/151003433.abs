Title: Dualising consistent IIA / IIB truncations
Authors: Emanuel Malek and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We use exceptional field theory to establish a duality between certain consistent 7-dimensional truncations with maximal SUSY from IIA to IIB. We use this technique to obtain new consistent truncations of IIB on $S^3$ and $H^{p,q}$ and work out the explicit reduction formulas in the internal sector. We also present uplifts for other gaugings of 7-d maximal SUGRA, including theories with a trombone gauging. Some of the latter can only be obtained by a non-geometric compactification.
