Title: Light Front Quantization with the Light Cone Gauge
Authors: D. G. C. McKeon and Chenguang Zhao
Abstract: The Dirac procedure for dealing with constraints is applied to the quantization of gauge theories on the light front. The light cone gauge is used in conjunction with the first class constraints that arise and the resulting Dirac brackets are found. These gauge conditions are not used to eliminate degrees of freedom from the action prior to applying the Dirac constraint procedure. This approach is illustrated by considering Yang-Mills theory and the superparticle in a 2 + 1 dimensional target space.
