Title: Stability of Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond Wormholes
Authors: Paul H. Cox and Benjamin C. Harms and Shaoqi Hou
Abstract: This paper investigates a particular type of wormhole. The wormhole solutions studied are obtained by sewing together two static, spherically symmetric, charged black-hole metrics at their horizons. The charged wormholes are in a background Kalb-Ramond field, which is the source of the necessary tension in the gravitational field. The metric-tensor elements are studied by numerically solving Einstein's equations with stress-energy-tensor elements given by the combination of static electric and Kalb-Ramond fields. For a certain range of electric charge the tension is positive away from the wormhole throat, but the tension is negative near the throat, making it non-traversable. The wormholes are found to be quasi-stable against decay via gravitational instanton tunnelling.
