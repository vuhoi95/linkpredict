Title: The Effective Strength of Gravity, the Scale of Inflation (and how KK  gravitons evade the Higuchi Bound)
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: For any given momentum transfer, gravitational interactions have a strength set by a characteristic scale $M_*$ inferred from amplitudes calculated in an effective theory with a strong coupling scale $M_{**}$. These are in general different from each other and $M_{\rm pl}$, the macroscopic strength of gravity as determined by (laboratory scale) Cavendish experiments. During single field inflation, $M_*$ can differ from $M_{\rm pl}$ due to the presence of any number of (hidden) universally coupled species between laboratory and inflationary scales. Although this has no effect on dimensionless (i.e. observable) quantities measured at a fixed scale such as the amplitude and spectral properties of the CMB anisotropies, it complicates the inference of an absolute scale of inflation given any detection of primordial tensors. In this note we review and elaborate upon these facts and address concerns raised in a recent paper.
