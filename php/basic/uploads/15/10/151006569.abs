Title: BRST Analysis of the Supersymmetric Higher Spin Field Models
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and K. Koutrolikos
Abstract: We develop the BRST approach for all massless integer and half-integer higher spins in 4D Minkowski space, using the two component spinor nota- tion and develop the Lagrangian formulation for supersymmetric higher spin models. It is shown that the problem of second class constraints disappears and the BRST procedure becomes much more simple than in tensorial nota- tion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the BRST procedure automatically provides extra auxiliary components that belong in the set of supersymmetry auxiliary components. Finally, we demonstrate how supersymmetry transfo- rmations are realized in such an approach. As a result, we conclude that the BRST approach to higher spin supersymmetric theories allows to derive both the Lagrangian and the supersymmetry transformations. Although most part of the work is devoted to massless component supersymmetric models, we also discuss generalization for massive component supersymmetric models and for superfield models.
