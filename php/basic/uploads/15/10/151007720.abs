Title: Deformations of nearly KÃ¤hler instantons
Authors: Benoit Charbonneau and Derek Harland
Abstract: We formulate the deformation theory for instantons on nearly K\"ahler six-manifolds using spinors and Dirac operators. Using this framework we identify the space of deformations of an irreducible instanton with semisimple structure group with the kernel of an elliptic operator, and prove that abelian instantons are rigid. As an application, we show that the canonical connection on three of the four homogeneous nearly K\"ahler six-manifolds G/H is a rigid instanton with structure group H. In contrast, these connections admit large spaces of deformations when regarded as instantons on the tangent bundle with structure group SU(3).
