Abstract: In this manuscript we compute the corrections to the black body force due to spacetime geometry and topology. This recently discovered attractive force on neutral atoms is caused by the thermal radiation emitted from black bodies and here we investigate it in systems with spherical and cylindrical symmetries. For some astrophysical objects we find that the corrected force is greater than the flat case, showing that this kind of correction can be quite relevant when curved spaces are considered. Then we consider four cases: The Schwarzschild spacetime, the non-relativistic infinity cylinder, and both the static and stationary cosmic strings. For the spherically symmetric case we find that two corrections appear: One due to the gravitational modification of the temperature and the other due to the modification of the solid angle subtended by the atom. We apply the found results to a typical neutron star and to the Sun. For the cylindrical case, which is locally flat, no gravitational correction to the temperature exists. However, we find the curious fact that the black body force depends on the topology of the spacetime through the modification of the azimuthal angle and therefore of the solid angle. For the static cosmic string we find that the force is null for zero thickness case. For the stationary one, we find that the force is non-null even for the thin case.
