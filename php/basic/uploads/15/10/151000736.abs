Title: Scaling Relations in Two-Dimensional Relativistic Hydrodynamic  Turbulence
Authors: John Ryan Westernacher-Schneider and Luis Lehner and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We derive exact scaling relations for two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic turbulence in the inertial range of scales. We consider both the energy cascade towards large scales and the enstrophy cascade towards small scales. We illustrate these relations by numerical simulations of turbulent weakly compressible flows. Intriguingly, the fluid-gravity correspondence implies that the gravitational field in spacetimes with anti-de Sitter asymptotics should exhibit similar scaling relations.
