Title: Nonrelativistic limit of the abelianized ABJM model and the ADS/CMT  correspondence
Authors: Cristhiam Lopez-Arcos and Jeff Murugan and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We consider the nonrelativistic limit of the abelian reduction of the massive ABJM model proposed in \cite{Mohammed:2012gi}, obtaining a supersymmetric version of the Jackiw-Pi model. The system exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ Super-Schr\"odinger symmetry with the Jackiw-Pi vortices emerging as BPS solutions. We find that this $(2+1)$-dimensional abelian field theory is dual to a certain (3+1)-dimensional gravity theory that differs somewhat from previously considered abelian condensed matter stand-ins for the ABJM model. We close by commenting on progress in the top-down realization of the AdS/CMT correspondence in a critical string theory.
