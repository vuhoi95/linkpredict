Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking and masses numerical results in DFR  noncommutative space-time
Authors: M. J. Neves and Everton M. C. Abreu
Abstract: With the elements of the Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts (DFR) noncommutative formalism, we have constructed the standard electroweak model. To accomplish this task we have begun with the WM-product basis group of symmetry. We have introduced the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the hypercharge in DFR framework. The electroweak symmetry breaking was analyzed and the masses of the new bosons were computed.
