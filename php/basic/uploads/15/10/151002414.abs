Title: An inconsistency in the spectrum of bosonic open 2-brane
Authors: M. Abdul Wasay and Ding-fang Zeng
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of a bosonic open 2-brane does not contain any massless states to take the role of gravitons. Moreover, the spectrum of this open 2-brane only contains half integer mass squared values.
