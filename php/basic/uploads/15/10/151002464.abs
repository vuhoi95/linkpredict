Title: Bootstrapping 2D CFTs in the Semiclassical Limit
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Ying-Hsuan Lin
Abstract: We study two dimensional conformal field theories in the semiclassical limit. In this limit, the four-point function is dominated by intermediate primaries of particular weights along with their descendants, and the crossing equations simplify drastically. For a four-point function receiving sufficiently small contributions from the light primaries, the structure constants involving heavy primaries follow a universal formula. Applying our results to the four-point function of the $\mathbb Z_2$ twist field in the symmetric product orbifold, we produce the Hellerman bound and the logarithmically corrected Cardy formula that is valid for $h \geq c/12$.
