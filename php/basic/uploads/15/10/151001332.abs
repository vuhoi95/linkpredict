Title: The Exact Bremsstrahlung Function in N=2 Superconformal Field Theories
Authors: Bartomeu Fiol and Efrat Gerchkovitz and Zohar Komargodski
Abstract: We propose an exact formula for the energy radiated by an accelerating quark in N=2 superconformal theories in four dimensions. This formula reproduces the known Bremsstrahlung function for N=4 theories and provides a prediction for all the perturbative and instanton corrections in N=2 theories. We perform a perturbative check of our proposal up to three loops.
