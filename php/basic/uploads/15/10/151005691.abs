Title: Critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ $Ï†^4$ theories near six dimensions
Authors: Igor F. Herbut and Lukas Janssen
Abstract: We consider $O(N)$-symmetric bosonic $\phi^4$ field theories above four dimensions, and propose a new reformulation in terms of an irreducible tensorial field with a cubic and Yukawa terms. The $\phi^4$ field theory so rewritten exhibits real and nontrivial IR-stable fixed points near and below six dimension, for low values of $N$ such as $N=2$ and $N=3$. The so-defined UV completions of the $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models hence constitute precious examples of asymptotically safe quantum field theories. The possibility of an extension of our results to five dimensions is discussed.
