Title: Generalized Second Law for Cosmology
Authors: Raphael Bousso and Netta Engelhardt
Abstract: We conjecture a novel Generalized Second Law that can be applied in cosmology, regardless of whether an event horizon is present: the generalized entropy increases monotonically outside of certain hypersurfaces we call past Q-screens. A past Q-screen is foliated by surfaces whose generalized entropy (sum of area and entanglement entropy) is stationary along one future null direction and increasing along the other. We prove that our Generalized Second Law holds in spacetimes obeying the Quantum Focussing Conjecture. An analogous law applies to future Q-screens, which appear inside evaporating black holes and in collapsing regions.
