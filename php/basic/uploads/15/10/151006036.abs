Title: Semicontinuity of 4d N=2 spectrum under renormalization group flow
Authors: Dan Xie and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We study renormalization group flow of four dimensional N=2 SCFTs defined by isolated hypersurface three-fold singularities. We define the spectrum of N=2 theory as the set of scaling dimensions of the parameters on the Coulomb branch, which include Coulomb branch moduli, mass parameters and coupling constants. We prove that the spectrum of those theories is semicontinous under the RG flow on the Coulomb branch using the mathematical result about the singularity spectra under deformation. The semicontinuity behavior of N=2 spectrum implies a theorem under relevant and Coulomb branch moduli deformation, the absence of dangerous irrelevant deformations and can be taken as the necessary condition for the ending point of a RG flow. This behavior is also true for (c,c) ring deformation of two dimensional Landau-Ginzburg model with (2,2) supersymmetry.
