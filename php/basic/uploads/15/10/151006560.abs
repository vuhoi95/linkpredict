Title: Wave equations on the linear mass Vaidya metric
Authors: Saeede Nafooshe and Martin O'Loughlin
Abstract: We discuss the near singularity region of the linear mass Vaidya metric. In particular we investi- gate the structure in the numerical solutions for the scattering of scalar and electromagnetic metric perturbations from the singularity. In addition to directly integrating the full wave-equation, we use the symmetry of the metric to reduce the problem to that of an ODE. We observe that, around the total evaporation point, quasi-normal like oscillations appear, indicating that this may be an interesting model for the description of the end-point of black hole evaporation.
