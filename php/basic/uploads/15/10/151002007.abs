Abstract: We consider the class of higher derivative $3d$ vector field models with the field equation operator being a polynomial of the Chern-Simons operator. For $n$-th order theory of this type, we provide a general receipt for constructing $n$-parameter family of conserved second rank tensors. The family includes the canonical energy-momentum tensor, which is unbounded, while there are bounded conserved tensors that provide classical stability of the system for certain combinations of the parameters in the Lagrangian. We also demonstrate the examples of consistent interactions which are compatible with the requirement of stability.
