Title: Schwinger mechanism revisited
Authors: Francois Gelis and Naoto Tanji
Abstract: In this article, we review recent theoretical works on the Schwingermechanism of particle production in external electrical fields. Although the non-perturbative Schwinger mechanism is at the center of this discussion, many of the approaches that we discuss can cope with general time and space dependent fields, and therefore also capture the perturbative contributions to particle production.
