Title: Strong CP and SUZ$_2$
Authors: Abdelhamid Albaid and Michael Dine and Patrick Draper
Abstract: Solutions to the strong CP problem typically introduce new scales associated with the spontaneous breaking of symmetries. Absent any anthropic argument for small $\bar\theta$, these scales require stabilization against ultraviolet corrections. Supersymmetry offers a tempting stabilization mechanism, since it can solve the "big" electroweak hierarchy problem at the same time. One family of solutions to strong CP, including generalized parity models, heavy axion models, and heavy $\eta^\prime$ models, introduces $\mathbb{Z}_2$ copies of (part of) the Standard Model and an associated scale of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking. We review why, without additional structure such as supersymmetry, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking scale is unacceptably tuned. We then study "SUZ$_2$" models, supersymmetric theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ copies of the MSSM. We find that the addition of SUSY typically destroys the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ protection of $\bar\theta=0$, even at tree level, once SUSY and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ are broken. In theories like supersymmetric completions of the twin Higgs, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ addresses the little hierarchy problem but not strong CP, two axions can be used to relax $\bar\theta$.
