Title: Ladder exponentiation for generic large symmetric representation Wilson  loops
Authors: Diego H. Correa and Fidel I. Schaposnik Massolo
Abstract: A recent proposal was made for a large representation rank limit for which the expectation values of N = 4 super Yang-Mills Wilson loops are given by the exponential of the 1-loop result. We verify the validity of this exponentiation in the strong coupling limit using the holographic D3-brane description for straight Wilson loops following an arbitrary internal space trajectory.
