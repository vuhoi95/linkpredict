Title: Theta vocabulary II. Multidimensional case
Authors: S. Kharchev and A. Zabrodin
Abstract: It is shown that the Jacobi and Riemann identities of degree four for the multidimensional theta functions as well as the Weierstrass identities emerge as algebraic consequences of the fundamental multidimensional binary identities connecting the theta functions with Riemann matrices $\tau$ and $2\tau$.
