Title: Bosons being their own antiparticles in Dirac formulation
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: Using our earlier formalism of extending the idea of the Dirac sea (negative energy states) to also for Bosons, we construct a formalism for Bosons which are their own antiparticles. Since antiparticles in formalisms with a Dirac sea are at first formulated as holes, they are a priori formally a bit different from the particles themselves. To set up a formalism/a theory for Majorana fermions and for Bosons in which particles are their own antiparticles is thus at first non-trivial. We here develop this not totally trivial formalism for what one could call extending the name for the fermions, Majorana-bosons. Because in our earlier work had what we called different sectors we got there some formal extensions of the theory which did not even have positive definite metric. Although such unphysical sectors may a priori be of no physical interest one could hope that they could be helpful for some pedagogical deeper understanding so that also the formalism for particles in such unphysical sectors of their own antiparticles would ,
