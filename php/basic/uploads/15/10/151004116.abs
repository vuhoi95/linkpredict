Abstract: We employ an $SU(2)$ bulk Higgs doublet as the stabilization field in Randall-Sundrum model with appropriate bulk and brane-localized potentials. The gauge hierarchy problem can be solved for an exponentially IR-localized Higgs background field with mild values of fundamental parameters of the 5D theory. We consider an IR-UV-IR background geometry with the 5D SM fields in the bulk such that all the fields have even and odd tower of KK-modes. The zero-mode 4D effective theory contains all the SM fields plus a stable scalar, which serves as a dark matter candidate.
