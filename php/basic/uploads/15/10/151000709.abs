Abstract: Numerical evidence suggests that the superradiant instability of Kerr-AdS black holes and "black resonators" evolves to smaller and smaller scales towards a "limiting" black resonator. Using $AdS_4$ supergravity, we argue that this putative endpoint to the superradiant instability does not exist.
