Title: New potentials for string axion inflation
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Akane Oikawa and Hajime Otsuka
Abstract: We propose a new type of axion inflation with complex structure moduli in the framework of type IIB superstring theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifold. The inflaton is identified as the axion for the complex structure moduli whose potential is originating from instantonic corrections appearing through the period vector of mirror Calabi-Yau manifold. The axionic shift symmetry is broken down to the discrete one by the inclusion of instantonic correction and certain three-from fluxes. Our proposed inflation scenario is compatible with K\"ahler moduli stabilization. We also study a typical reheating temperature in the case of complex structure moduli inflation.
