Title: Accelerated quarks and energy loss in confinement theory
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Kouki Kubo
Abstract: We study the energy loss rate (ELR) of the accelerated quark in terms of the holographic models for the two different motions, linear acceleration and uniform rotation. They are examined by two different non-conformal models with confinement. We found in both models that the value of ELR is bounded from below by the string tension of the linear confinement potential between quark and anti-quark. The lower bounds of ELR are independent of the types of the motion of the quark. They are determined by the string tension at the world sheet horizon of the model. These results are obtained when the model has the diagonal background metric.
