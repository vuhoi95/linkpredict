Abstract: We study unitarity and renormalizability in the Lifshitz scalar field theory, which is characterized by an anisotropic scaling between the space and time directions. Without the Lorentz symmetry, both the unitarity and the renormalizability conditions are modified from those in relativistic theories. We show that for renormalizability, an extended version of the power counting condition is required in addition to the conventional one. The unitarity bound for S-matrix elements also gives stronger constraints on interaction terms because of the reference frame dependence of scattering amplitudes. We prove that both unitarity and renormalizability require identical conditions as in the case of conventional relativistic theories.
