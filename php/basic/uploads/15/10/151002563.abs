Title: Effective actions in ${\cal N}$=1, D5 supersymmetric gauge theories:  harmonic superspace approach
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: We consider the off-shell formulation of the 5D, $ {\cal N}$=1 super Yang-Mills and super Chern-Simons theories in harmonic superspace. Using such a formulation we develop a manifestly supersymmetric and gauge invariant approach to constructing the one-loop effective action both in super Yang-Mills and super Chern-Simons models. On the base of this approach we compute the leading low-energy quantum contribution to the effective action on the Abelian vector multiplet background. This contribution corresponds to $F^4$ invariant which is given in 5D superfield form.
