Title: Higgsing towards E-strings
Authors: Joonho Kim and Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We explore 6d (1,0) superconformal field theories with SU(3) and SU(2) gauge symmetries which cascade after Higgsing to the E-string theory on a single M5 near an $E_8$ wall. Specifically, we study the 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ gauge theories which describe self-dual strings of these 6d theories. The self-dual strings can be also viewed as instanton string solitons of 6d Yang-Mills theories. We find the 2d anomaly-free gauge theories for self-dual strings, amending the naive ADHM gauge theories which are anomalous, and calculate their elliptic genera. While these 2d theories respect the flavor symmetry of each 6d SCFT only partially, their elliptic genera manifest the symmetry fully as these functions as BPS index are invariant in strongly coupled IR limit. Our consistent 2d (0,4) gauge theories also provide new insights on the non-linear sigma models for the instanton strings, providing novel UV completions of the small instanton singularities. Finally, we construct new 2d quiver gauge theories for the self-dual strings in 6d E-string theory for multiple M5-branes probing the $E_8$ wall, and find their fully refined elliptic genera.
