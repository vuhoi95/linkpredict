Title: Radiation Gauge in AdS/QCD: inadmissibility and implications on spectral  functions in the deconfined phase
Authors: David Dudal and Thomas G. Mertens
Abstract: We point out a subtlety in choosing the radiation gauge (A_z=0 combined with the Lorenz gauge) for gauge fields in AdS/QCD for black hole backgrounds. We then demonstrate the effect of this on the momentum-dependence of the spectral functions of the J/psi vector meson, showing a spreading with momentum and a breaking of isotropy, in contrast to previous results in the literature. We also discuss the dependence on a background magnetic field, following our earlier proposed model.
