Title: Gravity and nonabelian gauge fields in noncommutative space-time
Authors: Viet Ai Nguyen and Du Tien Pham
Abstract: Noncommutative geometric construction of gravity in the two sheeted spacetime can be viewed as a discretized version of a Kaluza-Klein theory. In this paper, we show that it is possible to incorporate the nonabelian gauge fields in the same framework. The generalized Hilbert-Einstein action is gauge invariant only in two cases. In the first case, the gauge group must be abelian on one sheet of spacetime and nonabelian on the other one. In the second case, the gauge group must be the same on two sheets of spacetime. Actually, the theories of electroweak and strong interactions are exactly these two cases.
