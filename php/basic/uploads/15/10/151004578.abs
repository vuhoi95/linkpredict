Title: Models for asymmetric hybrid brane
Authors: D. Bazeia and M. A. Marques and R. Menezes
Abstract: We deal with relativistic models described by a single real scalar field, searching for topological structures that behave asymmetrically, connecting minima with distinct profile. We use such features to build a new braneworld scenario, in which the source scalar field contributes to generate asymmetric hybrid brane.
