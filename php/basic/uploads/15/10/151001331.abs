Title: Universality in antiferromagnetic strange metals
Authors: Stefan A. Maier and Philipp Strack
Abstract: We propose a theory of metals at the spin-density wave quantum critical point in spatial dimension $d=2$. We provide a first estimate of the full set of critical exponents (dynamical exponent $z=2.13$, correlation length $\nu =1.02$, spin susceptibility $\gamma = 0.96$, electronic non-Fermi liquid $\eta^f_\tau = 0.53$, spin-wave Landau damping $\eta^b_\tau = 1.06$), which determine the universal power-laws in thermodynamics and response functions in the quantum-critical regime relevant for experiments in heavy-fermion systems and iron pnictides. We present approximate numerical and analytical solutions of Polchinski-Wetterich type flow equations with soft frequency regulators for an effective action of electrons coupled to spin-wave bosons. Performing the renormalization group in frequency -instead of momentum- space allows to track changes of the Fermi surface shape and to capture Landau damping during the flow. The technique is easily generalizable from models retaining only patches of the Fermi surface to full, compact Fermi surfaces.
