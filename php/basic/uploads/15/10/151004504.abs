Title: Higher-order QCD corrections to triple collinear splitting functions
Authors: German F. R. Sborlini and Daniel de Florian and German Rodrigo
Abstract: We present splitting functions in the triple collinear limit at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We performed the computation in the context of massless QCD+QED, and consider first collinear processes which include at least one photon. The IR divergent structure of the multi-partonic splitting functions agrees with the Catani's formula. Consistency checks based on symmetry arguments have been implemented and results for different configurations have been cross-checked. Studying photon-started processes, we obtained very compact results: this allowed us to simplify the expressions for the remaining splitting functions.
