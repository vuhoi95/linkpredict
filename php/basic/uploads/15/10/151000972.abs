Title: Quantum Hydrodynamics from Large-n Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Peter Koroteev and Antonio Sciarappa
Abstract: We study the connection between periodic finite-difference Intermediate Long Wave hydrodynamical systems and integrable many-body models of Calogero and Ruijsenaars-type. The former describe quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory of the ADHM moduli space of Abelian instantons, while the latter arise in the the instanton counting in four and five dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges in the presence of defects. Using string theory dualities we provide correspondences between hydrodynamical and many-body integrable systems. In particular, we match the energy spectra on both sides.
