Abstract: In a holographic approach, the evolution of a 4D strongly coupled non-Abelian plasma towards equilibrium can be studied investigating a 5D gravitational dual. The process driving the plasma out-of-equilibrium can be described by boundary sourcing, a deformation of the boundary metric; the analysis of the late-time dynamics allows to understand how the hydrodynamic regime settles in. We apply the method to a boost-invariant case, considering the effects of different quenches, solving the Einstein equations in the bulk and studying the time-dependence of observables such as the effective temperature, the energy density and the pressures. The main outcome is that, if the effective temperature of the system when the quench is switched off is $T_{eff}(\tau^*)=500$ MeV, thermalization is reached within a time of ${\cal O}$(1 fm/c), an important information if the case of the QCD plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is considered.
