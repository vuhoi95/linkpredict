Title: Constraints on Abelian Extensions of the Standard Model from Two-Loop  Vacuum Stability and $U(1)_{B-L}$
Authors: Claudio Coriano and Luigi Delle Rose and Carlo Marzo
Abstract: We present a renormalization group study of the scalar potential in a minimal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model involving one extra heavier Higgs and three heavy right-handed neutrinos with family universal B-L charge assignments. We implement a type-I seesaw for the masses of the light neutrinos of the Standard Model. In particular, compared to a previous study, we perform a two-loop extension of the evolution, showing that two-loop effects are essential for the study of the stability of the scalar potential up to the Planck scale. The analysis includes the contribution of the kinetic mixing between the two abelian gauge groups, which is radiatively generated by the evolution, and the one-loop matching conditions at the electroweak scale. By requiring the stability of the potential up to the Planck mass, significant constraints on the masses of the heavy neutrinos, on the gauge couplings and the mixing in the Higgs sector are identified.
