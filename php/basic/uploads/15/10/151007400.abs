Title: Instability of hairy black holes in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories
Authors: Hiromu Ogawa and Tsutomu Kobayashi and Teruaki Suyama
Abstract: Recently it was pointed out that in shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories a black hole can have nontrivial scalar hair which depends linearly on time. We develop black hole perturbation theory for such solutions and compute the quadratic action of odd-parity perturbations. We show that around all the solutions known so far with such time-dependent scalar hair the perturbations trigger instabilities or are presumably strongly coupled.
