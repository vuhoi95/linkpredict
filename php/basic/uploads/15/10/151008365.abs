Title: Stable interactions via proper deformations
Authors: D. S. Kaparulin and S. L. Lyakhovich and A. A. Sharapov
Abstract: A new method is proposed for switching on interactions that are compatible with global symmetries and conservation laws of the original free theory. The method is applied to the control of stability in Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian theories with higher derivatives. By way of illustration, a wide class of stable interactions is constructed for the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator.
