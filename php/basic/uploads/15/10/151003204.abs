Title: Ghost free massive gravity with singular reference metrics
Authors: Hongsheng Zhang and Xin-Zhou Li
Abstract: An auxiliary metric (reference metric) is inevitable in massive gravity theory. In the scenario of gauge/gravity duality, a singular reference metric corresponds to momentum dissipations, which describes the electric and heat conductivity for normal conductors. We demonstrate in detail that the massive gravity with singular reference metric is ghost-free.
