Title: Lectures on knot homology
Authors: Satoshi Nawata and Alexei Oblomkov
Abstract: We provide various formulations of knot homology that are predicted by string dualities. In addition, we also explain the rich algebraic structure of knot homology which can be understood in terms of geometric representation theory in these formulations. These notes are based on lectures in the workshop "Physics and Mathematics of Link Homology" at Centre de Recherches Mathematiques, Universite de Montreal.
