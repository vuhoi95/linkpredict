Title: Asymptotic freedom of gluons in the Fock space
Authors: Stanisław D. Głazek and Maria Gómez-Rocha
Abstract: Asymptotic freedom of gluons is described in terms of a family of scale-dependent renormalized Hamiltonian operators acting in the Fock space. The Hamiltonians are obtained by applying the renormalization group procedure for effective particles to quantum Yang-Mills theory.
