Title: Exploring the new phase transition of CDT
Authors: D. N. Coumbe and J. Gizbert-Studnicki and J. Jurkiewicz
Abstract: This work focuses on the newly discovered bifurcation phase transition of CDT quantum gravity. We define various order parameters and investigate which is most suitable to study this transition in numerical simulations. By analyzing the behaviour of the order parameters we present evidence that the transition separating the bifurcation phase and the physical phase of CDT is likely a second or higher-order transition, a result that may have important implications for the continuum limit of CDT.
