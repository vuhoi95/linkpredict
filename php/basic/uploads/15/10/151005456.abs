Title: A Novel Insulator by Holographic Q-lattices
Authors: Yi Ling and Peng Liu and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: We construct a bulk geometry with Q-lattice structure, which is implemented by two gauge fields and a coupling between the lattice and the Maxwell field. This gravity dual model can describe a novel insulator which exhibits some key features analogous to Mott insulator. In particular, a hard gap in insulating phase as well as vanishing DC conductivity can be simultaneously achieved. In addition, we discuss the non-Drude behavior of the optical conductivity in low frequency region in insulating phase, which exhibits some novel characteristics different from ordinary Mott insulator.
