Title: Effective action for a quantum scalar field in warped spaces
Authors: J. M. Hoff da Silva and E. L. Mendon√ßa and E. Scatena
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop corrections at zero, as well as finite temperature, of a scalar field taking place in a braneworld motived warped background. After to reach a well defined problem, we calculate the effective action with the corresponding quantum corrections to each case.
