Title: Renormalisation Group determination of scalar mass bounds in a simple  Yukawa-model
Authors: A. Jakovac and I. Kaposvari and A. Patkos
Abstract: The scalar mass is determined in the simplest scalar-fermion Yukawa-model in the whole range of stability of the scalar potential. Two versions of the Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) equations are solved, where also composite fermionic background is taken into account. The close agreement of the results with previous studies taking into account exclusively the effect of the scalar condensate, supports a rather small systematic truncation error of FRG due to the omission of higher dimensional operators.
