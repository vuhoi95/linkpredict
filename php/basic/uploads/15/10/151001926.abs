Title: Projective Limits of State Spaces IV. Fractal Label Sets
Authors: Suzanne Lan√©ry and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: Instead of formulating the state space of a quantum field theory over one big Hilbert space, it has been proposed by Kijowski [Kijowski 1977] to represent quantum states as projective families of density matrices over a collection of smaller, simpler Hilbert spaces. One can thus bypass the need to select a vacuum state for the theory, and still be provided with an explicit and constructive description of the quantum state space, at least as long as the label set indexing the projective structure is countable. Because uncountable label sets are much less practical in this context, we develop in the present article a general procedure to trim an originally uncountable label set down to countable cardinality. In particular, we investigate how to perform this tightening of the label set in a way that preserves both the physical content of the algebra of observables and its symmetries. This work is notably motivated by applications to the holonomy-flux algebra underlying Loop Quantum Gravity. Building on earlier work by Okolow [arXiv:1304.6330], a projective state space was introduced for this algebra in [arXiv:1411.3592]. However, the non-trivial structure of the holonomy-flux algebra prevents the construction of satisfactory semi-classical states. Implementing the general procedure just mentioned in the case of a one-dimensional version of this algebra, we show how a discrete subalgebra can be extracted without destroying universality nor diffeomorphism invariance. On this subalgebra, states can then be constructed whose semi-classicality is enforced step by step, starting from collective, macroscopic degrees of freedom and going down progressively toward smaller and smaller scales.
