Title: Testing non-associative quantum mechanics
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Suddhasattwa Brahma and Umut Buyukcam
Abstract: The familiar concepts of state vectors and operators in quantum mechanics rely on associative products of observables. However, these notions do not apply to some exotic systems such as magnetic monopoles, which have long been known to lead to non-associative algebras. Their quantum physics has remained obscure. This letter presents the first derivation of potentially testable physical results in non-associative quantum mechanics, based on effective potentials. They imply new effects which cannot be mimicked in usual quantum mechanics with standard magnetic fields.
