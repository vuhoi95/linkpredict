Title: Microstate solutions from black hole deconstruction
Authors: Joris Raeymaekers and Dieter Van den Bleeken
Abstract: We present a new family of asymptotic AdS_3 x S^2 solutions to eleven dimensional supergravity compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. They originate from the backreaction of S^2-wrapped M2-branes, which play a central role in the deconstruction proposal for the microscopic interpretation of the D4-D0 black hole entropy. We show that they are free of possible pathologies such as closed timelike curves and discuss their holographic interpretation.
