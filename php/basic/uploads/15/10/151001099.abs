Title: Dynamical Domain Wall and Localization
Authors: Yuta Toyozato and Masafumi Higuchi and Shin'ichi Nojiri
Abstract: Based on the previous works (arXiv:1202.5375 and 1402.1346), we investigate the localization of the fields on the dynamical domain wall, where the four dimensional FRW universe is realized on the domain wall in the five dimensional space-time. Especially we show that the chiral spinor can localize on the domain wall, which has not been succeeded in the past works as the seminal work in arXiv:0810.3746.
