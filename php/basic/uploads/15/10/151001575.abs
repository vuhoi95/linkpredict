Title: Scattering in Twisted Yangians
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: We study the bulk and boundary scattering of the sl(N) twisted Yangian spin chain via the solution of the Bethe ansatz equations in the thermodynamic limit. Explicit expressions for the scattering amplitudes are obtained and the factorization of the bulk scattering is shown. The issue of defects in twisted Yangians is also briefly discussed.
