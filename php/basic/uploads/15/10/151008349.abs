Title: Magnetic structures and Z_2 vortices in a non-Abelian gauge model
Authors: Daniel Cabra and Gustavo S. Lozano and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: The magnetic order of the triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions is described by an SO(3) field and allows for the presence of Z2 magnetic vortices as defects. In this work we show how these Z2 vortices can be fitted into a local SU(2) gauge theory. We propose simple Ansatzes for vortex configurations and calculate their energies using well-known results of the Abelian gauge model. We comment on how Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions could be derived from a non-Abelian gauge theory and speculate on their effect on non trivial configurations.
