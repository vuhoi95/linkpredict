Title: Bethe Ansatz and exact form factors of the O(N) Gross Neveu-model
Authors: Hrachya M. Babujian and Angela Foerster and Michael Karowski
Abstract: We apply previous results on the O(N) Bethe Ansatz [1 to 3] to construct a general form factor formula for the O(N) Gross-Neveu model. We examine this formula for several operators, such as the energy momentum, the spin-field and the current. We also compare these results with the 1/N expansion of this model and obtain full agreement. We discuss bound state form factors, in particular for the three particle form factor of the field. In addition for the two particle case we prove a recursion relation for the K-functions of the higher level Bethe Ansatz.
