Title: Stochastic cosmology, theories of perturbations and Lifshitz gravity
Authors: I. M. Khalatnikov and A. Yu. Kamenshchik
Abstract: We review some works of E M Lifshitz connected with gravity and cosmology and also some later works, connected with his ideas. The main topics of this review are the stochastic cosmology of an anisotropic universe and of an isotropic universe with the scalar field, the quasi-isotropic (gradient) expansion in cosmology and Horava-Lifshitz gravity and cosmology.
