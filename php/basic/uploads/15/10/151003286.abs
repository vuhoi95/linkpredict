Authors: H. Reinhardt and D. Campagnari and J. Heffner and M. Quandt and P. Vastag
Abstract: The variational Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge is reviewed and the essential results obtained in recent years are summarized. First the results for the vacuum sector are discussed, with a special emphasis on the mechansim of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Then the deconfinement phase transition is described by introducing temperature in the Hamiltonian approach via compactification of one spatial dimension. The effective action for the Polyakov loop is calculated and the order of the phase transition as well as the critical temperatures are obtained for the color group SU(2) and SU(3). In both cases, our predictions are in good agreement with lattice calculations.
