Title: The Amplituhedron and the One-loop Grassmannian Measure
Authors: Yuntao Bai and Song He and Thomas Lam
Abstract: All-loop planar scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be formulated geometrically in terms of the "amplituhedron". We study the mathematical structures of the one-loop amplituhedron, and present a new formula for its canonical measure, or the one-loop Grassmannian measure formula. Using the recently proposed momentum-twistor diagrams, we show that there is a correspondence between the cells of one-loop amplituhedron, BCFW terms or equivalently on-shell diagrams, and residues of the one-loop Grassmannian formula. In particular, for the first non-trivial case of one-loop NMHV, these structures are naturally associated with a nice geometric picture as polygons in projective space, as we discuss in various illustrative examples.
