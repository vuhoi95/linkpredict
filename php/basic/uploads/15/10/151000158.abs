Title: Semi-classical and nonlinear energy conditions
Authors: Prado Martin-Moruno and Matt Visser
Abstract: We consider the characteristics of nonlinear energy conditions and of quantum extensions of these and the usual energy conditions. We show that they are satisfied by some quantum vacuum states that violate the usual energy conditions.
