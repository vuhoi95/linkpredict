Title: Thermodynamics of third order Lovelock adS black holes in the presence  of Born-Infeld type nonlinear electrodynamics
Authors: Seyed Hossein Hendi and Ali Dehghani
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain topological black hole solutions of third order Lovelock gravity couple with two classes of Born-Infeld type nonlinear electrodynamics with anti-de Sitter asymptotic structure. We investigate geometric and thermodynamics properties of the solutions and obtain conserved quantities of the black holes. We examine the first law of thermodynamics and find that the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the black hole solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we calculate the heat capacity and determinant of Hessian matrix to evaluate thermal stability in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Moreover, we consider extended phase space thermodynamics to obtain generalized first law of thermodynamics as well as extended Smarr formula.
