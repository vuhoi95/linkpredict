Title: $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Janus Solutions and Flows: From Gauged  Supergravity to M Theory
Authors: Krzysztof Pilch and Alexander Tyukov and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We investigate a family of SU(3)$\times$U(1)$\times$U(1)-invariant holographic flows and Janus solutions obtained from gauged $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity in four dimensions. We give complete details of how to use the uplift formulae to obtain the corresponding solutions in M theory. While the flow solutions appear to be singular from the four-dimensional perspective, we find that the eleven-dimensional solutions are much better behaved and give rise to interesting new classes of compactification geometries that are smooth, up to orbifolds, in the infra-red limit. Our solutions involve new phases in which M2 branes polarize partially or even completely into M5 branes. We derive the eleven-dimensional supersymmetries and show that the eleven-dimensional equations of motion and BPS equations are indeed satisfied as a consequence of their four-dimensional counterparts. Apart from elucidating a whole new class of eleven-dimensional Janus and flow solutions, our work provides extensive and highly non-trivial tests of the recently-derived uplift formulae.
