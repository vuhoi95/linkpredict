Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of charged rotating black hole in large extra dimensions scenario where quantum gravity effects are taken into account. We consider the effects of minimal length, minimal momentum, and maximal momentum as natural cutoffs on the thermodynamics of charged rotating TeV-scale black holes. In this framework the effect of the angular momentum and charge on the thermodynamics of the black hole are discussed. We focus also on frame dragging and Sagnac effect of the micro black holes.
