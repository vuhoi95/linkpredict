Title: Dualities in 3D Large $N$ Vector Models
Authors: Nouman Muteeb and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Fernando Quevedo
Abstract: Using an explicit path integral approach we derive non-abelian bosonization and duality of 3D systems in the large $N$ limit. We first consider a fermionic $U(N)$ vector model coupled to level $k$ Chern-Simons theory, following standard techniques we gauge the original global symmetry and impose the corresponding field strength $F_{\mu\nu}$ to vanish introducing a Lagrange multiplier $\Lambda$. Exchanging the order of integrations we obtain the bosonized theory with $\Lambda$ as the propagating field using the large $N$ rather than the previously used large mass limit. Next we follow the same procedure to dualize the scalar $U(N)$ vector model coupled to Chern-Simons and find its corresponding dual theory. Finally, we compare the partition functions of the two resulting theories and find that they agree in the large $N$ limit including a level/rank duality. This provides a constructive evidence for previous proposals on level/rank duality of 3D vector models in the large $N$ limit. We also present a partial analysis at subleading order in large $N$ and find that the duality does not generically hold at this level.
