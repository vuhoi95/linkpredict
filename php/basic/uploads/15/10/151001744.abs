Title: Brane Brick Models, Toric Calabi-Yau 4-Folds and 2d (0,2) Quivers
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Sangmin Lee and Rak-Kyeong Seong
Abstract: We introduce brane brick models, a novel type of Type IIA brane configurations consisting of D4-branes ending on an NS5-brane. Brane brick models are T-dual to D1-branes over singular toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. They fully encode the infinite class of 2d (generically) N=(0,2) gauge theories on the worldvolume of the D1-branes and streamline their connection to the probed geometries. For this purpose, we also introduce new combinatorial procedures for deriving the Calabi-Yau associated to a given gauge theory and vice versa.
