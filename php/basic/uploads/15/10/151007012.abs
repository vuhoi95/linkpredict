Title: Gauge-invariant field-strength correlators for QCD in a magnetic  background
Authors: Massimo D'Elia and Enrico Meggiolaro and Michele Mesiti and Francesco Negro
Abstract: We consider the properties of the gauge-invariant two-point correlation functions of the gauge-field strengths for QCD in the presence of a magnetic background field. We discuss the general structure of the correlators in this case and provide the results of an exploratory lattice study for $N_f = 2$ QCD discretized with unimproved staggered fermions. Our analysis provides evidence for the emergence of anisotropies in the non-perturbative part of the correlators and for an increase of the gluon condensate as a function of the external magnetic field.
