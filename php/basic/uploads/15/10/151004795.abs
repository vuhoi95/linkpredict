Authors: Safia Ahmad and Nurgissa Myrzakulov and R. Myrzakulov
Abstract: In this paper, we consider rolling tachyon, with steep run-away type of potentials non-minimally coupled to massive neutrino matter. The coupling dynamically builds up at late times as neutrino matter turns non-relativistic. In case of scaling and string inspired potentials, we have shown that non-minimal coupling leads to minimum in the field potential. Given a suitable choice of model parameters, it is shown to give rise to late-time acceleration with the desired equation of state.
