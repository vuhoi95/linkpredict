Title: Chern-Simons dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Karim Ait Moussa and Gérard Clément and Hakim Guennoune
Abstract: We construct rotating magnetic solutions to the three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-dilaton theory with a Liouville potential. These include a class of black hole solutions which generalize the warped AdS black holes. The regular black holes belong to two disjoint sectors. The first sector includes black holes which have a positive mass and are co-rotating, while the black holes of the second sector have a negative mass and are counter-rotating. We also show that a particular, non-black hole, subfamily of our three-dimensional solutions may be uplifted to new regular non-asymptotically flat solutions of five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory.
