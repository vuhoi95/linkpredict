Title: Pair Production In Near Extremal Charged Black Holes
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Jia-Rui Sun and Fu-Yi Tang
Abstract: We study the spontaneous pair production, including the Schwinger mechanism and the Hawking radiation, of charged scalar and spinor particles from the near horizon region of (near) extremal charged black holes in the probe field limit. The pair production rate and the absorption cross section, as well as the retarded Green's functions of the probe fields are analytically computed. Moreover, the holographic description dual to the pair production is discussed.
