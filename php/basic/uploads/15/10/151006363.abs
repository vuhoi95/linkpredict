Title: Under The Dome: Doped holographic superconductors with broken  translational symmetry
Authors: Matteo Baggioli and Mikhail Goykhman
Abstract: We comment on a simple way to accommodate translational symmetry breaking into the recently proposed holographic model which features a superconducting dome-shaped region on the temperature-doping phase diagram.
