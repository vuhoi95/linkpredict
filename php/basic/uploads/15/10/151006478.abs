Title: Hawking Effect as Quantum Inertial Effect
Authors: Yu-Lei Feng and Yi-Xin Chen
Abstract: We show that "particle production" by gravitational field, especially the Hawking effect, may be treated as some quantum inertial effect, with the energy of Hawking radiation as some vacuum energy shift. This quantum inertial effect is mainly resulted from some intrinsical energy fluctuation $\hbar\kappa/c$ for a black hole. In particular, there is an extreme case in which $\hbar\kappa/c$ is the Planck energy, giving a "Planck black hole" whose event horizon's diameter is one Planck length. Moreover, we also provide a possibility to obtain some positive cosmological constant for an expanding universe, which is induced from the vacuum energy shift caused by quantum inertial effect.
