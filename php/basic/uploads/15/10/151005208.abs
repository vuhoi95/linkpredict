Title: Hairy black holes in scalar extended massive gravity
Authors: Andrew J. Tolley and De-Jun Wu and Shuang-Yong Zhou
Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in scalar extended ghost-free massive gravity and show the existence of hairy black holes in this class of extension. While the existence seems to be a generic feature, we focus on the simplest models of this extension and find that asymptotically flat hairy black holes can exist without fine-tuning the theory parameters, unlike the bi-gravity extension, where asymptotical flatness requires fine-tuning in the parameter space. Like the bi-gravity extension, we are unable to obtain asymptotically dS regular black holes in the simplest models considered, but it is possible to obtain asymptotically AdS black holes.
