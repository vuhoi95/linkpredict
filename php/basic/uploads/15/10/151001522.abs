Title: The Flux-Scaling Scenario: De Sitter Uplift and Axion Inflation
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Cesar Damian and Anamaria Font and Daniela Herschmann and Rui Sun
Abstract: Non-geometric flux-scaling vacua provide promising starting points to realize axion monodromy inflation via the F-term scalar potential. We show that these vacua can be uplifted to Minkowski and de Sitter by adding an anti D3-brane or a D-term containing geometric and non-geometric fluxes. These uplifted non-supersymmetric models are analyzed with respect to their potential to realize axion monodromy inflation self-consistently. Admitting rational values of the fluxes, we construct examples with the required hierarchy of mass scales.
