Authors: S. H. Hendi and B. Eslam Panah and S. Panahiyan
Abstract: Motivated by gauge/gravity group in the low energy effective theory of the heterotic string theory, the minimal coupling of Gauss-Bonnet-massive gravity with Born-Infeld electrodynamics is considered. At first the metric function is calculated and then the geometrical properties of the solutions are investigated. It is found that there is an essential singularity at the origin and the intrinsic curvature is regular elsewhere. In addition, the effects of massive parameters on the horizons of black holes are studied and the conserved and thermodynamic quantities are calculated. Also, it is shown that the solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Furthermore using heat capacity of these black holes, thermal stability and phase transitions are investigated. The variation of different parameters and related modifications on the (number of) phase transition are examined. Next, the critical behavior of the Gauss-Bonnet-Born-Infeld-massive black holes in context of extended phase space is studied. It is shown that how the variation of the different parameters affects the existence and absence of phase transition. Also, it is found that for specific values of different parameters, these black holes may enjoy the existence of new type of phase transition which to our knowledge was not observed in black hole physics before.
