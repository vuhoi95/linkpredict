Title: Super-BMS$_{3}$ invariant boundary theory from three-dimensional flat  supergravity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Laura Donnay and Javier Matulich and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: The two-dimensional super-BMS$_{3}$ invariant theory dual to three-dimensional asymptotically flat $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity is constructed. It is described by a constrained or gauged chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten action based on the super-Poincar\'e algebra in the Hamiltonian, respectively the Lagrangian formulation, whose reduced phase space description corresponds to a supersymmetric extension of flat Liouville theory.
