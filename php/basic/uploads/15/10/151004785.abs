Title: T-duality trivializes bulk-boundary correspondence: the parametrised  case
Authors: Keith Hannabuss and Varghese Mathai and Guo Chuan Thiang
Abstract: We state a general conjecture that T-duality trivialises a model for the bulk-boundary correspondence in the parametrised context. We give evidence that it is valid by proving it in a special interesting case, which is relevant both to String Theory and to the study of topological insulators with defects in Condensed Matter Physics.
