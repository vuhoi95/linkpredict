Title: Steerability of Quantum Coherence in Accelerated Frame
Authors: Debasis Mondal and Chiranjib Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: The interplay between steering and quantum coherence is studied in a scenario, where two atoms move through an external massless scalar field. We show that just like entanglement, the steering induced coherence of the equilibrium state may increase or decrease with acceleration depending on the initial condition of the state. We also investigate the condition for coherence steerability - as opposed to simple state steerability. Interestingly, we find that the quantum coherence of the equilibrium state cannot be steered, even when the steering induced coherence is non-zero. We argue that under any condition, gravity prohibits the coherence steering of the equilibrium state.
