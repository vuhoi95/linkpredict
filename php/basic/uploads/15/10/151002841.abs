Title: The number radial coherent states for the generalized MICZ-Kepler  problem
Authors: D. Ojeda-Guillén and M. Salazar-Ramírez and R. D. Mota
Abstract: We study the radial part of the MICZ-Kepler problem in an algebraic way by using the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We obtain the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of this problem from the $su(1,1)$ theory of unitary representations and the tilting transformation to the stationary Schr\"odinger equation. We construct the physical Perelomov number coherent states for this problem and compute some expectation values. Also, we obtain the time evolution of these coherent states.
