Title: Integrable supersymmetric chain without particle conservation
Authors: Jan de Gier and Gyorgy Z. Feher and Bernard Nienhuis and Magdalena Rusaczonek
Abstract: We introduce a new integrable supersymmetric lattice chain which violates fermion conservation and exhibits fermion-hole symmetry. The model displays exponential degeneracy in every eigenstate including the groundstate. This degeneracy is expressed in the possibility to create any number of zero modes reminiscent of Cooper pairs.
