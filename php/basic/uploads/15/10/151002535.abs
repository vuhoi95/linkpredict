Title: Constraining conformal field theories with a higher spin symmetry in d>  3 dimensions
Authors: Vasyl Alba and Kenan Diab
Abstract: We study unitary conformal field theories with a unique stress tensor and at least one higher-spin conserved current in d>3 dimensions. We prove that every such theory contains an infinite number of higher-spin conserved currents of arbitrarily high spin, and that Ward identities generated by the conserved charges of these currents imply that the correlators of the stress tensor and the conserved currents of the theory must coincide with one of the following three possibilities: a) a theory of n free bosons (for some integer n), b) a theory of n free fermions, or c) a theory of n (d-2)/2-forms. For d even, all three structures exist, but for d odd, it may be the case that the third structure (c) does not; if it does exist, it is unclear what theory, if any, realizes it. This is a generalization of the result proved in three dimensions by Maldacena and Zhiboedov [arXiv:1112.1016]. This paper supersedes the previous paper by the authors [arXiv:1307.8092]
