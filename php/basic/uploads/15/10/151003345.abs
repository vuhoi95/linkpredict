Abstract: It is known that the Bloch brane is generated by an odd scalar field $\phi$ and an even one $\chi$. In order to localize a bulk fermion on the Bloch brane, the coupling between the fermion and scalars should be introduced. However, only the Yukawa coupling between the fermion and the odd scalar $\phi$ was considered. In this paper, we consider the full coupling between the fermion and the odd and even scalars, and investigate the localization and spectrum structure of the fermion on the Bloch brane. It is found that the full coupling insures that the left-handed fermion zero mode can be localized on the Bloch brane under some conditions, and the effective potentials have richer structure and may be volcano-like, finite square well-like, and infinite potentials. As a result, the spectrum is consisted of a series of resonant Kaluza-Klein fermions, finite or infinite numbers of bound Kaluza-Klein fermions.
