Title: Real and pseudoreal forms of D=4 complex Euclidean (super)algebras and  super-Poincare / super-Euclidean r-matrices
Authors: Andrzej Borowiec and Jerzy Lukierski and Valerij N. Tolstoy
Abstract: We provide the classification of real forms of complex D=4 Euclidean algebra $\mathcal{\epsilon}(4; \mathbb{C}) = \mathfrak{o}(4;\mathbb{C})) \ltimes \mathbf{T}_{\mathbb{C}}^4$ as well as (pseudo)real forms of complex D=4 Euclidean superalgebras $\mathcal{\epsilon}(4|N; \mathbb{C})$ for N=1,2. Further we present our results: N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric D=4 Poincare and Euclidean r-matrices obtained by using D= 4 Poincare r-matrices provided by Zakrzewski [1]. For N=2 we shall consider the general superalgebras with two central charges.
