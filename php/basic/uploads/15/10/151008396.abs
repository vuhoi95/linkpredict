Title: Static multi-soliton solutions in the affine su(N+1) Toda models
Authors: J. Costa de Faria and P. Klimas
Abstract: We study some static multi-soliton configurations in the su(N + 1) Toda models. Such configurations exist for N > 1. We construct explicitly a multi-soliton solution for any N and study conditions for having such solutions. The number of static solitons is limited by the rank of the su(N + 1) Lie algebra. We give some examples of non-static multi-soliton solutions with static components.
