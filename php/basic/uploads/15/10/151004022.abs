Authors: Stoytcho Yazadjiev and Boian Lazov
Abstract: We consider the problem for the classification of static and asymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton spacetimes with a photon sphere. It is first proven that the photon spheres in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity have constant mean and constant scalar curvature. Then we derive some relations between the mean curvature and the physical characteristics of the photon spheres. Using further the symmetries of the dimensionally reduced Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton field equations we show that the lapse function, the electrostatic potential and the dilaton field are functionally dependent in the presence of a photon sphere. Using all this we prove the main classification theorem by explicitly constructing all Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton solutions possessing a non-extremal photon sphere.
