Abstract: We study Yang-Baxter sigma models with deformed 4D Minkowski spacetimes arising from classical $r$-matrices associated with $\kappa$-deformations of the Poincar\'e algebra. These classical $\kappa$-Poincar\'e $r$-matrices describe three kinds of deformations: 1) the standard deformation, 2) the tachyonic deformation, and 3) the light-cone deformation. For each deformation, the metric and two-form $B$-field are computed from the associated $r$-matrix. The first two deformations, related to the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, lead to T-duals of dS$_4$ and AdS$_4$\,, respectively. The third deformation, associated with the homogeneous classical Yang-Baxter equation, leads to a time-dependent pp-wave background. Finally, we construct a Lax pair for the generalized $\kappa$-Poincar\'e $r$-matrix that unifies the three kinds of deformations mentioned above as special cases.
