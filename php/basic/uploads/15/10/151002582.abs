Authors: J. A. Agudelo and H. I. Arcos and A. Idarraga
Abstract: A cosmological analysis considering the inclusion of dark energy and dark matter cosmic components in the context of some particular cases for intersecting S-brane solutions is presented and discussed. Direct solution of $d$-dim field equations and dimensional reduction processes, are implemented for the pure dark energy and dark energy with dark matter cosmological scenarios, respectively. In the first case, explicit expressions and evolution for $d$-dim scale factors are founded and studied. Secondly, a low energy effective $4$-dim model is obtained analytically and their resulting field equations are solved numerically. The role of internal space geometry is always a central element of our analysis. In some intersecting cases and under certain considerations, a suitable late-time cosmic acceleration description is founded and an adequate behavior for scale factor $a(t)$ and realistic values for dark energy $\Omega_{DE}$ and dark matter $\Omega_{DM}$ relative energy densities are obtained as well. As a result, we do specifically obtain late-time cosmic acceleration in one scenario where our universe makes part either of an SM2$\bot$SM2 or an SM2$\bot$SM5 intersection. This could give rise to further possible configurations where late-time cosmic acceleration is present.
