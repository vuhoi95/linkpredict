Title: BRST symmetry of Unimodular Gravity
Authors: S. Upadhyay and M. Oksanen and R. Bufalo
Abstract: We derive the BRST symmetry for two versions of unimodular gravity, namely, fully diffeomorphism-invariant unimodular gravity and unimodular gravity with fixed metric determinant. The BRST symmetry is generalized further to the finite field-dependent BRST, in order to establish the connection between different gauges in each of the two versions of unimodular gravity.
