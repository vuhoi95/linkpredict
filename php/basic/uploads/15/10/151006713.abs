Title: Extended Jackiw-Pi Model and Its Supersymmetrization
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present an extended version of the so-called Jackiw-Pi (JP) model in three dimensions, and perform its supersymmetrization. Our field content has three multiplets: (i) Yang-Mills vector multiplet $(A_\mu{}^I, \lambda^I)$, (ii) Parity-odd extra vector multiplet $(B_\mu{}^I, \chi^I)$, and (iii) Scalar multiplet $(C^I, \rho^I, f^I)$. The bosonic fields in these multiplets are the same as the original JP-model, except for the auxiliary field $~f^I$ which is new, while the fermions $\lambda^I, \chi^I$ and $\rho^I$ are their super-partners. The basic difference from the original JP-model is the presence of the kinetic term for $C^I$ with its modified field-strength $H_\mu{}^I \equiv D_\mu C^I + m B_\mu{}^I$. The inclusion of the $C^I$-kinetic term is to comply with the recently-developed tensor hierarchy formulation for supersymmetrization.
