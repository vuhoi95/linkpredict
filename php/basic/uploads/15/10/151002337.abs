Title: The Hidden Flat Like Universe II: Quasi inverse power law inflation by  $f(T)$ gravity
Authors: W. El Hanafy and G. G. L. Nashed
Abstract: In a recent work, a particular class of $f(T)$ gravity, where $T$ is the teleparallel torsion scalar, has been derived. This class has been identified by flat-like universe (FLU) assumptions \cite{HN15}. The model is consistent with the early cosmic inflation epoch. A quintessence potential has been constructed from the FLU $f(T)$-gravity. We show that the first order potential of the induced quintessence is a quasi inverse power law inflation with an additional constant providing an end of the inflation with no need to an extra mechanism. At $e$-folds $N_{*}= 55$ before the end of the inflation, this type of potential can perform both $E$ and $B$ modes of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization pattern.
