Title: Conserved charges of the extended Bondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra
Authors: Éanna É. Flanagan and David A. Nichols
Abstract: Isolated objects in asymptotically flat spacetimes in general relativity are characterized by their conserved charges associated with the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group. These charges include total energy, linear momentum, intrinsic angular momentum and center-of-mass location, and, in addition, an infinite number of supermomentum charges associated with supertranslations. Recently, it has been suggested that the BMS symmetry algebra should be enlarged to include an infinite number of additional symmetries known as superrotations. We show that the corresponding charges are finite and well defined, and can be divided into electric parity "super center-of-mass" charges and magnetic parity "superspin" charges. The supermomentum charges are associated with ordinary gravitational-wave memory, and the super center-of-mass charges are associated with total (ordinary plus null) gravitational-wave memory, in the terminology of Bieri and Garfinkle. Superspin charges are associated with the ordinary piece of spin memory. Some of these charges can give rise to black-hole hair, as described by Strominger and Zhiboedov. We clarify how this hair evades the no-hair theorems.
