Abstract: We study the ultraviolet properties of theories whose fundamental fields display a confining, Gribov-type, propagator. These are propagators that exhibit complex poles and violate positivity, thus precluding a physical propagating particle interpretation. We show that the properties of this type of confining propagators do not change the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, in the sense that no new ultraviolet primitive divergences are generated, thus securing the renormalizability of these confining theories. We illustrate these properties by studying a variety of models, including bosonic and fermionic confined degrees of freedom. The more intricate case of Super Yang-Mills with ${\cal N} =1$ supersymmetries in the Wess-Zumino gauge is taken as example in order to prove these statements to all orders by means of the algebraic renormalization set up.
