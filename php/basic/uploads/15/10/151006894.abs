Title: Heat kernels on cone of $AdS_2$ and $k$-wound circular Wilson loop in  $AdS_5 \times S^5$ superstring
Authors: R. Bergamin and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We compute the one-loop world-sheet correction to partition function of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ superstring that should be representing $k$-fundamental circular Wilson loop in planar limit. The 2d metric of the minimal surface ending on $k$-wound circle at the boundary is that of a cone of $AdS_2$ with deficit $2\pi (1-k)$. We compute determinants of 2d fluctuation operators by first constructing heat kernels of scalar and spinor Laplacians on the cone using the Sommerfeld formula. The final expression for the k-dependent part of the one-loop correction has simple integral representation but is different from earlier results.
