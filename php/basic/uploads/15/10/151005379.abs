Title: On the smallness of the cosmological constant in SUGRA models with  Planck scale SUSY breaking and degenerate vacua
Authors: C. Froggatt and R. Nevzorov and H. B. Nielsen and A. Thomas
Abstract: We argue that the exact degeneracy of vacua in N=1 supergravity can shed light on the smallness of the cosmological constant. The presence of such vacua, which are degenerate to very high accuracy, may also result in small values of the quartic Higgs coupling and its beta function at the Planck scale in the phase in which we live.
