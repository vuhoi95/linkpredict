Title: Born-Infeld Gravity with a Unique Vacuum and a Massless Graviton
Authors: Ibrahim Gullu and Tahsin Cagri Sisman and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We construct an n-dimensional Born-Infeld type gravity theory that has the same properties as Einstein's gravity in terms of the vacuum and particle content: Namely, the theory has a unique viable vacuum (maximally symmetric solution) and a single massless unitary spin-2 graviton about this vacuum. The BI gravity, in some sense, is the most natural, minimal generalization of Einstein's gravity with a better UV behavior, and hence, is a potentially viable proposal for low energy quantum gravity. The Gauss-Bonnet combination plays a non-trivial role in the construction of the theory. As an extreme example, we consider the infinite dimensional limit where an interesting exponential gravity arises.
