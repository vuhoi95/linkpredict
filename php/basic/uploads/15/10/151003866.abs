Title: Bootstrapping ${\mathcal N}=2$ chiral correlators
Authors: Madalena Lemos and Pedro Liendo
Abstract: We apply the numerical bootstrap program to chiral operators in four-dimensional ${\mathcal N}=2$ SCFTs. In the first part of this work we study four-point functions in which all fields have the same conformal dimension. We give special emphasis to bootstrapping a specific theory: the simplest Argyres-Douglas fixed point with no flavor symmetry. In the second part we generalize our setup and consider correlators of fields with unequal dimension. This is an example of a mixed correlator and allows us to probe new regions in the parameter space of ${\mathcal N}=2$ SCFTs. In particular, our results put constraints on relations in the Coulomb branch chiral ring and on the curvature of the Zamolodchikov metric.
