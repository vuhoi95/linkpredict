Title: Ferrara-Porrati-Sagnotti approach and the one-dimensional supersymmetric  model with PBGS
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Sutulin
Abstract: We apply Ferrara-Porrati-Sagnotti approach to the case of one-dimensional supersymmetric model with N=2 supersymmetry spontaneously broken to the N=1 one. We explicitly demonstrate that only one superfield can be treated as the Goldstone one, while the second one has the meaning of the matter superfield. The general action for such a system is constructed and also two relevant particular cases are considered.
