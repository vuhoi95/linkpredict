Title: Three Point Functions in the N=4 Orthogonal Coset Theory
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Hyunsu Kim and Jinsub Paeng
Abstract: We construct the lowest higher spin-2 current in terms of the spin-1 and the spin-1/2 currents living in the orthogonal SO(N+4)/[SO(N) x SO(4)] Wolf space coset theory for general N. The remaining fifteen higher spin currents are determined. We obtain the three-point functions of bosonic (higher) spin currents with two scalars for finite N and k (the level of the spin-1 current). By multiplying SU(2) x U(1) into the above Wolf space coset theory, the other fifteen higher spin currents together with the above lowest higher spin-2 current are realized in the extension of the large N=4 linear superconformal algebra. Similarly, the three-point functions of bosonic (higher) spin currents with two scalars for finite N and k are obtained. Under the large N 't Hooft limit, the two types of three-point functions in the nonlinear and linear versions coincide as in the unitary coset theory found previously.
