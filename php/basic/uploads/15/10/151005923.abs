Title: Searching for non-Gaussianity in the Planck data
Authors: M. J. Reboucas and A. Bernui
Abstract: The statistical properties of the temperature anisotropies and polarization of the of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offer a powerful probe of the physics of the early universe. In recent works a statistical procedure based upon the calculation of the kurtosis and skewness of the data in patches of CMB sky-sphere has been proposed and used to investigate the large-angle deviation from Gaussianity in WMAP maps. Here we briefly address the question as to how this analysis of Gaussianity is modified if the foreground-cleaned Planck maps are considered. We show that although the foreground-cleaned Planck maps present significant deviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when a less severe mask is used, they become consistent with Gaussianity, as detected by our indicators, when masked with the union mask U73.
