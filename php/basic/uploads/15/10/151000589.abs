Title: Hermitian separability and transition from singlet to adjoint BFKL  equations in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: S. Bondarenko and A. Prygarin
Abstract: We revisit the next-to-leading order~(NLO) correction to the eigenvalue of the BFKL equation in the adjoint representation and investigate its properties in analogy with the singlet BFKL in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills Theory~(SYM). We show that the adjoint NLO BFKL eigenvalue is needed to be slightly modified in order to have a property of hermitian separability present for the singlet BFKL. After this modification the adjoint NLO BFKL eigenvalue is expressed through holomorphic and antiholomophic parts of the leading order eigenvalue and their derivatives. The proposed choice of the modified NLO expression is supported by the fact that it is possible to obtain the same result in a relatively straightforward way directly from the singlet NLO BFKL eigenvalue replacing alternating sums by non-alternating ones. This transformation corresponds to changing cylindrical topology of the singlet BFKL to the planar topology of the adjoint BFKL. We believe that the original NLO calculation of Fadin and Lipatov is correct and valid for the computations of the remainder function of the BDS amplitude. However, the notion of the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue is vaguely defined due to removal of the infrared divergences as well as redistributing NLO corrections between the kernel and impact factors, and is to be modified to comply with properties of the singlet BFKL equation. This, at first sight, a purely semantic difference may become important in resolving the issue of the non-vanishing adjoint NNLO eigenvalue in the limit of zero anomalous dimension $\nu$ and conformal spin $n$, which contradicts the bootstrap condition of the BFKL equation.
