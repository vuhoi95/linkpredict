Title: Magnetic brane solutions of Lovelock gravity with nonlinear  electrodynamics
Authors: Seyed Hossein Hendi and Behzad Eslam Panah and Shahram Panahiyan
Abstract: In this paper, we consider logarithmic and exponential forms of nonlinear electrodynamics as a source and obtain magnetic brane solutions of the Lovelock gravity. Although these solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizon, they have a conic singularity with a deficit angle. We investigate the effects of nonlinear electrodynamics and the Lovelock gravity on the value of deficit angle and find that various terms of Lovelock gravity do not affect deficit angle. Next, we generalize our solutions to spinning cases with maximum rotating parameters in arbitrary dimensions and calculate the conserved quantities of the solutions. Finally, we consider nonlinear electrodynamics as a correction of the Maxwell theory and investigate the properties of the solutions.
