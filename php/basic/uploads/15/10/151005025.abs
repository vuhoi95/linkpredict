Title: ADE Transform
Authors: Ron Donagi and Martijn Wijnholt
Abstract: There is a beautiful correspondence between configurations of lines on a rational surface and tautological bundles over that surface. We extend this correspondence to families, by means of a generalized Fourier-Mukai transform that relates spectral data to bundles over a rational surface fibration.
