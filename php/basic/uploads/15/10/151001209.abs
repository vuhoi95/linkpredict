Title: Black Rings in U(1)^3 Supergravity and their dual 2d CFT
Authors: S. Sadeghian and H. Yavartanoo
Abstract: We study the near horizon geometry of black ring solutions in five-dimensional U(1)^3 supergravity with three electric dipole charges and one angular momentum. We consider the extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit of these solutions and show that the near horizon geometries develop locally AdS_3 throats which at the near-EVH near horizon limit the AdS_3 factor turns to a BTZ black hole. By analysing the first law of thermodynamics for black rings we show that at EVH limit it reduces to the first law of thermodynamics for BTZ black holes. Using the AdS3/CFT2 duality, we propose a dual CFT to describe the near-horizon low energy dynamics of near-EVH black rings. We also discuss the connection between our CFT proposal and the Kerr/CFT correspondence in the cases where these two overlap.
