Title: Effect of Self-Interaction on Vacuum Energy for Yang-Mills System in  Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: Kiyoshi Shiraishi and Satoru Hirenzaki
Abstract: We calculate the vacuum energy for Yang--Mills (YM) system in the background space-time $M^4 \times S^3$, taking the effect of self-interaction of the YM fields into account. The compactification scale obtained by Candelas--Weinberg mechanism becomes large if the YM coupling is large. The case with an extra space $S^3/Z_2$ is also considered, and it is shown that the vacuum associated with broken gauge symmetry is unstable.
