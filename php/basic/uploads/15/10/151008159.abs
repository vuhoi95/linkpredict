Abstract: In a study of the quasinormal mode frequencies of nearly extremal black holes, we pointed out a bifurcation of the mode spectrum into modes with finite decay and modes with vanishing decay in the extremal limit. We provided analytic and semi-analytic results identifying which families of modes bifurcated, and when modes with finite decay rates exist when approaching the extremal limit. In a recent note (arXiv:1510.05604), Hod suggests that additional modes asymptote to finite decay at extremely high spin parameter, based on past work by Detweiler. We search for these suggested modes and find no evidence of their existence. In addition, we point out an inconsistency in the derivation of the proposed modes, which further indicates that these damped modes do not exist.
