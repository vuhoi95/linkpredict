Title: Remarks on the Convergence Properties of the Conformal Block Expansion
Authors: Slava Rychkov and Pierre Yvernay
Abstract: We show how to refine conformal block expansion convergence estimates from hep-th/1208.6449. In doing so we find a novel explicit formula for the 3d conformal blocks on the real axis.
