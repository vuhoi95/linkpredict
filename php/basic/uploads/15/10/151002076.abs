Title: Black holes sourced by a massless scalar
Authors: Mariano Cadoni and Edgardo Franzin
Abstract: We construct asymptotically flat black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity sourced by a nontrivial scalar field with 1/r asymptotic behaviour. Near the singularity the black hole behaves as the Janis-Newmann-Winicour-Wyman solution. The hairy black hole solutions allow for a consistent thermodynamical description. At large mass they have the same thermodynamical behaviour of the Schwarzschild black hole, whereas for small masses they differ substantially from the latter.
