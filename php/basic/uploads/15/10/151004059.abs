Title: Large field inflation and string moduli stabilization
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Anamaria Font and Michael Fuchs and Daniela Herschmann and Erik Plauschinn
Abstract: Recent developments on large scale string moduli stabilization via non-geometric fluxes are reviewed. In the framework of type IIB orientifolds on fluxed Calabi-Yau manifolds, the existence of so-called flux-scaling minima provides a good starting point for the realization of parametrically controlled models of F-term axion monodromy inflation.
