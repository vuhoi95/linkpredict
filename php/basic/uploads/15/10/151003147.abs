Authors: Konstantin Osetrin and Altair Filippov and Evgeny Osetrin
Abstract: The characteristics of dust matter in space-time models, admitting the existence of privilege coordinate systems are given, where the single-particle Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be integrated by the method of complete separation of variables. The resulting functional form of the 4-velocity field and energy density of matter for all types of spaces under consideration is presented.
