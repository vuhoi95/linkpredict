Abstract: We present a 5D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric IR-UV-IR model with a {\it warped KK-parity} under which the bulk fields have towers of either even or odd KK-modes. We show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric geometry is equivalent to two times the UV-IR geometry (Randall-Sundrum model) provided each bulk field is subject to Neumann (or mixed) and Dirichlet boundary conditions at the UV-brane for even and odd fields, respectively. The 5D Standard Model (SM) bosonic sector is considered, such that in the 4D low-energy effective theory the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even zero-modes correspond to the SM degrees of freedom, whereas the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd zero modes serve as a dark sector. In the zero-mode scalar sector, the even scalar mimics the SM Higgs boson, while the odd scalar (dark-Higgs) is stable and serves as a dark matter candidate. Implications for this dark matter are discussed; it is found that the dark-Higgs can provide only a small fraction of the observed dark matter abundance.
