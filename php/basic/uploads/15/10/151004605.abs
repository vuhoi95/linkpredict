Title: Quasinormal modes of non-Abelian hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black  holes
Authors: Ramón Bécar and P. A. González and Yerko Vásquez
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of scalar field perturbations in the background of non-Abelian hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes. We find that the quasinormal frequencies have no real part so there is no oscillatory behavior in the perturbations, only exponential decay, that is, the system is always overdamped, which guarantees the mode stability of non-Abelian hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes. We determine analytically the quasinormal modes for massless scalar fields for a dynamical exponent $z=2$ and hyperscaling violating exponent $\tilde{\theta}>-2$. Also, we obtain numerically the quasinormal frequencies for different values of the dynamical exponent and the hyperscaling violating exponent by using the improved asymptotic iteration method.
