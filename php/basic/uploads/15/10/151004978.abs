Title: A Monte Carlo exploration of threefold base geometries for 4d F-theory  vacua
Authors: Washington Taylor and Yi-Nan Wang
Abstract: We use Monte Carlo methods to explore the set of toric threefold bases that support elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds for F-theory compactifications to four dimensions, and study the distribution of geometrically non-Higgsable gauge groups, matter, and quiver structure. We estimate the number of distinct threefold bases in the connected set studied to be $\sim { 10^{48}}$. The distribution of bases peaks around $h^{1, 1}\sim 82$. All bases encountered after "thermalization" have some geometric non-Higgsable structure. We find that the number of non-Higgsable gauge group factors grows roughly linearly in $h^{1,1}$ of the threefold base. Typical bases have $\sim 6$ isolated gauge factors as well as several larger connected clusters of gauge factors with jointly charged matter. Approximately 76% of the bases sampled contain connected two-factor gauge group products of the form SU(3)$\times$SU(2), which may act as the non-Abelian part of the standard model gauge group. SU(3)$\times$SU(2) is the third most common connected two-factor product group, following SU(2)$\times$SU(2) and $G_2\times$SU(2), which arise more frequently.
