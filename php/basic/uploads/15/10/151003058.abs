Title: Finsler pp-waves
Authors: Andrea Fuster and Cornelia Pabst
Abstract: In this work we present a Finslerian version of the well-known pp-waves, which generalizes the very special relativity (VSR) line element. Our Finsler pp-waves are an exact solution of Finslerian Einstein's equations in vacuum.
