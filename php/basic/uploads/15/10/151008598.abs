Authors: Hironori Mori and Takeshi Morita and Akinori Tanaka
Abstract: The supercoonformal index on $\mathbb{RP}^{2} \times \mathbb{S}^{1}$ can be derived exactly by the localization technique and applied to the direct proof of Abelian mirror symmetry. We find two sets of parity conditions compatible with the unorientable property of $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ and then rigorously show two kinds of Abelian mirror symmetry via the index on $\mathbb{RP}^{2} \times \mathbb{S}^{1}$.
