Title: On the Hamilton-Jacobi method in classical and quantum nonconservative  systems
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and R. A. C. Correa and P. H. R. S. Moraes
Abstract: In this work we show how to complete some Hamilton-Jacobi solutions of linear, nonconservative classical oscillatory systems which appeared in the literature and we extend these complete solutions to the quantum mechanical case. In addition, we get the solution of the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an electric charge in an oscillating pulsing magnetic field. We also argue that for the case where a charged particle is under the action of an oscillating magnetic field, one can apply nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in order to find experimental results regarding this problem. We obtain all results analytically, showing that the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is a powerful tool to describe quantum mechanics.
