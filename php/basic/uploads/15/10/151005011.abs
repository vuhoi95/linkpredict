Title: Aspects of Defects in 3d-3d Correspondence
Authors: Dongmin Gang and Nakwoo Kim and Mauricio Romo and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: In this paper we study supersymmetric co-dimension 2 and 4 defects in the compactification of the 6d $(2,0)$ theory of type $A_{N-1}$ on a 3-manifold $M$. The so-called 3d-3d correspondence is a relation between complexified Chern-Simons theory (with gauge group $SL(N, \mathbb{C})$) on $M$ and a 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T_{N}[M]$. We establish a dictionary for this correspondence in the presence of supersymmetric defects, which are knots/links inside the 3-manifold. Our study employs a number of different methods: state-integral models for complex Chern-Simons theory, cluster algebra techniques, domain wall theory $T[SU(N)]$, 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM, and also supergravity analysis through holography. These methods are complementary and we find agreement between them. In some cases the results lead to highly non-trivial predictions on the partition function. Our discussion includes a general expression for the cluster partition function, in particular for non-maximal punctures and $N>2$. We also highlight the non-Abelian description of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $T_N[M]$ theory with defect included, as well as its Higgsing prescription and the resulting `refinement' in complex CS theory. This paper is a companion to our shorter paper arXiv:1510.03884, which summarizes our main results.
