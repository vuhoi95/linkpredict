Title: Review on High energy String Scattering Amplitudes and Symmetries of  String Theory
Authors: Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We review high energy symmetries of string theory at both the fixed angle or Gross regime (GR) and the fixed momentum transfer or Regge regime (RR). We calculated in details high energy string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary mass levels for both regimes. We discovered infinite linear relations among fixed angle string amplitudes conjectured by Gross in 1988 from decoupling of high energy zero-norm states (ZNS), and infinite recurrence relations among Regge string amplitudes from Kummer function U and Appell function F. In the GR/RR regime, all high energy string amplitudes can be solved by these linear/recurrence relations so that all GR/RR string amplitudes can be expressed in terms of one single GR/RR string amplitude. In addition, we found an interesting link between string amplitudes of the two regimes, and discovered that at each mass level the ratios among fixed angle amplitudes can be extracted from Regge string scattering amplitudes. This result enables us to argue that the known SL(5,C) dynamical symmetry of the Appell function F is crucial to probe high energy spacetime symmetry of string theory.
