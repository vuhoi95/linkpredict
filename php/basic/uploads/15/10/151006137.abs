Title: Holographic vortices in the presence of dark matter sector
Authors: Marek Rogatko and Karol I. Wysokinski
Abstract: The {\it dark matter} seem to be an inevitable ingredient of the total matter configuration in the Universe and the knowledge how the {\it dark matter} affects the properties of superconductors is of vital importance for the experiments aimed at its direct detection. The homogeneous magnetic field acting perpendicularly to the surface of (2+1) dimensional s-wave holographic superconductor in the theory with {\it dark matter} sector has been modeled by the additional $U(1)$-gauge field representing dark matter and coupled to the Maxwell one. As expected the free energy for the vortex configuration turns out to be negative. Importantly its value is lower in the presence of {\it dark matter} sector. This feature can explain why in the Early Universe first the web of {\it dark matter} appeared and next on these gratings the ordinary matter forming cluster of galaxies has formed.
