Title: The Cosmological Constant as an Eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian constraint  in a Varying Speed of Light theory
Authors: Remo Garattini and Mariafelicia De Laurentis
Abstract: In the framework of a Varying Speed of Light theory, we study the eigenvalues associated with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation representing the vacuum expectation values associated with the cosmological constant. We find that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric is completely equivalent to a Sturm-Liouville problem provided that the related eigenvalue and the cosmological constant be identified. The explicit calculation is performed with the help of a variational procedure with trial wave functionals related to the Bessel function of the second kind $K_{\nu }\left( x\right) $. We find the existence of a family of eigenvalues associated to a negative power of the scale. Furthermore, we show that at the inflationary scale such a family of eigenvalues does not appear.
