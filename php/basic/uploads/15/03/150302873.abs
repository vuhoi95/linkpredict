Title: The Minimal Geometric Deformation Approach Extended
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Jorge Ovalle and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: The minimal geometric deformation approach was introduced in order to study the exterior space-time around spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems, like stars or similar astrophysical objects as well, in the Randall-Sundrum brane-world framework. A consistent extension of this approach is developed here, which contains modifications of both the time component and the radial component of a spherically symmetric metric. A modified Schwarzschild geometry is obtained as an example of its simplest application, and a new solution potentially useful to describe stars in the brane-world is also presented.
