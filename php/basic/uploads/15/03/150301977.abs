Authors: L. Bellantuono and P. Colangelo and F. De Fazio and F. Giannuzzi
Abstract: Using a holographic method, we further investigate the relaxation towards the hydrodynamic regime of a boost-invariant non-Abelian plasma taken out-of-equilibrium. In the dual description, the system is driven out-of-equilibrium by boundary sourcing, a deformation of the boundary metric, as proposed by Chesler and Yaffe. The effects of several deformation profiles on the bulk geometry are investigated by the analysis of the corresponding solutions of the Einstein equations. The time of restoration of the hydrodynamic regime is investigated: setting the effective temperature of the system at the end of the boundary quenching to $T_{eff}(\tau^*)=500$ MeV, the hydrodynamic regime is reached after a lapse of time of ${\cal O}$(1 fm/c).
