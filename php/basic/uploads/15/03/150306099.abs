Title: QED trace anomaly, non-local Lagrangians and quantum Equivalence  Principle violations
Authors: John F. Donoghue and Basem Kamal El-Menoufi
Abstract: We discuss the derivation of the trace anomaly using a non-local effective action at one loop. This provides a simple and instructive form and emphasizes infrared physics. We then use this example to explore several of the properties of non-local actions, including displaying the action for the full non-local energy-momentum tensor. As an application, we show that the long-distance corrections at one loop lead to quantum violations of some classical consequences of the equivalence principle, for example producing a frequency dependence of the gravitational bending of light.
