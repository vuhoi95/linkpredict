Title: 10D to 4D Euclidean Supergravity over a Calabi-Yau three-fold
Authors: Wafic Sabra and Owen Vaughan
Abstract: We dimensionally reduce the bosonic sector of 10D Euclidean type IIA supergravity over a Calabi-Yau three-fold. The resulting theory describes the bosonic sector of 4D, N = 2 Euclidean supergravity coupled to vector- and hyper-multiplets. We show that the scalar target manifold of the vector-multiplets is projective special para-Kahler, and is therefore of split signature, whereas the target manifold of the hyper-multiplets is (positive-definite) quaternionic Kahler.
