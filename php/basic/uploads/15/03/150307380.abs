Title: Heat-kernel approach for scattering
Authors: Wen-Du Li and Wu-Sheng Dai
Abstract: An approach for solving scattering problems, based on two quantum field theory methods, the heat kernel method and the scattering spectral method, is constructed. This approach converts a method of calculating heat kernels into a method of solving scattering problems. This allows us to establish a method of scattering problems from a method of heat kernels. As an application, we construct an approach for solving scattering problems based on the covariant perturbation theory of heat-kernel expansions. In order to apply the heat-kernel method to scattering problems, we first calculate the off-diagonal heat-kernel expansion in the frame of the covariant perturbation theory. Moreover, as an alternative application of the relation between heat kernels and partial-wave phase shifts presented in this paper, we give an example of how to calculate a global heat kernel from a known scattering phase shift.
