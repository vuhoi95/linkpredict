Title: Low-energy Supersymmetry Breaking Without the Gravitino Problem
Authors: Anson Hook and Hitoshi Murayama
Abstract: In models of low-energy gauge mediation, the observed Higgs mass is in tension with the cosmological limit on the gravitino mass $m_{3/2} \lesssim 16$ eV. We present an alternative mediation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking via a $U(1)$ $D$-term with an $E_6$-inspired particle content, which we call "vector mediation". The gravitino mass can be in the eV range. The sfermion masses are at the 10 TeV scale, while gauginos around a TeV. This mechanism also greatly ameliorates the $\mu$-problem.
