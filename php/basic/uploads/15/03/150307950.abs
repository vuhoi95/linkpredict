Title: On Coupling NEC-Violating Matter to Gravity
Authors: Saugata Chatterjee and Maulik Parikh and Jan Pieter van der Schaar
Abstract: We show that effective theories of matter that classically violate the null energy condition cannot be minimally coupled to Einstein gravity without being inconsistent with both string theory and black hole thermodynamics. We argue however that they could still be either non-minimally coupled or coupled to higher-curvature theories of gravity.
