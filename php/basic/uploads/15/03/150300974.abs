Title: Static pure Lovelock black hole solutions with horizon topology ${\bf  S^{(n)} \times S^{(n)}}$
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Josep M. Pons
Abstract: It is well known that vacuum equation of arbitrary Lovelock order for static spacetime ultimately reduces to a single algebraic equation, we show that the same continues to hold true for pure Lovelock gravity of arbitrary order $N$ for topology ${\bf S^{(n)} \times S^{(n)}}$. We thus obtain pure Lovelock static black hole solutions with two-sphere topology for any order $N$, and in particular we study in full detail the third and fourth order Lovelock black holes. It is remarkable that thermodynamical stability of black hole discerns between odd and even $N$, and consequently between negative and positive $\Lambda$ and it favours the former while rejecting the latter.
