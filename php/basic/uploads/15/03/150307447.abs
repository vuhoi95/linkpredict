Title: Spiky strings in $\varkappa$-deformed $AdS$
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Soumya Bhattacharya and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study rigidly rotating strings in $\varkappa$-deformed $AdS$ background. We probe this classically integrable background with `spiky' strings and analyze the string profiles in the large charge limit systematically. We also discuss the dispersion relation among the conserved charges for these solutions in long string limit.
