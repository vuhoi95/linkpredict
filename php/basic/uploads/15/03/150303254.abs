Title: Lifshitz Hydrodynamics And New Massive Gravity
Authors: Arpan Bhattacharyya and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: In this paper, using the techniques of Gauge/gravity duality we explore the hydrodynamic regime of $ z=3 $ Lifshitz fixed points in $ 1+1 $ dimensions. The speed of sound in the non relativistic plasma turns out to be $\sqrt{3}$, which clearly violates the conjectured upper bound. We identify this as a natural consequence of the Lorentz symmetry breakdown at $ z=3 $ Lifshitz fixed point. Finally, the non perturbative correction appearing from the higher derivative sector of the New Massive Gravity seems to preserve the conjectured lower bound for the bulk viscosity to entropy ratio. We also propose some practical set up to test these results.
