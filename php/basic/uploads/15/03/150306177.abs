Abstract: Recently Grinstein, Jora, and Polosa have studied a theory of large-$N$ scalar quantum chromodynamics in one-space one-time dimension. This theory admits a Bethe-Salpeter equation describing the discrete spectrum of quark-antiquark bound states. They consider gauge fields in the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and scalar fields in the fundamental representation. The theory is asymptotically free and linearly confining. The theory could possibly provide a good field theoretic framework for the description of a large class of diquark-antidiquark (tetra-quark) states. Recently we have studied the light-front quantization of this theory without a Higgs potential. In the present work, we study the light-front Hamiltonian, path integral and BRST formulations of the theory in the presence of a Higgs potential. The light-front theory is seen to be gauge-invariant, possessing a set of first-class constraints. The explicit occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the theory is shown in unitary gauge as well as in the light-front 't Hooft gauge.
