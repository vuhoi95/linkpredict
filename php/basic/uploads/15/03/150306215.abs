Title: Superalgebras, constraints and partition functions
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Jakob Palmkvist
Abstract: We consider Borcherds superalgebras obtained from semisimple finite-dimensional Lie algebras by adding an odd null root to the simple roots. The additional Serre relations can be expressed in a covariant way. The spectrum of generators at positive levels are associated to partition functions for a certain set of constrained bosonic variables, the constraints on which are complementary to the Serre relations in the symmetric product. We give some examples, focusing on superalgebras related to pure spinors, exceptional geometry and tensor hierarchies, of how construction of the content of the algebra at arbitrary levels is simplified.
