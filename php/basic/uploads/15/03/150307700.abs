Title: Holographic Thermalization in Charged Dilaton Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Shao-Jun Zhang and E. Abdalla
Abstract: We study holographic thermalization in spacetimes with a chemical potential and a non-trivial dilaton field. Three non-local observables are used to probe the whole process and investigate the effect of the ratio of the chemical potential over temperature $\chi$ and the dilaton-Maxwell coupling constant $\alpha$. It is found that the saturation time is not always a monotonically increasing function of $\chi$, the situation depends on $\alpha$. When $0 \leq\alpha \leq 1$, larger $\chi$ yields longer saturation time, while for $\alpha>1$, the situation becomes more complex. More interesting, we found that although $\alpha$ indeed has influence on the whole thermalization process, it nearly does not affect the saturation time, which indicates the universality of the saturation time for the dual one-parameter field theories.
