Abstract: In earlier works, it was seen that a ${\mathbb Z}/2$ orbifold of the theory of 24 free two-dimensional chiral fermions admits various sporadic finite simple groups as global symmetry groups when viewed as an ${\cal N}=1$, ${\cal N}=2$, or ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theory. In this note, we show that viewing the same theory as an SCFT with extended ${\cal N}=1$ symmetry -- where the extension is the same one which arises in string compactification on manifolds of exceptional Spin$(7)$ holonomy -- yields theories which have global symmetry given by the sporadic groups $M_{24}, Co_2$ or $Co_3$. The partition functions twined by these symmetries, when decomposed into characters of the Spin(7) algebra, give rise to two-component vector-valued mock modular forms encoding an infinite-dimensional module for the corresponding sporadic groups.
