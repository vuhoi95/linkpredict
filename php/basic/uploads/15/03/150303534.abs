Title: Cosmological Particle Decays at Finite Temperature
Authors: Chiu Man Ho and Robert J. Scherrer
Abstract: We calculate finite-temperature corrections to the decay rate of a generic neutral (pseudo)scalar particle that decays into (pseudo)scalars or fermion-antifermion pairs. The ratio of the finite-temperature decay rate to the zero-temperature decay rate is presented. Thermal effects are largest in the limit where the decaying particle is nonrelativistic but with a mass well below the background temperature, but significant effects are possible even when we relax the former assumption. Thermal effects are reduced for the case of nonzero momentum of the decaying particle. We discuss cosmological scenarios under which significant finite-temperature corrections to the decay rate can be achieved.
