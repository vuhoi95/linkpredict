Title: Key to Physics beyond the Standard Model: Modification of the QFTs so as  to make their diagrams convergent
Authors: Marijan Ribarič and Luka Šušteršič
Abstract: Motivation: We think that the physics about microscopic, small distance phenomena that underlie quantum scattering is the keystone of Physics beyond the Standard Model; and it may provide solutions to the ultraviolet divergences, the crucial QFT fault that is presently professionally declared as remedied by renormalization. Results: a) Testable theory, Regularization by replacing QFT partial differential equations with the Boltzmann integro-differential equations. b) Novel, possibly nonlinear and infinitesimal-range, fundamental forces. c) Regularization parameters are hypothetical physical constants. d) A potential framework for explaining hierarchy problems. e) Medium of the Universe with faster than light effects. Application: Usage of the present high energy facilities for gathering quantitative information about the underlying physics of QFTs by the experimental values of regularization parameters . Keywords: Standard Model; Boltzmann equation PACS numbers: 2.30.Jr, 11.10.Gh, 11.90.+t, 95.35.+d, 51.10.+
