Title: Classical Tests of General Relativity: Brane-World Sun from Minimal  Geometric Deformation
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Jorge Ovalle and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: We consider a solution of the effective four-dimensional brane-world equations, obtained from the General Relativistic Schwarzschild metric via the principle of Minimal Geometric Deformation, and investigate the corresponding signatures stemming from the possible existence of a warped extra dimension. In particular, we derive bounds on an extra-dimensional parameter, closely related with the fundamental gravitational length, from the experimental results of the classical tests of General Relativity in the Solar system.
