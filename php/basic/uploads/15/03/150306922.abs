Title: General solution of cyclic Leibniz rule
Authors: Daisuke Kadoh and Naoya Ukita
Abstract: We study the general solution of the cyclic Leibniz rule (CLR) which was recently proposed as a new approach to the lattice supersymmetry. Introducing some mathematical preliminaries related to the cyclic symmetry, we find the general solution of the 2-body CLR for the naive symmetric difference operator. The main theorems of this paper state that the general solution can be uniquely expressed as (A) a linear combination of the two fundamental solutions with cyclic invariant coefficients, and (B) a linear combination of the minimal solutions with complex coefficients. Moreover, an extension to the general difference operators is also discussed.
