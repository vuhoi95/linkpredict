Title: Infinitesimal moduli for the Strominger system and Killing spinors in  generalized geometry
Authors: Mario Garcia-Fernandez and Roberto Rubio and Carl Tipler
Abstract: We construct the space of infinitesimal variations for the Strominger system and an obstruction space to integrability, using elliptic operator theory. We initiate the study of the geometry of the moduli space, describing the infinitesimal structure of a natural foliation on this space. The associated leaves are related to generalized geometry and correspond to moduli spaces of solutions of suitable Killing spinor equations on a Courant algebroid. As an application, we propose a unifying framework for metrics with holonomy $\SU(3)$ and solutions of the Strominger system.
