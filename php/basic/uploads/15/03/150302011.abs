Title: Conformal symmetry of the critical 3D Ising model inside a sphere
Authors: Catarina Cosme and J. M. Viana Parente Lopes and Joao Penedones
Abstract: We perform Monte-Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model at the critical temperature and zero magnetic field. We simulate the system in a ball with free boundary conditions on the two dimensional spherical boundary. Our results for one and two point functions in this geometry are consistent with the predictions from the conjectured conformal symmetry of the critical Ising model.
