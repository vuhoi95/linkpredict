Title: Equivalence between two different field-dependent BRST formulations
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: Finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformations were constructed by integrating infinitesimal BRST transformation in a closed form. Such a generalized transformations have been extended in various branch of physics and found many applications. Recently BRST transformation has also been generalized with same goal and motivation in slightly different manner. In this work we have shown that the later formulation is conceptually equivalent to the earlier formulation. We justify our claim by producing the same result of later formulation using earlier FFBRST formulation.
