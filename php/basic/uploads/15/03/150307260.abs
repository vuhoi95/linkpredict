Title: Gluon Transport Equation with Effective Mass and Dynamical Onset of  Bose-Einstein Condensation
Authors: Jean-Paul Blaizot and Yin Jiang and Jinfeng Liao
Abstract: We study the transport equation describing a dense system of gluons, in the small scattering angle approximation, taking into account medium-generated effective masses of the gluons. We focus on the case of overpopulated systems that are driven to Bose-Einstein condensation on their way to thermalization. The presence of a mass modifies the dispersion relation of the gluon, as compared to the massless case, but it is shown that this does not change qualitatively the scaling behavior in the vicinity of the onset.
