Title: Gluon Transport Equations with Condensate in the Small Angle  Approximation
Authors: Jean-Paul Blaizot and Jinfeng Liao
Abstract: We derive the set of kinetic equations that control the evolution of gluons in the presence of a condensate. We show that the dominant singularities remain logarithmic when the scattering involves particles in the condensate. This allows us to define a consistent small angle approximation.
