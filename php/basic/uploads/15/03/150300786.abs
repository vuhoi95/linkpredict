Title: The Solution of the Relativistic Schrodinger Equation for the  $Î´'$-Function Potential in 1-dimension Using Cutoff Regularization
Authors: M. H. Al-Hashimi and A. M. Shalaby
Abstract: We study the relativistic version of Schr\"odinger equation for a point particle in 1-d with potential of the first derivative of the delta function. The momentum cutoff regularization is used to study the bound state and scattering states. The initial calculations show that the reciprocal of the bare coupling constant is ultra-violet divergent, and the resultant expression cannot be renormalized in the usual sense. Therefore a general procedure has been developed to derive different physical properties of the system. The procedure is used first on the non-relativistic case for the purpose of clarification and comparisons. The results from the relativistic case show that this system behaves exactly like the delta function potential, which means it also shares the same features with quantum field theories, like being asymptotically free, and in the massless limit, it undergoes dimensional transmutation and it possesses an infrared conformal fixed point.
