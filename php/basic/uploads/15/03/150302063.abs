Title: Stability of disformally coupled accretion disks
Authors: Tomi Koivisto and Hannu J. Nyrhinen
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories, presence of matter in the vicinity of black holes can lead to the so called "spontaneous scalarisation" instability that can trigger the development of scalar hair. In the Brans-Dicke type theories, this effect can be understood as a result of tachyonic effective mass of the scalar field, induced by the purely conformal coupling to matter. Here this instability, in matter configurations around both Schwarzschild and rotating black holes, is explored in more general scalar-tensor theories featuring non-conformal, i.e. "disformal", couplings to matter. It is found that on one hand the disformal coupling can add to scalarisation by making the configuration more unstable. On the other hand, especially large enough disformal part of the coupling tends quite generically to stabilise the system.
