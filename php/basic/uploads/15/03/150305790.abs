Title: Unruh effect and condensate in and out of an accelerated vacuum
Authors: Sanjin Benic and Kenji Fukushima
Abstract: We revisit the Unruh effect to investigate how finite acceleration would affect a scalar condensate. We discuss a negative thermal-like correction associated with acceleration. From the correspondence between thermo-field dynamics and acceleration effects we give an explanation for this negative sign. Using this result and solving the gap equation we show that the condensate should increase with larger acceleration.
