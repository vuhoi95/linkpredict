Title: Confinement and $Î±_s$ in a strong magnetic field
Authors: Yu. A. Simonov and M. A. Trusov
Abstract: Hadron decay widths are shown to increase in strong magnetic fields as $\Gamma (eB) \sim \frac{eB}{\kappa} \Gamma(0)$. The same mechanism is shown to be present in the production of the sea quark pair inside the confining string, which decreases the string tension with the growing $eB$ parallel to the string . On the other hand, the average energy of the $q\bar q$ holes in the string world sheet increases, when the direction of $\mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to the sheet. These two effects stipulate the spectacular picture of the $\mathbf{B}$ dependent confinement and $\alpha_s$, discovered on the lattice.
