Title: Stabilising the Planck mass shortly after inflation
Authors: Carsten van de Bruck and Adam J. Christopherson and Mathew Robinson
Abstract: We consider a model of the early universe which consists of two scalar fields: the inflaton, and a second field which drives the stabilisation of the Planck mass (or gravitational constant). We show that the non-minimal coupling of this second field to the Ricci scalar sources a non-adiabatic pressure perturbation. By performing a fully numerical calculation we find, in turn, that this boosts the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum after inflation.
