Title: Light Quarks in the Screened Dyon-Anti-Dyon Coulomb Liquid Model II
Authors: Yizhuang Liu and Edward Shuryak and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the dyon-anti-dyon liquid model that includes light quarks in the dense center symmetric Coulomb phase. In this work, like in our previous one, we use the simplest color SU(2) group. We start with a single fermion flavor $N_f=1$ and explicitly map the theory onto a 3-dimensional quantum effective theory with a fermion that is only U$_V(1)$ symmetric. We use it to show that the dense center symmetric plasma develops, in the mean field approximation, a nonzero chiral condensate, although the ensuing Goldstone mode is massive due to the U$_A(1)$ axial-anomaly. We estimate the chiral condensate and $\sigma,\eta$ meson masses for $N_f=1$. We then extend our analysis to several flavors $N_f>1$ and colors $N_c>2$ and show that center symmetry and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking disappear simultaneously when $x=N_f/N_c\geq 2$ in the dense plasma phase. A reorganization of the dense plasma phase into a gas of dyon-antidyon molecules restores chiral symmetry, but may preserve center symmetry in the linearized approximation. We estimate the corresponding critical temperature.
