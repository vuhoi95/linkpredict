Title: Fusion for the one-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Niklas Beisert and Marius de Leeuw and Panchali Nag
Abstract: We discuss a formulation of the fusion procedure for integrable models which is suitable for application to non-standard R-matrices. It allows for construction of bound state R-matrices for AdS/CFT worldsheet scattering or equivalently for the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We also discuss some peculiar cases that arise in these models.
