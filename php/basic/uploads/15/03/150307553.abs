Title: Minimal Surfaces of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ Superstring and the Symmetries  of Super Wilson Loops at Strong Coupling
Authors: Hagen Munkler and Jonas Pollok
Abstract: Based on an extension of the holographic principle to superspace, we provide a strong-coupling description of smooth super Wilson loops in terms of minimal surfaces of the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ superstring. We employ the classical integrability of the Green-Schwarz superstring on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ to derive the superconformal and Yangian $Y[\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)]$ Ward identities for the super Wilson loop, thus extending the strong coupling results obtained for the Maldacena-Wilson loop. In the course of the derivation, we determine the minimal surface solution up to third order in an expansion close to the conformal boundary.
