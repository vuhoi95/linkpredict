Title: Mirror Symmetry, D-brane Superpotential and Ooguri-Vafa Invariants of  Compact Calabi-Yau Manifolds
Authors: Shan-Shan Zhang and Fu-Zhong Yang
Abstract: The D-brane superpotential is very important in the low energy effective theory. As the generating function of all disk instantons from the worldsheet point of view, it plays a crucial role in deriving some important properties of the compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. By using the GKZ-generalized hypergeometric system, we will calculate the B-brane superpotentials of two non-fermat type compact Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties,respectively. Then according to the mirror symmetry, we obtain the A-model superpotentials and the Ooguri-Vafa invariants for the mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds.
