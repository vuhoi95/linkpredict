Title: Inflection point inflation and dark energy in supergravity
Authors: Tie-Jun Gao and Zong-Kuan Guo
Abstract: We consider an inflection point inflationary model in supergravity with a single chiral superfield and show that the predicted values of the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are consistent with the Planck 2015 results. In this model supersymmetry is strongly broken after inflation, which results in a non-SUSY de-Sitter vacuum responsible for the recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.
