Title: The microscopic structure of 2D CDT coupled to matter
Authors: J. Ambjorn and A. Goerlich and J. Jurkiewicz and H. Zhang
Abstract: We show that for 1+1 dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) coupled to 4 massive scalar fields one can construct an effective transfer matrix if the masses squared is larger than or equal to 0.05. The properties of this transfer matrix can explain why CDT coupled to matter can behave completely different from "pure" CDT. We identify the important critical exponent in the effective action, which may determine the universality class of the model.
