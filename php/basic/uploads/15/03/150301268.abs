Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of spherically symmetric black hole solutions in a four-dimensional Einstein--Yang-Mills-SU(2) theory with a negative cosmological constant. Special attention is paid to configurations with a unit magnetic charge. We find that a set of Reissner-Nordstr\"om--Anti-de Sitter black holes can become unstable to forming non-Abelian hair. However, the hairy black holes are never thermodynamically favoured over the full set of abelian monopole solutions. The thermodynamics of the generic configurations possessing a noninteger magnetic charge is also discussed.
