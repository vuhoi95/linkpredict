Title: Quantum radiation reaction in laser-electron beam collisions
Authors: T. G. Blackburn and C. P. Ridgers and J. G. Kirk and A. R. Bell
Abstract: It is possible using current high intensity laser facilities to reach the quantum radiation reaction regime for energetic electrons. An experiment using a wakefield accelerator to drive GeV electrons into a counterpropagating laser pulse would demonstrate the increase in the yield of high energy photons caused by the stochastic nature of quantum synchrotron emission: we show that a beam of $10^9$ 1 GeV electrons colliding with a 30 fs laser pulse of intensity $10^{22}~\text{Wcm}^{-2}$ will emit 6300 photons with energy greater than 700 MeV, $60\times$ the number predicted by classical theory.
