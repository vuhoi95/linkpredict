Title: 't Hooft-Polyakov Monopoles with Non-Abelian Moduli
Authors: Mikhail Shifman and Gianni Tallarita and Alexei Yung
Abstract: We extend the Georgi-Glashow model of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopoles to include additional collective coordinates "orientational isospin moduli". The low-energy theory of these solitonic solutions can be interpreted as dyons with isospin.
