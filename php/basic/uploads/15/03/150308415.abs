Title: Highly relativistic spin-gravity coupling for fermions
Authors: Roman Plyatsko and Mykola Fenyk
Abstract: Descriptions of highly relativistic fermions in a gravitational field in the classical (nonquantum) and quantum approaches are discussed. The results following from the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations for a fast spinning particle in Schwarzschild's and Kerr's background are considered. Numerical estimates for electron, proton and neutrino in the gravitational field of black holes are presented.The general relativistic Dirac equation is analyzed from the point of view it is using for the adequate description of highly relativistic fermions in a gravitational field, in the linear and nonlinear spin approximation. It is necessary to have some corrected Dirac equation for a highly relativistic fermion with strong spin-gravity coupling.
