Title: A New Look At Gravitational Coupling Constant And The Dark Energy  Problem
Authors: O. F. Akinto and Farida Tahir
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the solution to the dark energy problem is connected to the cutoff Ultraviolet scale manifesting itself as linearly independent infrared sectors of the effective theory of gravity interacting with QCD fields. We work in the combined frameworks of finite temperature-density corrections and effective quantum field theory (as low energy quantum gravity). We strongly suggest that the failure to reproduce the exact observed value of dark energy from the framework of Veneziano ghost theory of QCD is intimately linked to the unverifiable ad hoc assumption that conditions the gravitational coupling constant to be unity C Gravity is equal to 0ne. A close perusal of the Minkowski vacuum structure reveals that C Gravity is not equal to one. We compute the value of C Gravity from the Bose-Einstein distribution function. With this value of C Gravity coupled with the value of vacuum energy estimated from the Veneziano ghost theory of QCD, we reproduce the observed value of row lambda to be row lambda congruent to C Gravity. An important prediction of these combined frameworks (made manifest by the application of standard box-quantization procedure to the UV scale Max Planck states that there are to ten raise to power one hundred and twenty two linearly independent "subuniverses" representing the linearly independent infrared sectors of the effective theory of gravity interacting with QCD fields. A direct consequence of this is that our subuniverse is embedded on a non-trivial manifold M such as a torus group T raise to power ten raise to power one hundred and twenty two with different linear sizes.
