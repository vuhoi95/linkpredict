Title: 2D Kac-Moody Symmetry of 4D Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Temple He and Prahar Mitra and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes of any four-dimensional theory with nonabelian gauge group $\mathcal G$ may be recast as two-dimensional correlation functions on the asymptotic two-sphere at null infinity. The soft gluon theorem is shown, for massless theories at the semiclassical level, to be the Ward identity of a holomorphic two-dimensional $\mathcal G$-Kac-Moody symmetry acting on these correlation functions. Holomorphic Kac-Moody current insertions are positive helicity soft gluon insertions. The Kac-Moody transformations are a $CPT$ invariant subgroup of gauge transformations which act nontrivially at null infinity and comprise the four-dimensional asymptotic symmetry group.
