Title: A Note on Ghost-Free Matter Couplings in Massive Gravity and  Multi-Gravity
Authors: Kurt Hinterbichler and Rachel A. Rosen
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed non-minimal matter coupling in massive gravity and multi-gravity. We argue that, when formulated in terms of unconstrained vielbeins, this matter coupling contains the primary constraints necessary to remove the Boulware-Deser ghost to all orders away from the decoupling limit.
