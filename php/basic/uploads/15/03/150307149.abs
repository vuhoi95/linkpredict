Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the lowest nonhydrodynamic modes in a class of holographic models which exhibit an equation of state closely mimicking the one determined from lattice QCD. We calculate the lowest quasinormal mode frequencies for a range of scalar self-interaction potentials and find that the damping of the quasinormal modes at the phase transition/crossover falls off by a factor of around two from conformality after factoring out standard conformal temperature dependence. The damping encoded in the imaginary part of the frequencies turns out to be correlated with the speed of sound and is basically independent of the UV details of the model. We also find that the dynamics of the nonhydrodynamic degrees of freedom remains ultralocal, even to a higher degree, as we deviate from conformality. These results indicate that the role of nonhydrodynamic degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the crossover transition may be enhanced.
