Authors: Cuauhtemoc Campuzano and Ruben Cordero and Miguel Cruz and Efrain Rojas
Abstract: We show how the flat spacetime Galileon field theories (FSGFT) in arbitrary dimensions can be obtained through a Born-Infeld type structure. This construction involves a brane metric and non-linear combinations of derivatives of a scalar field. Our setup gives rise to some Galileon tensors and vectors useful for the variational analysis which are related to the momentum density of the probe Lovelock branes floating in a $N$-dimensional flat bulk. We find further that the Noether currents associated to these Galileon theories may be written in terms of such tensors.
