Title: The dynamics of universe for exponential decaying dark energy
Authors: Nilay Bostan and Ekrem Aydiner
Abstract: In this study we consider an exponential decaying form for dark energy as EoS parameter in order to discuss the dynamics of the universe. Firstly, assuming that universe is filled with an ideal fluid which consists of exponential decaying dark energy we obtain time dependent behavior of several physical quantities such as energy density, pressure and others for dark energy, dark energy-matter coupling and non-coupling cases. Secondly, using scalar field instead of an ideal fluid we obtain these physical quantities in terms of scalar potential and kinetic term for the same cases in scalar-tensor formalism. Finally we show that ideal fluid and scalar-tensor description of dark energy give mathematically equivalent results for this EoS parameter.
