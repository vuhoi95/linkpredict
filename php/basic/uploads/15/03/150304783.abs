Title: Fencing in the Swampland: Quantum Gravity Constraints on Large Field  Inflation
Authors: Jon Brown and William Cottrell and Gary Shiu and Pablo Soler
Abstract: In this note we show that models of natural inflation based on closed string axions are incompatible with the weak gravity conjecture (WGC). Specifically, we use T-duality in order to map the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio of particles imposed by the WGC, to constraints on the ratio between instanton actions and axion decay constants. We use this connection to prove that if the WGC holds, even when multiple axions are present and mix with each other, one cannot have large axion decay constants while remaining in a regime of perturbative control. We also discuss the extension of the WGC to discrete symmetries and its possible impact on models with axion monodromy, and the distinction between the strong and mild versions of the WGC. Finally, we offer some speculations regarding the import of these results to the general theory of inflation.
