Title: Quantum cosmology of the multi-field scalar matter: some exact solutions
Authors: Alexander A. Andrianov and Oleg O. Novikov and Chen Lan
Abstract: We consider the gravity interacting with matter scalar fields and quantized in the minisuperspace approach in which the wave functional is described by the Wheeler-DeWitt equations (WdW). Assuming the domination of the homogeneous and isotropic geometry the leading contributions to the wave functional in the approximation of the minisuperspace with Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric (FRW) and spatially uniform scalar fields are considered. The model of several scalar fields with exponential potentials and kinetic terms admitting such a special mixing that ultimately it is possible to separate the variables in the WdW equation and to find its exact solution in terms of the special functions is proposed. The semiclassical approximation is thoroughly investigated and the boundary conditions permitting the physical solution selection for classical cosmologies are chosen.
