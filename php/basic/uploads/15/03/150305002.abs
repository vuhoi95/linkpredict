Title: Mott multicriticality of Dirac electrons in graphene
Authors: Laura Classen and Igor F. Herbut and Lukas Janssen and Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: We study the multicritical behavior for the semimetal-insulator transitions on graphene's honeycomb lattice using the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa effective theory with two order parameters: the SO(3) (Heisenberg) order parameter describes the antiferromagnetic transition, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (Ising) order parameter describes the transition to a staggered density state. Their coupling induces multicritical behavior which determines the structure of the phase diagram close to the multicritical point. Depending on the number of fermion flavors $N_f$ and working in the perturbative regime in vicinity of three (spatial) dimensions, we observe first order or continuous phase transitions at the multicritical point. For the graphene case of $N_f=2$ and within our low order approximation, the phase diagram displays a tetracritical structure.
