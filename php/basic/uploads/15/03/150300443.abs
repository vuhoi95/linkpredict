Title: Toric data and Killing forms on homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein manifold  $T^{1,1}$
Authors: Vladimir Slesar and Mihai Visinescu and Gabriel Eduard Vilcu
Abstract: Throughout this paper we investigate the complex structure of the conifold $C(T^{1,1})$ basically making use of the interplay between symplectic and complex approaches of the K\"{a}hler toric manifolds. The description of the Calabi-Yau manifold $C(T^{1,1})$ using toric data allows us to write explicitly the complex coordinates and apply standard methods for extracting special Killing forms on the base manifold. As an outcome, we obtain the complete set of special Killing forms on the five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space $T^{1,1}$.
