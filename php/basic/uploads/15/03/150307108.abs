Title: Analog Sauter-Schwinger effect in semiconductors
Authors: Malte F. Linder and Ralf Sch√ºtzhold
Abstract: Particle creation in quantum electrodynamics is closely related to the existence of two separated energy continua in the semiclassical one-electron picture (Dirac-sea picture). In ground-state semiconductors or other band insulators exposed to an external electric field, the physical situation is analogous if only electrons in the valence and the conduction band are considered. For example, the analogy between the Sauter-Schwinger effect (nonperturbative electron-positron vacuum pair production) and the dielectric breakdown of an insulator via Landau-Zener tunneling in static fields is well known. In this paper, we show analytically that electrons in a two-band semiconductor in 1+1 dimensions will still obey a quantitative analog of the Dirac theory if the external electric field $E(t,x)$ varies in time and also slowly in space. Semiconductor analogs could thus be used to study pair creation mechanisms in nonstatic fields like, e.g., the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect.
