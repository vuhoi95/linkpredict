Title: Maxwell-affine gauge theory of gravity
Authors: O. Cebecioğlu and S. Kibaroğlu
Abstract: Maxwell extension of affine algebra with additional tensorial generators is given. Using the methods of nonlinear realizations, we found the transformation rules for group parameters and corresponding generators. Gauging the Maxwell-affine algebra we presented two possible invariant actions for gravity: one is the first order and the other one is the second order in affine curvature. We noticed that equations of motion for the action, second order in affine curvature, lead to the generalized Bianchi identities on the choice of appropriate coefficients for a particular solution of the constraint equation.
