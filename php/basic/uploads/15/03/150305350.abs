Title: (M-theory-)Killing spinors on symmetric spaces
Authors: Noel Hustler and Andree Lischewski
Abstract: We show how the theory of invariant principal bundle connections for reductive homogeneous spaces can be applied to determine the holonomy of generalised Killing spinor covariant derivatives of the form $D= \nabla + \Omega$ in a purely algebraic and algorithmic way, where $\Omega : TM \rightarrow \Lambda^*(TM)$ is a left-invariant homomorphism. Specialising this to the case of symmetric M-theory backgrounds (i.e. $(M,g,F)$ with $(M,g)$ a symmetric space and $F$ an invariant closed 4-form), we derive several criteria for such a background to preserve some supersymmetry and consequently find all supersymmetric symmetric M-theory backgrounds.
