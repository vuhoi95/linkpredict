Title: Hojman Symmetry Approach for Scalar-Tensor Cosmology
Authors: Mariacristina Paolella and Salvatore Capozziello
Abstract: Scalar-tensor Cosmologies can be dealt under the standard of the Hojman conservation theorem that allows to fix the form of the coupling $F(\phi)$, of the potential $V(\phi)$ and to find out exact solutions for related cosmological models. Specifically, the existence of a symmetry transformation vector for the equations of motion gives rise to a Hojman conserved quantity on the corresponding minisuperpace and exact solutions for the cosmic scale factor $a$ and the scalar field $\phi$ can be achieved. In particular, we take advantage of the fact that minimally coupled solutions, previously obtained in the Einstein frame, can be conformally transformed in non-minimally coupled solutions in the Jordan frame. Some physically relevant examples are worked out.
