Title: Raising and Lowering operators of spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics
Authors: Abhay G. Shah and Bernard F. Whiting
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the spin-raising and lowering operators of spin-weighted spherical harmonics to linear-in-$\gamma$ spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics where $\gamma$ is an additional parameter present in the second order ordinary differential equation governing these harmonics. One can then generalize these operators to higher powers in $\gamma$. Constructing these operators required calculating the $\ell$-, $s$- and $m$-raising and lowering operators (and various combinations of them) of spin-weighted spherical harmonics which have been calculated and shown explicitly in this paper.
