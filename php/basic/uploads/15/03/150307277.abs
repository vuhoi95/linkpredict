Title: Little strings and T-duality
Authors: Jungmin Kim and Seok Kim and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We study the 2d N = 4 gauge theory descriptions of little strings on type II NS5- branes. The IIB strings on N NS5-branes are described by the N = (4,4) gauge theories, whose Higgs branch CFTs on U(N) instanton moduli spaces are relevant. The IIA strings are described by N = (4,4) circular A_{N-1} quiver theories, whose Coulomb branch CFTs are relevant. We study new N = (0,4) quiver gauge theories for the IIA strings, which make it easier to study some infrared observables. In particular, we show that the elliptic genera of the IIA / IIB strings precisely map to each other by T-duality.
