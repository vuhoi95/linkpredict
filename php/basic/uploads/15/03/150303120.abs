Abstract: We investigate the dimension two condensate $< {\bar \phi}^{ab}_i \phi^{ab}_i -{\bar \omega}^{ab}_i \omega^{ab}_i >$ within the Gribov-Zwanziger approach to Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in the Coulomb gauge, in both 3 and 4 dimensions. An explicit calculation shows that, at the first order, the condensate $< {\bar \phi}^{ab}_i \phi^{ab}_i -{\bar \omega}^{ab}_i \omega^{ab}_i >$ is plagued by a non-integrable IR divergence in 3D, while in 4D it exhibits a logarithmic UV divergence, being proportional to the Gribov parameter $\gamma^2$. These results indicate that in 3D the transverse spatial Coulomb gluon two-point correlation function exhibits a scaling behaviour, in agreement with Gribov's expression. In 4D, however, they suggest that, next to the scaling behaviour, a decoupling solution might emerge too.
