Title: Thermal equilibrium states for quantum fields on non-commutative  spacetimes
Authors: Gandalf Lechner and Jan Schlemmer
Abstract: Fully Poincar\'e covariant quantum field theories on non-commutative Moyal Minkowski spacetime so far have been considered in their vacuum representations, i.e. at zero temperature. Here we report on work in progress regarding their thermal representations, corresponding to physical states at non-zero temperature, which turn out to be markedly different from both, thermal representations of quantum field theory on commutative Minkowski spacetime, and such representations of non-covariant quantum field theory on Moyal Minkowski space with a fixed deformation matrix.
