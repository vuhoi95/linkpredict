Title: Confining Dyon-Anti-Dyon Coulomb Liquid Model I
Authors: Yizhuang Liu and Edward Shuryak and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We revisit the dyon-anti-dyon liquid model for the Yang-Mills confining vacuum discussed by Diakonov and Petrov, by retaining the effects of the classical interactions mediated by the streamline between the dyons and anti-dyons. In the SU(2) case the model describes a 4-component strongly interacting Coulomb liquid in the center symmetric phase. We show that in the linearized screening approximation the streamline interactions yield Debye-Huckel type corrections to the bulk parameters such as the pressure and densities, but do not alter significantly the large distance behavior of the correlation functions in leading order. The static scalar and charged structure factors are consistent with a plasma of a dyon-anti-dyon liquid with a Coulomb parameter $\Gamma_{D\bar D}\approx 1$ in the dyon-anti-dyon channel. Heavy quarks are still linearly confined and the large spatial Wilson loops still exhibit area laws in leading order. The t$^\prime$ Hooft loop is shown to be 1 modulo Coulomb corrections.
