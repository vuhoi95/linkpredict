Title: Lifshitz quasinormal modes and relaxation from holography
Authors: Watse Sybesma and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We obtain relaxation times for field theories with Lifshitz scaling and with holographic duals Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity theories. This is done by computing quasinormal modes of a bulk scalar field in the presence of Lifshitz black branes. We determine the relation between relaxation time and dynamical exponent z, for various values of boundary dimension d and operator scaling dimension. It is found that for d>z+1, at zero momenta, the modes are non-overdamped, whereas for d<=z+1 the system is always overdamped. For d=z+1 and zero momenta, we present analytical results.
