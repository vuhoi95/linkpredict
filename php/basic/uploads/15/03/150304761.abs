Title: Chern-Simons Theory in SIM(1) Superspace
Authors: Jiří Vohánka and Mir Faizal
Abstract: In this paper, we will analyse a three dimensional supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory in SIM(1) superspace formalism. The breaking of the Lorentz symmetry down to the SIM(1) symmetry, breaks half the supersymmetry of the Lorentz invariant theory. So, the supersymmetry of the Lorentz invariant Chern-Simons theory with N=1 supersymmetry will break down to N=1/2 supersymmetry, when the Lorentz symmetry is broken down to the SIM(1) symmetry. First, we will write the Chern-Simons action using SIM(1) projections of N=1 superfields. However, as the SIM(1) transformations of these projections are very complicated, we will define SIM(1) superfields which transform simply under SIM(1) transformations. We will then express the Chern-Simons action using these SIM(1) superfields. Furthermore, we will analyse the gauge symmetry of this Chern-Simons theory. This is the first time that a Chern-Simons theory with N=1/2 supersymmetry will be constructed on a manifold without a boundary.
