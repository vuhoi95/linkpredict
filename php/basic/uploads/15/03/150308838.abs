Title: Further Holographic Investigations of Big Bang Singularities
Authors: Netta Engelhardt and Thomas Hertog and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We further explore the quantum dynamics near past cosmological singularities in anisotropic Kasner-AdS solutions using gauge/gravity duality. The dual description of the bulk evolution involves N=4 super Yang-Mills on the contracting branch of an anisotropic de Sitter space and is well defined. We compute two-point correlators of Yang-Mills operators of large dimensions using spacelike geodesics anchored on the boundary. The correlator between two points separated in a direction with negative Kasner exponent p always exhibits a pole at horizon scales, in any dimension, which we interpret as a dual signature of the classical bulk singularity. We find evidence that the pole is absent at finite coupling in the dual field theory, indicating the singularity is resolved.
