Title: Extended phase space thermodynamics and $P-V$ criticality of charged  black holes in Brans-Dicke theory
Authors: S. H. Hendi and Z. Armanfard
Abstract: In this paper, taking in to account Brans-Dick theory, we investigate thermodynamic behavior of charged black hole solutions. We study the analogy of the black hole solution with the Van der Waals liquid-gas system in the extended phase space by considering the cosmological constant as dynamical pressure. We obtain critical values of thermodynamic coordinates and plot $P-r_{+}$ and $G-T$ diagrams to study the phase transition.
