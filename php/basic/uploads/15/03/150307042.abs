Title: Energy-momentum tensor on the lattice: non-perturbative renormalization  in Yang--Mills theory
Authors: Leonardo Giusti and Michele Pepe
Abstract: We construct an energy-momentum tensor on the lattice which satisfies the appropriate Ward Identities (WIs) and has the right trace anomaly in the continuum limit. It is defined by imposing suitable WIs associated to the Poincare` invariance of the continuum theory. These relations come forth when the length of the box in the temporal direction is finite, and they take a particularly simple form if the coordinate and the periodicity axes are not aligned. We implement the method for the SU(3) Yang--Mills theory discretized with the standard Wilson action in presence of shifted boundary conditions in the (short) temporal direction. By carrying out extensive numerical simulations, the renormalization constants of the traceless components of the tensor are determined with a precision of roughly half a percent for values of the bare coupling constant in the range 0<= g^2_0<=1.
