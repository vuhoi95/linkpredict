Title: Path-Integral Derivation of the Non-relativistic Scale Anomaly
Authors: Chris L. Lin and Carlos. R. Ordonez
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the scale anomaly for a quantum field theoretic 2D-nonrelativistic Bose gas with contact interactions using Fujikawa's method, both in vacuum and in many-body systems. The use of path integrals for these problems is novel and motivated by a recently developed path-integral framework for addressing questions about scaling in these systems. A natural class of regulators is found that produces the correct value of the anomaly traditionally calculated via other methods, e.g., diagrammatically via the beta function.
