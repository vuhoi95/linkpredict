Title: On $\mathcal{N}=1$ susy backgrounds with $AdS$ factor from nonabelian  T-duality
Authors: Thiago R. Araujo and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We consider the action of a non-abelian T-duality on backgrounds with an AdS${}_5$ factor in type IIA supergravity, finding a new type IIB background, as well as the non-abelian T-dual of a domain wall solution which has as limits the non-abelian T-dual of $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$ and the non-abelian T-dual of $AdS_3\times \mathbb{R}^2\times S^2\times S^3$. We explore some consequences of non-abelian T-duality for the dual conformal field theories.
