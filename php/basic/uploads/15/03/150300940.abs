Title: F-theory with Worldvolume Sectioning
Authors: William D. Linch III and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We describe the worldvolume for the bosonic sector of the lower-dimensional F-theory that embeds 5D, N=1 M-theory and the 4D type II superstring. This theory is a complexification of the fundamental 5-brane theory that embeds the 4D, N=1 M-theory of the 3D type II string in a sense that we make explicit at the level of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations. We find three types of section condition: in spacetime, on the worldvolume, and one tying them together. The 5-brane theory is recovered from the new theory by a double dimensional reduction.
