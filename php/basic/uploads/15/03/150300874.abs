Title: On the functional renormalization group for the scalar field on curved  background with non-minimal interaction
Authors: Ilya L. Shapiro and Poliane M. Teixeira and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: The running of the non-minimal parameter (\xi) of the interaction of the real scalar field and scalar curvature is explored within the non-perturbative setting of the functional renormalization group (RG). We establish the RG flow in curved space-time in the scalar field sector, in particular derive an equation for the non-minimal parameter. The RG trajectory is numerically explored for different sets of initial data.
