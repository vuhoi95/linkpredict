Title: Regularization of energy-momentum tensor correlators and parity-odd  terms
Authors: Loriano Bonora and Antonio Duarte Pereira and Bruno Lima de Souza
Abstract: We discuss the problem of regularizing correlators in conformal field theories. The only way to do it in coordinate space is to interpret them as distributions. Unfortunately except for the simplest cases we do not have tabulated mathematical results. The way out we pursue here is to go to momentum space and use Feynman diagram techniques and their regularization methods. We focus on the energy-momentum tensor correlators and, to gain insight, we compute and regularize 2-point functions in 2d with various techniques both in coordinate space and in momentum space, obtaining the same results. Then we do the same for 2-point functions in 4d. Finally we turn to 3-point function in 4d, and concentrate on the parity-odd part. We derive in particular the regularized trace and divergence of the energy-momentum tensor in a chiral fermion model. We discuss the problems related to the parity-odd trace anomaly.
