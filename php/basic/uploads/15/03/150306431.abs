Title: Quantum phase transition of high dimensional Yang-Mills theories
Authors: Nikos Irges and George Koutsoumbas and Konstantinos Ntrekis
Abstract: We determine the critical value of the coupling where the first order quantum phase transition takes place for lattice SU(2) Yang-Mills theories in dimensions higher than four. Within a Mean-Field approach we derive an approximate law valid for any dimension d and in the context of a Monte Carlo approach, in addition to the already known d=5 case, we look at d=6,7,8.
