Title: Bethe states for the two-site Bose-Hubbard model: a binomial approach
Authors: Gilberto Santos and Changrim Ahn and Angela Foerster and Itzhak Roditi
Abstract: We calculate explicitly the Bethe vectors states by the algebraic Bethe ansatz method with the $gl(2)$-invariant $R$-matrix for the two-site Bose-Hubbard model. Using a binomial expansion of the n-th power of a sum of two operators we get and solve a recursion equation. We calculate the scalar product and the norm of the Bethe vectors states. The form factors of the imbalance current operator are also computed.
