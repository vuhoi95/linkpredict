Title: Proton Spin and Tensorgluons
Authors: Spyros Konitopoulos and George Savvidy
Abstract: Recently it was suggested that inside the hadrons there are additional partons - tensorgluons - which carry the same charges as the gluons, but have larger spin. The nonzero density of tensorgluons can be created inside a nucleon by radiation of tensorgluons by gluons. Tensorgluons can carry a part of nucleon momentum together with gluons. Because tensorgluons have a larger spin, they can influence the spin structure of the nucleon. We analyse a possible contribution of polarised tensorgluon density to the spin of the nucleon. This contribution appears in the next to leading order, compared to the gluons and can provide a substantial screening effect due to the larger spin of tensorgluons.
