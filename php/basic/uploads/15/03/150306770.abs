Abstract: We search for realistic supersymmetric standard-like models from SO(32) heterotic string theory on factorizable tori with multiple magnetic fluxes. Three chiral ganerations of quarks and leptons are derived from the adjoint and vector representations of SO(12) gauge groups embedded in SO(32) adjoint representation. Massless spectra of our models also include Higgs fields, which have desired Yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons at the tree-level.
