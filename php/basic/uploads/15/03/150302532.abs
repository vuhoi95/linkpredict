Title: Geometry of Winter Model
Authors: U. G. Aglietti and P. M. Santini
Abstract: By constructing the Riemann surface controlling the resonance structure of Winter model, we determine the limitations of perturbation theory. We then derive explicit non-perturbative results for various observables in the weak-coupling regime, in which the model has an infinite tower of long-lived resonant states. The problem of constructing proper initial wavefunctions coupled to single excitations of the model is also treated within perturbative and non-perturbative methods.
