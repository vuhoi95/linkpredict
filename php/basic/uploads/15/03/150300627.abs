Title: Entanglement Entropy and Duality in AdS(4)
Authors: Ioannis Bakas and Georgios Pastras
Abstract: Small variations of the entanglement entropy \delta S and the expectation value of the modular Hamiltonian \delta E are computed holographically for circular entangling curves in the boundary of AdS(4), using gravitational perturbations with general boundary conditions in spherical coordinates. Agreement with the first law of thermodynamics, \delta S = \delta E, requires that the line element of the entangling curve remains constant. In this context, we also find a manifestation of electric-magnetic duality for the entanglement entropy and the corresponding modular Hamiltonian, following from the holographic energy-momentum/Cotton tensor duality.
