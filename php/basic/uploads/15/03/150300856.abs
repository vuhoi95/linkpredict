Title: Three-dimensional asymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell theory
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Pierre-Henry Lambert and Pujian Mao
Abstract: Three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with non trivial asymptotics at null infinity is solved. The symmetry algebra is a Virasoro-Kac-Moody type algebra that extends the bms3 algebra of the purely gravitational case. Solution space involves logarithms and provides a tractable example of a polyhomogeneous solution space. The associated surface charges are non-integrable and non-conserved due to the presence of electromagnetic news. As in the four dimensional purely gravitational case, their algebra involves a field-dependent central charge.
