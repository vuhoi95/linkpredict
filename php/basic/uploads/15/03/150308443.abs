Abstract: We demonstrate that finite time singularities of Type IV can be consistently incorporated in the Universe's cosmological evolution, either appearing in the inflationary era, or in the late-time regime. While using only one scalar field instabilities can in principle occur at the time of the phantom-divide crossing, when two fields are involved we are able to avoid such instabilities. Additionally, the two-field scalar-tensor theories prove to be able to offer a plethora of possible viable cosmological scenarios, at which various types of cosmological singularities can be realized. Amongst others, it is possible to describe inflation with the appearance of a Type IV singularity, and phantom late-time acceleration which ends in a Big Rip. Finally, for completeness, we also present the Type IV realization in the context of suitably reconstructed $F(R)$ gravity.
