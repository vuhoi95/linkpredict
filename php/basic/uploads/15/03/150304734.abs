Title: Asymptotically flat black holes sourced by a massless scalar field
Authors: Mariano Cadoni and Edgardo Franzin
Abstract: We derive exact, asymptotically flat black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity sourced by a non trivial scalar field with $1/r$ asymptotic behaviour. They are determined using an ansatz for the scalar field profile and working out, together with the metric functions, the corresponding form of the scalar self-interaction potential. Near to the singularity the black hole behaves as the Janis-Newmann-Winicour-Wyman solution. We also work out a consistent thermodynamical description of our black hole solutions. For large mass our hairy black holes have the same thermodynamical behaviour of the Schwarzschild black hole, whereas for small masses they differ substantially from the latter.
