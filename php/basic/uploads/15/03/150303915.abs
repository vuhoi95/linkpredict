Title: Einstein-Maxwell Dirichlet walls, negative kinetic energies, and the  adiabatic approximation for extreme black holes
Authors: Tomas Andrade and William R. Kelly and Donald Marolf
Abstract: The gravitational Dirichlet problem -- in which the induced metric is fixed on boundaries at finite distance from the bulk -- is related to simple notions of UV cutoffs in gauge/gravity duality and appears in discussions relating the low-energy behavior of gravity to fluid dynamics. We study the Einstein-Maxwell version of this problem, in which the induced Maxwell potential on the wall is also fixed. For flat walls in otherwise-asymptotically-flat spacetimes, we identify a moduli space of Majumdar-Papapetrou-like static solutions parametrized by the location of an extreme black hole relative to the wall. Such solutions may be described as balancing gravitational repulsion from a negative-mass image-source against electrostatic attraction to an oppositely-signed image charge. Standard techniques for handling divergences yield a moduli space metric with an eigenvalue that becomes negative near the wall, indicating a region of negative kinetic energy and suggesting that the Hamiltonian may be unbounded below. One may also surround the black hole with an additional (roughly spherical) Dirichlet wall to impose a regulator whose physics is more clear. Negative kinetic energies remain, though new terms do appear in the moduli-space metric. The regulator-dependence indicates that the adiabatic approximation may be ill-defined for classical extreme black holes with Dirichlet walls.
