Title: Topological T-duality via Lie algebroids and $Q$-flux in  Poisson-generalized geometry
Authors: T. Asakawa and H. Muraki and S. Watamura
Abstract: It is known that the topological T-duality exchanges $H$ and $F$-fluxes. In this paper, we reformulate the topological T-duality as an exchange of two Lie algebroids in the generalized tangent bundle. Then, we apply the same formulation to the Poisson-generalized geometry, which is introduced in arXiv:1408.2649 to define $R$-fluxes as field strength associated with $\beta$-transformations. We propose a definition of $Q$-flux associated with $\beta$-diffeomorphisms, and show that the topological T-duality exchanges $R$ and $Q$-fluxes.
