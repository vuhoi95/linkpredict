Title: Biconformal symmetry and static Maxwell fields near higher-dimensional  black holes
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Andrei Zelnikov
Abstract: We study an electric field created by a static electric charge near the higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. The relation between the static Green functions on the D-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom background and on the (D+2)-dimensional homogeneous Bertotti-Robinson spacetime is found. Using the biconformal symmetry we obtained a simple integral representation for the static Maxwell Green functions in arbitrary dimensions. We show that in a four-dimensional spacetime the static Green function obtained by the biconformal method correctly reproduces known results. We also found a closed form for the exact static Green functions and vector potentials in the five-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime.
