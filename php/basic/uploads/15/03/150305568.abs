Title: Wald's gravitational entropy for ghost-free, infinite derivative  theories of Gravity
Authors: Aindri√∫ Conroy and Anupam Mazumdar and Ali Teimouri
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the Wald's entropy for any spherically symmetric blackhole within an infinite derivative theory of gravity is determined solely by the area law. Thus, the infrared behaviour of gravity is captured by the Einstein-Hilbert term, provided that the massless graviton remains the only propagating degree of freedom in the spacetime.
