Title: Bulk from Bi-locals in Thermo Field CFT
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Junggi Yoon
Abstract: We study the Large $N$ dynamics of the $O(N)$ field theory in the Thermo field dynamics approach. The question of recovering the high temperature phase and the corresponding $O(N)$ gauging is clarified. Through the associated bi-local representation we discuss the emergent bulk space-time and construction of (Higher spin) fields. We note the presence of `evanescent' modes in this construction and also the mixing of spins at finite temperature.
