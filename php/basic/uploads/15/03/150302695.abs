Title: Entanglement over the rainbow
Authors: Giovanni Ramírez and Javier Rodríguez-Laguna and Germán Sierra
Abstract: In one dimension the area law for the entanglement entropy is violated maximally by the ground state of a strong inhomogeneous spin chain, the so called concentric singlet phase (CSP), that looks like a rainbow connecting the two halves of the chain. In this paper we show that, in the weak inhomogeneity limit, the rainbow state is a thermofield double of a conformal field theory with a temperature proportional to the inhomogeneity parameter. This result suggests some relation of the CSP with black holes. Finally, we propose an extension of the model to higher dimensions.
