Title: Detecting quantum gravitational effects of loop quantum cosmology in the  early universe?
Authors: Tao Zhu and Anzhong Wang and Gerald Cleaver and Klaus Kirsten and Qin Sheng and Qiang Wu
Abstract: We derive the primordial power spectra and spectral indexes of the density fluctuations and gravitational waves in the framework of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) with holonomy and inverse-volume corrections, by using the uniform asymptotic approximation method to its third-order, at which the upper error bounds are $\lesssim 0.15\%$, and accurate enough for the current and forthcoming cosmological observations. Then, using the Planck, BAO and SN data we obtain the tightest constraints on quantum gravitational effects from LQC corrections, and find that such effects could be well within the detection of the current and forthcoming cosmological observations.
