Title: Fermion localization and flavour hierarchy in higher curvature spacetime
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Joydip Mitra and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: Fermion localization in a braneworld model in presence of dilaton coupled higher curvature Gauss-Bonnet bulk gravity is discussed. It is shown that the left handed fermionic modes can be localized on the visible brane due to the dilaton coupled higher curvature term without the necessity of any external localizing bulk field. This offers a natural resolution of the flavour hierarchy problem in Standard Model.
