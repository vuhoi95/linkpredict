Title: A state description of pair production from Dirac sea in gravitational  field --physical interpretation of Weyl anomaly--
Authors: Yoshinobu Habara and Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We present the method that the pair production of particles is described as a Fock space state vector, where the pair production stems from receiving energy from, as an example, gravitational background field. At the same time we show a sort of new mechanism that in the diffeomorphism-invariant Dirac sea the Weyl symmetry is broken due to the pair production and this provides us a new physical interpretation of the origin of Weyl anomaly. In the present paper at the first place, we consider two kinds of background space-time which are connected each other by the Weyl transformation. It is shown that the vacuum, i.e. Dirac sea, in the "curved" space-time \underline{after} making Weyl transformation is nothing but the pair produced state provided we consider the state in terms of the Fock space basis in the "flat" space-time \underline{before} making the Weyl transformation. When summing up with respect to the time the contribution of pair production of each time-slice we obtain the Ricci scalar $R$ and then it is related to the trace part $\left\langle T^{\mu}_{\> \mu}\right\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor to produce Weyl anomaly.
