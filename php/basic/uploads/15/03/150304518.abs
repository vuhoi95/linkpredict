Title: Effect of phantom dark energy on the holographic thermalization
Authors: Xiao-Xiong Zeng and Xin-Yun Hu and Li-Fang Li
Abstract: Gravitational collapse of a shell of charged dust surrounded by the phantom dark energy is probed by the minimal area surface, which is dual to probe the thermalization in the boundary quantum field by expectation values of Wilson loop in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We investigated mainly the effect of the phantom dark energy parameter and chemical potential on the thermalization. The result shows that the smaller the phantom dark energy parameter is, the easier the plasma thermalizes as the chemical potential is fixed, and the larger the chemical potential is, the harder the plasma thermalizes as the dark energy parameter is fixed. We get the fitting function of the thermalization curve and with it, the thermalization velocity and thermalization acceleration are discussed.
