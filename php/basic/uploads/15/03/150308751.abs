Title: Astrophysical constraints on extended gravity models
Authors: Gaetano Lambiase and Mairi Sakellariadou and Antonio Stabile and Arturo Stabile
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in the context of fourth order gravity nonminimally coupled to a massive scalar field. Using the damping of the orbital period of coalescing stellar binary systems, we impose constraints on the free parameters of extended gravity models. In particular, we find that the variation of the orbital period is a function of three mass scales which depend on the free parameters of the model under consideration; we can constrain these mass scales from current observational data.
