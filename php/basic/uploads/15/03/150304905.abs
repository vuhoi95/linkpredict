Title: Finite BRST-BFV transformations for dynamical systems with second-class  constraints
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov and Igor V. Tyutin
Abstract: We study finite field dependent BRST-BFV transformations for dynamical systems with first- and second-class constraints within the generalized Hamiltonian formalism. We find explicitly their Jacobians and the form of a solution to the compensation equation necessary for generating an arbitrary finite change of gauge-fixing functionals in the path integral.
