Title: Two-loop Yang-Mills diagrams from superstring amplitudes
Authors: Lorenzo Magnea and Sam Playle and Rodolfo Russo and Stefano Sciuto
Abstract: Starting from the superstring amplitude describing interactions among D-branes with a constant world-volume field strength, we present a detailed analysis of how the open string degeneration limits reproduce the corresponding field theory Feynman diagrams. A key ingredient in the string construction is represented by the twisted (Prym) super differentials, as their periods encode the information about the background field. We provide an efficient method to calculate perturbatively the determinant of the twisted period matrix in terms of sets of super-moduli appropriate to the degeneration limits. Using this result we show that there is a precise one-to-one correspondence between the degeneration of different factors in the superstring amplitudes and one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams capturing the gauge theory effective action at the two-loop level.
