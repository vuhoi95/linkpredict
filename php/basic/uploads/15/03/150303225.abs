Title: $BMS_4$ Surface-Charge Algebra via Hamiltonian Framework
Authors: Ippei Fujisawa and Ryuichi Nakayama
Abstract: Surface-charge algebra associated with BMS$_4$ symmetry on the null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetime is studied via the Hamiltonian framework. A coordinate system, where boundaries of constant-time hypersurfaces cross the null infinity, is adopted. The equation itself which determines the variation of the surface charges turns out the same as that previously obtained via the covariant framework by Barnich and Troessaert, and is non-integrable for general radiation field $C_{AB}$. However, if $C_{AB}$ is independent of retarded time $u$, the variation equation is integrable and the conserved surface charges generate BMS$_4$ algebra without central extension.
