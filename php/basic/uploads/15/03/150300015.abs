Title: Forms and algebras in (half-)maximal supergravity theories
Authors: Paul Howe and Jakob Palmkvist
Abstract: The forms in D-dimensional (half-)maximal supergravity theories are discussed for 3 $\leq$ D $\leq$ 11. Superspace methods are used to derive consistent sets of Bianchi identities for all the forms for all degrees, and to show that they are soluble and fully compatible with supersymmetry. The Bianchi identities determine Lie superalgebras that can be extended to Borcherds superalgebras of a special type. It is shown that any Borcherds superalgebra of this type gives the same form spectrum, up to an arbitrary degree, as an associated Kac-Moody algebra. For maximal supergravity up to D-form potentials, this is the very extended Kac-Moody algebra E11. It is also shown how gauging can be carried out in a simple fashion by deforming the Bianchi identities by means of a new algebraic element related to the embedding tensor. In this case the appropriate extension of the form algebra is a truncated version of the so-called tensor hierarchy algebra.
