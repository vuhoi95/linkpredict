Title: Constructing Buildings and Harmonic Maps
Authors: Ludmil Katzarkov and Alexander Noll and Pranav Pandit and Carlos Simpson
Abstract: In a continuation of our previous work, we outline a theory which should lead to the construction of a universal pre-building and versal building with a $\phi$-harmonic map from a Riemann surface, in the case of two-dimensional buildings for the group $SL_3$. This will provide a generalization of the space of leaves of the foliation defined by a quadratic differential in the classical theory for $SL_2$. Our conjectural construction would determine the exponents for $SL_3$ WKB problems, and it can be put into practice on examples.
