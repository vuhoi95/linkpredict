Title: Landau-Ginzburg Mirror Symmetry Conjecture
Authors: Weiqiang He and Si Li and Yefeng Shen and Rachel Webb
Abstract: We prove the Landau-Ginzburg mirror symmetry conjecture between invertible quasi-homogeneous polynomial singularities at all genera. That is, we show that the FJRW theory (LG A-model) of such a polynomial is equivalent to the Saito-Givental theory (LG B-model) of the mirror polynomial.
