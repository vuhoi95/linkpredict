Title: Approach of background metric expansion to a new metric ansatz for  gauged and ungauged Kaluza-Klein supergravity black holes
Authors: Shuang-Qing Wu and He Wang
Abstract: In a previous paper [S.Q. Wu, Phys. Rev. D 83, 121502(R) (2011)], a new kind of metric ansatz was found to fairly describe all already known black hole solutions in the ungauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) supergravity theories. That metric ansatz somewhat resembles to the famous Kerr-Schild (KS) form, but it is different from the KS one in two distinct aspects. That is, apart from a global conformal factor, the metric ansatz can be written as a vacuum background spacetime plus a "perturbation" modification term, the latter of which is associated with a timelike geodesic vector field rather than a null geodesic congruence in the usual KS ansatz. In this paper, we shall study this novel metric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the construction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other gauged supergravity theories. In order to investigate the metric properties of the general KK-AdS solutions, in this paper we devise a new effective method, dubbed the background metric expansion method, which can be thought of as a generalization of the perturbation expansion method, to deal with the Lagrangian and all equations of motion. In addition to two previously known conditions, namely the timelike and geodesic properties of the vector, we get the three additional constraints via contracting the Maxwell and Einstein equations once or twice with this timelike geodesic vector. In particular, we find that these are a simple set of sufficient conditions to determine the vector and the dilaton scalar around the background metric, which is helpful in obtaining new exact solutions. With these five simplified equations in hand, we rederive the general rotating charged KK-(A)dS black hole solutions with spherical horizon topology and obtain new solutions with planar topology in all dimensions.
