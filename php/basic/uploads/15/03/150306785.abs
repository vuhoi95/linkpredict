Abstract: The cosmological models called $\alpha$-attractors provide an excellent fit to the latest observational data. Their predictions $n_{s} = 1-2/N$ and $r = 12\alpha/N^{2}$ are very robust with respect to the modifications of the inflaton potential. An intriguing interpretation of $\alpha$-attractors is based on a geometric moduli space with a boundary: a Poincare disk model of a hyperbolic geometry with the radius $\sqrt{3\alpha}$, beautifully represented by the Escher's picture Circle Limit IV. In such models, the amplitude of the gravitational waves is proportional to the square of the radius of the Poincare disk.
