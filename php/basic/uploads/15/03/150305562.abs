Title: Quantum Black Hole Formation in the BFSS Matrix Model
Authors: Sinya Aoki and Masanori Hanada and Norihiro Iizuka
Abstract: We study the various head-on collisions of two bunches of D0-branes and their real-time evolution in the BFSS matrix model in classical limit. For a various matrix size N respecting the 't Hooft scaling, we find quantitative evidence for the formation of a single bound state of D0-branes at late time, which is matrix model thermalization and dual to the formation of a larger black hole.
