Title: Holographic Complexity And Cosmological Singularities
Authors: Jose L. F. Barbon and Eliezer Rabinovici
Abstract: We study the evolution of holographic complexity in various AdS/CFT models containing cosmological crunch singularities. We find that a notion of complexity measured by extremal bulk volumes tends to decrease as the singularity is approached in CFT time, suggesting that the corresponding quantum states have simpler entanglement structure at the singularity.
