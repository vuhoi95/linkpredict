Abstract: We study $(p,q)$ 5-brane webs dual to certain $N$ M5-brane configurations and show that the partition function of these brane webs gives rise to cylindric Schur process with period $N$. This generalizes the previously studied case of period $1$. We also show that open string amplitudes corresponding to these brane webs are captured by the generating function of cylindric plane partitions with profile determined by the boundary conditions imposed on the open string amplitudes.
