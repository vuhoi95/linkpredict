Title: Counterterms in Massive Gravity Theory
Authors: Li-Ming Cao and Yuxuan Peng
Abstract: We derived local boundary counterterms in massive gravity theory with a negative cosmological constant in four dimensions. With these counterterms at hand we analyzed the properties of the boundary field theory in the context of AdS/CFT duality by calculating the boundary stress energy tensor. The calculation shows that the boundary stress energy tensor is conserved, and momentum dissipation might occur on the level of linear response only. We also calculated the thermodynamic quantities and the boundary stress energy tensor for a specific type of solutions. The thermodynamic potentials agree with the results of literature up to some constants which can be removed by adding finite counterterms.
