Authors: Tomohiro Inagaki and Sergei D. Odintsov and Hiroki Sakamoto
Abstract: We investigate the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in curved spacetime at the large $N_c$ limit and in slow-roll approximation. The model can be described by the renormalization group corrected gauge-Higgs-Yukawa theory with the corresponding compositeness conditions. Evaluating the renormalization group (RG) improved effective action, we show that such model can produce CMB fluctuations and find inflationary parameters: spectral index, tensor-to-scalar-ratio and running of the spectral index. We demonstrate that the model can naturally satisfy the Planck 2015 data and maybe considered as an alternative candidate for Higgs inflation.
