Title: Saddle point inflation from higher order corrections to  Higgs/Starobinsky inflation
Authors: Michal Artymowski and Zygmunt Lalak and Marek Lewicki
Abstract: We explore two saddle point inflationary scenarios in the context of higher order corrections related to different generalisations of general relativity. Firstly, we deal with Jordan frame Starobinsky potential, for which we identify a portion of a parameter space of inflection point inflation, which can accommodate all the experimental results. Secondly, we analyse Higgs inflation and more specifically the influence of non-renormalisible terms on the standard quartic potential. All results were verified with the PLANCK 2015 data.
