Title: Lagrangian formulation for Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD)  equations
Authors: Alexei A. Deriglazov and Walberto Guzmán Ramírez
Abstract: We obtain Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon equations of a rotating body with given values of spin and momentum starting from Lagrangian action without auxiliary variables. MPTD-equations correspond to minimal interaction of our spinning particle with gravity. We shortly discuss some novel properties deduced from the Lagrangian form of MPTD-equations: emergence of an effective metric instead of the original one, non-commutativity of coordinates of representative point of the body, spin corrections to Newton potential due to the effective metric as well as spin corrections to the expression for integrals of motion of a given isometry.
