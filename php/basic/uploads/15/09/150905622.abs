Title: New approach to nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariance and its  applications
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: A comprehensive account of a new structured algorithm for obtaining nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariances in both space and spacetime by gauging the Galilean symmetry in a generic nonrelativistic field theoretical model is provided. Various applications like the obtention of nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariance, the introduction of Chern-Simons term and its role in fractional quantum Hall effect, induction of diffeomorphism in irrotational fluid model, abstraction of Newton-Cartan geometry and the emergence of Horava-Lifshitz gravity are discussed in details.
