Title: Semi-Calabi-Yau varieties and mirror pairs
Authors: Alessandro Chiodo and Elana Kalashnikov and Davide Cesare Veniani
Abstract: We prove cohomological mirror duality for varieties of Borcea-Voisin type in any dimension. Our proof applies to all examples which can be constructed through Berglund-H\"ubsch duality. Our method is a variant of the Landau-Ginzburg model and of the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence which allows us to prove the classical cohomological mirror symmetry statement for an orbifold version of the ramification locus of the anti-symplectic involution. These ramification loci mirroring each other are beyond the Calabi-Yau category and feature sextic curves in $P^2$, octic surfaces in $P^3$, degree-$10$ three-folds in $P^4$, etc.
