Title: The horizon of the lightest black hole
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Roberto Casadio
Abstract: We study the properties of the poles of the resummed graviton propagator obtained by resumming bubble matter diagrams which correct the classical graviton propagator. These poles have been previously interpreted as black holes precursors. Here, we show using the Horizon Wave-Function formalism that these poles indeed have properties which make them compatible with being black hole precursors. In particular, when modeled with a Breit-Wigner distribution, they have a well defined gravitational radius. The probability that the resonance is inside its own gravitational radius, and thus that it is black hole, is about one half. Our results confirm the interpretation of these poles as black hole precursors.
