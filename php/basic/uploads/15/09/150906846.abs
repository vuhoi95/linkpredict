Title: Hawking, Fiducial, and Free-fall Temperatures of Black Hole on Gravity's  Rainbow
Authors: Yongwan Gim and Wontae Kim
Abstract: On gravity's rainbow, the energy of particles affects the geometry of black hole in such a way that the Hawking temperature of black hole is appropriately modified. It means that the fiducial and free-fall temperatures on the background of black hole should also be modified according to deformation of the geometry. We find that the fiducial temperature takes the blue-shifted modified Hawking temperature so that it is divergent at the horizon, while the free-fall temperature defined by employing the thermodynamic Stefan-Boltzmann relation on gravity's rainbow is finite everywhere without the blue-shift effect; in particular, it is vanishing at the horizon. In this respect, the behaviors of the two-different temperatures at the horizon show that black hole complementarity is still required on gravity's rainbow.
