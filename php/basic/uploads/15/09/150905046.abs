Title: Hydrodynamics, resurgence and trans-asymptotics
Authors: Gokce Basar and Gerald V. Dunne
Abstract: The second-order hydrodynamical description of a homogeneous conformal plasma that undergoes a boost- invariant expansion is given by a single nonlinear ordinary differential equation, whose resurgent asymptotic properties we study, developing further the recent work of Heller and Spalinski [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 072501 (2015)]. Resurgence clearly identifies the non-hydrodynamic modes that are exponentially suppressed at late times, analogous to the quasi-normal-modes in gravitational language, organizing these modes in terms of a trans-series expansion. These modes are analogs of instantons in semi-classical expansions, where the damping rate plays the role of the instanton action. We show that this system displays the generic features of resurgence, with explicit quantitative relations between the fluctuations about different orders of these non-hydrodynamic modes. The imaginary part of the trans-series parameter is identified with the Stokes constant, and the real part with the freedom associated with initial conditions.
