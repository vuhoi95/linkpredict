Abstract: We consider a modification of GR with a special type of a non-local f(R). The structure of the non-local operators is motivated by the string field theory and p-adic string theory. We pay special account to the stability of the de Sitter solution in our model and formulate the conditions on the model parameters to have a stable configuration. Relevance of unstable configurations for the description of the de Sitter phase during inflation is discussed. Special physically interesting values of parameters are studied in details.
