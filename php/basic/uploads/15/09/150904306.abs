Title: Quasinormal frequencies of self-dual black holes
Authors: Victor Santos and R. V. Maluf and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: One simplified black hole model constructed from a semiclassical analysis of loop quantum gravity (LQG) is called self-dual black hole. This black hole solution depends on a free dimensionless parameter P known as the polymeric parameter and also on the $a_{0}$ area related to the minimum area gap of LQG. In the limit of P and $a_{0}$ going to zero, the usual Schwarzschild-solution is recovered. Here we investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless scalar perturbations in the self-dual black hole background. We compute the QN frequencies using the sixth order WKB approximation method and compare them with numerical solutions of the Regge-Wheeler equation. Our results show that as the parameter P grows, the real part of the QN frequencies suffers an initial increase and then starts to decrease while the magnitude of the imaginary one decreases for fixed area gap $a_{0}$. This particular feature means that the damping of scalar perturbations in the self-dual black hole spacetimes are slower, and their oscillations are faster or slower according to the value of P.
