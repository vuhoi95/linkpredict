Title: Configurational entropy in $f(R,T)$ brane models
Authors: R. A. C. Correa and P. H. R. S. Moraes
Abstract: In this work we investigate generalized theories of gravity in the so-called configurational entropy (CE) context. We show, by means of this information-theoretical measure, that a stricter bound on the parameter of $f(R,T)$ brane models arises from the CE. We find that these bounds are characterized by a valley region in the CE profile, where the entropy is minimal. We argue that the CE measure can open a new role and an important additional approach to select parameters in modified theories of gravitation.
