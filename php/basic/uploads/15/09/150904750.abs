Abstract: We analyze the embedding of probe D3'-brane in the background of $N$ D3-branes at finite temperature, oriented such that they overlap in 1+1 dimensions. As the distance between the D3'-brane and the D3 brane is varied, we find solutions that appear to intersect the horizon. We find that this brane bends logarithmically, making the precise definition of the distance separating the D3 and the D3' brane scale dependent. We also consider the embedding of a probe M5-brane in the background of $N$ M2-branes at finite temperature, for which the logarithmic bending is absent. These systems appear to open a path to probe physics near and behind the black hole horizon in a strictly field theoretic framework.
