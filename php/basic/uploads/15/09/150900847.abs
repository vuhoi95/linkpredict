Title: Classification of Argyres-Douglas theories from M5 branes
Authors: Yifan Wang and Dan Xie
Abstract: We obtain a large class of new 4d Argyres-Douglas theories by classifying irregular punctures for the 6d (2,0) superconformal theory of ADE type on a sphere. Along the way, we identify the connection between the Hitchin system and three-fold singularity descriptions of the same Argyres-Douglas theory. Other constructions such as taking degeneration limits of the irregular puncture, adding an extra regular puncture, and introducing outer-automorphism twists are also discussed. Later we investigate various features of these theories including their Coulomb branch spectrum and central charges.
