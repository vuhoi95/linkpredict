Title: Holographic Flows in non-Abelian T-dual Geometries
Authors: Niall T. Macpherson and Carlos Nunez and Daniel C. Thompson and S. Zacarias
Abstract: We use non-Abelian T-duality to construct new N=1 solutions of type IIA supergravity (and their M-theory lifts) that interpolate between AdS_5 geometries. We initiate a study of the holographic interpretation of these backgrounds as RG flows between conformal fixed points. Along the way we give an elegant formulation of non-Abelian T-duality when acting on a wide class of backgrounds, including those corresponding to such flows, in terms of their SU(2) structure.
