Abstract: We investigate a Lorentz-violating chiral model composed by two fermions, a complex scalar field and a gauge field. We show that by convenientely adjusting the parameters of the model, it is possible to generate an unambiguous Carroll-Field-Jackiw term and, at the same time, provide the cancelation of the chiral anomaly. The renormalizability of the model is investigated and it is shown that the same counterterms needed in the symmetric phase also renormalize the model with broken symmetry.
