Title: Ultraviolet behavior of 6D supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and  harmonic superspace
Authors: Guillaume Bossard and Evgeny Ivanov and Andrei Smilga
Abstract: We revisit the issue of higher-dimensional counterterms for the N=(1,1) supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in six dimensions using the off-shell N=(1,0) and on-shell N=(1,1) harmonic superspace approaches. The second approach is developed in full generality and used to solve, for the first time, the N=(1,1) SYM constraints in terms of N=(1,0) superfields. This provides a convenient tool to write explicit expressions for the candidate counterterms and other N=(1,1) invariants and may be conducive to proving non-renormalization theorems needed to explain the absence of certain logarithmic divergences in higher-loop contributions to scattering amplitudes in N=(1,1) SYM.
