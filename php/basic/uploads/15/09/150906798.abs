Title: Reentrant phase transitions and van der Waals behaviour for hairy black  holes
Authors: Robie A. Hennigar and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We study the extended phase space thermodynamics for hairy AdS black hole solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ theory conformally coupled to a scalar field in five dimensions. We find these solutions to exhibit van der Waals behaviour in both the charged/uncharged cases, and reentrant phase transitions in the charged case. This is the first example of reentrant phase transitions in a five dimensional gravitational system which does not include higher curvature corrections.
