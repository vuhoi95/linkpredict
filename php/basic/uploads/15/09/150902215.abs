Title: Refining thick brane models via electroweak data
Authors: A. E. R. Chumbes and J. M. Hoff da Silva and M. B. Hott
Abstract: After discussing the localization of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and Higgs fields on a thick brane, we introduce a procedure of dimensional reduction and its consequences to the rescaled parameters of the boson sector of the Standard Model. The parameters encodes some power dependence on the extra dimension, usually narrow, warp factor and hence it also depend on the position related with the extra dimension inside the thick brane. In this vein, the observable parameters may be used to refine the braneworld models via the brane thickness.
