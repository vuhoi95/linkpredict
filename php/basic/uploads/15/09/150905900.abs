Title: Conservation laws and covariant equations of motion for spinning  particles
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Dirk Puetzfeld
Abstract: We derive the Noether identities and the conservation laws for general gravitational models with arbitrarily interacting matter and gravitational fields. These conservation laws are used for the construction of the covariant equations of motion for test bodies with minimal and nonminimal coupling.
