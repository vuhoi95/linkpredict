Abstract: We study a massless Dirac particle with PT symmetric non-Hermitian Rashba interaction in the background of Dirac oscillator potential to show the PT phase transition in a (2+1) dimensional relativistic system analytically. PT phase transition occurs when strength of the (i) imaginary Rashba interaction or (ii) transverse magnetic field exceed their respective critical values. Small mass gap in the spectrum, consistent with other approaches is generated as long as the system is in the unbroken phase. Relativistic Landau levels are constructed explicitly for such a system.
