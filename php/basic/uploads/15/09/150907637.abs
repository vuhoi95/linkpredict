Title: Near-horizon Extreme Kerr Magnetospheres
Authors: G. Comp√®re and R. Oliveri
Abstract: Analytical solutions to force-free electrodynamics around black holes are fundamental for building simple models of accretion disk and jet dynamics. We present a (nonexhaustive) classification of complex highest-weight solutions to the force-free equations in the near-horizon region of the extremal Kerr black hole. Several classes of real magnetically dominated or null solutions, either axisymmetric or nonaxisymmetric, are described which admit finite energy and angular momentum with respect to the asymptotically flat observer. Subtleties related to the velocity of light surface in the near-horizon region are discussed.
