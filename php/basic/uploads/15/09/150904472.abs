Title: Formal solution to the KP hierarchy
Authors: S. Natanzon and A. Zabrodin
Abstract: We find all formal solutions to the $\hbar$-dependent KP hierarchy. They are characterized by certain Cauchy-like data. The solutions are found in the form of formal series for the tau-function of the hierarchy and for its logarithm (the F-function). An explicit combinatorial description of the coefficients of the series is provided.
