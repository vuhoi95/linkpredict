Title: On-Shell Recursion Relations for Effective Field Theories
Authors: Clifford Cheung and Karol Kampf and Jiri Novotny and Chia-Hsien Shen and Jaroslav Trnka
Abstract: We derive the first ever on-shell recursion relations for amplitudes in effective field theories. Based solely on factorization and the soft behavior of amplitudes, these recursion relations employ a new rescaling momentum shift to construct all tree-level scattering amplitudes in theories like the non- linear sigma model, Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, and the Galileon. Our results prove that all theories with enhanced soft behavior are on-shell constructible.
