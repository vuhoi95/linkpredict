Title: Validity check for imaginary part of potential of a moving quarkonia in  plasma with hyperscaling violating backgrounds
Authors: J. Sadeghi and S. Tahery
Abstract: One efficient tool for studying strongly coupled field theory is the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this note we apply conditions for validity of the imaginary part of the potential for a moving quarkonia in plasma when it has backgrounds with the hyperscaling violation. The imaginary part of potential should be negative because it appears in an exponential function and should exhibit a decaying behavior. We find general constraints for Im$V_{Q \bar{Q}}$ at the near horizon limit and apply them for some known cases. Finally, we find the appropriate spatial dimension for two interesting cases, surplus we present an exact hyperscaling violationg metric which behaves in this context very close to a YM theory with finite temperature.
