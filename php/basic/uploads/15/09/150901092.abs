Title: Conformal quantum mechanics and holographic quench
Authors: Jarkko Järvelä and Ville Keränen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri
Abstract: Recently, there has been much interest in holographic computations of two-point non-equilibrium Green functions from AdS-Vaidya backgrounds. In the strongly coupled quantum field theory on the boundary, the dual interpretation of the background is an equilibration process called a holographic quench. The two dimensional AdS-Vaidya spacetime is a special case, dual to conformal quantum mechanics. We study how the quench is incorporated into a Hamiltonian $H + \theta(t) \Delta H$ and into correlation functions. With the help of recent work on correlation functions in conformal quantum mechanics, we first rederive the known two point functions, and then compute non-equilibrium 3- and 4-point functions. We also compute the 3-point function Witten diagram in the two-dimensional AdS-Vaidya background, and find agreement with the conformal quantum mechanics result.
