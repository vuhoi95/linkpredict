Title: From conformal invariance towards dynamical symmetries of the  collisionless Boltzmann equation
Authors: Stoimen Stoimenov and Malte Henkel
Abstract: Dynamical symmetries of the collisionless Boltzmann transport equation, or Vlasov equation, but under the influence of an external driving force, are derived from non-standard representations of the $2D$ conformal algebra. In the case without external forces, the symmetry of the conformally invariant transport equation is first generalised by considering the particle momentum as an independent variables. This new conformal representation can be further extended to include an external force. The construction and possible physical applications are outlined.
