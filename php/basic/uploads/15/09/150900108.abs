Title: Exact quantum numbers of collapsed and non-collapsed 2-string solutions  in the Heisenberg spin chain
Authors: Tetsuo Deguchi and Pulak Ranjan Giri
Abstract: Every solution of the Bethe-ansatz equations (BAE) is characterized by a set of quantum numbers, by which we can evaluate it numerically. However, no general rule is known how to give quantum numbers for the physical solutions of BAE. For the spin-1/2 XXX chain we rigorously derive all the quantum numbers for the complete set of the Bethe-ansatz eigenvectors in the two down-spin sector with any chain length $N$. Here we obtain them both for real and complex solutions. Consequently, we prove the completeness of the Bethe ansatz and give an exact expression for the number of real solutions which correspond to collapsed bound-state solutions (i.e., 2-string solutions) in the sector: $2[ (N-1)/2 - (N/\pi) \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{N-1})]$ in terms of Gauss' symbol. Moreover, we prove in the sector the scheme conjectured by Takahashi for solving BAE systematically. We also suggest that by applying the present method we can derive the quantum numbers for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain.
