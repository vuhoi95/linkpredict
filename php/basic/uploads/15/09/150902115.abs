Title: Twisted conformal algebra related to $Îº$-Minkowski space
Authors: Stjepan Meljanac and Anna Pachol and Danijel Pikutic
Abstract: Twisted deformations of the conformal symmetry in the Hopf algebraic framework are constructed. The first one is obtained by a Jordanian twist built up from dilatation and momenta generators. The second is the light-like $\kappa$-deformation of the Poincare algebra extended to the conformal algebra, obtained by a twist corresponding to the extended Jordanian r-matrix. The $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime is covariant quantum space under both of these deformations. The extension of the conformal algebra by the noncommutative coordinates is presented in two cases. The differential realizations for $\kappa$-Minkowski coordinates, as well as their left-right dual counterparts, are also included.
