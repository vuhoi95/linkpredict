Title: Examples of naked singularity formation in higher-dimensional  Einstein-vacuum spacetimes
Authors: Xinliang An and Xuefeng Zhang and H. LÃ¼
Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations in 5+1 dimensions are shown to admit solutions describing naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse from nonsingular asymptotically locally flat initial data. We present a class of specific examples with spherical extra dimensions. Thanks to the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, these spacetimes are constructed by lifting continuously self-similar solutions of the 4-dimensional Einstein-scalar field system with a negative exponential potential. Their existence provides a new test-bed for weak cosmic censorship in higher-dimensional gravity. In addition, we point out that a similar attempt of embedding Christodoulou's well-known solutions for massless scalar fields fails to capture formation of naked singularities in 4+1 dimensions, due to a diverging Kretschmann scalar in the initial data.
