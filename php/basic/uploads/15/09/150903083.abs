Title: Highly Deformed Non-uniform Black Strings in Six Dimensions
Authors: Michael Kalisch and Marcus Ansorg
Abstract: We construct numerically static non-uniform black string solutions in six dimensions by using pseudo-spectral methods. An appropriately designed adaptation of the methods in regard of the specific behaviour of the field quantities in the vicinity of our numerical boundaries provides us with extremely accurate results, that allows us to get solutions with an unprecedented deformation of the black string horizon. Consequently, we are able to investigate in detail a critical regime within a suitable parameter diagram. In particular, we observe a clearly pronounced maximum in the mass curve, which is in accordance with the results of Kleihaus, Kunz and Radu from 2006. Interestingly, by looking at extremely distorted black strings, we find two further turning points of the mass, resulting in a spiral curve in the black string's phase diagram.
