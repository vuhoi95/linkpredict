Title: Black hole remnant in asymptotic Anti-de Sitter space
Authors: Wen-Yu Wen and Shang-Yu Wu
Abstract: It is known that a solution of remnant were suggested for black hole ground state after surface gravity is corrected by loop quantum effect. On the other hand, a Schwarzschild black hole in asymptotic Anti-de Sitter space would tunnel into the thermal soliton solution known as the Hawking-Page phase transition. In this letter, we investigate the low temperature phase of three-dimensional BTZ black hole and four-dimensional AdS Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the thermal soliton is energetically favored than the remnant solution at low temperature in three dimensions, while Planck-size remnant is still possible in four dimensions. Though the BTZ remnant seems energetically disfavored, we argue that it is still possible to be found in the overcooled phase if strings were present and its implication is discussed.
