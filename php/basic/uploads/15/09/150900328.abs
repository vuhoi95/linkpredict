Title: Constraining parameters of effective field theory of inflation from  Planck data
Authors: Anindya Banerjee and Himanshu Khanchandani
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background can provide information regarding physics of the very early universe, more specifically, of the matter-radiation distribution of the inflationary era. Starting from the effective field theory of inflation, we use the Goldstone action to calculate the three point correlation function for the Goldstone field, whose results can be directly applied to the field describing the curvature perturbations around a de Sitter solution for the inflationary era. We then use the data from the recent Planck mission for the parameters $f_{NL}^{equil}$ and $f_{NL}^{orthog}$ which parametrize the size and shape of non-Gaussianities generated in single field models of inflation. Using these known values, we calculate the parameters relevant to our analysis, $f_{NL}^{\dot{\pi}^3}$, $f_{NL}^{\dot{\pi}(\partial _i \pi)^2}$ and the speed of sound $c_s$ which parametrize the non-Gaussianities arising from two different kinds of generalized interactions of the scalar field in question.
