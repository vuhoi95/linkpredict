Title: The laws of thermodynamics and information for emergent cosmology
Authors: M. Hashemi and S. Jalalzadeh and S. Vasheghani Farahani
Abstract: The aim here is to provide a set of equations for cosmology in terms of information and thermodynamical parameters. The method we implement in order to describe the universe is a development of Padmanabhan\rq{}s approach which is based on the fact that emergence of the cosmic space is provided by the evolution of the cosmic time. In this line we obtain the Friedmann equation or its equivalent the conservation law in terms of information by the implementation of Laundauer\rq{}s principle or in other words the information loss/production rate. Hence, a self consistent description of the universe is provided in terms of thermodynamical parameters. This is due to the fact that in this work the role of information which is the most important actor of all times, has stepped in to cosmology. We provide a picture of the emergent cosmology merely based on the information theory. In addition, we introduce a novel entropy on the horizon, which can also generalize Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the asymptotic holographic principle.
