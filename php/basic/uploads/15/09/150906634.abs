Title: Compact Lumps
Authors: D. Bazeia and M. A. Marques and R. Menezes
Abstract: We study the presence of lumplike solutions in models described by a single real scalar field with standard kinematics in two-dimensional spacetime. The results show several distinct models that support the presence of bell-shaped, lumplike structures which may live in a compact space.
