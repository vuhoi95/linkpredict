Title: A note on a mimetic scalar-tensor cosmological model
Authors: Yevgeniya Rabochaya and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: A specific Horndeski scalar-gravity mimetic model is investigated within a FLWR space-time. The mimetic scalar field is implemented via a Lagrangian multiplier, and it is shown that the model has equations of motion formally similar to the original simpler mimetic matter model of Chamseddine-Mukhanov-Vikman. Several exact solutions describing inflation, bounces, future time singularities are presented and discussed.
