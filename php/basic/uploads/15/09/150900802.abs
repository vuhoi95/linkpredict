Title: Scalar Perturbations of Nonlinear Charged Lifshitz Black Branes with  Hyperscaling Violation
Authors: P. A. González and Yerko Vásquez
Abstract: We study scalar perturbations of nonlinear charged Lifshitz black branes with hyperscaling violating factor, and we find numerically the quasinormal modes for scalar fields. Then, we study the stability of these black branes under massive and massless scalar field perturbations. Also, we consider different values of the dynamical exponent, the nonlinear exponent and the hyperscaling violating exponent.
