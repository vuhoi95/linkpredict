Title: Oscillating and Static Universes from a Single Barotropic Fluid
Authors: John Kehayias and Robert J. Scherrer
Abstract: We consider cosmological solutions to general relativity with a single barotropic fluid, where the pressure is a general function of the density, $p = f(\rho)$. We derive conditions for static and oscillating solutions and provide examples, extending earlier work to these simpler and more general single-fluid cosmologies. Generically we expect such solutions to suffer from instabilities, through effects such as quantum fluctuations or tunneling to zero size. We also find a classical instability ("no-go" theorem) for oscillating solutions of a single barotropic perfect fluid due to a necessarily negative squared sound speed.
