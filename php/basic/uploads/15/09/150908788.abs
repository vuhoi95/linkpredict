Title: Recent results in CDT quantum gravity
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Daniel Coumbe and Jakub Gizbert-Studnicki and Jerzy Jurkiewicz
Abstract: We review some recent results from the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) approach to quantum gravity. We review recent observations of dimensional reduction at a number of previously undetermined points in the parameter space of CDT, and discuss their possible relevance to the asymptotic safety scenario. We also present an updated phase diagram of CDT, discussing properties of a newly discovered phase and its possible relation to a signature change of the metric.
