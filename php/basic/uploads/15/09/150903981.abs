Title: Torsional chiral magnetic effect in Weyl semimetal with topological  defect
Authors: Hiroaki Sumiyoshi and Satoshi Fujimoto
Abstract: We propose a torsional response raised by lattice dislocation in Weyl semimetals akin to chiral magnetic effect; i.e. a fictitious magnetic field arising from screw or edge dislocation induces charge current. We demonstrate that, in sharp contrast to the usual chiral magnetic effect which vanishes in real solid state materials, the torsional chiral magnetic effect exists even for realistic lattice models, which implies the experimental detection of the effect via SQUID or nonlocal resistivity measurements in Weyl semimetal materials.
