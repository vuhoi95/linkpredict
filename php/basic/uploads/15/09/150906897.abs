Title: Euler Sequence and Koszul complex of a module
Authors: Bjorn Andreas and Darío Sánchez Gómez and Fernando Sancho de Salas
Abstract: We construct relative and global Euler sequences of a module. We apply it to prove some acyclicity results of the Koszul complex of a module and to compute the cohomology of the sheaves of (relative and absolute) differential $p$-forms of a projective bundle. In particular we generalize Bott's formula for the projective space to a projective bundle over a scheme of characteristic zero.
