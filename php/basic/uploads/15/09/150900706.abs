Title: The cosmological constant from the zero point energy of compact  dimensions
Authors: Vikram Soni and Naresh Dadhich and Rathin Adhikari
Abstract: We consider extra compact dimensions as the origin of a cosmological universal energy density in the regular dimensions, with only graviton fields propagating in the compact space dimensions. The quantum zero point energy originating from the finite size boundary condition in the compact dimensions can produce a constant energy density in regular $3$ space which is homogeneous and isotropic. It then makes a natural identification with the cosmological constant in conformity with the Einstein equation. It turns out that for the emergent energy density to agree with the observed value of the cosmological constant, the size/radius of compact dimension is to be of order of $10^{-2}$ cm.
