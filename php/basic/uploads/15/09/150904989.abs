Abstract: We have studied the existence of topological self-dual configurations in a nonminimal CPT-odd and Lorentz-violating (LV) Maxwell-Higgs model, where the LV interaction is introduced by modifying the minimal covariant derivative. The Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield formalism has been implemented, revealing that the scalar self-interaction implying self-dual equations contains a derivative coupling. The CPT-odd self-dual equations describe electrically neutral configurations with finite total energy proportional to the total magnetic flux, which differ from the charged solutions of other CPT-odd and LV models previously studied. In particular, we have investigated the axially symmetrical self-dual vortex solutions altered by the LV parameter. For large distances, the profiles possess general behavior similar to the vortices of Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen. However, within the vortex core, the profiles of the magnetic field and energy can differ substantially from ones of the Maxwell-Higgs model depending if the LV parameter is negative or positive.
