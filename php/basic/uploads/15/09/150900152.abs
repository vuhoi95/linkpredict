Title: Near horizon symmetry and entropy of black holes in $f(R)$ gravity and  conformal gravity
Authors: Jun Li and Kun Meng and Liu Zhao
Abstract: We generalize the Noether current method proposed by Majhi and Padmanabhan recently to $f(R)$ gravity and conformal gravity and analyze the near horizon symmetry of black holes in these models. It is shown that the entropy obtained with Cardy's formula agrees with Wald entropy.
