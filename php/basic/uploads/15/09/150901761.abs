Title: Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Exponentially Small Bjorken Parameter  Regime from the Holographic Softwall Model
Authors: Eduardo Folco Capossoli and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence and the holographic softwall model to investigate the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) in the exponentially small $x$ (Bjorken Parameter) regime. We calculate the corresponding structure functions for scalar fields. Using these results we studied the problem of the saturation line in the strong interactions. Our results are consistent with those achieved using other models.
