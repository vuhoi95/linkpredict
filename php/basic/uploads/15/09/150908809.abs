Title: Chern--Simons--Yang--Mills system in presence of Gribov horizon with  fundamental Higgs matter
Authors: Arturo J. Gomez and Sebastian Gonzalez and Silvio P. Sorella
Abstract: In this work we study the behaviour of Yang--Mills--Chern--Simons theory coupled to a Higgs field in the fundamental representation by taking into account the effects of the presence of the Gribov horizon. By analyzing the infrared structure of the gauge field propagator, both confined and de-confined regions can be detected. The confined region corresponds to the appearance of complex poles in the propagators, while the de-confined one to the presence of real poles. One can move from one region to another by changing the parameters of the theory.
