Title: Weak Measurements, Quantum State Collapse and the Born Rule
Authors: Apoorva Patel and Parveen Kumar
Abstract: Projective measurement is used as a fundamental axiom in quantum mechanics, even though it is discontinuous and cannot predict which measured operator eigenstate will be observed in which experimental run. The probabilistic Born rule gives it an ensemble interpretation, predicting proportions of various outcomes over many experimental runs. Understanding gradual weak measurements requires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the collapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We revisit the framework to model quantum measurement as a continuous nonlinear stochastic process. It combines attraction towards the measured operator eigenstates with white noise, and for a specific ratio of the two reproduces the Born rule. We emphasise some striking features this result, which would be important ingredients for obtaining quantum measurement as an effective process of an underlying theory.
