Title: Black Holes and Thunderbolt Singularities with Lifshitz Scaling Terms
Authors: Yosuke Misonoh and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We study a static, spherically symmetric and asymptotic flat spacetime, assuming the hypersurface orthogonal Einstein-aether theory with an ultraviolet modification motivated by the Horava-Lifshitz theory, which is composed of the $z=2$ Lifshitz scaling terms such as scalar combinations of a three-Ricci curvature and the acceleration of the aether field. For the case with the quartic term of the acceleration of the aether field, we obtain a two-parameter family of black hole solutions, which possess a regular universal horizon. While, if three-Ricci curvature squared term is joined in ultraviolet modification, we find a solution with a thunderbolt singularity such that the universal horizon turns to be a spacelike singularity.
