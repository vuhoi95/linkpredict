Abstract: We propose a new framework to represent the perturbative S-matrix which is well-defined for all quantum field theories of massless particles, constructed from tree-level amplitudes and integrable term-by-term. This representation is derived from the Feynman expansion through a series of partial fraction identities, discarding terms that vanish upon integration. Loop integrands are expressed in terms of "Q-cuts" that involve both off-shell and on-shell loop-momenta, defined with a precise contour prescription that can be evaluated by ordinary methods. This framework implies recent results found in the scattering equation formalism at one-loop, and it has a natural extension to all orders---even non-planar theories without well-defined forward limits or good ultraviolet behavior.
