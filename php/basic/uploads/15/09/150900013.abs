Title: A Precision Test of AdS/CFT with Flavor
Authors: Andreas Karch and Brandon Robinson and Christoph F. Uhlemann
Abstract: In this letter we put AdS/CFT dualities involving probe branes to a precision test. On the holographic side we use a new class of supersymmetric D7-brane embeddings into AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, which allow to describe N=4 SYM coupled to massive N=2 supersymmetric flavors on S$^4$. With these embeddings we can compare holographic results to a field theory analysis of the free energy using supersymmetric localization. Localization allows us to get results at strong coupling, and hence to compare in detail to AdS/CFT. We find analytically matching results: a phase transition at the same critical mass in both calculations and matching free energies up to a scheme-dependent constant in both phases.
