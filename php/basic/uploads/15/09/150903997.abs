Title: Compton scattering in the Buchholz-Roberts framework of relativistic QED
Authors: Sabina Alazzawi and Wojciech Dybalski
Abstract: We consider a Haag-Kastler net in a positive energy representation, admitting massive Wigner particles and asymptotic fields of massless bosons. We show that states of the massive particles are always vacua of the massless asymptotic fields. Our argument is based on the Mean Ergodic Theorem in a certain extended Hilbert space. As an application of this result we construct the outgoing isometric wave operator for Compton scattering in QED in a class of representations recently proposed by Buchholz and Roberts. In the course of this analysis we use our new technique to further simplify scattering theory of massless bosons in the vacuum sector. A general discussion of the status of the infrared problem in the setting of Buchholz and Roberts is given.
