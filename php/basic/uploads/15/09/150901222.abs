Title: Exploring the thermodynamics of non-commutative scalar fields
Authors: Francisco A. Brito and Elisama E. M. Lima
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in the context of the quantum field theory with non-commutative target space. Our main goal is to investigate in which temperature and/or energy regimes the non-commutativity can characterize some influence in the BEC properties described by a relativistic massive non-commutative boson gas. The non-commutativity parameters play a key role in the modified dispersion relations of the non-commutative fields, leading to a new phenomenology. We have obtained the condensate fraction, internal energy, pressure and specific heat of the system and taken ultra-relativistic (UR) and non-relativistic limits (NR). The non-commutative effects in the thermodynamic properties of the system are discussed. We found that there appear interesting signatures around the critical temperature.
