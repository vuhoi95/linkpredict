Title: de Sitter vacuum from $R^2$ supergravity
Authors: Fuminori Hasegawa and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We propose a supergravity model with a constrained curvature multiplet, which realizes the Starobinsky inflation and the de Sitter vacuum in the present universe simultaneously. Surprisingly, at the vacuum, the soft supersymmetry breaking scale for minimal supersymmetric standard model sector becomes the TeV scale, however, the gravitino mass scale becomes much higher than that of soft supersymmetry breaking. Such a hierarchical structure, which naturally avoids the gravitino problem, appears without introducing a new scale other than inflation scale.
