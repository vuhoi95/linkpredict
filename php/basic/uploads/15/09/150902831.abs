Title: Three-point correlation functions from pulsating strings in AdS$_5\times  S^5$
Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: One of the most important problems in any conformal field theory is the calculation of three-point functions of primary operators. In this paper we provide explicit examples of correlators with two scalar operators in $\,{\cal N}=4$ super-Yang--Mills theory at large $N$, corresponding to pulsating semiclassical strings in AdS$_5\times S^5$, and an operator with small quantum numbers at strong coupling.
