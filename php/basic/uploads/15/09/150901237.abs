Title: Existence of traversable wormholes in the spherical stellar systems
Authors: A. Övgün and M. Halilsoy
Abstract: Potentiality of the presence of traversable wormholes in the outer/inner regions of the halos of galaxies, situated on the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile and Universal Rotation Curve (URC) dark matter models have been investigated recently. Since this covers our own galaxy also as a possible home for traversable wormholes it prompts us to further the subject by considering alternative density distributions. From this token herein we make use of the Einasto model to describe the density profiles for the same purpose. Our choice for the latter is based on the fact that theoretical dark matter halos produced in computer simulations are best described by such a profile. For technical reasons we trim the number of parameters in the Einasto profile to a possible minimum. Based on such a model it is shown that traversable wormholes in the outer regions of spiral galaxies are possible while the inner part regions prohibit such formations.
