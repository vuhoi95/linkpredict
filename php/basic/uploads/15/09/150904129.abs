Title: Black holes and wormholes subject to conformal mappings
Authors: Valerio Faraoni and Angus Prain and Andres F. Zambrano Moreno
Abstract: Solutions of the field equations of theories of gravity which admit distinct conformal frame representations can look very different in these frames. We show that Brans class IV solutions describe wormholes in the Jordan frame (in a certain parameter range) but correspond to horizonless geometries in the Einstein frame. The reasons for such a change of behaviour under conformal mappings are elucidated in general, using Brans IV solutions as an example.
