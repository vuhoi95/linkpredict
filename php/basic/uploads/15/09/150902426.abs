Title: Fusion for AdS/CFT boundary S-matrices
Authors: Rafael I. Nepomechie and Rodrigo A. Pimenta
Abstract: We propose a fusion formula for AdS/CFT worldsheet boundary S-matrices. We show that, starting from the fundamental Y=0 boundary S-matrix, this formula correctly reproduces the two-particle bound-state boundary S-matrices.
