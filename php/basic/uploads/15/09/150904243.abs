Title: Designer black holes from new 2D gravity
Authors: Gabor Kunstatter and Hideki Maeda and Tim Taves
Abstract: We present a family of extensions of spherically symmetric Einstein-Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. The field equations are second order and obey a generalized Birkhoff's theorem. The Hamiltonian constraint can be written in terms of a generalized Misner-Sharp mass function that determines the form of the vacuum solution. The action can be designed to yield interesting non-singular black-hole spacetimes as the unique vacuum solutions, including the Hayward black hole as well as a completely new one. The new theories therefore provide a consistent starting point for studying the formation and evaporation of non-singular black holes as a possible resolution to the black hole information loss conundrum.
