Title: On the decoupling of heavy states in higher-derivative supersymmetric  field theories
Authors: M. Cvetic and T. Mariz and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We study the problem of decoupling of heavy chiral superfields in four-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetric field theories with Lorentz-invariant and Lorentz-violating higher-derivative terms. We demonstrate that the earlier found effect of large logarithmic quantum corrections, due to heavy chiral superfields, takes place not only if the theory possesses quantum divergences, but also for essentially finite theories involving higher derivative terms, both Lorentz-invariant and Lorentz-breaking ones.
