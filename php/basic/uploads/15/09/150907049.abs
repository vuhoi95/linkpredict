Title: Warping the Weak Gravity Conjecture
Authors: Karta Kooner and Susha Parameswaran and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: The Weak Gravity Conjecture, if valid, rules out simple models of Natural Inflation by restricting their axion decay constant to be sub-Planckian. We revisit stringy attempts to realise Natural Inflation, with a single open string axionic inflaton from D-branes in a warped throat. We show that warping allows the requisite super-Planckian axion decay constant to be achieved consistently with the Weak Gravity Conjecture. However, there is a tension between large axion decay constant and high string scale, where the requisite high string scale is difficult to achieve in all attempts to realise large field inflation using perturbative string theory. We comment on the Generalized Weak Gravity Conjecture in the light of our results.
