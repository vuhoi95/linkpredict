Title: Self-consistent solitons for vacuum decay in radiatively generated  potentials
Authors: Bjorn Garbrecht and Peter Millington
Abstract: We use a Green's function approach in order to develop a method for calculating the tunneling rate between radiatively-generated non-degenerate vacua. We apply this to a model that exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, where we determine the self-consistent tunneling configuration and illustrate the impact of gradient effects that arise from accounting for the underlying space-time inhomogeneity.
