Abstract: We analyze the bosonic current densities induced by a magnetic flux running along an idealized cosmic string considering that the coordinate along its axis is compactified. We also consider the presence of a magnetic flux enclosed by the compactificatified axis. To develop this analysis, we calculate the complete set of normalized bosonic wave functions obeying a quasiperiodicity condition along the compactified dimension. We show that in this context only the azimuthal and axial currents take place.
