Abstract: We consider the relation between exact solutions of cosmological models having minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar fields. This is done for a particular class of solvable models which, in the Einstein frame, have potentials depending on hyperbolic functions and in the Jordan frame, where the non-minimal coupling is conformal, possess a relatively simple dynamics. We show that a particular model in this class can be generalized to the cases of closed and open Friedmann universes and still exhibits a simple dynamics. Further we illustrate the conditions for the existences of bounces in some sub-classes of the set of integrable models we have considered.
