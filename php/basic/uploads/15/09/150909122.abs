Title: On selfdual spin-connections and Asymptotic Safety
Authors: Ulrich Harst and Martin Reuter
Abstract: We explore Euclidean quantum gravity using the tetrad field together with a selfdual or anti-selfdual spin-connection as the basic field variables. Setting up a functional renormalization group (RG) equation of a new type which is particularly suitable for the corresponding theory space we determine the non-perturbative RG flow within a two-parameter truncation suggested by the Holst action. We find that the (anti-)selfdual theory is likely to be asymptotically safe. The existing evidence for its non-perturbative renormalizability is comparable to that of Einstein-Cartan gravity without the selfduality condition.
