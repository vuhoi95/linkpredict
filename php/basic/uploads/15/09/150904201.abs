Title: A Problem With delta-functions: Stress-Energy Constraints on Bulk-Brane  Matching (with comments on arXiv:1508.01124)
Authors: C. P. Burgess and Ross Diener and M. Williams
Abstract: We critically assess a recent assertion (arXiv:1508.01124) concerning using delta-functions to analyze how higher-codimension branes back-react on their environment. We also briefly summarize the state of the art: describing how stress-energy balance dictates the components of off-brane stress energy in terms brane tension; how this can modify the standard tension/defect-angle relation for codimension-two sources when dilatons are present; and how it all relates to extra-dimensional searches for a small cosmological constant.
