Title: Exotic Hadrons and Underlying Z_{2,3} Symmetries
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Salah Eddine Ennadifi and Moulay Brahim Sedra
Abstract: The recent observation of higher quark combinations, tetraquarks and pentaquarks, is a strong indication of more exotic hadrons. Using Z_{2} and Z_{3} symmetries and standard model data, a general quark combination producing new hadronic states is proposed in terms of polygon geometries according to the Dynkin diagrams of \widehat{A}_{n} affine Lie algebras. It has been shown that Z_{\mathbf{2,3}} invariance is crucial in the determination of the mesonic or the baryonic nature of these states. The hexagonal geometry is considered in some details producing both mesonic and baryonic states. A general class of this family is also presented.
