Title: Worldsheet dilatation operator for the $AdS$ superstring
Authors: Israel Ramirez and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: In this work we propose a systematic way to compute the logarithmic divergences of composite operators in the pure spinor description of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring. The computations of these divergences can be summarized in terms of a dilatation operator acting on the local operators. We check our results with some important composite operators of the formalism.
