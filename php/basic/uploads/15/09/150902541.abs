Title: Scale-dependent CMB power asymmetry from primordial speed of sound and a  generalized $Î´$N formalism
Authors: Dong-Gang Wang and Yi-Fu Cai and Wen Zhao and Yang Zhang
Abstract: We explore a plausible mechanism that the hemispherical power asymmetry in the CMB is produced by the spatial variation of the primordial sound speed parameter. We suggest that in a generalized approach of the $\delta N$ formalism the local e-folding number may depend on some other primordial parameters besides the initial values of inflaton. Here the $\delta N$ formalism is extended by considering the effects of a spatially varying sound speed parameter caused by a super-Hubble perturbation of a light field. Using this generalized $\delta N$ formalism, we systematically calculate the asymmetric primordial spectrum in the model of multi-speed inflation by taking into account the constraints of primordial non-Gaussianities. We further discuss specific model constraints, and the corresponding asymmetry amplitudes are found to be scale-dependent, which can accommodate current observations of the power asymmetry at different length scales.
