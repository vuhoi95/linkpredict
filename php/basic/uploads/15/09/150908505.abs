Title: Free energy of topologically massive gravity and flat space holography
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Wout Merbis
Abstract: We calculate the free energy from the on-shell action for topologically massive gravity with negative and vanishing cosmological constant, thereby providing a first principles derivation of the free energy of BTZ black holes and flat space cosmologies. We summarize related recent checks of flat space holography.
