Title: Application of AdS/QCD to B physics
Authors: Mohammad Ahmady and SÃ©bastien Lord and Ruben Sandapen
Abstract: We build on the success of AdS/QCD in predicting diffractive $\rho$ meson production to obtain the transition form factors for B decays to light mesons. Consequently, we predict several observables associated with $B\to \rho\ell\nu$ semileptonic and $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ dileptonic decays. Our predictions are compared to the available experimental data.
