Title: Nonsingular Black Holes in $f(R)$ Theories
Authors: Gonzalo J. Olmo and D. Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: We study the structure of a family of static, spherically symmetric space-times generated by an anisotropic fluid and governed by a particular type of $f(R)$ theory. We find that for a range of parameters with physical interest, such solutions represent black holes with the central singularity replaced by a finite size wormhole. We show that time-like geodesics and null geodesics with nonzero angular momentum never reach the wormhole throat due to an infinite potential barrier. For null radial geodesics, it takes an infinite affine time to reach the wormhole. This means that the resulting space-time is geodesically complete and, therefore, nonsingular despite the generic existence of curvature divergences at the wormhole throat.
