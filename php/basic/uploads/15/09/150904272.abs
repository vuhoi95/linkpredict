Title: Flat-space Quantum Gravity in AdS/CFT
Authors: Yasunori Nomura and Fabio Sanches and Sean J. Weinberg
Abstract: Motivated by the task of understanding microscopic dynamics of an evolving black hole, we present a scheme describing gauge-fixed continuous time evolution of quantum gravitational processes in asymptotically flat spacetime using the algebra of CFT operators. This allows us to study the microscopic dynamics of the Hawking emission process, although obtaining a full S-matrix may require a modification of the minimal scheme. The role of the operator product expansion is to physically interpret the resulting time evolution by decomposing the Hilbert space of the states for the entire system into those for smaller subsystems. We translate the picture of an evaporating black hole previously proposed by the authors into predictions for nonperturbative properties of the CFTs that have weakly coupled dual gravitational descriptions. We also discuss a possible relationship between the present scheme and a reference frame change in the bulk.
