Title: Fractal dimensions of self-avoiding walks and Ising high-temperature  graphs in 3D conformal bootstrap
Authors: Hirohiko Shimada and Shinobu Hikami
Abstract: The fractal dimensions of polymer chains and high-temperature graphs in the Ising model both in three dimension are determined using the conformal bootstrap applied for the continuation of the $O(N)$ models from $N=1$ (Ising model) to $N=0$ (polymer). The unitarity bound below $N=1$ of the scaling dimension for the the $O(N)$-symmetric-tensor develops a kink as a function of the fundamental field as in the case of the energy operator dimension in the Ising model. Although this kink structure becomes less pronounced as $N$ tends to zero, an emerging asymmetric minimum in the current central charge $C_J$ can be used to locate the CFT. It is pointed out that certain level degeneracies at the $O(N)$ CFT should induce these singular shapes of the unitarity bounds. As an application to the quantum and classical spin systems, we also predict critical exponents associated with the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, which could be relevant for locating the correspoinding fixed point in the phase diagram.
