Title: De Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan from multi Matrix Systems
Authors: Mthokozisi Masuku and Jo√£o P. Rodrigues
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanics of an even number of space indexed hermitian matrices. Upon complexification, we show that a closed subsector naturally parametrized by a matrix valued radial coordinate has a description in terms of non interacting $s$-state "radial fermions" with an emergent De Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan type potential, present only for two or more complex matrices. The concomitant $AdS_2$ symmetry is identified. The large $N$ description in terms of the density of radial eigenvalues is also described.
