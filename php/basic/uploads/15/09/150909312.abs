Title: Anyonic glueballs from an effective-string model
Authors: Fabien Buisseret and Nicolas Boulanger
Abstract: Relying on an effective-string approach in which glueballs --- bound states of pure Yang-Mills theory --- are modelled by closed strings, we give arguments suggesting that anyonic glueballs, \textit{i.e.} glueballs with arbitrary spin, may exist in $(2+1)$-$\,$dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We then focus on the large$\,$-$N_c$ limit of $SU$($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory and show that our model leads to a mass spectrum in good agreement with lattice data in the scalar sector, while it predicts the masses and spins of anyonic glueball states.
