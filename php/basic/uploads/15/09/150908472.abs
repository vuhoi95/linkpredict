Title: Interior of Black Holes and Information Recovery
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Yuki Yokokura
Abstract: We analyze time evolution of a spherically symmetric collapsing matter from a point of view that black holes evaporate by nature. We first consider a spherical thin shell that falls in the metric of an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole of which the radius $a(t)$ decreases in time. The important point is that the shell can never reach $a(t)$ but it approaches $a(t)-a(t)\frac{d a(t)}{d t}$. This situation holds at any radius because the motion of a shell in a spherically symmetric system is not affected by the outside. In this way, we find that the collapsing matter evaporates without forming a horizon. Nevertheless, a Hawking-like radiation is created in the metric, and the object looks the same as a conventional black hole from the outside. We then discuss how the information of the matter is recovered. We also consider a black hole that is adiabatically grown in the heat bath and obtain the interior metric. We show that it is the self-consistent solution of $G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G \langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ and that the four-dimensional Weyl anomaly induces the radiation and a strong angular pressure. Finally, we analyze the internal structures of the charged and the slowly rotating black holes.
