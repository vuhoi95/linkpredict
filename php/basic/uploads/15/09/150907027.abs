Abstract: In this paper, we will analyse the cosmological models in Einstein-aether gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity in which a time-like vector field breaks the Lorentz symmetry. We will use this formalism to analyse different cosmological models with different behavior of the scale factor. In this analysis, we will use a certain functional dependence of the dark energy on the Hubble parameter. It will be demonstrated that the aether vector field has a non-trivial effect on these cosmological models. We will also perform the \emph{Om} diagnostic in Einstein-aether gravity. Thus, we will fit parameters of the cosmological models using recent observational data.
