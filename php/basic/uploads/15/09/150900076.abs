Title: Alternative derivation of Krasnov's action for general relativity
Authors: Mariano Celada and Diego Gonzalez and Merced Montesinos
Abstract: Starting from Plebanski's action for general relativity with cosmological constant, we show that by integrating out all the auxiliary fields Krasnov's action immediately emerges. We also perform the Hamiltonian analysis of the latter and show that the constraints are those of the Ashtekar formalism.
