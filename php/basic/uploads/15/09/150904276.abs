Title: Gauge theory on projective surfaces and anti-self-dual Einstein metrics  in dimension four
Authors: Maciej Dunajski and Thomas Mettler
Abstract: Given a projective structure on a surface N, we show how to canonically construct a neutral signature Einstein metric with non-zero scalar curvature on the total space M of a certain rank 2 affine bundle M->N. The resulting Einstein metric has anti-self-dual conformal curvature and admits a parallel field of anti-self-dual planes. We show that Einstein metrics arising from this construction admit smooth deformations to Ricci--flat metrics if the corresponding projective structures admit a representative connection with totally skew-symmetric Ricci tensor. The homogeneous Einstein metric corresponding to the flat projective structure on RP^2 is the non-compact real form of the Fubini-Study metric on M=SL(3, R)/GL(2, R). Our construction is a combination of the Cartan and tractor bundle approaches to projective differential geometry with a projectively invariant gauge theory of a connection and a pair of Higgs fields developed by Calderbank.
