Title: Stress-tensor OPE in N=2 Superconformal Theories
Authors: Pedro Liendo and Israel Ramirez and Jihye Seo
Abstract: We carry out a detailed superspace analysis of the OPE of two N=2 stress-tensor multiplets. Knowledge of the multiplets appearing in the expansion, together with the two-dimensional chiral algebra description of N=2 SCFTs, imply an analytic bound on the central charge c. This bound is valid for any N=2 SCFT regardless of its matter content and flavor symmetries, and is saturated by the simplest Argyres-Douglas fixed point. We also present a partial conformal block analysis for the scalar superconformal primary of the multiplet.
