Abstract: Motivated by a recent work on asymptotically AdS_4 black holes in M-theory, we investigate the thermodynamics and thermodynamical geometry of AdS black holes from M2 and M5-branes. Concretely, we consider AdS black holes in AdS_{p+2}\times S^{11-p-2}, where p=2,5 by interpreting the number of M2 (and M5-branes) as a thermodynamical variable. We study the corresponding phase transition to examine their stabilities by calculating and discussing various thermodynamical quantities including the chemical potential. Then, we compute the thermodynamical curvatures from the Quevedo metric for M2 and M5-branes geometries to reconsider the stability of such black objects. The Quevedo metric singularities recover similar stability results provided by the phase transition program.
