Title: Pati-Salam Unification from Non-commutative Geometry and the TeV-scale  $W_R$ boson
Authors: Ufuk Aydemir and Djordje Minic and Chen Sun and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We analyze the compatibility of the unified left-right symmetric Pati-Salam models motivated by non-commutative geometry and the TeV scale right-handed W boson suggested by recent LHC data. We find that the unification/matching conditions place conflicting demands on the symmetry breaking scales and that generating the required W_R mass and coupling is non-trivial.
