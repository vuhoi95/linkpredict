Title: On the Entanglement Between Interacting Scalar Field Theories
Authors: M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar and Ali Mollabashi
Abstract: We study "field space entanglement" in certain quantum field theories consisting of N number of free scalar fields interacting with each other via kinetic mixing terms. We present exact analytic expressions for entanglement end Renyi entropies between arbitrary number of scalar fields by which we could explore certain entanglement inequalities. Other entanglement measures such as mutual information and entanglement negativity have also been studied. We also give some comments about possible holographic realizations of such models.
