Title: N=(4,4) Vector Multiplets on Curved Two-Manifolds
Authors: Albion Lawrence and Masoud Soroush
Abstract: We study the necessary conditions for preserving N=(4,4) supersymmetry on curved 2d backgrounds, following the strategy of Dumitrescu, Festuccia, and Seiberg. We derive the transformation laws and invariant action for off-shell Abelian vector multiplets. An explicit solution of the supersymmetry conditions is found on the round two-sphere.
