Title: Four-dimensional Quantum Gravity with a Cosmological Constant from  Three-dimensional Holomorphic Blocks
Authors: Hal M. Haggard and Muxin Han and Wojciech Kami≈Ñski and Aldo Riello
Abstract: Prominent approaches to quantum gravity struggle when it comes to incorporating a positive cosmological constant in their models. Using quantization of a complex $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory we include a cosmological constant, of either sign, into a model of quantum gravity.
