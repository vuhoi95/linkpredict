Title: Constructing 1-cusped isospectral non-isometric hyperbolic 3-manifolds
Authors: Stavros Garoufalidis and Alan Reid
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of pairs of isospectral but non-isometric $1$-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds. These examples have infinite discrete spectrum and the same Eisenstein series. Our constructions are based on an application of Sunada's method in the cusped setting, and so in addition our pairs are finite covers of the same degree of a 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-orbifold (indeed manifold) and also have the same complex length-spectra. Finally we prove that any finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold isospectral to the figure-eight knot complement is homeomorphic to the figure-eight knot complement.
