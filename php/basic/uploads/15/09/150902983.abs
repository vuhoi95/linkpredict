Title: Finite coupling corrections to holographic predictions for hot QCD
Authors: Sebastian Waeber and Andreas Schaefer and Aleksi Vuorinen and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Finite 't Hooft coupling corrections to multiple physical observables in strongly coupled $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma are examined, in an attempt to assess the stability of the expansion in inverse powers of the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$. Observables considered include thermodynamic quantities, transport coefficients, and quasinormal mode frequencies. Although large $\lambda$ expansions for quasinormal mode frequencies are notably less well behaved than the expansions of other quantities, we find that a partial resummation of higher order corrections can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the results to the value of $\lambda$.
