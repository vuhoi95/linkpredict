Title: Quantization of Pseudoclassical Systems in the Schrodinger Realization
Authors: Theodore J. Allen and Donald Spector and Christopher Wilson
Abstract: We examine the quantization of pseudoclassical dynamical systems, models that have classically anticommuting variables, in the Schrodinger picture. We quantize these systems, which can be viewed as classical models of particle spin, using the Dirac-Gupta-Bleuler method as well as the reduced phase space method when applicable. We show that, with minimal modifications, the standard constructions of Schrodinger quantum mechanics for constrained systems work for pseudoclassical systems as well. In particular, we construct the space of spinors as physical wave functions of anticommuting variables.
