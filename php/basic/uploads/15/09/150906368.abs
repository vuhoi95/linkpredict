Title: Exploring the Minimal 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT
Authors: David Poland and Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: We study the conformal bootstrap constraints for 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories containing a chiral operator $\phi$ and the chiral ring relation $\phi^2=0$. Hints for a minimal interacting SCFT in this class have appeared in previous numerical bootstrap studies. We perform a detailed study of the properties of this conjectured theory, establishing that the corresponding solution to the bootstrap constraints contains a $\text{U}(1)_R$ current multiplet and estimating the central charge and low-lying operator spectrum of this theory.
