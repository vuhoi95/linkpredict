Title: A Compact Expression for Periodic Instantons
Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis and Clare O'Hara and Dmitri Zaitsev
Abstract: Instantons on various spaces can be constructed via a generalization of the Fourier transform called the ADHM-Nahm transform. An explicit use of this construction, however, involves rather tedious calculations. Here we derive a simple formula for instantons on a space with one periodic direction. It simplifies the ADHM-Nahm machinery and can be generalized to other spaces.
