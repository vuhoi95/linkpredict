Title: Perfect fluids with $Ï‰=\mathrm{const}$ as sources of scalar  cosmological perturbations
Authors: Maxim Eingorn and Ruslan Brilenkov
Abstract: In the given paper we make the suggesting itself generalization of a self-consistent first-order perturbation scheme, being suitable for all (sub-horizon and super-horizon) scales, which has been recently constructed for the concordance cosmological model and discrete presentation of matter sources, to the case of extended models with extra perfect fluids and continuous presentation. Namely, we derive a single equation determining the scalar perturbation and covering the whole space as well as define the corresponding universal Yukawa interaction range and demonstrate explicitly that the structure growth is suppressed at distances exceeding this fundamental range.
