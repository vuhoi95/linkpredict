Title: Fermionic Response in Finite-Density ABJM Theory with Broken Symmetry
Authors: Oliver DeWolfe and Steven S. Gubser and Oscar Henriksson and Christopher Rosen
Abstract: We calculate fermionic response in domain wall backgrounds of four-dimensional gauged supergravity interpolating between distinct stable AdS vacua. The backgrounds, found by Bobev et al., are holographically dual to zero-temperature states of ABJM theory at finite density for monopole charge and are similar to zero-temperature limits of holographic superconductors, but with a symmetry-breaking source as well. The condensed scalar mixes charged and neutral fields dual to composite fermionic operators in the Dirac equations. Both gapped and gapless bands of stable quasiparticles are found.
