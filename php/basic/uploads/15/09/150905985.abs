Authors: Xiao-Bao Xu and Gu-Qiang Li and Jie-Xiong Mo
Abstract: Entanglement temperature is an interesting quantity which relates the increased amount of entanglement entropy and energy for a weakly excited state in entanglement first-law, it is proportional to the inverse of the size of the entanglement subsystem and only depends on the shape of the entanglement region. We find the explicit formula of entanglement temperature for the general hyperscaling violation backgrounds with a strip-subsystem. We then investigate the entanglement temperature for a round ball-subsystem, we check that the entanglement temperature have a universal form when the hyperscaling violation exponent is near zero.
