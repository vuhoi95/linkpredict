Title: Permutation Orbifolds in the large N Limit
Authors: Alexandre Belin and Christoph A. Keller and Alexander Maloney
Abstract: The space of permutation orbifolds is a simple landscape of two dimensional CFTs, generalizing the well-known symmetric orbifolds. We consider constraints which a permutation orbifold with large central charge must obey in order to be holographically dual to a weakly coupled (but possibly stringy) theory of gravity in AdS. We then construct explicit examples of permutation orbifolds which obey these constraints. In our constructions the spectrum remains finite at large N, but differs qualitatively from that of symmetric orbifolds. We also discuss under what conditions the correlation functions factorize at large N and thus reduce to those of a generalized free field in AdS. We show that this happens not just for symmetric orbifolds, but also for permutation groups which act "democratically" in a sense which we define.
