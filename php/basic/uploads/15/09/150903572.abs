Title: Emergent geometry from random multitrace matrix models
Authors: B. Ydri and A. Rouag and K. Ramda
Abstract: A novel scenario for the emergence of geometry in random multitrace matrix models of a single hermitian matrix $M$ with unitary $U(N) $ invariance, i.e. without a kinetic term, is presented. In particular, the dimension of the emergent geometry is determined from the critical exponents of the disorder-to-uniform-ordered transition whereas the metric is determined from the Wigner semicircle law behavior of the eigenvalues distribution of the matrix $M$. If the uniform ordered phase is not sustained in the phase diagram then there is no emergent geometry in the multitrace matrix model.
