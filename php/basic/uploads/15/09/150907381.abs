Title: BPS Equations in Omega-deformed N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Yusuke Kanayama and Hiroaki Nakajima and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study supersymmetry of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions deformed in the Omega-background. We take the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the background so that two-dimensional super Poincare symmetry is recovered. We compute the deformed central charge of the superalgebra and study the 1/2 and 1/4 BPS states. We obtain the Omega-deformed 1/2 and 1/4 BPS dyon equations from the deformed supersymmetry transformation and the Bogomol'nyi completion of the energy.
