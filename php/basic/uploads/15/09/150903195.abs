Title: $S^1/T^2$ Compactifications of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ Theories and Brane  Webs
Authors: Kantaro Ohmori and Hiroyuki Shimizu
Abstract: We consider the circle and torus compactification of a certain subclass of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SCFTs which are Higgsable to the higher rank E-string theories. Using the T-duality between Type I' and Type IIB, we found that the $S^1$ compactification of the theories can be realized by 5-brane webs describing the 5d uplifting of a specified class S theory, generalizing the result by Benini, Benvenuti and Tachikawa. We checked the above result by calculating conformal and flavor central charges of the 4d torus compactified theory both from the tensor branch structure of the 6d theory and from the predicted class S description.
