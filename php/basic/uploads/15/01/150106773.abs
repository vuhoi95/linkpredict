Title: Strings from domain walls in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and  adjoint QCD
Authors: Mohamed M. Anber and Erich Poppitz and Tin Sulejmanpasic
Abstract: We study strings between static quarks in QCD with $n_f$ adjoint fermions, including $N=1$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM), in the calculable regime on $\mathbb R^3\times \mathbb S^1$. We find that they have many qualitatively new features not previously known. The difference from other realizations of abelian confinement is due to the composite nature of magnetic bions, whose Dirac quantum with fundamental quarks is two, and to the unbroken part of the Weyl group. In particular we show that strings are composed of two domain walls, that quarks are not confined on domain walls, that strings can end on domain walls, and that "Y" or "$\Delta$" baryons can form. We briefly discuss their lightest modes and decompactification limit.
