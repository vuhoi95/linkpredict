Title: Quantum mechanics on a curved Snyder space
Authors: S. Mignemi and R. Strajn
Abstract: We study the representations of the three-dimensional Euclidean Snyder-de Sitter algebra. This algebra generates the symmetries of a model admitting two fundamental scales (Planck mass and cosmological constant) and is invariant under the Born reciprocity for exchange of positions and momenta. Its representations can be obtained starting from those of the Snyder algebra, and exploiting the geometrical properties of the phase space, that can be identified with a Grassmannian manifold. Both the position and momentum operators turn out to have a discrete spectrum.
