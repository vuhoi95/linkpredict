Title: A general procedure to find ground state solutions for finite $N$  M(atrix) theory. Reduced models and SUSY quantum cosmology
Authors: J. L. López and O. Obregón
Abstract: We propose a general method to find exact ground state solutions to the SU($N$) invariant matrix model arising from the quantization of the 11-dimensional supermembrane action in the light-cone gauge. We illustrate the method by applying it to lower dimensional models and for the SU(2) group. This approach can be used to find ground state solutions to the complete 9-dimensional model and for any SU($N$) group. The supercharges and the constraints related to the SU(2) symmetry are the relevant operators and they generate a multicomponent wave function. In the procedure, the fermionic degrees of freedom are represented by means of Dirac-like gamma matrices. We exhibit a relation between these finite $N$ matrix theory ground state solutions and SUSY quantum cosmology wave functions giving a possible physical significance to the theory even for finite $N$
