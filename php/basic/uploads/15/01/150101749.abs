Title: Scale-invariant tensor spectrum from conformal gravity
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon
Abstract: We study cosmological tensor perturbations generated during de Sitter inflation in the conformal gravity with mass parameter $m^2=2H^2$. It turns out that tensor power spectrum is scale-invariant.
