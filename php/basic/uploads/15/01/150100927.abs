Title: Supersymmetrizing 5d instanton operators
Authors: Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Johannes Schmude
Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric version of instanton operators in five-dimensional Yang-Mills theories. This is possible by considering a five-dimensional generalization of the familiar four-dimensional topologically twisted theory, where the gauge configurations corresponding to instanton operators are supersymmetric.
