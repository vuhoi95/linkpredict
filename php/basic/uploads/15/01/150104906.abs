Title: Cosmological evolution of the gravitational entropy of the large-scale  structure
Authors: Giovanni Marozzi and Jean-Philippe Uzan and Obinna Umeh and Chris Clarkson
Abstract: We consider the entropy associated with the large-scale structure of the Universe in the linear regime, where the Universe can be described by a perturbed Friedmann-Lema\^itre spacetime. In particular, we compare two different definitions proposed in the literature for the entropy using a spatial averaging prescription. For one definition, the entropy of the large-scale structure for a given comoving volume always grows with time, both for a CDM and a $\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, while it diverges for a CDM model, it saturates to a constant value in the presence of a cosmological constant. The use of a light-cone averaging prescription in the context of the evaluation of the entropy is also discussed.
