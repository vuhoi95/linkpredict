Title: The entropy formula of black holes in Minimal Massive Gravity and its  application for BTZ black holes
Authors: M. R. Setare and H. Adami
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the entropy formula of black hole solutions of Minimal Massive Gravity (MMG) by Tachikawa method \cite{a}. Then we apply this formula for BTZ black hole solution. We find that the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified. The modification come from Chern-Simons (CS) term and new term in MMG. The contribution of CS term, which is proportional with inner radius of horizon is not new, but last term which is due to the new term of MMG, as usual is proportional to the outer radius of horizon and is new result. Then we show that the total entropy exactly can be reproduced by Cardy formula for entropy of the dual boundary CFT.
