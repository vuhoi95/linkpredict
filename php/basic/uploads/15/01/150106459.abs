Title: Magnetic oscillations in a holographic liquid
Authors: V. Giangreco M. Puletti and S. Nowling and L. Thorlacius and T. Zingg
Abstract: We present a holographic perspective on magnetic oscillations in strongly correlated electron systems via a fluid of charged spin 1/2 particles outside a black brane in an asymptotically anti-de-Sitter spacetime. The resulting back-reaction on the spacetime geometry and bulk gauge field gives rise to magnetic oscillations in the dual field theory, which can be directly studied without introducing probe fermions, and which differ from those predicted by Fermi liquid theory.
