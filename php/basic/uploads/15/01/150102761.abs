Title: F-theory Superspace
Authors: William D. Linch III and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We consider, at the linearized level, the superspace formulation of lower-dimensional F-theory. In particular, we describe the embedding of 3D Type II supergravity of the superstring, or 4D, N=1 supergravity of M-theory, into the corresponding F-theory in full detail, giving the linearized action and gauge transformations in terms of the prepotential. This manifestly supersymmetric formulation reveals some features not evident from a component treatment, such as Weyl and local S-supersymmetry invariances. The linearized multiplet appears as a super 3-form (just as that for the manifestly T-dual theory is a super 2-form), reflecting the embedding of M-theory (as the T-dual theory embeds Type II supergravity). We also give the embedding of matter multiplets into this superspace, and derive the F-constraint from the gauge invariance of the gauge invariance.
