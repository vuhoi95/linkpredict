Title: Vacuum stability of asymptotically safe gauge-Yukawa theories
Authors: Daniel F. Litim and Matin Mojaza and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We study the phase diagram and the stability of the ground state for certain four-dimensional gauge-Yukawa theories whose high-energy behaviour is controlled by an interacting fixed point. We also provide analytical and numerical results for running couplings, their crossover scales, the separatrix, and the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential. Classical and quantum stability of the vacuum is established.
