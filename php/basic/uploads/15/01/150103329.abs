Title: Infrared behavior of dynamical fermion mass generation in QED$_{3}$
Authors: Jing-Rong Wang and Guo-Zhu Liu and Chang-Jin Zhang
Abstract: Extensive investigations show that QED$_{3}$ exhibits dynamical fermion mass generation at zero temperature when the fermion flavor $N$ is sufficiently small. However, it seems difficult to extend the theoretical analysis to finite temperature. We study this problem by means of Dyson-Schwinger equation approach after considering the effect of finite temperature or disorder-induced fermion damping. Under the widely used instantaneous approximation, the dynamical mass displays an infrared divergence in both cases. We then adopt a new approximation that includes an energy-dependent gauge boson propagator and obtain results for dynamical fermion mass that do not contain infrared divergence. The validity of the new approximation is examined by comparing to the well-established results obtained at zero temperature.
