Title: A Note on Quantum Compactons
Authors: D. Bazeia and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: Compactons are solutions of the equations of motion that behave trivially outside a compact region. In general, the operators describing quantum fluctuations above compactons have singularities. However, we show that despite these singularities the quantum theory is well defined. As an example, we calculate the one-loop mass shift of a compacton in a model described by a single real scalar field.
