Title: The braneology of 3D dualities
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Davide Forcella and Claudius Klare and Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: In this paper we study the reduction of four-dimensional Seiberg duality to three dimensions from a brane perspective. We reproduce the non-perturbative dynamics of the three-dimensional field theory via a T-duality at finite radius and the action of Euclidean D-strings. In this way we also overcome certain issues regarding the brane description of Aharony duality. Moreover we apply our strategy to more general dualities, such as toric duality for M2-branes and dualities with adjoint matter fields.
