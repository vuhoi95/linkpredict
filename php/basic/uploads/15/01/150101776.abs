Title: Scale invariance implies conformal invariance for the three-dimensional  Ising model
Authors: Bertrand Delamotte and Matthieu Tissier and Nicol√°s Wschebor
Abstract: Using Wilson renormalization group, we show that if no integrated vector operator of scaling dimension $-1$ exists, then scale invariance implies conformal invariance. By using the Lebowitz inequalities, we prove that this necessary condition is fulfilled in all dimensions for the Ising universality class. This shows, in particular, that scale invariance implies conformal invariance for the three-dimensional Ising model.
