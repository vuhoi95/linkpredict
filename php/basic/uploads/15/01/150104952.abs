Title: Early thermalization, hydrodynamics and energy loss in AdS/CFT
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Wilke van der Schee
Abstract: Gauge/gravity duality has provided unprecedented opportunities to study dynamics in certain strongly coupled gauge theories. This review aims to highlight several applications to heavy ion collisions including far-from-equilibrium dynamics, hydrodynamics and jet energy loss at strong coupling.
