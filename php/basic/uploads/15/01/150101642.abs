Title: Anisotropies in Non-Thermal Distortions of Cosmic Light from  Photon-Axion Conversion
Authors: Guido D'Amico and Nemanja Kaloper
Abstract: Ultralight axions which couple sufficiently strongly to photons can leave imprints on the sky at diverse frequencies by mixing with cosmic light in the presence of background magnetic fields. We explore such direction dependent grey-body distortions of the CMB spectrum, enhanced by resonant conditions in the IGM plasma. We also find that if such axions are produced in the early universe and represent a subdominant dark radiation component today, they could convert into X-rays in supervoids, and brighten them at X-ray frequencies.
