Title: New remarks on DFR noncommutative phase-space
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and M. J. Neves and Vahid Nikoofard
Abstract: The so-called canonical noncommutativity is based on a constant noncommutative parameter ($\theta$). However, this formalism breaks Lorentz invariance and one way to recover it is to define the NC parameter as a variable, an extra coordinate of the system. One approach that uses the variable $\theta$ was developed by Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts (DFR) and hence, their phase-space is formed by $(x,p,\theta)$ with extra-dimensions. In this work we have demonstrated precisely that this phase-space is incomplete because the variable $\theta$ requires an associated momentum and the so-called DFR phase-space is in fact formed by $(x, p, \theta, \pi)$, where $\pi$ is an useful object. One of the models used here to demonstrate this fact brought other interesting results. We have used this complete phase-space to explain some undefined results in the $\theta$-variable literature. Finally, we have shown the importance of this DFR-momentum since with it we could fill the gap that exist in $\theta$-variable results. In other words, we have computed the field commutation relations of a QFT in this DFR phase-space. The results obtained here match exactly with the postulated (not demonstrated) values that dwell in the DFR literature.
