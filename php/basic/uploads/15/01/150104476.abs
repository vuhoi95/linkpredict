Title: On the Fourier coefficients of negative index meromorphic Jacobi forms
Authors: Kathrin Bringmann and Larry Rolen and Sander Zwegers
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Fourier coefficients of meromorphic Jacobi forms of negative index. This extends recent work of Creutzig and the first two authors for the special case of Kac-Wakimoto characters which occur naturally in Lie theory, and yields, as easy corollaries, many important PDEs arising in combinatorics such as the famous rank-crank PDE of Atkin and Garvan. Moreover, we discuss the relation of our results to partial theta functions and quantum modular forms as introducted by Zagier, which together with previous work on positive index meromorphic Jacobi forms illuminates the general structure of the Fourier coefficients of meromorphic Jacobi forms.
