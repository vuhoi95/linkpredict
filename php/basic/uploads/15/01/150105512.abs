Title: A Generalized Model for the Classical Relativistic Spinning Particle
Authors: Mehdi Hajihashemi and Ahmad Shirzad
Abstract: Following the Poincare algebra for a free spinning particle and using the Casimirs of the algebra in the Hamiltonian approach, we construct systematically a set of Lagrangians for the relativistic spinning particle which includes the Lagrangian given in the literature. Then we analyze the dynamics of this generalized system in the Lagrangian formulation and show that the equations of motion support an oscillatory solution corresponding to the spinning nature of the system. Next we analyze the canonical structure of the system and present the correct gauge suitable for the spinning motion of the system.
