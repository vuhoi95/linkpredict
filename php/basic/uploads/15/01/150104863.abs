Title: Thermodynamic instability of topological black holes with nonlinear  source
Authors: S. H. Hendi and M. Momennia
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain higher dimensional topological black hole solutions of Einstein-$\Lambda$ gravity in the presence of a class of nonlinear electrodynamics. First, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of ($n+1$)-dimensional asymptotically flat solutions and show that they satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Also, we investigate the stability of these solutions in the (grand) canonical ensemble. Second, we endow a global rotation to the static Ricci-flat solutions and calculate the conserved quantities of solutions by using the counterterm method. We obtain a Smarr-type formula for the mass as a function of the entropy, the angular momenta and the electric charge, and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Then, we perform a stability analysis of the rotating solutions both in the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles.
