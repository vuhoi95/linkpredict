Abstract: We propose the recently defined "Holoraumy Tensor" to play a critical role in defining a metric to establish a correspondence between 4D, N-extended 0-brane-based valise supermultiplet representations and, correspondingly via "SUSY Holography," on the space of 1D, 4N-extended network-based adinkras. Using an analogy with the su(3) algebra, it is argued the 0-brane holoraumy tensors plays the role of the "d-coefficients" and provides a newly established tool for investigating supersymmetric representation theory.
