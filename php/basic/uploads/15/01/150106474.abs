Title: Lifshitz field theories, Snyder noncomutative space-time and momentum  dependent metric
Authors: Juan M. Romero and J. David Vergara
Abstract: In this work, we propose three different modified relativistic particles. In the first case, we propose a particle with metrics depending on the momenta and we show that the quantum version of these systems includes different field theories, as Lifshitz field theories. As a second case we propose a particle that implies a modified symplectic structure and we show that the quantum version of this system gives different noncommutative space-times, for example the Snyder space-time. In the third case, we combine both structures before mentioned, namely noncommutative space-times and momentum dependent metrics. In this last case, we show that anisotropic field theories can be seen as a limit of noncommutative field theory.
