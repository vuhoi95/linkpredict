Title: Some Cosmological Consequences of Weyl Invariance
Authors: Enrique Álvarez and Sergio González-Martin and Mario Herrero-Valea
Abstract: We examine some Weyl invariant cosmological models in the framework of generalized dilaton gravity, in which the action is made of a set of $N$ conformally coupled scalar fields. It will be shown that when the FRW ansatz for the spacetime metric is assumed, the Ward identity for conformal invariance guarantees that the gravitational equations hold whenever the scalar fields EM do so. It follows that any scale factor can solve the theory provided a non-trivial profile for a dilaton field. In particular, accelerated expansion is a natural solution to the full set of equations.
