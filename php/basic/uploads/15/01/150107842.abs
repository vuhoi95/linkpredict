Title: Observations on the Partial Breaking of $N=2$ Rigid Supersymmetry
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio Ferrara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We study the partial breaking of $N=2$ rigid supersymmetry for a generic rigid special geometry of $n$ abelian vector multiplets in the presence of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms induced by the Hyper-K\"ahler momentum map. By exhibiting the symplectic structure of the problem we give invariant conditions for the breaking to occur, which rely on a quartic invariant of the Fayet-Iliopoulos charges as well as on a modification of the $N=2$ rigid symmetry algebra by a vector central charge.
