Title: Group manifold approach to higher spin theory
Authors: Shan Hu and Tianjun Li
Abstract: We consider the group manifold approach to higher spin theory. The deformed local higher spin transformation is realized as the diffeomorphism transformation in the group manifold $\textbf{M}$. With the suitable rheonomy condition and the torsion constraint imposed, the unfolded equation can be obtained from the Bianchi identity, by solving which, fields in $\textbf{M}$ are determined by the multiplet at one point, or equivalently, by $(W^{[a(s-1),b(0)]}_{\mu},H)$ in $AdS_{4}\subset \textbf{M}$. Although the space is extended to $\textbf{M}$ to get the geometrical formulation, the dynamical degrees of freedom are still in $AdS_{4}$. The $4d$ equations of motion for $(W^{[a(s-1),b(0)]}_{\mu},H)$ are obtained by plugging the rheonomy condition into the Bianchi identity. The proper rheonomy condition allowing for the maximum on-shell degrees of freedom is given by Vasiliev equation. We also discuss the theory with the global higher spin symmetry, which is in parallel with the WZ model in supersymmetry.
