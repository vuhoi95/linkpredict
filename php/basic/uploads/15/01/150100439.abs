Title: The Imaginary Potential and Thermal Width of Moving Quarkonium from  Holography
Authors: Kazem Bitaghsir Fadafan and Seyed Kamal Tabatabaei
Abstract: We study the effect of finite 't Hooft coupling corrections on the imaginary potential and the thermal width of a moving heavy quarkonium from the AdS/CFT correspondence. To study these corrections, we consider $\mathcal{R}^4$ terms and Gauss$-$Bonnet gravity. We conclude that the imaginary potential of a moving or static heavy quarkonium starts to be generated for smaller distances of quark and antiquark. Similar to the case of static heavy quarkonium, it is shown that by considering the corrections the thermal width becomes effectively smaller. The results are compared with analogous calculations in a weakly coupled plasma.
