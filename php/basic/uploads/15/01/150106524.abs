Title: Gravitational radiation-reaction in arbitrary dimension
Authors: Ofek Birnholtz and Shahar Hadar
Abstract: We use effective field theory tools to study non-conservative effects in systems of gravitating objects in general spacetime dimension. Using the classical version of the Closed Time Path formalism, we treat both the radiative gravitational field and its dynamical sources within a single action principle. New results include the radiation-reaction effective action in arbitrary dimensions to leading and +1PN orders, as well as the generalized Quadrupole formula to order +1PN.
