Title: A solution to the non-linear equations of D=10 super Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Oliver Schlotterer
Abstract: In this letter, we present a formal solution to the non-linear field equations of ten-dimensional super Yang--Mills theory. It is assembled from products of linearized superfields which have been introduced as multiparticle superfields in the context of superstring perturbation theory. Their explicit form follows recursively from the conformal field theory description of the gluon multiplet in the pure spinor superstring. Furthermore, superfields of higher mass dimensions are defined and their equations of motion spelled out.
