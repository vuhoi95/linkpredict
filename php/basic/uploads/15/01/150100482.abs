Title: Entanglement Hamiltonians for chiral fermions with zero modes
Authors: Israel Klich and Diana Vaman and Gabriel Wong
Abstract: In this Letter we study the effect of topological zero modes on entanglement Hamiltonians and entropy of free chiral fermion systems in (1+1)d. We show how Riemann-Hilbert solutions combined with finite rank perturbation theory allow us to obtain explicit expressions for entanglement Hamiltonians. We consider both chiral Majorana and Dirac fermions, and explore the effects of boundary conditions (periodic/anti-periodic for Majorana and generic for Dirac) and associated zero modes on entanglement. In the periodic sector, we derive explicitly the non-local contribution to the entanglement Hamiltonian due to the zero mode, and show an exact expression for the change in entanglement entropy due to the zero mode.
