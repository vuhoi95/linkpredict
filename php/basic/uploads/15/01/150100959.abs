Title: Superconformal Baryon-Meson Symmetry and Light-Front Holographic QCD
Authors: Hans Gunter Dosch and Guy F. de Teramond and Stanley J. Brodsky
Abstract: We construct an effective QCD light-front Hamiltonian for both mesons and baryons in the chiral limit based on the generalized supercharges of a superconformal graded algebra. The superconformal construction is shown to be equivalent to a semi-classical approximation to light-front QCD and its embedding in AdS space. The specific breaking of conformal invariance inside the graded algebra uniquely determines the effective confinement potential. The generalized supercharges connect the baryon and meson spectra to each other in a remarkable manner. In particular, the $\pi/b_1$ Regge trajectory is identified as the superpartner of the nucleon trajectory. However, the lowest-lying state on this trajectory, the $\pi$-meson is massless in the chiral limit and has no supersymmetric partner.
