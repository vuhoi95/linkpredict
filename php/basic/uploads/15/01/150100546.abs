Title: Application of Coherent State Approach for the cancellation of Infrared  divergences to all orders in LFQED
Authors: Jai More and Anuradha Misra
Abstract: We sketch an all order proof of cancellation of infrared (IR) divergences in Light Front Quantum Electrodynamics (LFQED) using a coherent state formalism. In this talk, it has been shown that the true IR divergences in fermion self energy are eliminated to all orders in a light-front time-ordered perturbative calculation if one uses coherent state basis instead of the usual Fock basis to calculate the Hamiltonian matrix elements.
