Title: Scaling theory of the cuprate strange metals
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We show that the anomalous temperature scaling of five distinct transport quantities in the strange metal regime of the cuprate superconductors can be reproduced with only two nontrivial critical exponents. The quantities are: (i) the electrical resistivity, (ii) the Hall angle, (iii) the Hall Lorenz ratio, (iv) the magnetoresistance and (v) the thermopower. The exponents are the dynamical critical exponent z = 4/3 and an anomalous scaling dimension Phi = -2/3 for the charge density operator.
