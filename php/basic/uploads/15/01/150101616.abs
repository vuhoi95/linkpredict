Title: Anti-FFBRST Transformations for the BLG Theory in Presence of a Boundary
Authors: Mir Faizal and Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani P. Mandal
Abstract: In this paper we will analyse the anti-BRST symmetries of Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory in presence of a boundary. We will analyses these symmetries in both linear and non-linear gauges. We will also derive the finite field version of the anti-BRST transformations for the BLG theory in presence of a boundary. These finite field transformations will be used to relate generating functional in linear gauge to the generating functional in the non-linear gauge.
