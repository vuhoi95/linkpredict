Title: General algorithm for non-relativistic diffeomorphism invariance
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Arpita Mitra and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: An algorithmic approach towards the formulation of non-relativistic diffeomorphism invariance has been developed which involves both matter and gauge fields. A step by step procedure has been provided which can accommodate all types of (abelian) gauge interaction. The algorithm is applied to the problem of a two dimensional electron moving under an external field and also under the Chern-Simons dynamics.
