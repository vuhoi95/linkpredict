Title: Charged Black Holes in Colored Lifshitz Spacetimes
Authors: Zhong-Ying Fan and H. Lu
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravities coupled to a cosmological constant and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in four and five dimensions. We find that the theories admit colored Lifshitz solutions with dynamic exponents $z>1$. We study the wave equations of the $SU(2)$ scalar triplet in the bulk, and find that the vacuum color modifies the scaling dimensions of the dual operators. We also introduce a Maxwell field and construct exact solutions of electrically-charged black holes that asymptote to the $D=4$, $z=3$ and $D=5$, $z=4$ colored Lifshitz spacetimes. We derive the thermodynamical first law for general colored and charged Lifshitz black holes.
