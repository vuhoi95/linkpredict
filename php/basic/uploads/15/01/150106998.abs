Title: p-wave Holographic Superconductors from Born-Infeld Black Holes
Authors: Pankaj Chaturvedi and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: We obtain (2+1) dimensional p-wave holographic superconductors from charged Born-Infeld black holes in the presence of massive charged vector fields in a bulk $AdS_4$ Einstein-Born-Infeld theory through the $AdS_4$-$CFT_3$ correspondence. Below a certain critical transition temperature the charged black hole develops vector hair that corresponds to charged vector condensate in the strongly coupled (2+1) dimensional boundary field theory that breaks both the $U(1)$ symmetry as well as the rotational invariance. The holographic free energy is computed for the boundary field theory which shows that the vector order parameter exhibits a rich phase structure involving zeroth order, first order, second order and retrograde phase transitions for different values of the backreaction and the Born-Infeld parameters. We numerically compute the ac conductivity for the p-wave superconducting phase of the strongly coupled (2+1) dimensional boundary field theory which also depends on the relative values of the parameters in the theory.
