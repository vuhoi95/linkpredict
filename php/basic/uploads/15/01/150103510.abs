Title: Local Invariants Vanishing on Stationary Horizons: A Diagnostic for  Locating Black Holes
Authors: Don N. Page and Andrey A. Shoom
Abstract: Inspired by the example of Abdelqader and Lake for the Kerr metric, we construct local scalar polynomial curvature invariants that vanish on the horizon of any stationary black hole: the squared norms of the wedge products of n linearly independent gradients of scalar polynomial curvature invariants, where n is the local cohomogeneity of the spacetime.
