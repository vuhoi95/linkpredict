Abstract: Based on certain assumptions for the expectation value of a product of the quantum fluctuating metric at two points, the gravitational and scalar field Lagrangians are evaluated. Assuming a vanishing expectation value of the first order terms of the metric, the calculations are performed with an accuracy of second order. It is shown that such quantum corrections give rise to modified gravity.
