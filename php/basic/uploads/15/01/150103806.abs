Title: Surface Tension and Negative Pressure Interior of a Non-Singular `Black  Hole'
Authors: Pawel O. Mazur and Emil Mottola
Abstract: The constant density interior Schwarzschild solution for a static, spherically symmetric collapsed star has a divergent pressure when its radius $R\le\frac{9}{8}R_s=\frac{9}{4}GM$. We show that this divergence is integrable, and induces a non-isotropic transverse stress with a finite redshifted surface tension on a spherical surface of radius $R_0=3R\sqrt{1-\frac{8}{9}\frac{R}{R_s}}$. For $r < R_0$ the interior Schwarzschild solution exhibits negative pressure. When $R=R_s$, the surface is localized at the Schwarzschild radius itself, $R_0=R_s$, and the solution has constant negative pressure $p =-\bar\rho$ everywhere in the interior $r<R_s$, thereby describing a gravitational condensate star, a fully collapsed non-singular state already inherent in and predicted by classical General Relativity. The redshifted surface tension of the condensate star surface is given by $\tau_s=\Delta\kappa/8\pi G$, where $\Delta\kappa=\kappa_+-\kappa_-=2\kappa_+=1/R_s$ is the difference of equal and opposite surface gravities between the exterior and interior Schwarzschild solutions. The First Law, $dM=dE_v+\tau_s dA$ is recognized as a purely mechanical classical relation at zero temperature and zero entropy, describing the volume energy and surface energy change respectively. Since there is no event horizon, the Schwarzschild time t of such a non-singular gravitational condensate star is a global time, fully consistent with unitary time evolution in quantum theory. The $p=-\bar\rho$ interior acts as a defocusing lens for light passing through the condensate, leading to imaging characteristics distinguishable from a classical black hole. A further observational test of gravitational condensate stars with a physical surface vs. black holes is the discrete surface modes of oscillation which should be detectable by their gravitational wave signatures.
