Title: ${\ell}$-oscillators from second-order invariant PDEs of the centrally  extended Conformal Galilei Algebras

Abstract: We construct, for any given ${\ell}=\frac{1}{2}+{\mathbb{N}}_0$, the second-order, linear PDEs which are invariant under the centrally extended Conformal Galilei Algebra. \par At the given ${\ell}$, two invariant equations in one time and ${\ell}+\frac{1}{2}$ space coordinates are obtained. The first equation possesses a continuum spectrum and generalizes the free Schr\"odinger equation (recovered for ${\ell}=\frac{1}{2}$) in $1+1$ dimension. The second equation (the "$\ell$-oscillator") possesses a discrete, positive spectrum. It generalizes the $1+1$-dimensional harmonic oscillator (recovered for $\ell=\frac{1}{2}$). The spectrum of the ${\ell}$-oscillator, derived from a specific $osp(1|2\ell+1)$ h.w.r., is explicitly presented.\par The two sets of invariant PDEs are determined by imposing (representation-dependent) {\it on-shell invariant conditions} both for {\it degree} $1$ operators (those with continuum spectrum) and for {\it degree } $0$ operators (those with discrete spectrum).\par The on-shell condition is better understood by enlarging the Conformal Galilei Algebras with the addition of certain second-order differential operators. Two compatible structures (the algebra/superalgebra duality) are defined for the enlarged set of operators.
