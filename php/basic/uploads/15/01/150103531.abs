Title: Gauge approach to superfluid density in underdoped cuprates
Authors: P. A. Marchetti and G. Bighin
Abstract: We prove that a gauge approach based on a composite structure of the hole in hole-doped cuprates is able to capture analytically many features of the experimental data on superfluid density in the moderate-underdoping to nearly-optimal doping region, including critical exponent, the Uemura relation and near universality of the normalized superfluid density.
