Abstract: We present a first look at the spectroscopy of SU(4) gauge theory coupled to two flavors of Dirac fermions in the two-index antisymmetric representation, which is a real representation. We compute meson and diquark masses, the pseudoscalar and vector meson decay constants, and the masses of six-quark baryons. We make comparisons with large-Nc expectations.
