Title: Gravitational collapse and formation of universal horizons
Authors: Miao Tian and Xinwen Wang and M. F. da Silva and Anzhong Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we first generalize the definition of stationary universal horizons to dynamical ones, and then show that (dynamical) universal horizons can be formed from realistic gravitational collapse. This is done by constructing analytical models of a collapsing spherically symmetric star with finite thickness in Einstein-aether theory.
