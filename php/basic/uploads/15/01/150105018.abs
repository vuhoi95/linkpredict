Title: Supersymmetric non conservative systems
Authors: N. E. Martínez-Pérez and C. Ramírez
Abstract: We give the generalization of a recent variational formulation for nonconservative classical mechanics, for fermionic and sypersymmetric systems. Both cases require slightly modified boundary conditions. The supersymmetric version is given in the superfield formalism. The corresponding Noether theorem is formulated. As expected, like the energy, the supersymmetric charges are not conserved.
