Title: Tinkertoys for the Twisted $E_6$ Theory
Authors: Oscar Chacaltana and Jacques Distler and Anderson Trimm
Abstract: We study $4D$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories that arise as the compactification of the six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theory of type $E_6$ on a punctured Riemann surface in the presence of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer-automorphism twists. We explicitly carry out the classification of these theories in terms of three-punctured spheres and cylinders, and provide tables of properties of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-twisted punctures. An expression is given for the superconformal index of a fixture with twisted punctures of type $E_6$, which we use to check our identifications. Several of our fixtures have Higgs branches which are isomorphic to instanton moduli spaces, and we find that S-dualities involving these fixtures imply interesting isomorphisms between hyperK\"ahler quotients of these spaces. Additionally, we find families of fixtures for which the Sommers-Achar group, which was previously a Coulomb branch concept, acts non-trivially on the Higgs branch operators.
