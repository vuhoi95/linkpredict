Title: Structures on the Conformal Manifold in Six Dimensional Theories
Authors: Hugh Osborn and Andreas Stergiou
Abstract: The tensors which may be defined on the conformal manifold for six dimensional CFTs with exactly marginal operators are analysed by considering the response to a Weyl rescaling of the metric in the presence of local couplings. It is shown that there are three symmetric two index tensors only one of which satisfies any positivity conditions. The general results are specialised to the six dimensional conformal theory defined by free two-forms and also to the interacting scalar $\phi^3$ theory at two loops which preserves conformal invariance to this order. All three two index tensor contributions are present.
