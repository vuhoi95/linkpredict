Abstract: Using AdS/CFT prescription, we compute two point Yang-Mills correlator on a constant time slice for the Kasner background. Pushing the surface close to the initial singularity, we find, in some cases, the correlator does not develop pole. This is consistent with the observations made in a recent work. We further numerically calculate similar correlator where the bulk is a Kasner AdS soliton. We find that the qualitative behaviour of the correlator remains unchanged.
