Title: Bifundamental Superfluids from Holography
Authors: Daniel Arean and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of a (2+1)-dimensional s-wave superfluid that breaks an abelian U(1) x U(1) global symmetry group to the diagonal U(1)_V. The model is inspired by Sen's tachyonic action, and the operator that condenses transforms in the bifundamental representation of the symmetry group. We focus on two configurations: the first one describes a marginal operator, and the phase diagram at finite temperature contains a first or a second order phase transition, depending on the parameters that determine the theory. In the second model the operator is relevant and the finite temperature transitions are always second order. In the latter case the conductivity for the current associated to the broken symmetry shows quasiparticle excitations at low temperatures, with mass given by the width of the superconducting gap. The suppression of spectral weight at low frequencies is also observed in the conductivity associated to the conserved symmetry, for which the DC value decreases as the temperature is reduced.
