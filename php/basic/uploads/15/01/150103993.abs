Title: Three-loop Correction to the Instanton Density. I. The Quartic Double  Well Potential
Authors: M. A. Escobar-Ruiz and E. Shuryak and A. V. Turbiner
Abstract: This paper deals with quantum fluctuations near the classical instanton configuration. Feynman diagrams in the instanton background are used for the calculation of the tunneling amplitude (the instanton density) in the three-loop order for quartic double-well potential. The result for the three-loop contribution coincides in six significant figures with one given long ago by J.~Zinn-Justin. Unlike the two-loop contribution where all involved Feynman integrals are rational numbers, in the three-loop case Feynman diagrams can contain irrational contributions.
