Title: N=1 superfield description of vector-tensor couplings in six dimensions
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We express supersymmetric couplings among the vector and the tensor multiplets in six dimensions (6D) in terms of N=1 superfields. The superfield description is derived from the invariant action in the projective superspace. The obtained expression is consistent with the known superfield actions of 6D supersymmetric gauge theory and 5D Chern-Simons theory after the dimensional reduction. Our result provides a crutial clue to the N=1 superfield description of 6D supergravity.
