Title: Exact three dimensional black hole with gauge fields in string theory
Authors: S. Hoseinzadeh and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We have obtained exact three dimensional BTZ type solutions with gauge fields, for string theory on a gauge symmetric gravitational background constructed from semi-simple extension of the Poincare algebra (and the Maxwell algebra) in 2 + 1 dimensions. We have studied the models for two non-Abelian and Abelian gauge fields solutions and shown that the related sigma models for each of these backgrounds is a SL(2;R) WZW (Wess-Zumino-Witten) model and that they are classically canonically equivalent. We have also obtained the dual solution for the Abelian case and by interpreting the new field strength tensors of the Abelian solution as electromagnetic field strength tensors shown that dual models coincide with the charged black string solution.
