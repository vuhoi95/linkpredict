Title: Violation of the strong Huygen's principle and timelike signals from the  early Universe
Authors: Ana Blasco and Luis J. Garay and Mercedes Martin-Benito and Eduardo Martin-Martinez
Abstract: We analyze the implications of the violations of the strong Huygens principle in the transmission of information from the early universe to the current era via massless fields. We show that much more information reaches us through timelike channels (not mediated by real photons) than it is carried by rays of light, which are usually regarded as the only carriers of information.
