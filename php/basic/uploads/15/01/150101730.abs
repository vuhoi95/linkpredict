Title: Pre-inflationary primordial perturbations
Authors: Yong Cai and Yu-Tong Wang and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: The large-scale power deficit in the cosmic microwave background fluctuations might be relevant with the physics of pre-inflation, a bounce, or a superinflationary phase preceding slow-roll inflation, which can provide a singular-free realization of inflation. We investigate the primordial perturbations from such pre-inflationary evolutions, which generally may consist of multiple phases with different background dynamics, and give a universal formula for the power spectrum of primordial perturbations in terms of the recursive Bogoliubov coefficients. We also apply our formula to corresponding cases and show how the intensity of large-scale power suppression is affected by the pre-inflationary physics.
