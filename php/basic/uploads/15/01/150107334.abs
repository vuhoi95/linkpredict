Title: Finite anticanonical transformations in field-antifield formalism
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov and Igor V. Tyutin
Abstract: We study the role of arbitrary (finite) anticanonical transformations in the field-antifield formalism, and the gauge-fixing procedure based on the use of these transformations. The properties of the generating functionals of the Green functions subjected to finite anticanonical transformations are considered.
