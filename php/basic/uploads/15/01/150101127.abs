Title: Confining forces
Authors: Dirk Rollmann and David E. Miller
Abstract: We discuss the forces on the internal constituents of the hadrons based on the bag model. The ground state of the hadrons forms a color singlet so that the effects of the colored internal states are neutralized. From the breaking of the dilatation and conformal symmetries under the strong interactions the corresponding currents are not conserved. These currents give rise to the forces changing the motion of the internal particles which causes confinement.
