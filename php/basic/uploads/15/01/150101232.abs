Title: Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Carl M. Bender
Abstract: Two Non-Hermitian fermion models are proposed and analyzed by using Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations. One model has Lorentz symmetry breaking and the other has a non-Hermitian mass term. It is shown that each model has real energies in a given region of parameter space, where they have a locally conserved current.
