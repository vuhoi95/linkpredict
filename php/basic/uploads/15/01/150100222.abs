Title: Collective Modes of Chiral Kinetic Theory in Magnetic Field
Authors: Mikhail Stephanov and Ho-Ung Yee and Yi Yin
Abstract: We study collective excitations in systems described by chiral kinetic theory in external magnetic field. We consider high-temperature weak-coupling plasma, as well as high-density Landau Fermi liquid with interaction not restricted to be weak. We show that chiral magnetic wave (CMW) emerges in hydrodynamic regime (at frequencies smaller than collision relaxation rate) and the CMW velocity is determined by thermodynamic properties only. We find that in a plasma of opposite chiralities, at frequencies smaller than the chirality-flipping rate, the CMW excitation turns into a vector-like diffusion mode. In the interacting Fermi liquid, the CMW turns into the Landau zero sound mode in the high-frequency collisionless regime.
