Title: Caloron correction to the effective potential in thermal gluodynamics
Authors: Chris P. Korthals Altes and Alfonso Sastre
Abstract: The effective potential in thermal gluodynamics has stable minima in perturbation theory. There the Wilson line is center group valued and eigenvalues of the Wilson line stay clustered. Calorons with non-trivial holonomy contribute to one loop order a linear term in the holonomy. The sign is such that the center group minimum stays stable.
