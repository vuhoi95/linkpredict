Title: Gauge/Bethe correspondence on $S^1 \times Î£_h$ and index over  moduli space
Authors: Satoshi Okuda and Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: We introduce two-types of topologically twisted Chern-Simons-matter theories on the direct product of circle and genus-h Riemann surface (S^1 \times \Sigma_h). The partition functions of first model agrees with the partition functions of a generalizations of G/G gauged WZW model. We also find that correlation functions of Wilson loops in first type Chern-Simons-matter theory coincide with correlation functions of G elements in the generalization of G/G gauged WZW model. The partition function of this model also has nice interpretations as norms of eigen states of Hamiltonian in the quantum integrable model (q-boson hopping model) and also as a geometric index over a particular moduli space. In the second-type Chern-Simons-matter theory, the partition function is related to integration over moduli space of Hitchin equation on Riemann surface.
