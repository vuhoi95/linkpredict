Title: Interaction-Free Measurements: A Complex Nonlinear Explanation
Authors: António Cardoso and João L. Cordovil and José R. Croca
Abstract: In this paper we show that interaction-free measurements, which have been object of much discussion in the last few decades, can be explained in a natural and intuitive way in the framework of complex nonlinear quantum physics, contrary to what is claimed by some orthodox authors that present them as incomprehensible, mind-boggling experiments.
