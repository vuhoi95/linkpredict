Authors: Stanislav Pakuliak and Eric Ragoucy and Nikita A. Slavnov
Abstract: We consider a composite generalized quantum integrable model solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz. Using explicit formulas of the action of the monodromy matrix elements onto Bethe vectors in the GL(3)-based quantum integrable models we prove a formula for the Bethe vectors of composite model. We show that this representation is a particular case of general coproduct property of the weight functions (Bethe vectors) found in the theory of the deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation.
