Title: Electrically-Charged Lifshitz Spacetimes, and Hyperscaling Violations
Authors: Zhong-Ying Fan and H. Lu
Abstract: Electrically-charged Lifshitz spacetimes are hard to come by. In this paper, we construct a class of such solutions in five dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to Maxwell and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields. The solutions are electrically-charged under the Maxwell field, whose equation is sourced by the Yang-Mills instanton(-like) configuration living in the hyperbolic four-space of the Lifshitz spacetime. We then introduce a dilaton and construct charged and colored Lifshitz spacetimes with hyperscaling violations. We obtain a class of exact Lifshitz black holes. We also perform similar constructions in four dimensions.
