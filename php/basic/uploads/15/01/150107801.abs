Title: Heisenberg model and Rigged Configurations
Authors: Pulak Ranjan Giri and Tetsuo Deguchi
Abstract: We show a correspondence of all the solutions of the spin-1/2 isotropic Heisenberg model for N=12 to the rigged configurations based on the comparison of the set of Takahashi quantum numbers in lexicographical order with the set of riggings of the rigged configurations in co-lexicographical order.
