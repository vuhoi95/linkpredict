Title: Dimensional oxidation and modular completion of non-geometric type IIB  action
Authors: Xin Gao and Pramod Shukla
Abstract: Utilizing a setup of type IIB superstring theory compactified on an orientifold of T^6/(Z2xZ2), we propose a modular invariant dimensional oxidation of the four-dimensional scalar potential. In the oxidized ten-dimensional supergravity action, the standard NS-NS and RR three form fluxes (H-, F-) as well as the non-geometric fluxes (Q-, P-) are found to nicely rearrange themselves to form generalized flux-combinations. As an application towards moduli stabilization, using the same S-duality invariant scalar potential, we examine the recently proposed No-Go theorem (in arXiv:1409.7075) about creating a mass-hierarchy between universal-axion and the dilaton relevant for axionic-inflation. Considering a two-field dynamics of universal axion and dilaton while assuming the other moduli/axions being stabilized, we find a part of the No-Go arguments to be quite robust even with the inclusion of non-geometric (Q-, P-) fluxes.
