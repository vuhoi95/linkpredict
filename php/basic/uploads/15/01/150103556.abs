Title: Entropy relations and the application of black holes with cosmological  constant and Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Wei Xu and Jia Wang and Xin-he Meng
Abstract: Based on the entropy relations, we derive thermodynamic bound for entropy and area of horizons of Schwarzschild-dS black hole, including the event horizon, Cauchy horizon and negative horizon (i.e. the horizon with negative value), which are all geometrical bound and made up of the cosmological radius. Consider the first derivative of entropy relations together, we get the first law of thermodynamics for all horizons. We also obtain the Smarr relation of horizons by using the scaling discussion. For thermodynamics of all horizons, the cosmological constant is treated as a thermodynamical variable. Especially for thermodynamics of negative horizon, it is defined well in the $r<0$ side of spacetime. The validity of this formula seems to work well for three-horizons black holes. We also generalize the discussion to thermodynamics for event horizon and Cauchy horizon of Gauss-Bonnet charged flat black holes, as the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is also considered as thermodynamical variable. These give further clue on the crucial role that the entropy relations of multi-horizons play in black hole thermodynamics and understanding the entropy at the microscopic level.
