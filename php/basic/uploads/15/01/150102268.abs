Title: 3d mirror symmetry as a canonical transformation
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Jan Felix
Abstract: We generalize the free Fermi-gas formulation of certain 3d ${\cal N}=3$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theories by allowing Fayet-Iliopoulos couplings as well as mass terms for bifundamental matter fields. The resulting partition functions are given by simple modifications of the argument of the Airy function found previously. With these extra parameters it is easy to see that mirror-symmetry corresponds to linear canonical transformations on the phase space (or operator algebra) of the 1-dimensional fermions.
