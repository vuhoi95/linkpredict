Title: N=2 Super-EYM coloured black holes from defective Lax matrices
Authors: P. Meessen and T. Ort√≠n
Abstract: We construct analytical supersymmetric coloured black hole solutions, i.e. non-Abelian black hole solutions that have no asymptotic non-Abelian charge but do have non-Abelian charges on the horizon that contribute to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, to two SU(3)-gauged N=2 d= supergravities. The analytical construction is made possible due to the fact that the main ingredient is the Bogomol'nyi equation, which under the assumption of spherical symmetry admits a Lax pair formulation. The Lax matrix needed for the coloured black holes must be defective which, even though it is the non-generic and less studied case, is a minor hindrance.
