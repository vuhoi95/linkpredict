Title: Bulk gauge and matter fields in nested warping: I. the formalism
Authors: Mathew Thomas Arun and Debajyoti Choudhury
Abstract: The lack of evidence for a TeV-mass graviton has been construed as constricting the Randall-Sundrum model. However, a doubly-warped generalization naturally avoids such restrictions. We develop, here, the formalism for extension of the Standard Model gauge bosons and fermions into such a six-dimensional bulk. Apart from ameliorating the usual problems such as flavour-changing neutral currents, this model admits two very distinct phases, with their own unique phenomenologies.
