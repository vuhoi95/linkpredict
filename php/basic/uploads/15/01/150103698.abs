Title: Rainbow metric formalism and Relative Locality
Authors: Niccol√≥ Loret and Leonardo Barcaroli
Abstract: This proceeding is based on a talk prepared for the XIII Marcell Grossmann meeting. We summarise some results of work in progress in collaboration with Giovanni Amelino-Camelia about momentum dependent (Rainbow) metrics in a Relative Locality framework and we show that this formalism is equivalent to the Hamiltonian formalization of Relative Locality obtained in arXiv:1102.4637.
