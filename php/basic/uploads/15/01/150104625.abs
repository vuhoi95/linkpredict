Title: Linear mode stability of Kerr-Newman and its quasinormal modes
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Mahdi Godazgar and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: We provide strong evidence that, up to $99.999\%$ of extremality, Kerr-Newman black holes (KN BHs) are linear mode stable within Einstein-Maxwell theory. We derive and solve, numerically, a coupled system of two PDEs for two gauge invariant fields that describe the most general linear perturbations of a KN BH (except for trivial modes that shift the parameters of the solution). We determine the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the KN BH as a function of its three parameters and find no unstable modes. In addition, we find that the QNMs that are connected continuously to the gravitational $\ell=m=2$ Schwarzschild QNM dominate the spectrum for all values of the parameter space ($m$ is the azimuthal number of the wave function and $\ell$ measures the number of nodes along the polar direction). Furthermore, all QNMs with $\ell=m$ approach Re$\,\omega = m \Omega_H^{ext}$ and Im$\,\omega=0$ at extremality; this is a universal property for any field of arbitrary spin $|s|\leq 2$ propagating on a KN BH background ($\omega$ is the wave frequency and $\Omega_H^{ext}$ the BH angular velocity at extremality). We compare our results with available perturbative results in the small charge or small rotation regimes and find good agreement. We also present a simple proof that the Regge-Wheeler (odd) and Zerilli (even) sectors of Schwarzschild perturbations must be isospectral.
