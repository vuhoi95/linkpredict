Title: Quantum Spacetime and Algebraic Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Dorothea Bahns and Sergio Doplicher and Gerardo Morsella and Gherardo Piacitelli
Abstract: We review the investigations on the quantum structure of spactime, to be found at the Planck scale if one takes into account the operational limitations to localization of events which result from the concurrence of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. We also discuss the different approaches to (perturbative) Quantum Field Theory on Quantum Spacetime, and some of the possible cosmological consequences.
