Title: Gravitational scalar-tensor theory
Authors: Atsushi Naruko and Daisuke Yoshida and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: We consider a new form of theories of gravity in which the action is written in terms of the Ricci scalar and its first and second derivatives. Despite the higher derivative nature of the action, the theory is free from ghost under an appropriate choice of the functional form of the Lagrangian. This model possesses $2+2$ physical degrees of freedom, namely $2$ scalar degrees and $2$ tensor degrees. We exhaust all such theories with the Lagrangian of the form $f(R, (\nabla R)^2, \Box R)$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, and then show some examples beyond this ansatz. In course of analysis, we prove the equivalence between these examples and generalized bi-Galileon theories.
