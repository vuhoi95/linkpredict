Authors: Hakan Cebeci and Nülifer Özdemir and Seçil Şentorun
Abstract: In this work, we study the motion of charged test particles in Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT spacetime. We analyze the angular and the radial parts of the orbit equations and examine the possible orbit types. We also investigate the spherical orbits and their stabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the analytical solutions of the equations of motion and express them in terms of Jacobian and Weierstrass elliptic functions. Finally, we discuss the observables of the bound motion and calculate the perihelion shift and Lense-Thirring effect for three dimensional bound orbits.
