Title: Some considerations on duality concerning kappa-Minkowski spacetime  theories
Authors: Vahid Nikoofard and Everton M. C. Abreu
Abstract: In this paper we have analyzed the $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski spacetime through the light of the interference phenomena in QFT where two opposite chiral fields are put together in the same multiplet and its consequences are discussed. The chiral models analyzed here are the chiral Schwinger model, its generalized version and its gauge invariant version, where a Wess-Zumino term were added. We will see that the final actions obtained here are in fact related to the original ones via duality transformations.
