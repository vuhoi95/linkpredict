Title: Charged rotating dilaton black holes with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics
Authors: Christian Knoll and Petya Nedkova
Abstract: We construct a class of stationary and axisymmetric solutions to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which describe configurations of charged rotating black objects with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. The solutions are constructed by uplifting a vacuum seed solution to six dimensions, performing a boost, and a subsequent circle reduction. We investigate the physical properties of the charged solutions, and obtain their general relations to the properties of the vacuum seed. We also derive the gyromagnetic ratio and the Smarr-like relations. As particular cases we study three solutions, which describe a charged rotating black string, a charged rotating black ring on Kaluza-Klein bubbles, and a superposition of two black holes and a Kaluza-Klein bubble.
