Title: Remarks on scale separation in flux vacua
Authors: F. F. Gautason and M. Schillo and T. Van Riet and M. Williams
Abstract: We argue that the Maldacena-Nunez no-go theorem excluding Minkowski and de Sitter vacua in flux compactifications can be extended to exclude anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua for which the Kaluza-Klein scale is parametrically smaller than the AdS length scale. As a practical application of this observation we demonstrate that the mechanism to resolve O6 singularities in massive type IIA at the classical level is likely not to occur in AdS compactifications with scale separation. We furthermore remark that a compactification to four observable dimensions implies a large cosmological hierarchy.
