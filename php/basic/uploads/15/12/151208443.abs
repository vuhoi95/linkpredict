Title: The Polyakov loop at next-to-next-to leading order
Authors: Matthias Berwein and Nora Brambilla and Peter Petreczky and Antonio Vairo
Abstract: We calculate the next-to-next-to-leading correction to the expectation value of the Polyakov loop or equivalently to the free energy of a static charge. This correction is of order $g^5$. We show that up to this order the free energy of the static charge is proportional to the quadratic Casimir operator of the corresponding representation. We also compare our perturbative result with the most recent lattice results in SU(3) gauge theory.
