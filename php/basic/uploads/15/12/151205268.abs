Title: Massive Vector Particles Tunneling From Noncommutative Charged Black  Holes and its GUP-corrected Thermodynamics
Authors: Ali Övgün and Kimet Jusufi
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tunneling process of charged massive bosons $W^{\pm }$ (spin-1 particles) from noncommutative charged black holes such as charged RN black holes and charged BTZ black holes. By applying the WKB approximation and by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation we derive the tunneling rate and the corresponding Hawking temperature for those black holes configuration. Furthermore, we show the quantum gravity effects using the GUP on the Hawking temperature for the noncommutative RN black holes. The tunneling rate shows that the radiation deviates from pure thermality and is consistent with an underlying unitary theory.
