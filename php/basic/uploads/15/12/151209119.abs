Title: Spectral sum rules for confining large-N theories
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and David A. McGady and Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: We consider asymptotically-free four-dimensional large-$N$ gauge theories with massive fermionic and bosonic adjoint matter fields, compactified on squashed three-spheres, and examine their regularized large-$N$ confined-phase spectral sums. The analysis is done in the limit of vanishing 't Hooft coupling, which is justified by taking the size of the compactification manifold to be small compared to the inverse strong scale $\Lambda^{-1}$. Our results motivate us to conjecture some universal spectral sum rules for these large $N$ gauge theories.
