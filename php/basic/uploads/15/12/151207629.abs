Abstract: We study the 1/2 BPS and 1/4 BPS sectors of the worldvolume theory of a stack of k M5-branes. Via a theorem by Atiyah [1], these sectors can be captured by a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model on CP^1 with target space the based loop group of SU(k). The 1/2 BPS sector of the M5-brane worldvolume theory, described by L^2-cohomology classes, forms modules over an affine Lie algebra, while the 1/4 BPS sector, described by chiral differential operators, forms modules over a toroidal Lie algebra. We also compute the partition functions of the 1/2 BPS and 1/4 BPS sectors, and find that they are, respectively, a modular form and an automorphic form for SO(2,2;Z). The symmetry of the 1/4 BPS sector under the SO(2,2;Z) T-duality group corroborates the fact that the worldvolume theory is described by tensionless strings.
