Title: A note on the Kerr-Newman metric in five dimensions
Authors: Hui-Min Fan and Zheng-Cheng Liang and Jianwei Mei
Abstract: We derive an ansatz for the five dimensional equal-rotation Kerr-Newman metric that contains two unknown functions. By solving for these functions through perturbation series, we find that the metric can be cast into the Kerr-Shild form in a background that is flat at the spatial infinity.
