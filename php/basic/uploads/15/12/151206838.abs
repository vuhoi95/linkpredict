Title: Non-compact nonlinear sigma models
Authors: Claudia de Rham and Andrew J. Tolley and Shuang-Yong Zhou
Abstract: The target space of a nonlinear sigma model is usually required to be positive definite to avoid ghosts. We introduce a unique class of nonlinear sigma models where the target space metric has a Lorentzian signature, thus the associated group being non-compact. We show that the would-be ghost associated with the negative direction is fully projected out by 2 second-class constraints, and there exist stable solutions in this class of models. This result also has important implications for Lorentz--invariant massive gravity: There exist stable nontrivial vacua in massive gravity that are free from any linear vDVZ--discontinuity and a $\Lambda_2$ decoupling limit can be defined on these vacua.
