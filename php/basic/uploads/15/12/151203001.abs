Title: Shear viscosity over entropy density ratio with extended quasi-particles
Authors: M. Horváth and A. Jakovác
Abstract: We consider an effective field theory description of beyond-quasi-particle excitations aiming to associate the transport properties of the system with the spectral density of states. Tuning various properties of the many-particle correlations, we investigate how the robust microscopic features are translated into the macroscopic observables like shear viscosity and entropy density. The liquid-gas crossover is analysed using several examples. A thermal constraint on the fluidity measure, the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, is discussed.
