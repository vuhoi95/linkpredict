Title: Entanglement-fluctuation relation for bipartite pure states
Authors: Aura Mae B. Villaruel and Francis N. C. Paraan
Abstract: We identify subsystem fluctuations (variances) that measure entanglement in an arbitrary bipartite pure state. These fluctuations are of observables that generalize the notion of polarization to an arbitrary N-level subsystem. We express this polarization fluctuation in terms of subsystem purity and other entanglement measures. The derived fluctuation-entanglement relation is evaluated for the ground states of a one-dimensional free fermion gas and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chain. Our results provide a framework for experimentally measuring entanglement using Stern-Gerlach-type state selectors.
