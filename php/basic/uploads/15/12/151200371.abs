Title: Holographic Three-Jet Events in Strongly Coupled N=4 Yang-Mills Plasma
Authors: Jorge Casalderrey-Solana and Andrej Ficnar
Abstract: We analyse classical string configurations with non-trivial transverse dynamics in $AdS_5$-Schwarzschild. These strings develop kink-like structures which, via the gauge/gravity duality, can be interpreted as the propagation of hard gluons produced in association with a quark-antiquark pair in a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma. We observe the appearance of two physically distinct regimes of the in-plasma dynamics, depending on whether the medium is able to resolve the transverse structure of the string prior to its total quench. From these studies we extract the medium resolution scale of the strongly coupled SYM plasma, defined as the smallest angular separation between two jets that the medium can resolve, $\theta_{\rm res} = \mathcal{C}_{\rm res} ( E /\sqrt{\lambda} T)^{-2/3}$, where $\mathcal{C}_{\rm res}= \frac{2^{4/3}}{\pi}\frac{\Gamma(3/4)^2}{\Gamma(5/4)^2}$. Our analysis constitutes the first study of proxies for three-jet events in a holographic context.
