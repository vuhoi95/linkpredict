Title: The formalism of invariants in scalar-tensor and multiscalar-tensor  theories of gravitation
Authors: Laur Jarv and Piret Kuusk and Margus Saal and Ott Vilson
Abstract: We give a brief summary of the formalism of invariants in general scalar-tensor and multiscalar-tensor gravities without derivative couplings. By rescaling of the metric and reparametrization of the scalar fields, the theory can be presented in different conformal frames and parametrizations. Due to this freedom in transformations, the scalar fields themselves do not carry independent physical meaning (in a generic parametrization). However, there are functions of the scalar fields and their derivatives which remain invariant under the transformations, providing a set of physical variables for the theory. We indicate how to construct such invariants and show how the observables like parametrized post-Newtonian parameters and characteristics of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology can be neatly expressed in terms of the invariants.
