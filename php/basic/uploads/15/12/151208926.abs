Title: A nonabelian particle-vortex duality in gauge theories
Authors: Jeff Murugan and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We define a nonabelian version of particle-vortex duality, by dimensionally extending usual (1+1)-dimensional nonabelian T-duality to (2+1) dimensions. While we will explicitly describe a global $SU(2)$ symmetry, our methods can also be applied to a larger group $G$, by gauging an appropriate subgroup. We will exemplify our duality with matter in both adjoint and fundamental representations by considering a modification of ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (Seiberg-Witten theory reduced to (2+1) dimensions), and an $SU(2)\times U(1)$ color-flavor locked theory that exhibits nonabelian vortex solutions.
