Title: Scattering asymptotic conditions in Euclidean relativistic quantum  theory
Authors: Gordon Aiello and Wayne Polyzou
Abstract: We discuss the formulation of the scattering asymptotic condition as a strong limit in Euclidean quantum theories satisfying the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms. When used with the invariance principle this provides a constructive method to compute scattering observables directly in the Euclidean formulation of the theory, without an explicit analytic continuation.
