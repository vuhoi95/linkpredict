Title: Inflationary cosmology with Chaplygin gas in Palatini formalism
Authors: Andrzej Borowiec and Aleksander Stachowski and Marek Szydlowski and Aneta Wojnar
Abstract: We present a simple generalisation of the $\Lambda$CDM model which on the one hand reaches very good agreement with the present day experimental data and provides an internal inflationary mechanism on the other hand. It is based on Palatini modified gravity with quadratic Starobinsky term and generalized Chaplygin gas as a matter source providing, besides a current accelerated expansion, the epoch of endogenous inflation driven by type III freeze singularity. It follows from our statistical analysis that astronomical data favors negative value of the parameter coupling quadratic term into Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian and as a consequence the bounce instead of initial Big-Bang singularity is preferred.
