Title: Mesons in strong magnetic fields: (I) General analyses
Authors: Koichi Hattori and Toru Kojo and Nan Su
Abstract: We study properties of neutral and charged mesons in strong magnetic fields |eB|>> Lambda_QCD^2 with Lambda_QCD being the QCD renormalization scale. Assuming long-range interactions, we examine magnetic-field dependences of various quantities such as the constituent quark mass, chiral condensate, meson spectra, and meson wavefunctions by analyzing the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Based on the density of states obtained from these analyses, we extend the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model to investigate thermodynamics at large B. As B increases the meson energy behaves as a slowly growing function of the meson's transverse momenta, and thus a large number of meson states is accommodated in the low energy domain; the density of states at low temperature is proportional to B^2. This extended transverse phase space in the infrared regime significantly enhances the HRG pressure at finite temperature, so that the system reaches the percolation or chiral restoration regime at lower temperature compared to the case without a magnetic field; this simple picture would offer a gauge invariant and intuitive explanation of the inverse magnetic catalysis.
