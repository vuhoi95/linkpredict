Title: Stefan-Boltzmann law for massive photons
Authors: E. S. Moreira Jr. and T. G. Ribeiro
Abstract: This paper generalizes the Stefan-Boltzmann law to include massive photons. A crucial ingredient to obtain the correct formula for the radiance is to realize that a massive photon does not travel at the speed of (massless) light. It follows that, contrary to what could be expected, the radiance is not proportional to the energy density times the speed of light.
