Title: L^2-Kernels Of Dirac-Type Operators On Monopole Moduli Spaces
Authors: Gregory W. Moore and Andrew B. Royston and Dieter Van den Bleeken
Abstract: We state some mathematical predictions concerning the kernels of Dirac-type operators on moduli spaces of (singular) monopoles in R^3. These predictions follow from the semiclassical interpretation of physical results on spaces of (framed) BPS states in d=4, N=2 gauge theories.
