Title: Genus one super-Green function revisited and superstring amplitudes with  non-maximal supersymmetry
Authors: H. Itoyama and Kohei Yano
Abstract: We reexamine genus one super-Green functions with general boundary conditions twisted by $(\alpha, \beta)$ for $(\sigma, \tau)$ directions in the eigenmode expansion and derive expressions as infinite series of hypergeometric functions. Using these, we compute one-loop superstring amplitudes with non-maximal supersymmetry, taking an example of massless vector emissions of open string type I ${\cal Z}_2$ orbifold.
