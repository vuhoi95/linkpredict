Title: Study of the Renormalization-Group Evolution of ${\cal N}=1$  Supersymmetric Gauge Theories Using Pad√© Approximants
Authors: Gongjun Choi and Robert Shrock
Abstract: We study asymptotically free SU($N_c$) gauge theories with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, including the purely gluonic theory and theories with $N_f$ copies of a pair of massless chiral superfields in the respective representations $R$ and $\bar R$ of SU($N_c$). The cases in which $R$ is the fundamental representation and the symmetric and antisymmetric rank-2 tensor representation are considered. We calculate Pad\'e approximants to the beta functions for these theories in the $\overline{\rm DR}$ scheme up to four-loop order for the gluonic theory and up to three-loop order for the theories with matter superfields and compare results for IR zeros and poles with results from the NSVZ beta function. Our calculations provide a quantitative measure, for these theories, of how well finite-order perturbative results calculated in one scheme reproduce properties of a known beta function calculated in a different scheme.
