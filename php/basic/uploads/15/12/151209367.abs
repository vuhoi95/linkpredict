Title: Solution of quantum integrable systems from quiver gauge theories
Authors: Nick Dorey and Peng Zhao
Abstract: We construct new integrable systems describing particles with internal spin from four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theories. The models can be quantized and solved exactly using the quantum inverse scattering method and also using the Bethe/Gauge correspondence.
