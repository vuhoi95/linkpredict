Title: Spinning Particles in Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Olindo Corradini and Christian Schubert
Abstract: The first part of the lectures, given by O. Corradini, covers introductory material on quantum-mechanical Feynman path integrals, which are here derived and applied to several particle models. We start considering the nonrelativistic bosonic particle, for which we compute the exact path integrals for the case of the free particle and for the harmonic oscillator, and then describe perturbation theory for an arbitrary potential. We then move to relativistic particles, both bosonic and fermionic (spinning) particles. We first investigate them from the classical view-point, studying the symmetries of their actions, then consider their canonical quantization and path integrals, and underline the role these models have in the study of space-time quantum field theories (QFT), by introducing the "worldline" path integral representation of propagators and effective actions. We also describe a special class of spinning particles that constitute a first-quantized approach to higher-spin fields. Since the fifties the quantum-mechanical path integral representation of QFT propagators and effective actions has been known. However it is only in recent years that they have gained some popularity for certain types of calculations in quantum field theory. The second part of the lectures, given by C. Schubert, describes two of the main techniques for the evaluation of such path integrals, which are gaussian integration (also called "string-inspired formalism") and semiclassical approximation ("worldline instantons"). We first give a detailed discussion of photonic amplitudes in Scalar and Spinor QED, in vacuum as well as in a constant external field. Then we shortly discuss the main issues encountered in the generalization to the nonabelian case, and finally the case of gravity, where subtle mathematical issues arise.
