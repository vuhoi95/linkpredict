Abstract: We review the classical properties of Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz and Post-Wintenitz systems and their relation with N-dimensional rational Calogero model with oscillator and Coulomb potentials, paying special attention to their hidden symmetries. Then we show that combining the radial coordinate and momentum in a single complex coordinate in proper way, we get an elegant description for the hidden and dynamical symmetries in these systems related with action-angle variables.
