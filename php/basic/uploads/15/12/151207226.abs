Title: Gauge Non-Invariant Higher-Spin Currents in $AdS_4$
Authors: P. A. Smirnov and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Conserved currents of any spin $t>0$ built from bosonic symmetric massless gauge fields of arbitrary integer spins in $AdS_4$ are found. Analogously to the case of $4d$ Minkowski space, currents considered in this paper are not gauge invariant but generate gauge invariant conserved charges.
