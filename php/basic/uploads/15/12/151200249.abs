Title: Large N behavior of mass deformed ABJM theory
Authors: Tomoki Nosaka and Kazuma Shimizu and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: In this paper, using the localization technique we analyze the large N limit of the mass deformed Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory on the three sphere with a finite mass parameter and finite Chern-Simons levels. We find two different solutions of the saddle point equations in the large N limit. With these solutions we compute the free energy and find that there is a first order phase transition. Our results may predict a phase transition in the dual gravity theory.
