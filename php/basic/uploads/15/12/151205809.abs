Title: Sparsity of the Hawking flux
Authors: Matt Visser and Finnian Gray and Sebastian Schuster and Alexander Van-Brunt
Abstract: It is (or should be) well-known that the Hawking flux that reaches spatial infinity is extremely sparse, and extremely thin, with the Hawking quanta, one-by-one, slowly dribbling out of the black hole. The typical time between quanta reaching infinity is much larger than the timescale set by the energy of the quanta. Among other things, this means that the Hawking evaporation of a black hole should be viewed as a sequential cascade of 2-body decays.
