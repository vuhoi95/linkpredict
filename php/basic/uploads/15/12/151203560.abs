Title: The Classical Limit of Minimal Length Uncertainty Relation:Revisit with  the Hamilton-Jacobi Method
Authors: Xiaobo Guo and Peng Wang and Haitang Yang
Abstract: The existence of a minimum measurable length could deform not only the standard quantum mechanics but also classical physics. The effects of the minimal length on classical orbits of particles in a gravitation field have been investigated before, using the deformed Poisson bracket or Schwarzschild metric. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to study motions of particles in the context of deformed Newtonian mechanics and general relativity. Specifically, the precession of planetary orbits, deflection of light, and time delay in radar propagation are considered in this paper. We also set limits on the deformation parameter by comparing our results with the observational measurements. Finally, comparison with results from previous papers is given at the end of this paper.
