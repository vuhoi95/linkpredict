Title: Exact solutions, energy and charge of stable Q-balls
Authors: D. Bazeia and M. A. Marques and R. Menezes
Abstract: In this work we deal with nontopological solutions of the Q-ball type in two spacetime dimensions. We study models of current interest, described by a Higgs-like and other, similar potentials which unveil the presence of exact solutions. We use the analytic results to investigate how to control the energy and charge to make the Q-balls stable.
