Title: New soft theorems for the gravity dilaton and the Nambu-Goldstone  dilaton at subsubleading order

Abstract: We study the soft behavior of two seemingly different particles that are both referred to as dilatons in the literature, namely the one that appears in theories of gravity and in string theory and the Nambu-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken conformal invariance. Our primary result is the discovery of a soft theorem at subsubleading order for each dilaton, which in both cases contains the operator of special conformal transformations. Interesting similarities as well as differences between the dilaton soft theorems are discussed.
