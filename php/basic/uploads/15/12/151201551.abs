Title: Generalized $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry and leptonic CP violation
Authors: Peng Chen and Gui-Jun Ding and Felix Gonzalez-Canales and J. W. F. Valle
Abstract: We propose a generalized $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry to constrain the lepton flavor mixing parameters. We obtain a new correlation between the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ and the "Dirac" CP violation phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$. Only in a specific limit our proposed CP transformation reduces to standard $\mu-\tau$ reflection, for which $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{CP}$ are both maximal. The "Majorana" phases are predicted to lie at their CP-conserving values with important implications for the neutrinoless double beta decay rates. We also study the phenomenological implications of our scheme for present and future neutrino oscillation experiments including T2K, NO$\nu$A and DUNE.
