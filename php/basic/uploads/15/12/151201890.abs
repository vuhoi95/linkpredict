Title: Entropy/information flux in Hawking radiation
Authors: Ana Alonso-Serrano and Matt Visser
Abstract: Blackbody radiation contains (on average) an entropy of $3.9\pm2.5$ bits per photon. This applies not only to the proverbial case of "burning a lump of coal", but also to the Hawking radiation from both analogue black holes and general relativistic black holes. The flip side of this observation is the information budget: If the emission process is unitary, (as it certainly is for normal physical/chemical burning, and also for the Hawking emission from analogue black holes), then this entropy is exactly compensated by the "hidden information" in the correlations. We shall now extend this argument to the Hawking radiation from general relativistic black holes, (where previous discussion is both heated and inconclusive), demonstrating that the assumption of unitarity leads to a perfectly reasonable entropy/information budget without any hint of a "firewall". The assumption of unitarity instead has a different implication --- the horizon (if present) cannot be an *event* horizon, it must be an *apparent/trapping* horizon, or some variant thereof. The key technical aspect of our calculation is the "average subsystem" approach, but applied to a tripartite pure system consisting of the (black hole)+(Hawking radiation)+(rest of universe).
