Title: Lower Bound of Electrical Conductivity from Holography
Authors: Xian-Hui Ge and Sang-Jin Sin and Shao-Feng Wu
Abstract: We propose a universal lower bound of dc electrical conductivity in rotational- and translational- symmetries breaking systems via the holographic duality. This bound predicts that BTZ-black brane can be easily used to realize linear temperature resistivity. We also construct an anisotropic black brane solution, which yields linear temperature for the in-plane resistivity and insulating behavior for the out-of-plane resistivity. Ultimately, we discuss its implications in experiments.
