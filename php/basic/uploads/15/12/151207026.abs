Title: Ramifications of Hurwitz theory, KP integrability and quantum curves
Authors: A. Alexandrov and D. Lewanski and S. Shadrin
Abstract: In this paper we revisit several recent results on monotone and strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers, providing new proofs. In particular, we use various versions of these numbers to discuss methods of derivation of quantum spectral curves from the point of view of KP integrability and derive new examples of quantum curves for the families of double Hurwitz numbers.
