Title: Generalized geometry and non-symmetric gravity
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Fech Scen Khoo and Peter Schupp and Jan Vysoky
Abstract: Generalized geometry provides the framework for a systematic approach to non-symmetric metric gravity theory and naturally leads to an Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity theory with totally anti-symmetric contortion. The approach is related to the study of the low-energy effective closed string gravity actions.
