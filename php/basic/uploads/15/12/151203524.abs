Title: On four dimensional N=3 superconformal theories
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Mikhail Evtikhiev
Abstract: In this note we study four dimensional theories with N=3 superconformal symmetry, that do not also have N=4 supersymmetry. No examples of such theories are known, but their existence is also not ruled out. We analyze several properties that such theories must have. We show that their conformal anomalies obey a=c. Using the N=3 superconformal algebra, we show that they do not have any exactly marginal deformations preserving N=3 supersymmetry, or global symmetries (except for their R-symmetries). Finally, we analyze the possible dimensions of chiral operators labeling their moduli space.
