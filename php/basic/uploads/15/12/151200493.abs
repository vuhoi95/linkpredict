Title: Hamiltonian Truncation Study of the Phi^4 Theory in Two Dimensions II.  The Z_2-Broken Phase and the Chang Duality
Authors: Slava Rychkov and Lorenzo G. Vitale
Abstract: The Fock-space Hamiltonian truncation method is developed further, paying particular attention to the treatment of the scalar field zero mode. This is applied to the two-dimensional Phi^4 theory in the phase where the Z_2-symmetry is spontaneously broken, complementing our earlier study of the Z_2-invariant phase and of the critical point. We also check numerically the weak/strong duality of this theory discussed long ago by Chang.
