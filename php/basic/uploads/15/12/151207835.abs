Abstract: We consider an effective viscous pressure as the result of a backreaction of inhomogeneities within Buchert's formalism. The use of an effective metric with a time-dependent curvature radius allows us to calculate the luminosity distance of the backreaction model. This quantity is different from its counterpart for a "conventional" spatially flat bulk viscous fluid universe. Both expressions are tested against the SNIa data of the Union2.1 sample with only marginally different results for the distance-redshift relation and in accordance with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Future observations are expected to be able to discriminate among these models on the basis of indirect measurements of the curvature evolution.
