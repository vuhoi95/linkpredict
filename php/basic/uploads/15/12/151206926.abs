Title: Global String Embeddings for the Nilpotent Goldstino
Authors: Iñaki García-Etxebarria and Fernando Quevedo and Roberto Valandro
Abstract: We discuss techniques for embedding a nilpotent Goldstino sector both in weakly coupled type IIB compactifications and F-theory models at arbitrary coupling, providing examples of both scenarios in semi-realistic compactifications. We start by showing how to construct a local embedding for the nilpotent Goldstino in terms of an anti D3-brane in a local conifold throat, and then discuss how to engineer the required local structure in globally consistent compact models. We present two explicit examples, the last one supporting also chiral matter and K\"ahler moduli stabilisation.
