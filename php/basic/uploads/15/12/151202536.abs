Title: A Computer Test of Holographic Flavour Dynamics
Authors: Veselin G. Filev and Denjoe O'Connor
Abstract: We perform computer simulations of the Berkooz-Douglas (BD) matrix model, holographically dual to the D0/D4-brane intersection. We generate the fundamental condensate versus bare mass curve of the theory both holographically and from simulations of the BD model. Our studies show excellent agreement of the two approaches in the deconfined phase of the theory and significant deviations in the confined phase. We argue the discrepancy in the confined phase is explained by the embedding of the D4-brane which yields stronger $\alpha'$ corrections to the condensate in this phase.
