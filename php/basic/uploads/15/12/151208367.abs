Title: Two One-Parameter Special Geometries
Authors: Volker Braun and Philip Candelas and Xenia de la Ossa
Abstract: The special geometries of two recently discovered Calabi-Yau threefolds with $h^{11}=1$ are analyzed in detail. These correspond to the 'minimal three-generation' manifolds with $h^{21}=4$ and the `24-cell' threefolds with $h^{21}=1$. It turns out that the one-dimensional complex structure moduli spaces for these manifolds are both very similar and surprisingly complicated. Both have 6 hyperconifold points and, in addition, there are singularities of the Picard-Fuchs equation where the threefold is smooth but the Yukawa coupling vanishes. Their fundamental periods are the generating functions of lattice walks, and we use this fact to explain why the singularities are all at real values of the complex structure.
