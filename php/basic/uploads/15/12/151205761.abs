Title: Cosmological singularities encoded in IR boundary correlations
Authors: Adam Bzowski and Thomas Hertog and Marjorie Schillo
Abstract: We study the dynamics near big crunch singularities produced in asymptotic AdS cosmologies using gauge/gravity duality. The dual description consists of a constant mass deformation of ABJM theory on de Sitter space and is well-defined and stable for small deformations. We identify the critical deformation where the theory becomes unstable at weak and at strong coupling. Using spacelike geodesics anchored on the boundary we compute two-point correlators of ABJM operators of large dimensions. Near the critical deformation a second saddle point contribution enters, in which the spacelike geodesics probe the high curvature region near the singularity. Its contribution strongly enhances the long-distance correlations. This has a natural interpretation in the weakly coupled boundary theory where the critical point corresponds to a massless limit.
