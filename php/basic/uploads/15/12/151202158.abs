Title: Constrained superfields in Supergravity
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Fotis Farakos
Abstract: We analyze constrained superfields in supergravity. We investigate the consistency and solve all known constraints, presenting a new class that may have interesting applications in the construction of inflationary models. We provide the superspace Lagrangians for minimal supergravity models based on them and write the corresponding theories in component form using a simplifying gauge for the goldstino couplings.
