Title: Ricci-flat spacetimes with l-conformal Galilei symmetry
Authors: D. Chernyavsky and A. Galajinsky
Abstract: Ricci-flat metrics of the ultrahyperbolic signature which enjoy the l-conformal Galilei symmetry are constructed. They involve the AdS_2-metric in a way similar to the near horizon black hole geometries. The associated geodesic equations are shown to describe a second order dynamical system for which the acceleration generators are functionally independent.
