Title: Holographic incoherent transport in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton Gravity
Authors: Zhenhua Zhou and Yi Ling and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: Recent progress in the holographic approach makes it more transparent that each conductivity can be decomposed into the coherent contribution due to momentum relaxation and the incoherent contribution due to intrinsic current relaxation. In this paper we investigate this decomposition in the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We derive the perturbation equations, which are decoupled for a large class of background solutions, and then obtain the analytic results of conductivity with the slow momentum relaxation in low frequency approximation, which is consistent with the known results from memory matrix techniques.
