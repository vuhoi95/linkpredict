Title: Global strings in five-dimensional supergravity
Authors: Miho Marui and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We show the existence of solitonic solutions of five-dimensional supergravity, which can be interpreted as global cosmic strings in our universe. They possess the same mathematical structure as the stringy cosmic strings studied by Greene, Shapere, Vafa and Yau, while the size of the extra space and the value of the extra-space component of the gauge field vary from place to place around the string in our model. We also show that supersymmetry is partially broken in the presence of the global strings.
