Title: Higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields in Klebanov-Strassler geometry
Authors: Ashmita Das and Soumitra Sengupta
Abstract: In string theory, higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields appear as massless excitations of closed strings. Till date there is no experimental support in favour of their existence. In a stringy framework, starting from a warped throat-like Klebanov-Strassler geometry, we show that all the massless higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields are heavily suppressed due to the background fluxes leading to their invisibility in our Universe.
