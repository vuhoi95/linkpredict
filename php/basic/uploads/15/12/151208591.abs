Title: Evidence for a Nonplanar Amplituhedron
Authors: Zvi Bern and Enrico Herrmann and Sean Litsey and James Stankowicz and Jaroslav Trnka
Abstract: The scattering amplitudes of planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills exhibit a number of remarkable analytic structures, including dual conformal symmetry and logarithmic singularities of integrands. The amplituhedron is a geometric construction of the integrand that incorporates these structures. This geometric construction further implies the amplitude is fully specified by constraining it to vanish on spurious residues. By writing the amplitude in a dlog basis, we provide nontrivial evidence that these analytic properties and "zero conditions" carry over into the nonplanar sector. This suggests that the concept of the amplituhedron can be extended to the the nonplanar sector of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory.
