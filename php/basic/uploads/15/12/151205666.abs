Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Time Dependent Gauss-Bonnet Gravity
Authors: Elena Caceres and Manuel Sanchez and Julio Virrueta
Abstract: We study holographic entanglement entropy in Gauss-Bonnet gravity following a global quench. It is known that in dynamical scenarios the entanglement entropy probe penetrates the apparent horizon. The goal of this work is to study how far behind the horizon can the entanglement probe reach in a Gauss-Bonnet theory. We find that the behavior is quite different depending on the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\lambda_{GB}$. We show that for $\lambda_{GB} > 0$ the holographic entanglement entropy probe explores less of the spacetime behind the horizon than in Einstein gravity. On the other hand, for $\lambda_{GB} < 0$ the results are strikingly different; for early times a new family of solutions appears. These new solutions reach arbitrarily close to the singularity. We calculate the entanglement entropy for the two family of solutions with negative coupling and find that the ones that reach the singularity are the ones of less entropy. Thus, for $\lambda_{GB} < 0$ the holographic entanglement entropy probes further behind the horizon than in Einstein gravity. In fact, for early times it can explore all the way to the singularity.
