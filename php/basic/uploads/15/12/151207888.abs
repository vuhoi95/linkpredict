Title: Exotic Elko on String-Like Defects in Six Dimensions
Authors: D. M. Dantas and Roldao da Rocha and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: Eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator with dual helicity (Elko) are mass dimension one fermions that represent natural dark matter prime candidates. On the other hand, six dimensional braneworld models have, among other prominent features, the spontaneously confinement of free spin 1 fields. It further holds in the limit of thin braneworlds likewise. In this work, we analyse the trapping of Elko spinor in thin and thick braneworld string-like models in six dimensions. We conclude that the free massless mode is not spontaneously confined in six dimensions. Hence we present an exotic coupling for Elko, which can localize the zero mode in both thin and thick branes. Moreover, we verify that there is no bound massive KK modes in both cases.
