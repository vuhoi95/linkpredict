Title: Inflatino-less Cosmology
Authors: John Joseph M. Carrasco and Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde
Abstract: We construct inflationary models in the context of supergravity with orthogonal nilpotent superfields [1]. When local supersymmetry is gauge-fixed in the unitary gauge, these models describe theories with only a single real scalar (the inflaton), a graviton and a gravitino. Critically, there is no inflatino, no sgoldstino, and no sinflaton in these models. This dramatically simplifies cosmological models which can simultaneously describe inflation, dark energy and SUSY breaking.
