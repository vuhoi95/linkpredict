Title: Emergent Weak Scale from Cosmological Evolution and Dimensional  Transmutation
Authors: Ahmad Sadeghi and Mahdi Torabian
Abstract: In this note we present a framework in which the weak scale appears dynamically technically natural with no new physics up to the Planck scale. The mixing between the massless Higgs and the R^2 metric theory induces, in canonical parametrization of the Einstein frame, an effective field-dependent Higgs mass parameter. It is a dynamical variable which in the course of cosmic evolution scans a wide range of values and eventually stabilizes at a low scale. The one-loop effective potential has an electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum and the hierarchy is explained by dimensional transmutation and cosmological relaxation mechanisms. Furthermore, by evaluating the renormalization group improved effective potential we find that the electroweak vacuum is the global minimum of the effective potential.
