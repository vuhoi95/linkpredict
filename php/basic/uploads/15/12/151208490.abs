Abstract: We study inflation in the $\alpha-$attractor model under a non-slow-roll dynamics with an ansatz proposed by Gong \& Sasaki \cite{Gong:2015ypa} of assuming $N=N\left(\phi\right)$. Under this approach, we construct a class of local shapes of inflaton potential that are different from the T-models. We find this type of inflationary scenario predicts an attractor at $n_{s}\sim0.967$ and $r\sim0.00055$. In our approach, the non-slow-roll inflaton dynamics are related to the $\alpha-$parameter which is the curvature of K\"ahler geometry in the SUGRA embedding of this model.
