Abstract: In this article, we make a gauge theory from the Open p-brane system and map it into the Open 2-brane one. Due to the presence of second class constraints in this model, we encounter some problems during the procedure of quantization. In this regard, considering boundary conditions as Dirac conditions, one can drive the constrained structure of the model at first. Then, with the help of BFT formalism of constraint systems, the Open 2-brane model is embedded into an extended phase space. For this purpose, we introduce some tensor fields to convert ungauged theory into the gauged one. This is the novel part of our research, while mostly scalar and vector fields are used to convert second class constraints into first ones.
