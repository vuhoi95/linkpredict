Title: Residual Local Supersymmetry and the Soft Gravitino
Authors: Steven G. Avery and Burkhard U. W. Schwab
Abstract: We show that there exists an infinite tower of fermionic symmetries in pure $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity on an asymptotically flat background. The Ward identities associated with these symmetries are equivalent to the soft limit of the gravitino and to the statement of supersymmetry at every angle. Additionally, we show that these charges commute into charges associated with the (unextended) BMS group, providing a supersymmetrization of the BMS translations.
