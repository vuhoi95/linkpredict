Title: Five-dimensional null & time-like supersymmetric geometries
Authors: Giulio Pasini and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We show that there exist supersymmetric solutions of five-dimensional, pure, $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supergravity such that the norm of the supersymmetric Killing vector, built out of the Killing spinor, is a real not-everywhere analytic function such that all its derivatives vanish at a point where the Killing vector field becomes null. The norm of the Killing vector field then is not an analytic function on a neighborhood around this point. We explicitly construct such solutions by using a multi-center Gibbons-Hawking base. Although many of these solutions have infinite charges, we find explicit examples with finite charges that asymptote to $AdS_3\times S_2$ and discuss their physical interpretation.
