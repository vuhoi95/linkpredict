Title: The iterated structure of the all-order result for the two-loop sunrise  integral
Authors: Luise Adams and Christian Bogner and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We present a method to compute the Laurent expansion of the two-loop sunrise integral with equal non-zero masses to arbitrary order in the dimensional regularisation $\varepsilon$. This is done by introducing a class of functions (generalisations of multiple polylogarithms to include the elliptic case) and by showing that all integrations can be carried out within this class of functions.
