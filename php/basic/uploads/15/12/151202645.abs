Abstract: We demonstrate explicitly that the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of BPS line operators in 4d N=2 super Yang-Mills theory compactified on a circle, computed by localization techniques, can be expanded in terms of Darboux coordinates as proposed by Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke [arXiv:1006.0146]. However, we need to refine the expansion by including additional novel monopole bubbling contributions to obtain a precise match. Using D-brane realization of these singular BPS line operators, we derive and incorporate the monopole bubbling contributions as well as predict the degeneracies of framed BPS states contributing to the line operator vevs in the limit of vanishing simultaneous spatial and R-symmetry rotation fugacity parameter.
