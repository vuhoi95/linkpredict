Title: Categorical generalization of spinfoam models
Authors: Aleksandar Mikovic and Marko Vojinovic
Abstract: We give a brief review of the problem of quantum gravity. After the discussion of the nonrenormalizability of general relativity, we briefly mention the main research directions which aim to resolve this problem. Our attention then focuses on the approach of Loop Quantum Gravity, specifically spinfoam models. These models have some issues concerning the semiclassical limit and coupling of matter fields. The recent developments in category theory provide us with the necessary formalism to introduce a new action for general relativity and perform covariant quantization so that the issues of spinfoam models are successfully resolved.
