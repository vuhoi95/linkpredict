Title: Hall effect, edge states and Haldane exclusion statistics in  two-dimensional space
Authors: F. Ye and P. A. Marchetti and Z. B. Su and L. Yu
Abstract: We clarify the relation between two kinds of statistics for particle excitations in planar systems: the braid statistics of anyons and the Haldane exclusion statistics(HES). It is shown non-perturbatively that the HES exists for incompressible anyon liquid in the presence of a Hall response. We also study the statistical properties of a specific quantum anomalous Hall model with Chern-Simons term by perturbation in both compressible and incompressible regimes, where the crucial role of edge states to the HES is shown.
