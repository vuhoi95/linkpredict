Title: A general mass term for bigravity
Authors: Giulia Cusin and Ruth Durrer and Pietro Guarato and Mariele Motta
Abstract: We introduce a new formalism to study perturbations of Hassan-Rosen bigravity theory, around general backgrounds for the two dynamical metrics. In particular, we derive the general expression for the mass term of the perturbations and we explicitly compute it for cosmological settings. We study tensor perturbations in a specific branch of bigravity using this formalism. We show that the tensor sector is affected by a late-time instability, which sets in when the mass matrix is no longer positive definite.
