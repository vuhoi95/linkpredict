Title: Split Chern-Simons theory in the BV-BFV formalism
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Pavel Mnev and Konstantin Wernli
Abstract: The goal of this note is to give a brief overview of the BV-BFV formalism developed by the first two authors and Reshetikhin in [arXiv:1201.0290], [arXiv:1507.01221] in order to perform perturbative quantisation of Lagrangian field theories on manifolds with boundary, and present a special case of Chern-Simons theory as a new example.
