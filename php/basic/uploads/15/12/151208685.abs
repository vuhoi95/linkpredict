Title: The Hot Attractor Mechanism: Decoupling Without Deep Throats
Authors: Kevin Goldstein and Vishnu Jejjala and Suresh Nampuri
Abstract: Non-extremal black holes in $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity have two horizons, the geometric mean of whose areas recovers the horizon area of the extremal black hole obtained from taking a smooth zero temperature limit. In prior work (arxiv:1410.3478), using the attractor mechanism, we deduced the existence of several moduli independent invariant quantities obtained from averaging over a decoupled inter-horizon region. We establish that non-extremal geometries at the Reissner--Nordstr\"om point, where the scalar moduli are held fixed, can be lifted to solutions in supergravity with a near-horizon AdS$_3\times$S$^2$. These solutions have the same entropy and temperature as the original black hole and therefore allow an interpretation of the underlying gravitational degrees of freedom in terms of CFT$_2$. Symmetries of the moduli space enable us to explicate the origin of entropy in the extremal limit.
