Title: Novel stability approach of thin-shell gravastars
Authors: Francisco S. N. Lobo and Prado Martín-Moruno and Nadiezhda Montelongo-García and Matt Visser
Abstract: We develop an extremely general and robust framework that can be adapted to wide classes of generic spherically symmetric thin-shell gravastars. The thin shell (transition layer) will be permitted to move freely in the bulk spacetimes, permitting a fully dynamic analysis. This will then allow us to perform a general stability analysis, where it is explicitly shown that stability of the gravastar is related to the properties of the matter residing in the thin-shell transition layer.
