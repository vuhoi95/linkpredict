Abstract: We give a brief description of the generalized Furry picture with t-electric potential steps and use this basis to present nonperturbative calculations in three exactly solvable cases: Sauter-like (or adiabatic) electric field, T-constant electric field, and exponentially decaying electric field. Here, we provide some important and so far unpublished details. We show how these cases help to gain insight into the universal features of particle creation from vacuum. This survey of exactly solvable cases, presented on the same footing, can be used as introductory material for understanding a recent generalization of the Furry picture with x-electric potential steps [arXiv:1506.01156] and [arXiv:1511.02915].
