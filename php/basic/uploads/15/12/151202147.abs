Title: Multipole Expansion in the Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Andrea Cappelli and Enrico Randellini
Abstract: The effective action for low-energy excitations of Laughlin's states is obtained by systematic expansion in inverse powers of the magnetic field. It is based on the W-infinity symmetry of quantum incompressible fluids and the associated higher-spin fields. Besides reproducing the Wen and Wen-Zee actions and the Hall viscosity, this approach further indicates that the low-energy excitations are extended objects with dipolar and multipolar moments.
