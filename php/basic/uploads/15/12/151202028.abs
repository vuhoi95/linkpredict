Title: Godel Type Metrics in Einstein-Aether Theory II: Nonflat Background in  Arbitrary Dimensions
Authors: Metin Gurses and Cetin Senturk
Abstract: It was previously proved that the G\"{o}del-type metrics with flat three-dimensional background metric solve exactly the field equations of the Einstein-Aether theory in four dimensions. We generalize this result by showing that the stationary G\"{o}del-type metrics with nonflat background in $D$ dimensions solve exactly the field equations of the Einstein-Aether theory. The reduced field equations are the $(D-1)$-dimensional Euclidean Ricci-flat and the $(D-1)$-dimensional source-free Maxwell equations, and the parameters of the theory are left free except $c_{1}-c_{3}=1$. We give a method to produce exact solutions of the Einstein-Aether theory from the G\"{o}del-type metrics in $D$ dimensions. By using this method, we present explicit exact solutions to the theory by considering the particular cases: ($D-1$)-dimensional Euclidean flat, conformally flat, and Tangherlini backgrounds.
