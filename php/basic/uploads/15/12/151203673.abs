Title: The Phase Diagram of QC2D from Functional Methods
Authors: Naseemuddin Khan and Jan M. Pawlowski and Fabian Rennecke and Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of two-color Quantum Chromodynamics at finite temperature and chemical potential. This is done within an effective low-energy description in terms of quarks, mesons and diquarks. Quantum, thermal and density fluctuations are taken into account with the functional renormalisation group approach. In particular, we establish the phenomenon of pre-condensation, affecting the location of the phase boundary to Bose-Einstein condensation. We also discuss the Silver Blaze property in the context of the functional renormalisation group.
