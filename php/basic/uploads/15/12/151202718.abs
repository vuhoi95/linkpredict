Title: Regular Phantom Black Hole and Holography: very high temperature  superconductors
Authors: Kai Lin and A. B. Pavan and Qiyuan Pan and E. Abdalla
Abstract: Holographic superconductors containing a non-minimal derivative coupling for scalar field in a regular phantom plane symmetric black hole have been considered. We show that the parameter of the regular black hole $b$ as well as the non-minimal derivative coupling parameter $\eta$ affect the formation of the condensate as well as the conductivity in the superconductor. Moreover, $b$ has a critical value in which the critical temperature $T_c$ increases without a bound. We argue that an unlimited critical temperature is an evidence that high $T_c$ superconductor must be related to the absence of a singularity in the bulk in the AdS/CFT context.
