Title: Finite Gauge Transformations and Geometry in Extended Field Theory
Authors: N. Chaemjumrus and C. M. Hull
Abstract: The recently derived expressions for finite gauge transformations in double field theory with duality group O(d,d) are generalised to give expressions for finite gauge transformations for extended field theories with duality group SL(5,R), SO(5,5) and E6. The generalised metrics are discussed.
