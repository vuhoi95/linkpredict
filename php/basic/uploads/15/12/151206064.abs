Title: Non-relativistic fields from arbitrary contracting backgrounds
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Jan Rosseel and Thomas Zojer
Abstract: We discuss a non-relativistic contraction of massive and massless field theories minimally coupled to gravity. Using the non-relativistic limiting procedure introduced in our previous work, we (re-)derive non-relativistic field theories of massive and massless spins 0 to 3/2 coupled to torsionless Newton-Cartan backgrounds. We elucidate the relativistic origin of the Newton-Cartan central charge gauge field $m_\mu$ and explain its relation to particle number conservation.
