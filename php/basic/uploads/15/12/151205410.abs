Title: Asymptotically locally flat spacetimes and dynamical black flowers in  three dimensions
Authors: Glenn Barnich and CÃ©dric Troessaert and David Tempo and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: The theory of massive gravity proposed by Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend is considered in the special case of the pure irreducibly fourth order quadratic Lagrangian. It is shown that the asymptotically locally flat black holes of this theory can be consistently deformed to "black flowers" that are no longer spherically symmetric. Moreover, we construct radiating spacetimes settling down to these black flowers in the far future. The generic case can be shown to fit within a relaxed set of asymptotic conditions as compared to the ones of general relativity at null infinity, while the asymptotic symmetries remain the same. Conserved charges as surface integrals at null infinity are constructed following a covariant approach, and their algebra represents BMS$_{3}$, but without central extensions. For solutions possessing an event horizon, we derive the first law of thermodynamics from these surface integrals.
