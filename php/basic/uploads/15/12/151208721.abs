Abstract: The relativistic problem of spin- fermions subject to vector hyperbolic (kink-like) potential tanh (kx) is investigated by using the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The energy eigenvalue equation and the corresponding normalized wave functions are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials for x>0 and x<0 cases.
