Title: Vacuum decay in an interacting multiverse
Authors: S. Robles-Pérez and A. Alonso-Serrano and C. Bastos and O. Bertolami
Abstract: We examine a new multiverse scenario in which the component universes interact. We focus our attention to the process of "true" vacuum nucleation in the false vacuum within one single element of the multiverse. It is shown that the interactions lead to a collective behaviour that might lead, under specific conditions, to a pre-inflationary phase and ensued distinguishable imprints in the comic microwave background radiation.
