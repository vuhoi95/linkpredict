Abstract: We study the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous time-dependent scalar field which, besides its coupling to curvature, it is also coupled kinematically to the Einstein tensor. This coupling is part of the Horndeski theory and we investigate the effect of the shift symmetry on the collapsing process. We find that, as the value of the derivative coupling is increasing, the time required for the scalar field to collapse is also increasing, the singularity is protected by a horizon and a black hole is formed while the weak energy condition is satisfied during the collapsing process.
