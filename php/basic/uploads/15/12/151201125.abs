Abstract: We discuss the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) method for the O(2) model with a chemical potential in 1+1 dimensions with emphasis on near gapless/conformal situations. We emphasize the role played by the late Leo Kadanoff in the development of this theoretical framework. We describe the entanglement entropy in the superfluid phase (see arXiv:1507.01471 for details). We present recent progress on optimized truncation methods.
