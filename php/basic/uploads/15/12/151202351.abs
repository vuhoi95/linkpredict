Title: The M-sigma Relation of Super Massive Black Holes from the Scalar Field  Dark Matter
Authors: Jae-Weon Lee and Jungjai Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim
Abstract: We explain the M-sigma relation between the mass of super massive black holes in galaxies and the velocity dispersions of their bulges in the scalar field or the Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model. The gravity of the central black holes changes boundary conditions of the scalar field at the galactic centers. Owing to the wave nature of the dark matter this significantly changes the galactic halo profiles even though the black holes are much lighter than the bulges. As a result the heavier the black holes are, the more compact the bulges are, and hence the larger the velocity dispersions are. This tendency is verified by a numerical study. The M-sigma relation is well reproduced with the dark matter particle mass $m\simeq 5\times 10^{-22} eV$.
