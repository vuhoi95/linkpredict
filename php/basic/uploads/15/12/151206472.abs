Title: Charged scalar gravitational collapse in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Cheng-Yong Zhang and Shao-Jun Zhang and De-Cheng Zou and Bin Wang
Abstract: We study the charged scalar collapse in de Sitter spacetimes. With the electric charge, there is one more competitor to join the competition of dynamics in the gravitational collapse. We find that two factors can influence the electric charge. If we just adjust the charge conjugation, the electric charge effect is always perturbative at the black hole threshold. The electric charge can also be influenced by the initial conditions of perturbations. These initial parameters can be tuned to control the competition in dynamics and present us new and rich physics in the process of gravitational collapse. We give physical explanations on these phenomena found in dynamics. Furthermore we show that the properties of the gravitational collapse are universal and do not depend on spacetime dimensions.
