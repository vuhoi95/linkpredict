Abstract: Recently, Padmanabhan [arXiv:1206.4916 [hep-th]] discussed that the difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and the number of degrees of freedom in a bulk region causes the accelerated expansion of the universe. The main question that arises on the origin of this inequality between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom. We answer this question in M-theory. In our model, first M0-branes are compactified on one circle and then N D0-branes are created. Then, N D0-branes join to each other, grow and form a D5-brane. Next, D5- brane is compactified on two circle and our universe-D3-brane, two D1-brane and some extra energies are produced. After that, one of the D1-branes, which is more close to the universe-brane, gives its energy into it, leads to an increase of the difference between the number of degrees of freedom and the occurring inflation era. With the disappearance of this D1-brane, the number of degrees of freedom of boundary surface and bulk region becomes equal and inflation ends. At this stage, extra energies that are produced due to the compactification cause to an expansion of universe and deceleration epoch. Finally, another D1-brane, dissolves in our universe-brane, leads to an inequality between degrees of freedom and gives rise to a new phase of acceleration.
