Title: Classically Scale Invariant Inflation, Supermassive WIMPs, and  Adimensional Gravity
Authors: Arsham Farzinnia and Seyen Kouwn
Abstract: We introduce a minimal and yet comprehensive framework with $CP$- and classical scale-symmetries, in order to simultaneously address the hierarchy problem, neutrino masses, dark matter, and inflation. One complex gauge singlet scalar and three flavors of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are added to the standard model content, facilitating the see-saw mechanism, among others. An adimensional theory of gravity (Agravity) is employed, allowing for the trans-Planckian field excursions. The weak and Planck scales are induced by the Higgs portal and the scalar non-minimal couplings, respectively, once a Coleman-Weinberg dynamically-generated vacuum expectation value for the singlet scalar is obtained. All scales are free from any mutual quadratic destabilization. The $CP$-symmetry prevents a decay of the pseudoscalar singlet, rendering it a suitable WIMPzilla dark matter candidate with the correct observational relic abundance. Identifying the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the (approximate) scale symmetry with the inflaton field, the model accommodates successful slow-roll inflation, compatible with the observational data. We reach the conclusion that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone inflaton, within a classically scale-symmetric framework, yields lighter WIMPzillas.
