Title: On Hermitian separability of the next-to-leading order BFKL kernel for  the adjoint representation of the gauge group in the planar N = 4 SYM
Authors: V. S. Fadin and R. Fiore
Abstract: We analyze a modification of the BFKL kernel for the adjoint representation of the colour group in the maximally supersymmetric (N=4) Yang-Mills theory in the limit of a large number of colours, related to the modification of the eigenvalues of the kernel suggested by S. Bondarenko and A. Prygarin in order to reach the Hermitian separability of the eigenvalues. We restore the modified kernel in the momentum space. It turns out that the modification is related only to the real part of the kernel and that the correction to the kernel can not be presented by a single analytic function in the entire momentum region, which contradicts the known properties of the kernel.
