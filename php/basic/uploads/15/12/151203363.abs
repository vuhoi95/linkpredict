Title: Holographic Dual to Conical Defects: II. Colliding Ultrarelativistic  Particles
Authors: D. S. Ageev and I. Ya. Aref'eva
Abstract: We study instant conformal symmetry breaking as a holographic effect of ultrarelativistic particles moving in the AdS3 spacetime. We give the qualitative picture of this effect probing it by two-point correlation functions and the entanglement entropy of the corresponding boundary theory. We show that within geodesic approximation the ultra-relativistic massless defect due to gravitational lensing of the geodesics, produces a zone structure for correlators with broken conformal invariance. Meanwhile, the holographic entanglement entropy also exhibits a transition to the non-conformal behaviour. Two colliding massless defects produce more diverse zone structure for correlators and the entanglement entropy.
