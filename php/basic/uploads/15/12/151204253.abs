Title: A manifestly Lorentz covariant, interacting and non-commutative Dirac  equation
Authors: P. H. Williams and F. G. Scholtz
Abstract: We propose a manifestly Lorentz covariant, non-commutative Dirac equation for charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field. The equation is formulated on the operator level, but operators are not composed through the normal operator product, but a modified product that restores the Lorentz covariance. This equation is solved for the free particle and a particle moving in a constant magnetic field. An abstract action, constructed on the operator level, that yields this equation as equation of motion is also derived. To relate this formalism to current formulations of non-commutative quantum field theories, this action is written in a coherent state basis, leading to an action in 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time. The resulting action differs from existing non-commutative actions, but still exhibits non-commutative effects through non-locality.
