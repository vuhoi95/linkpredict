Title: Aharonov-Bohm Phase in High Density Quark Matter
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Stable non-Abelian vortices, which are color magnetic flux tubes as well as superfluid vortices, are present in the color-flavor locked phase of dense quark matter with diquark condensations. We calculate the Aharanov-Bohm phases of charged particles, that is, electrons, muons, and color-flavor locked mesons made of tetraquarks around a non-Abelian vortex.
