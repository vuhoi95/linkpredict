Title: Frobenius type and CV-structures for Donaldson-Thomas theory and a  convergence property
Authors: Anna Barbieri and Jacopo Stoppa
Abstract: We rephrase some well-known results in Donaldson-Thomas theory in terms of (formal families of) Frobenius type and CV-structures on a vector bundle in the sense of Hertling. We study these structures in an abstract setting, and prove a convergence result which is relevant to the case of triangulated categories. An application to physical field theory is also briefly discussed.
