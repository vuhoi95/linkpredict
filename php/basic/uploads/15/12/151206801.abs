Title: Recursion relations from soft theorems
Authors: Hui Luo and Congkao Wen
Abstract: We establish a set of new on-shell recursion relations for amplitudes satisfying soft theorems. The recursion relations can apply to those amplitudes whose additional physical inputs from soft theorems are enough to overcome the bad large-z behaviour. This work is a generalization of the recursion relations recently obtained by Cheung et al for amplitudes in scalar effective field theories with enhanced vanishing soft behaviours, which can be regarded as a special case of those with non-vanishing soft limits. We apply the recursion relations to tree-level amplitudes in various theories, including amplitudes in the Akulov-Volkov theory, amplitudes containing dilatons of spontaneously-broken conformal symmetry.
