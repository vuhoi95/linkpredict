Title: Inflation model constraints from data released in 2015
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Ke Wang and Sai Wang
Abstract: We provide the latest constraints on the power spectra of both scalar and tensor perturbations from the CMB data (including \textit{Planck}~2015, BICEP2 \& \textit{Keck Array} experiments) and the new BAO scales from SDSS-III BOSS observation. We find that the inflation model with a convex potential is not favored and both the inflation model with a monomial potential and the natural inflation model are marginally disfavored at around $95\%$ confidence level. But both the Brane inflation model and the Starobinsky inflation model fit the data quite well.
