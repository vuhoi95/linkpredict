Title: Build-up of the Kondo effect from real-time 2PI effective action for the  Anderson impurity model
Authors: Sebastian Bock and Alexander Liluashvili and Thomas Gasenzer
Abstract: The nonequilibrium time evolution of a quantum dot is studied by means of dynamic equations for time-dependent Greens functions derived from a two-particle-irreducible (2PI) effective action for the Anderson impurity model. Coupling the dot between two leads at different voltages, the dynamics of the current through the dot is investigated. We show that the 2PI approach is capable to describe the dynamical build-up of the Kondo effect, which shows up as a sharp resonance in the spectral function, with a width exponentially suppressed in the electron self coupling on the dot. An external voltage applied to the dot is found to deteriorate the Kondo effect at the hybridization scale. The dynamic equations are evaluated within different nonperturbative resummation schemes, within the direct, particle-particle, and particle-hole channels, as well as their combination, and the results compared with that from other methods.
