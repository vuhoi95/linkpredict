Title: Strong-coupling effects in a plasma of confining gluons
Authors: Wojciech Florkowski and Radoslaw Ryblewski and Nan Su and Konrad Tywoniuk
Abstract: The plasma consisting of confining gluons resulting from the Gribov quantization of the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory is studied using non-equilibrium fluid dynamical framework. Exploiting the Bjorken symmetry and using linear response theory a general analytic expressions for the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients are derived. It is found that the considered system exhibits a number of properties similar to the strongly-coupled theories, where the conformality is explicitly broken. In particular, it is shown that, in the large temperature limit, bulk to shear viscosity ratio, scales linearly with the difference $1/3 - c_s^2$, where $c_s$ is the speed of sound. Results obtained from the analysis are in line with the interpretation of the quark-gluon plasma as an almost perfect fluid.
