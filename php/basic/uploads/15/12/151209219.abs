Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle. The corrections to the Hawking temperature, entropy and the heat capacity are obtained via the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation. These modifications show that the GUP changes the evolution of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Specially, the GUP effect becomes susceptible when the radius or mass of black hole approach to the order of Planck scale, it stops radiating and leads to black hole remnant. Meanwhile, the Planck scale remnant can be confirmed through the analysis of the heat capacity. Those phenomenons imply that the GUP may give a way to solve the information paradox. Besides, we also investigate the possibilities to observe the black hole at LHC, the results demonstrate that the black hole can not be produced in the recent LHC.
