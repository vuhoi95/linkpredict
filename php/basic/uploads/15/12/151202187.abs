Abstract: We consider quantum quenches in models of free scalars and fermions with a generic time dependent mass $m(t)$ that goes from $m_0$ to zero. We prove that, as anticipated in MSS (hep-th/1501.04580), the post-quench dynamics can be described by a CFT with initial state of the generalized Calabrese-Cardy form $|\psi \rangle=\text{exp}[-\kappa_2 H -\sum_{n>2}^\infty \kappa_n W_n]| \hbox{Bd} \rangle$. The $W_n$ ($n=2,3,...$, $W_2=H$) represent the conserved $W_\infty$ charges and $| \hbox{Bd} \rangle$ represents a conformal boundary state. We prove the result for pre-quench states which can be the ground state or a squeezed state, and without recourse to perturbation in the $\kappa_n$'s as in MSS. For specific quench protocols $m(t)$, we compute exact time-dependent correlators. The correlators show thermalization to a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE), with inverse temperature $\beta= 4\kappa_2$, and chemical potentials $\mu_n=4\kappa_n$. By an application of inverse scattering techniques, we are able to retrieve from the $\kappa_n$'s (equivalently, from temperature and chemical potentials) the exact quench protocol $m(t)$. The other notable result, which we interpret as a UV/IR mixing, is that the long distance and long time (IR) behaviour of correlators crucially rests on taking into account all $\kappa_n$'s which, in usual RG parlance, are highly irrelevant couplings in IR. This shows a different nature of RG for non-equilibrium dynamics.
