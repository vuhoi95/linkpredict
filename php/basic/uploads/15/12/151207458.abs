Title: Semilocal Fractional Instantons
Authors: Minoru Eto and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We find semi-local fractional instantons of codimension four in Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories coupled with scalar fields and the corresponding ${\mathbb C}P^{N-1}$ and Grassmann sigma models at strong gauge coupling. They are 1/4 BPS states in supersymmetric theories with eight supercharges, carry fractional (half) instanton charges characterized by the fourth homotopy group $\pi_4 (G/H)$, and have divergent energy in infinite spaces. We construct exact solutions for the sigma models and numerical solutions for the gauge theories. Small instanton singularity in sigma models is resolved at finite gauge coupling (for the Abelian gauge theory). Instantons in Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories have negative and positive instantons charges, respectively, which are related by the Seiberg-like duality that changes the sign of the instanton charge.
