Title: Gravity and the stability of the Higgs sector
Authors: Olga Czerwińska and Zygmunt Lalak and Łukasz Nakonieczny
Abstract: We pursued the question of the influence of a strong gravitational field on the structure of the Higgs effective potential in the gauge-less top-Higgs sector of the Standard Model with an additional scalar singlet. To this end, we calculated the one-loop corrected effective potential in an arbitrary curved spacetime. We have found that the gravity induced terms in the effective potential may influence its behavior in both small and large field regions. This result indicated the necessity of a more careful investigation of the effect of high curvature in the problems concerning the stability of the Higgs effective potential in the full Standard Model.
