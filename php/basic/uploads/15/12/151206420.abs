Title: Holographic Wilson Loops in Symmetric Representations in N = 2*  Super-Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Xinyi Chen-Lin and Amit Dekel and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: We construct the D3-brane solution in the holographic dual of the N = 2* theory that describes Wilson lines in symmetric representations of the gauge group. The results perfectly agree with the direct field-theory predictions based on localization.
