Abstract: We study correlation functions of scalar operators on the boundary of the $AdS_3$ space deformed by moving massive particles in the context of the AdS/CFT duality. To calculate two-point correlation functions we use the geodesic approximation and the renormalized image method. We compare results of the renormalized image method with direct calculations using tracing of winding geodesics around the cone singularities, and show on examples that they are equivalent. We demonstrate that in the geodesic approximation the correlators exhibit a zone structure. This structure substantially depends on the mass and velocity of the particle.
