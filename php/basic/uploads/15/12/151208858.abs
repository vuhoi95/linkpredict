Title: Local QCD Action at Finite Temperature
Authors: Patrick Cooper and Daniel Zwanziger
Abstract: In this article, we carefully derive the horizon condition at finite temperature. Only the zero Matsubara mode is affected, and this result is consistent with the suitably modified Maggiore-Schaden shift, which takes into account temporal periodicity. We thus obtain a local, BRST-invariant action for QCD at finite temperature. The large-N limit and other calculational schemes for the magnetic mass and its relation to the Gribov mass are also discussed.
