Title: A note on entanglement entropy for topological interfaces in RCFTs
Authors: Michael Gutperle and John D. Miller
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the entanglement entropy for topological interfaces in rational conformal field theories for the case where the interface lies at the boundary of the entangling interval and for the case where it is located in the center of the entangling interval. We compare the results to each other and also to the recently calculated left/right entropy of a related BCFT. We also comment of the entanglement entropies for topological interfaces for a free compactified boson and Liouville theory.
