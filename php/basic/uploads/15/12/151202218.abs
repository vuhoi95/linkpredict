Title: Stringy explanation of $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ anomalies
Authors: Alejandro Celis and Wan-Zhe Feng and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We show that the recent anomalies in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions observed by the LHCb collaboration can be accommodated within string motivated models with a low mass $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson. Such $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson can be obtained in compactifications with a low string scale. We consider a class of intersecting D-brane models, in which different families of quarks and leptons are simultaneously realized at different D-brane intersections. The explanation of $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ anomalies via a stringy $Z^{\prime}$ sets important restrictions on these viable D-brane constructions.
