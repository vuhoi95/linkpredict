Title: Finite Entanglement Entropy of Black Holes
Authors: Stefano Giaccari and Leonardo Modesto and Leslaw Rachwal and Yiwei Zhu
Abstract: We compute the area term contribution to the black holes' entanglement entropy for a class of local or weakly nonlocal renormalizable gravitational theories coupled to matter. For the case of super-renormalizable theories, we can get a finite conical entropy expressed only in terms of the classical Newton constant either by completing the theory to a finite one in dimensional regularization or by removing the quadratic divergences in the cut-off regularization by the introduction of additional interaction terms. Therefore, our result is independent from the renormalization scheme. We also propose a theory in which the renormalization of the Newton constant is entirely due to the standard model matter, arguing that such a contribution does not give the usual interpretational problems of conical entropy discussed in the literature.
