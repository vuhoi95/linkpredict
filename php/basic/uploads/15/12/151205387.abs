Title: The Role of MÃ¶bius Constants and Scattering Functions in CHY Scalar  Amplitudes
Authors: C. S. Lam and York-Peng Yao
Abstract: The integrations leading to the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) double-color $n$-point massless scalar amplitude are carried out one integral at a time. M\"obius invariance dictates the final amplitude to be independent of the three M\"obius constants $\sigma_r, \sigma_s, \sigma_t$, but their choice affects integrations and the intermediate results. The effect of the M\"obius constants, the two colors, and the scattering functions on each integration is investigated. A systematic way to carry out the $n-3$ integrations is explained, each exposing one of the $n-3$ propagators of the Feynman diagrams. Two detailed examples are shown to illustrate the procedure, one a five-point amplitude, and the other a nine-point amplitude.
