Abstract: In this paper the existence of a stealth field during the evolution of our Universe is studied. With this aim, in the framework of the FRW cosmology, the case of non-conformal non-minimal coupling between a stealth scalar field and gravity is studied. It is shown that de Sitter's are the only backgrounds allowing for a stealth field fully depending on the spacetime coordinates. This way, such a field is not consistent with the present cosmological picture. If the stealth is homogeneous, then its dynamics is restricted by the underlying cosmological evolution. It is shown that homogeneous stealths can coexist with the kind of matter used to describe the matter content of our Universe according to the $\Lambda$CDM model.
