Title: Truncated Hilbert space approach to the 2d $Ï†^{4}$ theory
Authors: Z. Bajnok and M. Lajer
Abstract: We apply the massive analogue of the truncated conformal space approach to study the two dimensional $\phi^{4}$ theory in finite volume. We focus on the broken phase and determine the finite size spectrum of the model numerically. We interpret the results in terms of the Bethe-Yang spectrum, from which we extract the infinite volume masses and scattering matrices for various couplings. We compare these results against semiclassical analysis and perturbation theory. We also analyze the critical point of the model and confirm that it is in the Ising universality class.
