Title: An Action for Matter Coupled Higher Spin Gravity in Three Dimensions
Authors: Roberto Bonezzi and Nicolas Boulanger and Ergin Sezgin and Per Sundell
Abstract: We propose a covariant Hamiltonian action for the Prokushkin and Vasiliev's matter coupled higher spin gravity in three dimensions. The action is formulated on ${\cal X}_4 \times {\cal Z}_2$ where ${\cal X}_4$ is an open manifold whose boundary contains spacetime and ${\cal Z}_2$ is a noncommutative twistor space. We examine various consistent truncations to models of BF type in ${\cal X}_4$ and ${\cal Z}_2$ with B$^2$ terms and central elements. They are obtained by integrating out the matter fields in the presence of a vacuum expectation value $\nu\in \mathbb{R}$ for the zero-form master field. For $\nu=0$, we obtain a model on ${\cal X}_4$ containing Blencowe's action and a model on ${\cal Z}_2$ containing the Prokushkin--Segal--Vasiliev action. For generic $\nu$ (including $\nu=0$), we propose an alternative model on ${\cal X}_4$ with gauge fields in the Weyl algebra of Wigner's deformed oscillator algebra and Lagrange multipliers in the algebra of operators acting in the Fock representation space of the deformed oscillators.
