Abstract: The present paper analyze SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) Chern-Simons theory on a class of graph complement 3-manifolds, and its relation with classical and quantum geometries on 4-dimensional manifolds. In classical theory, we explain the correspondence between a class of SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) flat connections on 3-manifold and the Lorentzian simplicial geometries in 4 dimensions. The class of flat connections on the graph complement 3-manifold is specified by a certain boundary condition. The corresponding simplicial 4-dimensional geometries are made by constant curvature 4-simplices. The quantization of 4d simplicial geometry can be carried out via the quantization of flat connection on 3-manifold in Chern-Simons theory. In quantum SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) Chern-Simons theory, a basis of physical wave functions is the class of (holomorphic) 3d block, defined by analytically continued Chern-Simons path integral over Lefschetz thimbles. Here we propose that the (holomorphic) 3d block with the proper boundary condition imposed gives the quantization of simplicial 4-dimensional geometry. Interestingly in the semiclassical asymptotic expansion of (holomorphic) 3d block, the leading contribution gives the classical action of simplicial Einstein-Hilbert gravity in 4 dimensions, i.e. Lorentzian 4d Regge action on constant curvature 4-simplices with a cosmological constant. Such a result suggests a relation between SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$) Chern-Simons theory on a class of 3-manifolds and simplicial quantum gravity on 4-dimensional manifolds. This paper presents the details for the results reported in arXiv:1509.00458.
