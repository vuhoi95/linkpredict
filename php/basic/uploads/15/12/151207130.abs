Title: Conformal gravity 1-loop partition function
Authors: M. Irakleidou and I. Lovrekovic
Abstract: We evaluate the 1-loop partition function of conformal gravity in four dimensions around an $AdS_4$ background, using the heat kernel techniques. We give expressions for the relevant thermodynamical quantities and compare our results with the ones from the literature.
