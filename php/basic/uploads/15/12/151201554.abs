Title: On the Stringy Hartle-Hawking State
Authors: Roy Ben-Israel and Amit Giveon and Nissan Itzhaki and Lior Liram
Abstract: We argue that non-perturbative $\alpha'$ stringy effects render the Hartle-Hawking state associated with the $SL(2)/U(1)$ eternal black hole singular at the horizon. We discuss implications of this observation on firewalls in string theory.
