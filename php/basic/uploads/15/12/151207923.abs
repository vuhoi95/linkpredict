Title: Bi-HKT and bi-Kaehler supersymmetric sigma models
Authors: S. A. Fedoruk and A. V. Smilga
Abstract: We study CKT (or bi-HKT) N = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanical sigma models. They are characterized by the usual and the mirror sectors displaying each HKT geometry. When the metric involves isometries, a Hamiltonian reduction is possible. The most natural such reduction with respect to a half of bosonic target space coordinates produces an N = 4 model, related to the twisted Kaehler model due to Gates, Hull and Rocek, but including certain extra F-terms in the superfield action.
