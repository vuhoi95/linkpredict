Abstract: We review how Geroch's reduction method is extended from Ricci-flat to Einstein spacetimes. The Ehlers-Geroch SL(2,R) group is still present in the three-dimensional sigma-model that captures the dynamics, but only a subgroup of it is solution-generating. Holography provides an alternative three-dimensional perspective to integrability properties of Einstein's equations in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. These properties emerge as conditions on the boundary data (metric and energy-momentum tensor) ensuring that the hydrodynamic derivative expansion be resummed into an exact four-dimensional Einstein geometry. The conditions at hand are invariant under a set of transformations dubbed holographic U-duality group. The latter fills the gap left by the Ehlers-Geroch group in Einstein spaces, and allows for solution-generating maps mixing e.g. the mass and the nut charge.
