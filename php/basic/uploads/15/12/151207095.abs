Title: Scaling Laws in Gravitational Collapse
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Run-Qiu Yang
Abstract: This paper presents two interesting scaling laws, which relate some critical exponents in the critical behavior of spherically symmetric gravitational collapses. These scaling laws are independent of the details of gravity theory under consideration and share similar forms as those in thermodynamic and geometrical phase transitions in condensed matter system. The properties of the scaling laws are discussed and some numerical checks are given.
