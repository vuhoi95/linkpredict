Title: Scalar waves from a star orbiting a BTZ black hole
Authors: Xing-Hua Wu and Ran Li and Jun-Kun Zhao
Abstract: In this paper we compute the decay rates of massless scalar waves excited by a star circularly orbiting around the non-extremal (general) and extremal BTZ black holes. These decay rates are compared with the corresponding quantities computed in the corresponding dual conformal field theories respectively. We find that matches are achieved in both cases.
