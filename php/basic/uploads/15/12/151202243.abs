Title: Static Spherically Symmetric Kerr-Schild Metrics and Implications for  the Classical Double Copy
Authors: Alexander K. Ridgway and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: We discuss the physical interpretation of stress-energy tensors that source static spherically symmetric Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the sources of such metrics with no curvature singularities or horizons do not simultaneously satisfy the weak and strong energy conditions. Sensible stress-energy tensors usually satisfy both of them. Under most circumstances these sources are not perfect fluids and contain shear stresses. We show that for these systems the classical double copy associates the electric charge density to the Komar energy density. In addition, we demonstrate that the stress-energy tensors are determined by the electric charge density and their conservation equations.
