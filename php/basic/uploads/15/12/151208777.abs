Title: A Megaxion at 750 GeV as a First Hint of Low Scale String Theory
Authors: Luis E. Ibanez and Victor Martin-Lozano
Abstract: Low scale string models naturally have axion-like pseudoscalars which couple directly to gluons and photons (but not $W$s) at tree level. We show how they typically get tree level masses in the presence of closed string fluxes, consistent with the axion discrete gauge symmetry, in a way akin of the axion monodromy of string inflation and relaxion models. We discuss the possibility that the hints for a resonance at 750 GeV recently reported at ATLAS and CMS could correspond to such a heavy axion state (megaxion). Adjusting the production rate and branching ratios suggests the string scale to be of order $M_s$ ~ $7 - 10^4$ TeV, depending on the compactification geometry. If this interpretation was correct, one extra $Z'$ gauge boson could be produced before reaching the string threshold at LHC and future colliders.
