Title: RG flow of AC Conductivity in Soft Wall Model of QCD
Authors: Neha Bhatnagar and Sanjay Siwach
Abstract: We study the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of AC conductivity in soft wall model of holographic QCD. We consider the charged black hole metric and the explicit form of AC conductivity is obtained at the cut-off surface. We plot the numerical solution of conductivity flow as a function of radial co-ordinate. The equation of gauge field is also considered and the numerical solution is obtained for AC conductivity as a function of frequency. The results for AC conductivity are also obtained for different values of chemical potential and Gauss-Bonnet couplings.
