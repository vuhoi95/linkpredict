Title: Thermodynamics and Entanglement Entropy with Weyl Corrections
Authors: Anshuman Dey and Subhash Mahapatra and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We consider charged black holes in four dimensional AdS space, in the presence of a Weyl correction. We obtain the solution including the effect of back-reaction, perturbatively up to first order in the Weyl coupling, and study its thermodynamic properties. This is complemented by a calculation of the holographic entanglement entropy of the boundary theory. The consistency of results obtained from both computations is established.
