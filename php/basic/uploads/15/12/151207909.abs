Title: Landau Singularities and Symbology: One- and Two-loop MHV Amplitudes in  SYM Theory
Authors: Tristan Dennen and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We apply the Landau equations, whose solutions parameterize the locus of possible branch points, to the one- and two-loop Feynman integrals relevant to MHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. We then identify which of the Landau singularities appear in the symbols of the amplitudes, and which do not. We observe that all of the symbol entries in the two-loop MHV amplitudes are already present as Landau singularities of one-loop pentagon integrals.
