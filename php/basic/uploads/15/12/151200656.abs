Title: Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations and Pair-breaking in Planar QED
Authors: Kumar Abhinav and Prasanta K. Panigrahi
Abstract: Planar quantum electrodynamics, in presence of tree-level Chern-Simons term, is shown to support bound state excitations, with a threshold, not present for the pure Chern-Simons theory. In the present case, the bound state gets destabilized by vacuum fluctuations. The bound state itself finds justification in the duality of the theory with massive topological vector field. Thermal fluctuations further destabilize this state, leading to smooth dissociation at high temperatures. Physical systems are suggested for observing such a bound state.
