Title: Large-scale computation of the exponentially expanding universe in a  simplified Lorentzian type IIB matrix model
Authors: Yuta Ito and Jun Nishimura and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a conjectured nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. Recent studies on the Lorentzian version of the model have shown that only three out of nine spatial directions start to expand after some critical time. On the other hand, due to the unbounded action of the Lorentzian model, one has to introduce infrared (IR) cutoffs in order to make the partition function finite. In this work we investigate whether the effects of the IR cutoffs disappear in the infinite volume limit. For that purpose, we study a simplified model with large matrix size up to $N=256$ by Monte Carlo simulation. First we confirm the exponentially expanding behavior of the "universe". Then we generalize the form of the IR cutoffs by one parameter, and find that the results become universal in some region of the parameter. It is suggested that the effects of IR cutoffs disappear in this region, which is confirmed also from the studies of Schwinger-Dyson equations.
