Title: Non-Abelian Electric-Magnetic Duality with Supersymmetry in 4D and 10D
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present electric-magnetic (Hodge) duality formulation for non-Abelian gauge groups with N=1 supersymmetry in 3+1 (4D) dimensions. Our system consists of three multiplets: (i) A super-Yang-Mills vector multiplet (YMVM) $(A_\mu{}^I, \lambda^I)$, (ii) a dual vector multiplet (DVM) $(B_\mu{}^I, \chi^I)$, and (iii) an unphysical tensor multiplet (TM) $(C_{\mu\nu}{}^I, \rho^I, \varphi^I)$, with the index I for adjoint representation. The multiplets YMVM and DVM are dual to each other like: $G_{\mu\nu}{}^I = (1/2) \epsilon_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho\sigma} F_{\rho\sigma}{}^I$. The TM is unphysical, but still plays an important role for establishing the total consistency of the system, based on recently-developed tensor-hierarchy formulation. We also apply this technique to non-Abelian electric-magnetic duality in 9+1 (10D) dimensions. The extra bosonic auxiliary field $K_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_6}$ in 10D is shown to play an important role for the closure of supersymmetry on fields.
