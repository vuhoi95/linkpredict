Title: On the Topology of Real Bundle Pairs over Nodal Symmetric Surfaces
Authors: Penka Georgieva and Aleksey Zinger
Abstract: We give an alternative argument for the classification of real bundle pairs over smooth symmetric surfaces and extend this classification to nodal symmetric surfaces. We also classify the homotopy classes of automorphisms of real bundle pairs over symmetric surfaces. The two statements together describe the isomorphisms between real bundle pairs over symmetric surfaces up to deformation.
