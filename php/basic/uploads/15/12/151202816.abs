Title: Time-evolution of holographic entanglement entropy and metric  perturbations
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Jung Hun Lee
Abstract: We study the holographic entanglement entropy under small deformations of AdS, including time-dependence. It is found through perturbative analysis that the divergent terms are not affected and the change appears only in the finite terms. We also consider the entanglement thermodynamic first law, and calculate the entanglement temperature and confirm that it is inversely proportional to the size of the entangling region.
