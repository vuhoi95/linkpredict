Abstract: We propose new five-dimensional gauge theory descriptions of six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories arising from type IIA brane configurations including an $ON^0$-plane. The new five-dimensional gauge theories may have $SO$, $Sp$, and $SU$ gauge groups and further broaden the landscape of ultraviolet complete five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. When we include an $O8^-$-plane in addition to an $ON^0$-plane, T-duality yields two $O7^-$-planes at the intersections of an $ON^0$-plane and two $O5^0$-planes. We propose a novel resolution of the $O7^-$-plane with four D7-branes in such a configuration, which enables us to obtain three different types of five-dimensional gauge theories, depending on whether we resolve either none or one or two $O7^-$-planes. Such different possibilities yield a new five-dimensional duality between a D-type $SU$ quiver and an $SO-Sp$ quiver theories. We also claim that a twisted circle compactification of a six-dimensional superconformal field theory may lead to a five-dimensional gauge theory different from those obtained by a simple circle compactification.
