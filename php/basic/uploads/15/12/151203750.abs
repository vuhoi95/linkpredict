Abstract: We consider the interplay between explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking in strongly coupled field theories. Some well-known statements, such as the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, descend directly from the Ward identities and have thus a general relevance. Such Ward identities are recovered in gauge/gravity dual setups through holographic renormalization. In a simple paradigmatic three dimensional toy-model, we find analytic expressions for the two-point correlators which match all the quantum field theoretical expectations. Moreover, we have access to the full spectrum, which is reminiscent of linear confinement.
