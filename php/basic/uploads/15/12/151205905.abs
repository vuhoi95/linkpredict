Title: Critical line of the Ising model on 2-dimensional CDT and its dual
Authors: George M. Napolitano and Tatyana S. Turova
Abstract: In this paper we study the annealed coupling of an Ising model with 2-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation model. After a short review of previous results, we prove the existence of the so-called critical line and derive its analytical properties and asymptotics. In addition, relations between the model and its dual are investigated.
