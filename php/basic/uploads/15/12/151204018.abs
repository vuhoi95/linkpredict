Title: Conformal Transformations, Rotating String and Effects of angular  velocity on Accelerating Quark-Antiquark pair in $AdS_3$
Authors: Jafar Sadeghi and Fatemeh Razavi
Abstract: In order to study quark and anti-quark interaction, one should consider all effects of the medium in motion of the pair. Because the pair, is not produced at rest in QGP. So the velocity of the pair, has some effects on its interactions that should be taken into account. In this paper we apply some conformal transformations for a rotat- ing string dual to a rotating heavy quark in $AdS_3$ which construct an accelerating string dual to an accelerating quark and anti-quark pair. So, we can have a comparison between when pair has angular velocity or not. Then we can study effects of angular velocity on the accelerating quark and anti-quark which are constructed by performing special con- formal transformations, conformal SO(2,2) transformation and particular $SL(2,R)_L$ and $SL(2,R)_R$ transformation. The accelerating quark and anti-quark show different behavior with increasing in angular velocity. With useful numerical solutions we show that quark and anti-quark can deccelerate to achieve each other or accelerate to get away from each other. We will see variable behaviors of the pair in different transformations. There are various behavior like, permanent behavior, increase or decrese in acceleration or we will consider uncertain behavior.
