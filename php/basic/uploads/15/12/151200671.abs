Title: Nonperturbative emergence of Dirac fermion in strongly correlated  composite fermions of fractional quantum Hall effects
Authors: Yibin Yang and Xi Luo and Yue Yu
Abstract: The classic composite fermion field theory \cite{HLR} builds up an excellent framework to uniformly study important physical objects and globally explain anomalous experimental phenomena in fractional quantum Hall physics while there are also inherent weaknesses. We present a nonperturbative emergent Dirac fermion theory from this strongly correlated composite fermion field theory, which overcomes these serious long-standing shortcomings. The particle-hole symmetry of Dirac equation resolves this particle-hole symmetry enigma in the composite fermion field theory. With the help of presented numerical data, we show that for main Jain's sequences of fractional quantum Hall effects, this emergent Dirac fermion theory is most likely nonperturbatively stable.
