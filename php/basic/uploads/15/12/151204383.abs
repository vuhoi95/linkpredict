Title: Coherent Cascade Conjecture for Collapsing Solutions in Global AdS
Authors: Ben Freivogel and I-Sheng Yang
Abstract: We analyze the gravitational dynamics of a classical scalar field coupled to gravity in asymptotically AdS spacetime, which leads to black hole formation on the shortest nonlinear time scale for some initial conditions. We show that the observed collapse cannot be described by the well-known process of a random-phase cascade in the theory of weak turbulence. This implies that the dynamics on this time scale is highly sensitive to the phases of modes. We explore the alternative possibility of a coherent phase cascade and analytically find stationary solutions with completely coherent phases and power-law energy spectra. We show that these power-law spectra lead to diverging geometric backreaction, which is the likely precursor to black hole formation. In 4+1 dimensions, our stationary solution has the same power law energy spectrum as the final state right before collapse observed in numerical simulations. We conjecture that our stationary solutions describe the system shortly before collapse in other dimensions, and predict the energy spectrum.
