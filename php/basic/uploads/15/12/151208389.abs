Authors: Johannes M. Henn and Alexander V. Smirnov and Vladimir A. Smirnov
Abstract: We evaluate multiple polylogarithm values at sixth roots of unity up to weight six, i.e. of the form $G(a_1,\ldots,a_w;1)$ where the indices $a_i$ are equal to zero or a sixth root of unity, with $a_1\neq 1$. For $w\leq 6$, we present bases of the linear spaces generated by the real and imaginary parts of $G(a_1,\ldots,a_w;1)$ and present a table for expressing them as linear combinations of the elements of the bases.
