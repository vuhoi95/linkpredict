Title: E11 must be a symmetry of strings and branes
Authors: Alexander G. Tumanov and Peter West
Abstract: We construct the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and its vector representation in five and eleven dimensions and find the dynamical equations it predicts at low levels. Restricting these results to contain only the usual fields of supergravity and the generalised space-time to be the usual space-time we find the equations of motion of the five and eleven dimensional maximal supergravity theories. Since this non-linear realisation contains effects that are beyond the supergravity approximation and are thought to be present in an underlying theory we conclude that the low energy effective action of string and branes must possess an E11 symmetry.
