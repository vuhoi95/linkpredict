Title: Deformation quantization on jet manifolds
Authors: G. Sardanashvily and A. Zamyatin
Abstract: Deformation quantization conventionally is described in terms of multidifferential operators. Jet manifold technique is well-known provide the adequate formulation of theory of differential operators. We extended this formulation to the multidifferential ones, and consider their infinite order jet prolongation. The infinite order jet manifold is endowed with the canonical flat connection that provides the covariant formula of a deformation star-product.
