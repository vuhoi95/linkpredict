Title: Quantum Cosmology in Four Dimensions
Authors: Teresa Bautista and Andr√© Benevides and Atish Dabholkar and Akash Goel
Abstract: We analyze the cosmological solutions to the recently proposed nonlocal quantum effective action for gravity with a cosmological term. We show that the vacuum energy decays with a slow-roll parameter proportional to the anomalous gravitational dressings.
