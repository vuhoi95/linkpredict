Title: $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetry Partial Breaking and Tadpole Anomaly
Authors: R. Ahl Laamara and M. N. El Kinani and E. H Saidi and M. Vall
Abstract: We consider the $U(1) ^{n}$ extension of the effective $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $U(1) \times U(1) $ model of $arXiv:1204.2141$; and study the explicit relationship between partial breaking of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry constraint and D3 brane tadpole anomaly of type IIB string on Calabi-Yau threefolds in presence of H$^{RR}$ and H$^{NS}$ fluxes. We also comment on supersymmetry breaking in the particular $\mathcal{N}=2$ $U(1) $ Maxwell theory; and study its interpretation in connection with the tadpole anomaly with extra localized flux sources.
