Title: Inflationary field excursion in view of KÃ¤hler Moduli II inflation
Authors: Argha Banerjee and Ratna Koley
Abstract: We address the issue of how much the field excursion variable, $\Delta \phi $ can change for a given set of inflationary parameters as obtained from latest CMB observations. We use various classifications of inflationary models by means of their large-$N$ behaviour where $N$ is the number of e-folds. Observationally there is no upper bound on the number of e-foldings for an inflationary model. In this work it has been shown that it is possible to have an upper bound on $N$ for the range of inflation between horizon exit and its end. This in turn translates into an upper bound on the field excursion $\Delta\phi$. The entire work has been performed considering the K\"{a}hler Moduli inflation II (KMIII) model as the reference and comparing with the other universality classes of models. It has been explored the possibility of having super-Planckian and sub-Planckian field excursions within the framework of single field slow roll inflation.
