Abstract: We present the results of the calculations of longitudinal and Hall conductivities of AB-stacked bilayer graphene as a function of frequency, finite chemical potential, temperature both with and without magnetic fields on a base of 2- and 4-band effective models. The limited cases of the conductivities for direct current are derived. The relations being important for optoelectronic among Hall conductivities and Faraday, Kerr angles in the AB-bilayers samples in the electric and magnetic fields when the radiation passes across bilayer sheets on different kinds a substrate are obtained.
