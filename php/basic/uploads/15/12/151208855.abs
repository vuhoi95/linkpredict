Title: Van der Waals phase transition in the framework of holography
Authors: Xiao-Xiong Zeng and Li-Fang Li
Abstract: Phase structure of the quintessence Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole is probed with the nonlocal observables such as holographic entanglement entropy and two point correlation function. Our result shows that, as the case of the thermal entropy, both the observables exhibit the similar Van der Waals-like phase transition. To reinforce the conclusion, we further check the equal area law for the first order phase transition and critical exponent of the heat capacity for the second order phase transition. We also discuss the effect of the state parameter on the phase structure of the nonlocal observables.
