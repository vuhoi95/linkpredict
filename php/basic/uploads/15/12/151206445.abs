Title: Semi-Holography for Heavy Ion Collisions: Self-Consistency and First  Numerical Tests
Authors: Ayan Mukhopadhyay and Florian Preis and Anton Rebhan and Stefan A. Stricker
Abstract: We present an extended version of a recently proposed semi-holographic model for heavy-ion collisions, which includes self-consistent couplings between the Yang-Mills fields of the Color Glass Condensate framework and an infrared AdS/CFT sector, such as to guarantee the existence of a conserved energy-momentum tensor for the combined system that is local in space and time, which we also construct explicitly. Moreover, we include a coupling of the topological charge density in the glasma to the same of the holographic infrared CFT. The semi-holographic approach makes it possible to combine CGC initial conditions and weak-coupling glasma field equations with a simultaneous evolution of a strongly coupled infrared sector describing the soft gluons radiated by hard partons. As a first numerical test of the semi-holographic model we study the dynamics of fluctuating homogeneous color-spin-locked Yang-Mills fields when coupled to a homogeneous and isotropic energy-momentum tensor of the holographic IR-CFT, and we find rapid convergence of the iterative numerical procedure suggested earlier.
