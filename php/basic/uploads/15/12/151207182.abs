Title: Could reggeon field theory be an effective theory for QCD in the Regge  limit?
Authors: Jochen Bartels and Carlos Contreras and Gian Paolo Vacca
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the possibility whether, in the extreme limit of high energies and large transverse distances, reggeon field theory might serve as an effective theory of high energy scattering for strong interactions. We analyse the functional renormalization group equations (flow equations) of reggeon field theory and search for fixed points in the space of (local) reggeon field theories. We study in complementary ways the candidate for the scaling solution, investigate its main properties and briefly discuss possible physical interpretations.
