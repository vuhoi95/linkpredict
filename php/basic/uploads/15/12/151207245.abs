Title: On Swift Gravitons
Authors: Karim Benakli and Shira Chapman and Luc Darm√© and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We use the method of characteristics to study superluminal graviton (thereof called swift graviton) propagation in theories of higher curvature gravity of the form $($Riemann$)^2$, $($Riemann$)^3$, $\nabla^2 ($Riemann$)^2$ and $($Riemann$)^4$. We consider a pp-wave background. When probed by gravitons with an appropriate polarisation, several of the gravitational theories under consideration exhibit characteristic hypersurfaces outside the flat spacetime light-cone.
