Authors: Marc Henneaux and Alfredo PÃ©rez and David Tempo and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: In a recent paper (JHEP {\bf 1508} (2015) 021), we have investigated hypersymmetry bounds in the context of simple anti-de Sitter hypergravity in $2+1$ dimensions. We showed that these bounds involved non linearly the spin-$2$ and spin-$4$ charges, and were saturated by a class of extremal black holes, which are $\frac14$-hypersymmetric. We continue the analysis here by considering $(M,N)$-extended anti-de Sitter hypergravity models, based on the superalgebra $osp(M \vert 4) \oplus osp(N \vert 4)$. The asymptotic symmetry superalgebra is then the direct sum of two-copies of a $W$-superalgebra that contains $so(M)$ (or $so(N)$) Kac-Moody currents of conformal weight $1$, fermionic generators of conformal weight $5/2$ and bosonic generators of conformal weight $4$ in addition to the Virasoro generators. The nonlinear hypersymmetry bounds on the conserved charges are derived and shown to be saturated by a class of extreme hypersymmetric black holes which we explicitly construct.
