Title: Gravitational radiation in dynamical noncommutative spaces
Authors: S. A. Alavi and M. Amiri Nasab
Abstract: We investigate gravitational radiation in dynamical noncommutative spaces. By including corrections to the gravitational potential due to dynamical noncommutativity, we calculate the power in gravitational radiation and use observational data to place an upper bound on the noncommutativity parameter. We also study quantum interference induced by gravitational potential in the usual and dynamical noncommutative spaces, and compare the resulting phase difference in these cases with that in commutative space.
