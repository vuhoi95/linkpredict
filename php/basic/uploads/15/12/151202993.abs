Title: No evidence for bilinear condensate in parity-invariant  three-dimensional QED with massless fermions
Authors: Nikhil Karthik and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We present our numerical study of three-dimensional QED with 2, 4, 6 and 8 flavors of massless two-component fermions using a parity-preserving lattice regularization with Wilson fermions. We study the behavior of low-lying eigenvalues of the massless improved Wilson-Dirac operator as a function of three-dimensional physical volume, after taking the continuum limit at fixed physical volumes. We find the following evidences against the presence of bilinear condensate: the eigenvalues do not scale as the inverse of the three-dimensional physical volume, and the number variance associated with these eigenvalues do not exhibit ergodic behavior. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the associated eigenvectors exhibits a multi-fractal volume scaling. The relation satisfied by number variance and IPR suggests critical behavior.
