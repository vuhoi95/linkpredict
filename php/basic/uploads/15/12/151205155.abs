Title: Non-supersymmetric Asymmetric Orbifolds with Vanishing Cosmological  Constant
Authors: Yuji Satoh and Yuji Sugawara and Taiki Wada
Abstract: We study type II string vacua defined by torus compactifications accompanied by T-duality twists. We realize the string vacua, specifically, by means of the asymmetric orbifolding associated to the chiral reflections combined with a shift, which are interpreted as describing the compactification on `T-folds'. We discuss possible consistent actions of the chiral reflection on the Ramond-sector of the world-sheet fermions, and explicitly construct non-supersymmetric as well as supersymmetric vacua. Above all, we demonstrate a simple realization of non-supersymmetric vacua with vanishing cosmological constant at one loop. Our orbifold group is generated only by a single element, which results in simpler models than those with such property known previously.
