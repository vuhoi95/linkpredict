Title: On the reconstruction of Lifshitz spacetimes
Authors: Simon A. Gentle and Cynthia Keeler
Abstract: We consider the reconstruction of a Lifshitz spacetime from three perspectives: differential entropy (or "hole-ography"), causal wedges and entanglement wedges. We find that not all time-varying bulk curves in vacuum Lifshitz can be reconstructed via the differential entropy approach, adding a caveat to the general analysis of \cite{Headrick:2014eia}. We show that the causal wedge for Lifshitz spacetimes degenerates, while the entanglement wedge requires the additional consideration of a set of boundary-emanating light-sheets. The need to include bulk surfaces with no clear field theory interpretation in the differential entropy construction and the change in the entanglement wedge formation both serve as warnings against a naive application of holographic entanglement entropy proposals in Lifshitz spacetimes.
