Authors: M. A. Anacleto and D. Bazeia and F. A. Brito and J. C. Mota-Silva
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the Halmiton-Jacobi method to determine several thermodynamic quantities such as the temperature, entropy and specific heat of two-dimensional Horava-Lifshitz black holes by using the generalized uncertainty principles (GUP). We also address the product of horizons, mainly concerning the event, Cauchy, cosmological and virtual horizons.
