Title: Stress energy tensor renormalization for a spherically symmetric massive  scalar field on a quantum space-time
Authors: Nahuel Barrios and Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We consider a massive scalar field living on the recently found exact quantum space-time corresponding to vacuum spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity. The discreteness of the quantum space time naturally regularizes the scalar field, eliminating divergences. However, the resulting finite theory depends on the details of the micro physics. We argue that such dependence can be eliminated through a finite renormalization and discuss its nature. This is an example of how quantum field theories on quantum space times deal with the issues of divergences in quantum field theories.
