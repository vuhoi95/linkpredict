Title: Multi-spike strings in $AdS_3$ with mixed three-form fluxes
Authors: Aritra Banerjee and Abhishake Sadhukhan
Abstract: The string sigma model in $AdS_3\times S^3$ supported by mixed three-form fluxes has recently been proved to be integrable which led to a plethora of work in this background including proposals for S matrix and study of semiclassical string profiles. Motivated by this, in this paper, we present a study of `spiky' strings in this background. We analyze the string profiles in detail and also find the dispersion relation between the charges in the `long' string limit after solving the equations of motion perturbatively upto the leading order in the Neveu-Schwarz flux $b$. We find that the dispersion for 2 spikes gets corrected by the term $-\frac{b^2}{2}\log S$. We also discuss the fate of the solution in the limit of pure NS-NS flux.
