Title: Sextonions, Zorn Matrices, and e_{71/2}
Authors: Alessio Marrani and Piero Truini
Abstract: By exploiting suitably constrained Zorn matrices, we present a new construction of the algebra of sextonions (over the algebraically closed field C). This allows for an explicit construction, in terms of Jordan pairs, of the non-semisimple Lie algebra e_{71/2}, intermediate between e7 and e8, as well as of all Lie algebras occurring in the sextonionic row and column of the extended Freudenthal Magic Square.
