Title: Energy and stability of Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator
Authors: D. S. Kaparulin and S. L. Lyakhovich
Abstract: We study stability of higher-derivative dynamics from the viewpoint of more general correspondence between symmetries and conservation laws established by the Lagrange anchor. We show that classical and quantum stability may be provided if a higher-derivative model admits a bounded from below integral of motion and the Lagrange anchor that relates this integral to the time translation.
