Title: Toric data, Killing forms and complete integrability of geodesics in  Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$
Authors: Vladimir Slesar and Mihai Visinescu and Gabriel Eduard Vilcu
Abstract: In the present paper we show that the complete list of special Killing forms on the 5-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$ can be extracted using the symplectic potential and the classical Delzant construction. The results achieved here agree with previous ones obtained by direct computation, proving the reliability of the method which stands in fact as a general algorithm for toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. Finally, we discuss the integrability of geodesic motion in $Y^{p,q}$ spaces.
