Title: F-theory at order $Î±'^3$
Authors: Ruben Minasian and Tom G. Pugh and Raffaele Savelli
Abstract: We study the effective physics of F-theory at order $\alpha'^3$ in derivative expansion. We show that the ten-dimensional type IIB eight-derivative couplings involving the graviton and the axio-dilaton naturally descend from pure gravity in twelve dimensions. Upon compactification on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds, the non-trivial vacuum profile for the axio-dilaton leads to a new, genuinely N=1, $\alpha'^3$ correction to the four-dimensional effective action.
