Title: Stability of the Early Universe in Bigravity Theory
Authors: Katsuki Aoki and Kei-ichi Maeda and Ryo Namba
Abstract: We study the stability of a spherically symmetric perturbation around the flat Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\i}$tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime in the ghost-free bigravity theory, retaining nonlinearities of the helicity-$0$ mode of the massive graviton. It has been known that, when the graviton mass is smaller than the Hubble parameter, homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes suffer from the Higuchi-type ghost or the gradient instability against the linear perturbation in the bigravity. Hence, the bigravity theory has no healthy massless limit for cosmological solutions at linear level. In this paper we show that the instabilities can be resolved by taking into account nonlinear effects of the scalar graviton mode for an appropriate parameter space of coupling constants. The growth history in the bigravity can be restored to the result in general relativity in the early stage of the Universe, in which the St\"uckelberg fields are nonlinear and there is neither ghost nor gradient instability. Therefore, the bigravity theory has the healthy massless limit, and cosmology based on it is viable even when the graviton mass is smaller than the Hubble parameter.
