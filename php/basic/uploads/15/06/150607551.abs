Title: On Soft Theorems And Form Factors In N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: L. V. Bork and A. I. Onishchenko
Abstract: Soft theorems for the form factors of 1/2-BPS and Konishi operator supermultiplets are derived at tree level in N=4 SYM theory. They have a form identical to the one in the amplitude case. For MHV sectors of stress tensor and Konishi supermultiplets loop corrections to soft theorems are considered at one loop level. They also appear to have universal form in soft limit. Possible generalization of the on-shell diagrams to the form factors based on leading soft behavior is suggested. Finally, we give some comments on inverse soft limit and integrability of form factors in the limit $q^2\to 0$
