Title: Non-uniform horizons in Gauge/Gravity Duality
Authors: T. M. Moskalets and A. J. Nurmagambetov
Abstract: In this communication, based on our paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4186, we discuss a way of enhancing Gauge/Gravity Duality and response of a dual strongly coupled medium on placing the inhomogeneity on the gravity side.
