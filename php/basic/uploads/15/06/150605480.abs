Title: Supersymmetric AdS_6 Solutions of Type IIB Supergravity
Authors: Hyojoong Kim and Nakwoo Kim and Minwoo Suh
Abstract: We study the general requirement for supersymmetric AdS$_6$ solutions in type IIB supergravity. We employ the Killing spinor technique and study the differential and algebraic relations among various Killing spinor bilinears to find the canonical form of the solutions. Our result agrees precisely with the work of Apruzzi et. al. \cite{Apruzzi:2014qva} which used the pure spinor technique. We also obtained the four-dimensional theory through the dimensional reduction of type IIB supergravity on AdS$_6$. This effective action is essentially a nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields parametrizing $\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})/\textrm{SO}(2,1)$, modified by a scalar potential and coupled to Einstein gravity in Euclidean signature. We argue that the scalar potential can be explained by a subgroup CSO(1,1,1) $\subset\textrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ in a way analogous to gauged supergravity.
