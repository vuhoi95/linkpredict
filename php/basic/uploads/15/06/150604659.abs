Title: Conformal Bootstrap With Slightly Broken Higher Spin Symmetry
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Alexander Zhiboedov
Abstract: We consider conformal field theories with slightly broken higher spin symmetry in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. We analyze the crossing equation in the double light-cone limit and solve for the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents $\gamma_s$ with large spin $s$. The result depends on the symmetries and the spectrum of the unperturbed conformal field theory. We reproduce all known results and make further predictions. In particular we make a prediction for the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in the 3d Ising model.
