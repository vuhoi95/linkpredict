Abstract: In this paper we study the quantum cosmological Kantowski-Sachs model and solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace to obtain the wave function of the corresponding universe. The perfect fluid is described by the Schutz's canonical formalism, which allows to attribute dynamical degrees of freedom to matter. The time is introduced phenomenologically using the fluid's degrees of freedom. In particular, we adopt a stiff matter fluid. The viability of this model is analyzed and discussed.
