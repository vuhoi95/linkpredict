Title: Stability Bounds on Compact Astrophysical Objects from  Information-Entropic Measure
Authors: Marcelo Gleiser and Nan Jiang
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the stability of various self-gravitating astrophysical objects using a new measure of shape complexity known as configurational entropy. We apply the method to Newtonian polytropes, neutron stars with an Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation of state, and to self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with different self-couplings, showing that the critical stability region of these stellar configurations obtained from traditional perturbation methods correlates well with critical points of the configurational entropy with accuracy of a few percent or better.
