Title: Factorization of the 3d superconformal index with an adjoint matter
Authors: Chiung Hwang and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We work out the factorization of the 3d superconformal index for N = 2 $U(N_c)$ gauge theory withone adjoint chiral multiplet as well as $N_f$ fundamental, $N_a$ anti-fundamental chiral multiplets. Using the factorization,one can prove the Seiberg-like duality for N = 4 $U(N_c)$ theory with $N_f$ hypermultiplets at the index level. We explicitlyshow that monopole operators violating unitarity bound in a bad theory are mapped to free hypermultiplets in the dual side. For N = 2 $U(N_c)$ theory with one adjoint matter $X$, $N_f$ fundamental, $N_a$ anti-fundamental chiral multiplets with superpotential $W = tr X^{n+1}$, we work out Seiberg-like duality for this theory. The index computation provides combinatorial identities for a dual pair, which we carry out intensive numerical checks.
