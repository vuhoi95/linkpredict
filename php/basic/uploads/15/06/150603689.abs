Abstract: The planar quantum dynamics of spin-1/2 neutral particle interacting with electrical fields is considered. A set of first order differential equations are obtained directly from the planar Dirac equation with nonminimum coupling. New solutions of this system, in particular, for the Aharonov-Casher effect, are found and discussed in detail. Pauli equation is also obtained by studying the motion of the particle when it describes a circular path of constant radius. We also analyze the planar dynamics in the full space, including the $r=0$ region. The self-adjoint extension method is used to obtain the energy levels and wave functions of the particle for two particular values for the self-adjoint extension parameter. The energy levels obtained are analogous to the Landau levels and explicitly depend on the spin projection parameter.
