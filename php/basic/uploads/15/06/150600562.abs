Title: On a relativistic scalar particle subject to a Coulomb-type potential  given by Lorentz symmetry breaking effects
Authors: K. Bakke and H. Belich
Abstract: The behaviour of a relativistic scalar particle in a possible scenario that arises from the violation of the Lorentz symmetry is investigated. The background of the Lorentz symmetry violation is defined by a tensor field that governs the Lorentz symmetry violation out of the Standard Model Extension. Thereby, we show that a Coulomb-type potential can be induced by Lorentz symmetry breaking effects and bound states solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation can be obtained. Further, we discuss the effects of this Coulomb-type potential on the confinement of the relativistic scalar particle to a linear confining potential by showing that bound states solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation can also be achieved, and obtain a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of a parameter of the linear confining potential on the quantum numbers $\left\{n,l\right\}$ of the system.
