Title: The universal C*-algebra of the electromagnetic field
Authors: Detlev Buchholz and Fabio Ciolli and Giuseppe Ruzzi and Ezio Vasselli
Abstract: A universal C*-algebra of the electromagnetic field is constructed. It is represented in any quantum field theory which incorporates electromagnetism and expresses basic features of this field such as Maxwell's equations, Poincar\'e covariance and Einstein causality. Moreover, topological properties of the field resulting from Maxwell's equations are encoded in the algebra, leading to commutation relations with values in its center. The representation theory of the algebra is discussed with focus on vacuum representations, fixing the dynamics of the field.
