Title: Stealths on Anisotropic Holographic Backgrounds
Authors: Eloy Ayón-Beato and Mokhtar Hassaïne and María Montserrat Juárez-Aubry
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in exploring the existence of stealth configurations on anisotropic backgrounds playing a prominent role in the non-relativistic version of the gauge/gravity correspondence. By stealth configuration, we mean a nontrivial scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity whose energy-momentum tensor evaluated on the anisotropic background vanishes identically. In the case of a Lifshitz spacetime with a nontrivial dynamical exponent z, we spotlight the role played by the anisotropy to establish the holographic character of the stealth configurations, i.e. the scalar field is shown to only depend on the radial holographic direction. This configuration which turns out to be massless and without integration constants is possible for a unique value of the nonminimal coupling parameter. Then, using a simple conformal argument, we map this configuration into a stealth solution defined on the so-called hyperscaling violation metric which is conformally related to the Lifshitz spacetime. This holographic configuration obtained through a conformal mapping constitutes only a particular class within the stealth solutions defined on the hyperscaling violation as it is shown by deriving the most general stealth configurations. The case of the Schrodinger background is also exhaustively analyzed and we establish that the presence of the null direction makes their stealth configurations not necessarily holographic in general and characterized by a self-interacting behavior. Finally, for completeness we also study the stealth configurations on the Schrodinger inspired hyperscaling violation spacetimes.
