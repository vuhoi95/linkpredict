Title: Integrable potentials on Cayley-Klein spaces from quantum groups
Authors: N. A. Gromov and V. V. Kuratov
Abstract: The family of (super)integrable potentials on spaces with curvature developed by A. Ballesteros et all is extend to all two-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces with the help of contractions. It is shown that integrable systems on spaces with degenerate metrics are described by two Hamiltonians: one in the base and another in the fiber.
