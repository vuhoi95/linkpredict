Title: Remarks on Smarr's mass formula in the presence of both electric and  magnetic charges
Authors: V. S. Manko and H. García-Compeán
Abstract: The present paper clarifies how to use correctly Tomimatsu's representation of Komar integrals for consistently taking into account the contribution of magnetic charges in the generalized Smarr mass formula. In all three examples of the dyonic solutions considered by us, the sum of the two electromagnetic terms in that formula can be cast into the form $\bar{\cal Q}\Phi^H_{ext}$, where ${\cal Q}$ is the complex charge and $\Phi^H_{ext}$ the complex extension of the electric potential.
