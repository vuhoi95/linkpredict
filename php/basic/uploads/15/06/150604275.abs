Title: Unquenching the three-gluon vertex: A status report
Authors: Adrian L. Blum and Reinhard Alkofer and Markus Q. Huber and Andreas Windisch
Abstract: We discuss unquenching of the three-gluon vertex via its Dyson-Schwinger equation. We review the role of Furry's theorem and present first results for the quark triangle diagrams using non-perturbatively calculated dressing functions for the quark propagator and the quark-gluon vertex.
