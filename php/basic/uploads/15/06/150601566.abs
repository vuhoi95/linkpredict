Title: ${\cal R}^2$ Supergravity
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Alex Kehagias and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: We formulate $R^2$ pure supergravity as a scale invariant theory built only in terms of superfields describing the geometry of curved superspace. The standard supergravity duals are obtained in both "old" and "new" minimal formulations of auxiliary fields. These theories have massless fields in de Sitter space as they do in their non supersymmetric counterpart. Remarkably, the dual theory of $R^2$ supergravity in the new minimal formulation is an extension of the Freedman model, describing a massless gauge field and a massless chiral multiplet in de Sitter space, with inverse radius proportional to the Fayet-Iliopoulos term. This model can be interpreted as the "de-Higgsed" phase of the dual companion theory of $R+R^2$ supergravity.
