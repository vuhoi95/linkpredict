Title: Parametric Resonance and Dark Matter Axion-Like Particles
Authors: Ariel Arza and Paola Arias and Jorge Gamboa
Abstract: We study the local effects of an external time-dependent magnetic field on axion-like particles assuming they are all the dark matter of the universe. We find that under suitable conditions the amplitude of the dark matter field can resonate parametrically. The resonance depends on the velocity of the axion-like particles and scales quadratically with the strength} of the external magnetic field, $\frac{\rho}{\rho_{DM}} \sim {B_0}^3$. By considering typical experimental benchmark values, we find the resonance could amplify around two orders of magnitude the local energy density stored in the dark matter condensate.
