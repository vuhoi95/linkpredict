Abstract: We calculate static and spherically symmetric solutions for the Rastall modification of gravity to describe Neutron Stars (NS). The key feature of the Rastall gravity is the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor proportionally to the space-time curvature. Using realistic equations of state for the NS interior we place a conservative bound on the non-GR behaviour of the Rastall theory which should be $\lesssim 1\%$ level. This work presents the more stringent constraints on the deviations of GR caused by the Rastall proposal.
