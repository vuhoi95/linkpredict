Title: Navier-Stokes Equations on Black Hole Horizons and DC Thermoelectric  Conductivity
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: Within the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence we show that the DC thermoelectric conductivity can be obtained by solving the linearised, time-independent and forced Navier-Stokes equations on the black hole horizon for an incompressible and charged fluid.
