Title: $PT$-symmetric invisible defects and confluent Darboux-Crum  transformations
Authors: Francisco Correa and Vit Jakubsky and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We show that confluent Darboux-Crum transformations with emergent Jordan states are an effective tool for the design of optical systems governed by the Helmholtz equation under the paraxial approximation. The construction of generic, asymptotically real and periodic, $PT$-symmetric systems with local complex periodicity defects is discussed in detail. We show how the decay rate of the defect is related with the energy of the bound state trapped by the defect. In particular, the bound states in the continuum are confined by the periodicity defects with power law decay. We show that these defects possess complete invisibility; the wave functions of the system coincide asymptotically with the wave functions of the undistorted setting. The general results are illustrated with explicit examples of reflectionless models and systems with one spectral gap. We show that the spectral properties of the studied models are reflected by Lax-Novikov-type integrals of motion and associated supersymmetric structures of bosonized and exotic nature.
