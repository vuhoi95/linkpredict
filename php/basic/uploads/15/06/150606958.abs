Title: One-point Functions in Defect CFT and Integrability
Authors: Marius de Leeuw and Charlotte Kristjansen and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: We calculate planar tree level one-point functions of non-protected operators in the defect conformal field theory dual to the D3-D5 brane system with k units of the world volume flux. Working in the operator basis of Bethe eigenstates of the Heisenberg XXX_{1/2} spin chain we express the one-point functions as overlaps of these eigenstates with a matrix product state. For k=2 we obtain a closed expression of determinant form for any number of excitations, and in the case of half-filling we find a relation with the N\'eel state. In addition, we present a number of results for the limiting case of infinite k.
