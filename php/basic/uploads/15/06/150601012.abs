Title: Geometrical Applications of Split Octonions
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Otari Sakhelashvili
Abstract: It is shown that physical signals and space-time intervals modeled on split-octonion geometry naturally exhibit properties from conventional (3+1)-theory (e.g. number of dimensions, existence of maximal velocities, Heisenberg uncertainty, particle generations, etc.). This paper demonstrates these properties using an explicit representation of the automorphisms on split-octonions, the noncompact form of the exceptional Lie group G2. This group generates specific rotations of (3+4)-vector parts of split octonions with three extra time-like coordinates and in infinitesimal limit imitate standard Poincare transformations. In this picture translations are represented by non-compact Lorentz-type rotations towards the extra time-like coordinates. It is shown how the G2 algebra's chirality yields an intrinsic left-right asymmetry of a certain 3-vector (spin), as well as a parity violating effect on light emitted by a moving quantum system. Elementary particles are connected with the special elements of the algebra which nullify octonionic intervals. Then the zero-norm conditions lead to free particle Lagrangians, which allow virtual trajectories also and exhibit the appearance of spatial horizons governing by mass parameters.
