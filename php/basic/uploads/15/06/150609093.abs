Title: Two-loop off-shell QCD amplitudes in FDR
Authors: Ben Page and Roberto Pittau
Abstract: We link the FDR treatment of ultraviolet (UV) divergences to dimensional regularization up to two loops in QCD. This allows us to derive the one-loop and two-loop coupling constant and quark mass shifts necessary to translate infrared finite quantities computed in FDR to the MSbar renormalization scheme. As a by-product of our analysis, we solve a problem analogous to the breakdown of unitarity in the Four Dimensional Helicity (FDH) method beyond one loop. A fix to FDH is then presented that preserves the renormalizability properties of QCD without introducing evanescent quantities.
