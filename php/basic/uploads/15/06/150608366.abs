Title: False Vacuum Higgs Inflation and the Graviweak Unification
Authors: C. R. Das and L. V. Laperashvili
Abstract: In the present paper we develop a model of the Higgs inflation based on the non-minimal coupling of the Higgs boson to gravity predicted by Graviweak Unification. But later we get rid of the non-minimal coupling to gravity by making the conformal transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. We construct a self-consistent $Spin(4,4)$-invariant model of the unification of gravity with weak $SU(2)$ interactions in the assumption of the existence of visible and invisible sectors of the Universe. Assuming the interaction between the ordinary and mirror Higgs fields, we develop a special Hybrid model of inflation. According to this model, the inflaton starts trapped from the "false vacuum" of the Universe at the Higgs field VEV $v\sim 10^{18}$ GeV (in the visible world). Then the inflations of the two Higgs doublet fields, visible $\phi$ and mirror $\phi'$, lead to the emergence of the Standard Model vacua at the Electroweak scales with the Higgs boson VEVs $v_1\approx 246$ GeV and $v'_1=\zeta v_1$ in the visible and invisible worlds, respectively. Considering the results of cosmology and calculating the number of e-folds $N^*$, we predict $\zeta\simeq 100-115$ for $N^*\simeq 50-60$, in agreement with previous results of the model with broken mirror parity. We also consider RGEs, taking into account the mixing term - the interaction between the ordinary and mirror Higgs bosons, assuming the smallness of the mixing coupling.
