Title: Confinement-Deconfinment Phase Transition for Heavy Quarks
Authors: Yi Yang and Pei-Hung Yuan
Abstract: We study confinement-deconfinement phase transition for heavy quarks in a bottom-up holographic QCD model. We consider a black hole background in an Einstein-Maxwell-scalar system and add probe open strings to the background. Combining the various configurations of the open strings and the phase structure of the black hole background itself, we obtain the confinement-deconfinement phase diagram for heavy quarks in the holographic QCD model.
