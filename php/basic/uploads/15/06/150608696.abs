Title: Black Ring and Kerr Ellipsoid - Solitonic Configurations in Modified  Finsler Gravity
Authors: Subhash Rajpoot and Sergiu I. Vacaru
Abstract: We study an effective Einstein-Finsler theory on tangent Lorentz bundle constructed as a "minimal" extension of general relativity. Black ring and Kerr like ellipsoid exact solutions and soliton configurations are presented. In this endeavor the relevant metric depends not only on four dimensional spacetime coordinates and also on velocity type variables that can be interpreted as additional coordinates in the space of "extra dimensions".
