Title: A test of bosonization at the level of four-point functions in  Chern-Simons vector models
Authors: Akshay Bedhotiya and Shiroman Prakash
Abstract: We study four-point functions in Chern-Simons vector models in the large $N$ limit. We compute the four-point function of the scalar primary to all orders in the `t Hooft coupling $\lambda=N/k$ in $U(N)_k$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a fundamental fermion, in both the critical and non-critical theory, for a particular case of the external momenta. These theories cover the entire 3-parameter "quasi-boson" and 2-parameter "quasi-fermion" families of 3-dimensional quantum field theories with a slightly-broken higher spin symmetry. Our results are consistent with the celebrated bosonization duality, as we explicitly verify by calculating four-point functions in the free critical and non-critical bosonic theories.
