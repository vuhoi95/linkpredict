Title: Perturbative Vacuum Wavefunctional for Gauge Theories in the Milne Space
Authors: Sangyong Jeon and Thomas Epelbaum
Abstract: The spectrum of vacuum fluctuations in the Milne space (i.e. the tau-eta coordinate system) is an important ingredient in the thermalization studies in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this paper, the Schrodinger functional for the gauge theory perturbative vacuum is derived for the Milne space. The Wigner-transform of the corresponding vacuum density functional is also found together with the propagators. We finally identify the fluctuation spectrum in vacuum, and show the equivalence between the present approach and the symplectic product based method.
