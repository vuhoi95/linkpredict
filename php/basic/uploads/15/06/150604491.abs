Title: Loop expansion of the average effective action in the functional  renormalization group approach
Authors: Peter M. Lavrov and Boris S. Merzlikin
Abstract: We formulate a perturbation expansion for the effective action in a new approach to the functional renormalization group method based on the concept of composite fields for regulator functions being their most essential ingredients. We demonstrate explicitly the principal difference between the properties of effective actions in these two approaches existing already on the one-loop level in a simple gauge model.
