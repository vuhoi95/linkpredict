Title: Entanglement temperature for the excitation of SYM theory in  (De)confinement phase
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Masafumi Ishihara
Abstract: We study the holographic supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, which is living in a hyperbolic space, in terms of the entanglement entropy. The theory contains a parameter ($C$) corresponding to the excitation of the SYM theory, and it controls the dynamical properties of the theory. The entanglement temperature ($T_{ent}$) is obtained by imposing the thermodynamic law for the relative entanglement entropy and the energy density of the excitation. This temperature is available at any value of the parameter $C$ even in the region where the Hawking temperature disappears. With this new temperature, the dynamical properties of the excited SYM theory are examined in terms of the thermodynamic law. We could find the signatures of phase transitions of the theory.
