Title: Large BCFT moduli in open string field theory
Authors: Carlo Maccaferri and Martin Schnabl
Abstract: We use the recently constructed solution for marginal deformations by one of the authors, to analytically relate the BCFT modulus (lambda_BCFT) to the coefficient of the boundary marginal field in the solution (lambda_SFT). We explicitly find that the relation is not one to one and the same value of lambda_SFT corresponds to a pair of different lambda_BCFT 's: a "small" one, and a "large" one. The BCFT moduli space is fully covered, but the coefficient of the marginal field in the solution is not a good global coordinate on such a space.
