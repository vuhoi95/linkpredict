Title: T-duality simplifies bulk-boundary correspondence: some higher  dimensional cases
Authors: Varghese Mathai and Guo Chuan Thiang
Abstract: Recently we introduced T-duality in the study of topological insulators, and used it to show that T-duality trivialises the bulk-boundary correspondence in 2 dimensions. In this paper, we partially generalise these results to higher dimensions and briefly discuss the 4D quantum Hall effect.
