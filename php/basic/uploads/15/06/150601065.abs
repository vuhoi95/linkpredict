Title: E$_{6(6)}$ Exceptional Field Theory: Review and Embedding of Type IIB
Authors: Arnaud Baguet and Olaf Hohm and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We review E$_{6(6)}$ exceptional field theory with a particular emphasis on the embedding of type IIB supergravity, which is obtained by picking the GL$(5)\times {\rm SL}(2)$ invariant solution of the section constraint. We work out the precise decomposition of the E$_{6(6)}$ covariant fields on the one hand and the Kaluza-Klein-like decomposition of type IIB supergravity on the other. Matching the symmetries, this allows us to establish the precise dictionary between both sets of fields. Finally, we establish on-shell equivalence. In particular, we show how the self-duality constraint for the four-form potential in type IIB is reconstructed from the duality relations in the off-shell formulation of the E$_{6(6)}$ exceptional field theory.
