Abstract: In this paper we examine the properties of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls in two models with different scalar field potentials. The obtained results demonstrate that in the general case $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls possess properties, which differ considerably from those of Q-balls in the nongauged case with the same forms of the scalar field potential. In particular, it is shown that in some cases the charge of $U(1)$ gauged Q-ball can be bounded from above, whereas it is not so for the corresponding nongauged Q-ball. Our conclusions are supported both by analytical considerations and numerical calculations.
