Title: On extended symmetries for the Galileon
Authors: Johannes Noller and Vishagan Sivanesan and Mikael von Strauss
Abstract: We investigate a large class of infinitesimal, but fully nonlinear in the field, transformations of the Galileon and search for extended symmetries. The transformations involve powers of the coordinates $x$ and the field $\pi$ up to any finite order $N$. Up to quadratic order the structure of these symmetry transformations is the unique generalisation of both the infinitesimal version of the standard Galileon shift symmetry as well as a recently discovered infinitesimal extension of this symmetry. The only higher-order extensions of this symmetry we recover are (`Galileon dual' versions of) symmetries of the standard kinetic term.
