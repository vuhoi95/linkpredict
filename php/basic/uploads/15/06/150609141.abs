Title: Towards relativistic quantum geometry
Authors: Luis Santiago Ridao and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We obtain a gauge-invariant relativistic quantum geometry by using a Weylian-like manifold with a geometric scalar field which provides a gauge-invariant relativistic quantum theory in which the algebra of the Weylian-like field depends on observers. An example for a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black-hole is studied.
