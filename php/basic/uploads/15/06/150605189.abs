Title: Planar limit of 1D many-body system
Authors: Fen Zuo and Yi-Hong Gao
Abstract: We review one dimensional matrix theory and its variations, collective field theory and quantum phase space description. In the planar limit, these theories become classical and can be easily analyzed. With these descriptions, one dimensional interacting many-body system can be solved exactly when the particle number goes to infinity. As an example, bosonic and two-component fermionic systems with a $\delta$-function interaction are analyzed in detail.
