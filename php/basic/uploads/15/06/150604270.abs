Abstract: We consider a certain ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric, $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ invariant, subsector of the $\omega$-deformed family of $SO(8)$-gauged ${\cal N}=8$ four-dimensional supergravities. The theory contains two scalar fields and two pseudoscalar fields. We look for stationary points of the scalar potential, corresponding to AdS vacua in the theory. One of these, which breaks all supersymmetries but is nonetheless stable, is new. It exists only when $\omega\ne 0$. We construct supersymmetric domain wall solutions in the truncated theory, and we give a detailed analysis of their holographic dual interpretations using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Domain walls where the pseudoscalars vanish were studied previously, but those with non-vanishing pseudoscalars, which we analyse numerically, are new. The pseudoscalars are associated with supersymmetric mass deformations in the CFT duals. When $\omega$ is zero, the solutions can be lifted to M-theory, where they approach the Coulomb-branch flows of dielectric M5-branes wrapped on $S^3$ in the deep IR.
