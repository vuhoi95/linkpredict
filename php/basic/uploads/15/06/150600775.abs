Abstract: We consider integer quantum Hall states and calculate bulk entanglement spectrum by formulating the correlation matrix in guiding center representation. Our analytical approach is based on the projection operator with redefining the inner product of states in Hilbert space to take care of the restriction imposed by the (rectangle-tiled) checkerboard partition. The resultant correlation matrix contains the coupling constants between states of different guiding centers parameterized by magnetic length and the period of partition. We find various band-crossings by tuning the flux $\Phi$ threading each chekerborad pixel and by changing filling factor $\nu$. When $\nu=1$ and $\Phi=2\pi$, or $\nu=2$ and $\Phi=\pi$, one Dirac band crossing is found. For $\nu=1$ and $\Phi=\pi$, the band crossings are in the form of nodal line, enclosing the Brillouin zone. As for $\nu=2$ and $\Phi=2\pi$, the doubled Dirac point, or the quadratic point, is seen. Besides, we infer that the quadratic point is protected by C$_4$ symmetry of the checkerboard partition since it evolves into two separate Dirac points when the symmetry is lowered to C$_2$. In addition, we also identify the emerging symmetries responsible for the symmetric bulk entanglement spectra, which are absent in the underlying quantum Hall states.
