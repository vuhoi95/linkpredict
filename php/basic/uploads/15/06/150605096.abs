Title: Neutron-Antineutron Oscillation as a Signal of CP Violation
Authors: Zurab Berezhiani and Arkady Vainshtein
Abstract: Assuming the Lorentz and CPT invariances we show that neutron-antineutron oscillation implies breaking of CP along with baryon number violation -- i.e. two of Sakharov conditions for baryogenesis. The oscillation is produced by the unique operator in the effective Hamiltonian. This operator mixing neutron and antineutron preserves charge conjugation C and breaks P and T. External magnetic field always leads to suppression of oscillations. Its presence does not lead to any new operator mixing neutron and antineutron.
