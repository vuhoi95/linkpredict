Title: Supergravity divergences, supersymmetry and automorphic forms
Authors: Guillaume Bossard and Axel Kleinschmidt
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of divergences in maximal supergravity in various dimensions from the point of view of supersymmetry constraints on the U-duality invariant threshold functions defining the higher derivative couplings in the effective action. Our method makes use of tensorial differential equations that constrain these couplings. We study in detail the Fourier modes and wave-front sets of the associated automorphic functions and find that they are always associated to special nilpotent orbits.
