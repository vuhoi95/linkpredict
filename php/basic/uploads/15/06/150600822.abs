Title: Non-Abelian $SU(3)_k$ anyons: inversion identities for higher rank face  models
Authors: Holger Frahm and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: The spectral problem for an integrable system of particles satisfying the fusion rules of $SU(3)_k$ is expressed in terms of exact inversion identities satisfied by the commuting transfer matrices of the integrable fused $A_2^{(1)}$ interaction round a face (IRF) model of Jimbo, Miwa and Okado. The identities are proven using local properties of the Boltzmann weights, in particular the Yang-Baxter equation and unitarity. They are closely related to the consistency conditions for the construction of eigenvalues obtained in the Separation of Variables approach to integrable vertex models.
