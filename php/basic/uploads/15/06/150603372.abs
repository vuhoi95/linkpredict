Title: Supersymmetric Duality in Deformed Superloop Space
Authors: Mir Faizal and Tsou Sheung Tsun
Abstract: In this paper, we will analyse the superloop space formalism for a four dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in deformed superspace. We will deform the $\mathcal{N} =1$ superspace by imposing non-anticommutativity. This non-anticommutative deformation of the superspace will break half the supersymmetry of the original theory. So, this theory will have $\mathcal{N} =1/2$ supersymmetry. We will analyse the superloop space duality for this deformed supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the $\mathcal{N} =1/2$ superspace formalism. We will demonstrate that the sources in the original theory will become monopoles in the dual theory, and the monopoles in the original theory will become sources in the dual theory.
