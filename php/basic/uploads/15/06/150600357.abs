Title: Three Point Functions in the Large N=4 Holography
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Hyunsu Kim
Abstract: The 16 higher spin currents with spins (1, 3/2, 3/2, 2), (3/2, 2, 2, 5/2), (3/2, 2, 2, 5/2) and (2, 5/2, 5/2, 3) in an extension of large N=4 `nonlinear' superconformal algebra in two dimensions were obtained previously. By analyzing the zero mode eigenvalue equations carefully, the three point functions of bosonic (higher spin) currents with two scalars for any finite N (where SU(N+2) is the group of coset) and k (the level of spin-1 Kac Moody current) are obtained. Furthermore, the 16 higher spin currents with above spin contents in an extension of large N=4 `linear' superconformal algebra are obtained for generic N and k implicitly. The corresponding three point functions are also determined. Under the large N 't Hooft limit, the two corresponding three point functions in the nonlinear and linear versions coincide with each other although they are completely different for finite N and k.
