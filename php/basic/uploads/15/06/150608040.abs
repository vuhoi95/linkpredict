Title: Supersymmetric AdS_7 backgrounds in half-maximal supergravity and  marginal operators of (1,0) SCFTs
Authors: Jan Louis and Severin Lust
Abstract: We determine the supersymmetric AdS_7 backgrounds of seven-dimensional half-maximal gauged supergravities and show that they do not admit any deformations that preserve all 16 supercharges. We compare this result to the conformal manifold of the holographically dual (1,0) superconformal field theories and show that accordingly its representation theory implies that no supersymmetric marginal operators exist.
