Title: Classical Virasoro irregular conformal block II
Authors: Chaiho Rim and Hong Zhang
Abstract: We present a new systematic way to evaluate the classical limit of the Virasoro irregular conformal block for arbitrary rank n based on the irregular partition function. In addition, we prove that the classical irregular conformal block has the exponential form as suggested by A. Zamolodchikov and Al. Zamolodchikov for the regular case. We provide an explicit calculation for the rank 2 case in detail.
