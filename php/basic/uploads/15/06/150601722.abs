Title: Spinning the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: David Berenstein and Eric Dzienkowski and Robin Lashof-Regas
Abstract: We construct various exact analytical solutions of the $SO(3)$ BMN matrix model that correspond to rotating fuzzy spheres and rotating fuzzy tori.These are also solutions of Yang Mills theory compactified on a sphere times time and they are also translationally invariant solutions of the $\mathcal{N} = 1^*$ field theory with a non-trivial charge density. The solutions we construct have a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, where $N$ is the rank of the matrices. After an appropriate ansatz, we reduce the problem to solving a set of polynomial equations in $2N$ real variables. These equations have a discrete set of solutions for each value of the angular momentum. We study the phase structure of the solutions for various values of $N$. Also the continuum limit where $N\to \infty$, where the problem reduces to finding periodic solutions of a set of coupled differential equations. We also study the topology change transition from the sphere to the torus.
