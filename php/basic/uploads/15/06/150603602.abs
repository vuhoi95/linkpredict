Title: Siklos waves in Poincaré gauge theory
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: A class of Siklos waves, representing exact vacuum solutions of general relativity with a cosmological constant, is extended to a new class of Siklos waves with torsion, defined in the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge theory. Three particular exact vacuum solutions of this type, the generalized Kaigorodov, the homogeneous and the exponential solution, are explicitly constructed.
