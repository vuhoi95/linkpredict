Title: Higgs phenomenon for higher spin fields on AdS_3
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida
Abstract: In a previous work, a marginal deformation of 2d coset type model with N=3 superconformal symmetry was studied, and it was interpreted as a change of boundary conditions for bulk fields in the dual higher spin theory. The deformation breaks generic higher spin gauge symmetry, and the generated mass of a spin 2 field was computed. The deformation might be related to the introduction of finite string tension in a superstring theory. In this paper, we extend the analysis and compute the masses of generic higher spin fields at the leading order of 1/c (c is the CFT central charge) but at the full order of the deformation parameter. We find that the masses are not generated for so(3)_R singlet higher spin fields at this order and the spectrum is the Regge-like one for so(3)_R triplet higher spin-charged fields.
