Title: Vacuum Persistence in Fierz-Pauli Theory on a Curved Background
Authors: Sungmin Hwang and Dennis Schimmel
Abstract: By explicitly constructing the Hilbert space, Higuchi showed that there is a lower bound on the mass of a minimally-coupled free spin-2 field on a curved background \cite{HiguchiBound}. Using the vacuum persistence amplitude, we show that this bound is modified by taking into account additional terms not prohibited by symmetry in the case of a maximally symmetric spacetime. This result can further be generalized to the maximally symmetric space case, such as the FRW universe, and its corresponding bound of the deformation parameter is discussed.
