Title: Entanglement entropy of Wilson surfaces from bubbling geometries in  M-theory
Authors: Simon A. Gentle and Michael Gutperle and Chrysostomos Marasinou
Abstract: We consider solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity constructed in [1,2] that are half-BPS, locally asymptotic to $AdS_7\times S^4$ and are the holographic dual of heavy Wilson surfaces in the six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theory. Using these bubbling solutions we calculate the holographic entanglement entropy for a spherical entangling surface in the presence of a planar Wilson surface. In addition, we calculate the holographic stress tensor and, by evaluating the on-shell supergravity action, the expectation value of the Wilson surface operator.
