Title: Hydrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions from Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in  AdS_3
Authors: Han-Chih Chang and Mitsutoshi Fujita and Matthias Kaminski
Abstract: In this presentation we review our work on Abelian Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional AdS black brane backgrounds, with both integer and non-integer Chern-Simons coupling. Such theories can be derived from several string theory constructions, and we found exact solutions in the low frequency, low momentum limit (omega, k << T, the hydrodynamic limit). Our results are translated into correlation functions of vector operators in the dual strongly coupled 1+1-dimensional quantum field theory with a chiral anomaly at non-zero temperature T, via the holographic correspondence. The applicability of the hydrodynamic limit is discussed, together with the comparison between an exact field theoretic computation and the found holographic correlation functions in the conformal case.
