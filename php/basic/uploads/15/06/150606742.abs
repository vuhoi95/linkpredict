Title: Imaginary Interactions with Minimum Length
Authors: Mir Faizal and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We analyze the effect of having minimum length on a two dimensional anisotropic simple harmonic oscillator with PT symmetric imaginary interaction perturbatively. First order correction to the general state is calculated analytically to show that it remains real as long as PT symmetry is unbroken. The characteristics of PT phase transition remain unaltered in this deformed formulation of quantum mechanics.
