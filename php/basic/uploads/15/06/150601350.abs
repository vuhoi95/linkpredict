Title: Thermodynamics and CP-odd transport in Holographic QCD with Finite  Magnetic Field
Authors: Tara Drwenski and Umut Gursoy and Ioannis Iatrakis
Abstract: We consider a bottom-up holographic model of QCD at finite temperature T and magnetic field B, and study dependence of thermodynamics and CP-odd transport on these variables. As the magnetic field couples to the flavor sector only, one should take the Veneziano limit where the number of flavors and colors are large while their ratio is kept fixed. We investigate the corresponding holographic background in the approximation where the ratio of flavors to colors is finite but small. We demonstrate that B-dependence of the entropy of QCD is in qualitative agreement with the recent lattice studies. Finally we study the CP-odd transport properties of this system. In particular, we determine the Chern-Simons decay rate at finite B and T, that is an important ingredient in the Chiral Magnetic Effect.
