Title: On the inhomogeneous T-Q relation for quantum integrable models
Authors: Yupeng Wang and Wen-Li Yang and Junpeng Cao and Kangjie Shi
Abstract: The off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz method [1] is used to revisit the periodic XXX Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain. It is found that the spectrum of the transfer matrix can be characterized by an inhomogeneous T-Q relation, a natural but nontrivial extension of Baxter's T-Q relation [2].
