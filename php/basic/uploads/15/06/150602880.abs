Abstract: Bipartite on-shell diagrams are the latest tool in constructing scattering amplitudes. In this letter we prove that an on-shell diagram process a rational top-form if and only if the algebraic ideal comprised of the geometrical constraints can be shifted linearly during successive Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten integrations. With a proper geometric interpretation of the constraints in the Grassmannian manifold, the rational top-form integration contours can thus be obtained, and understood, in a straightforward way. All top-form integrands of arbitrary higher loops can therefore be derived recursively, completing the top-form picture of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM scattering amplitudes proposed by us earlier. Scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric ($\mathcal{N}=4$) Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory can thus be greatly simplified due to the existence of top-forms comprised of rational functions of the minors of the constraint matrices.
