Title: Low Energy Theorems of Quantum Gravity from Effective Field Theory
Authors: John F. Donoghue and Barry R. Holstein
Abstract: In this survey, we review some of the low energy quantum predictions of General Relativity which are independent of details of the yet unknown high-energy completion of the gravitational interaction. Such predictions can be extracted using the techniques of effective field theory.
