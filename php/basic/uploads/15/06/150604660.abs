Authors: Pavel Yu. Moshin and Alexander A. Reshetnyak
Abstract: We continue our research Nucl.Phys B888, 92 (2014); Int. J. Mod. Phys. A29, 1450159 (2014); Phys. Lett. B739, 110 (2014); Int. J. Mod. Phys. A30, 1550021 (2015) and extend the class of finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with odd-valued parameters $\lambda_{a}$, $a=1,2$, introduced in these works. In doing so, we evaluate the Jacobians induced by finite BRST-antiBRST transformations linear in functionally-dependent parameters, as well as those induced by finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with arbitrary functional parameters. The calculations cover the cases of gauge theories with a closed algebra, dynamical systems with first-class constraints, and general gauge theories. The resulting Jacobians in the case of linearized transformations are different from those in the case of polynomial dependence on the parameters. Finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with arbitrary parameters induce an extra contribution to the quantum action, which cannot be absorbed into a change of the gauge. These transformations include an extended case of functionally-dependent parameters that implies a modified compensation equation, which admits non-trivial solutions leading to a Jacobian equal to unity. Finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with functionally-dependent parameters are applied to the Standard Model, and an explicit form of functionally-dependent parameters $\lambda_{a}$ is obtained, providing the equivalence of path integrals in any $3$-parameter $R_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$-like gauges. The Gribov--Zwanziger theory is extended to the case of the Standard Model, and a form of the Gribov horizon functional is suggested in the Landau gauge, as well as in $R_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$-like gauges, in a gauge-independent way using field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations, and in $R_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$-like gauges using transverse-like non-Abelian gauge fields.
