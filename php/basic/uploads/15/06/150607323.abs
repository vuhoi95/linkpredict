Title: Stringy Horizons and UV/IR Mixing
Authors: Roy Ben-Israel and Amit Giveon and Nissan Itzhaki and Lior Liram
Abstract: The target-space interpretation of the exact (in $\alpha'$) reflection coefficient for scattering from Euclidean black-hole horizons in classical string theory is studied. For concreteness, we focus on the solvable $SL(2, \mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole. It is shown that it exhibits a fascinating UV/IR mixing, dramatically modifying the late-time behavior of general relativity. We speculate that this might play an important role in the black-hole information puzzle, as well as in clarifying features related with the non-locality of Little String Theory.
