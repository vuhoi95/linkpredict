Title: Effect of coordinate noncommutativity on the mass of a particle in a  uniform field and the equivalence principle
Authors: Kh. P. Gnatenko and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in a uniform field in noncommutative space which is rotationally invariant. On the basis of exact calculations it is shown that there is an effect of coordinate noncommutativity on the mass of a particle. A particular case of motion of a particle in a uniform gravitational field is considered and the equivalence principle is studied. We propose the way to solve the problem of violation of the equivalence principle in the rotationally invariant noncommutative space.
