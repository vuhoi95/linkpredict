Title: Exceptional Lie Algebras at the very Foundations of Space and Time
Authors: Alessio Marrani and Piero Truini
Abstract: While describing the results of our recent work on exceptional Lie and Jordan algebras, so tightly intertwined in their connection with elementary particles, we will try to stimulate a critical discussion on the nature of spacetime and indicate how these algebraic structures can inspire a new way of going beyond the current knowledge of fundamental physics.
