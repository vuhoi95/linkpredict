Abstract: Monopole operators play a central role in 3 dimensional supersymmetric dualities: a careful understanding of their spectrum is necessary to match chiral operators on either sides of a conjectured duality. In Chern-Simons theories ($k\neq0$), monopole operators acquire an electric charge, thus they need to be "dressed" by chiral matter superfields to be made gauge-invariant. Here we present strong evidence that "dressed" monopoles appear in $SU(N)$ chiral theories even for $k=0$ because of mixed CS terms generated along certain Coulomb branch directions. Our analysis is based on the dimensional reduction of 4-dimensional dualities which, for the simplest s-confining case, allows us to easily identify the spectrum of the electric chiral operators.
