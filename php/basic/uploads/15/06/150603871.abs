Title: Duality walls and defects in 5d N=1 theories
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Hee-Cheol Kim
Abstract: We propose an explicit description of duality walls which encode at low energy the global symmetry enhancement expected in the UV completion of certain five-dimensional gauge theories. The proposal is supported by explicit localization computations and implies that the instanton partition function of these theories satisfies novel and unexpected integral equations.
