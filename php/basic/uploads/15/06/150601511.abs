Title: Cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry as a quantum fluctuation
Authors: Archil Kobakhidze and Adrian Manning
Abstract: We entertain a new paradigm according to which the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry is generated as a large-scale quantum fluctuation over the baryon-symmetric state that occurred during the cosmic inflation.
