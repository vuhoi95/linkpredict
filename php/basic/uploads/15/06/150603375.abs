Title: Polymer quantization versus the Snyder noncommutative space
Authors: M. A. Gorji and K. Nozari and B. Vakili
Abstract: We study a noncanonical Hilbert space representation of the polymer quantum mechanics. It is shown that Heisenberg algebra get some modifications in the constructed setup from which a generalized uncertainty principle will naturally come out. Although the extracted physical results are the same as those obtained from the standard canonical representation, the noncanonical representation may be notable in view of its possible connection with the generalized uncertainty theories suggested by string theory. In this regard, by considering an Snyder-deformed Heisenberg algebra we show that since the translation group is not deformed it can be identified with a polymer-modified Heisenberg algebra. In classical level, it is shown the noncanonical Poisson brackets are related to their canonical counterparts by means of a Darboux transformation on the corresponding phase space.
