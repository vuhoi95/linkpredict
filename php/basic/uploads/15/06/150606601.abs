Title: S-Matrices and Quantum Group Symmetry of k-Deformed Sigma Models
Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and J. Luis Miramontes and David M. Schmidtt
Abstract: Recently, several kinds of integrable deformations of the string world sheet theory in the gauge/gravity correspondence have been constructed. One class of these, the k deformations associated to the more general q deformations but with q=exp(i pi/k) a root of unity, has been shown to be related to a particular discrete deformation of the principal chiral models and (semi-)symmetric space sigma models involving a gauged WZW model. We conjecture a form for the exact S-matrices of the bosonic integrable field theories of this type. The S-matrices imply that the theories have a hidden infinite dimensional affine quantum group symmetry. We provide some evidence, via quantum inverse scattering techniques, that the theories do indeed possess the finite-dimensional part of this quantum group symmetry.
