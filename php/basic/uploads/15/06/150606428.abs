Title: Tunneling in Theories with Many Fields
Authors: Michael Dine and Sonia Paban
Abstract: The possibility of a landscape of metastable vacua raises the question of what fraction of vacua are truly long lived. Naively any would-be vacuum state has many nearby decay paths, and all possible decays must be suppressed. An interesting model of this phenomena consists of $N$ scalars with a random potential of fourth order. Here we show that the scaling of the typical minimal bounce action with $N$ is readily understood, and differs from statements in the literature. We discuss the extension to more realistic landscape models.
