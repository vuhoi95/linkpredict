Title: Gravitinos Tunneling From Traversable Lorentzian Wormholes
Authors: I. Sakalli and A. Ovgun
Abstract: Recent research shows that Hawking radiation (HR) is also possible around the trapping horizon of a wormhole. In this article, we show that the HR of gravitino (spin-$3/2$) particles from the traversable Lorentzian wormholes (TLWH) reveals a negative Hawking temperature (HT). We first introduce the TLWH in the past outer trapping horizon geometry (POTHG). Next, we derive the Rarita-Schwinger equations (RSEs) for that geometry. Then, using both the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) ans\"{a}tz and the WKB approximation in the quantum tunneling method, we obtain the probabilities of the emission/absorption modes. Finally, we derive the tunneling rate of the emitted gravitino particles, and succeed to read the HT of the TLWH.
