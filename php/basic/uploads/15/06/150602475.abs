Title: Light-like $κ$-deformations and scalar field theory via Drinfeld  twist
Authors: Tajron Jurić and Stjepan Meljanac and Andjelo Samsarov
Abstract: In this article we will use the Drinfeld twist leading to light-like $\kappa$-deformations of Poincar\'e algebra. We shall apply the standard Hopf algebra methods in order to define the star-product, which shall be used to formulate a scalar field theory compatible with $\kappa$-Poincar\'e-Hopf algebra. Using this approach we show that there is no problem with formulating integration on $\kappa$-Minkowski space and no need for introducing a new measure. We have shown that the $\star$-product obtained from this twist enables us to define a free scalar field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space that is equivalent to a commutative one on a usual Minkowski space. We also discuss the interacting $\phi^4$ scalar field model compatible with $\kappa$-Poincar\'e-Hopf algebra.
