Title: Hot multiboundary wormholes from bipartite entanglement
Authors: Donald Marolf and Henry Maxfield and Alex Peach and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We analyze the 1+1 CFT states dual to hot (time-symmetric) 2+1 multiboundary AdS wormholes. These are black hole geometries with high local temperature, $n \ge 1$ asymptotically-AdS$_3$ regions, and arbitrary internal topology. The dual state at $t=0$ is defined on $n$ circles. We show these to be well-described by sewing together tensor networks corresponding to thermofield double states. As a result, the entanglement is spatially localized and bipartite: away from particular boundary points ("vertices") any small connected region $A$ of the boundary CFT is entangled only with another small connected region $B$, where $B$ may lie on a different circle or may be a different part of the same circle. We focus on the pair-of-pants case, from which more general cases may be constructed. We also discuss finite-temperature corrections, where we note that the states involve a code subspace in each circle.
