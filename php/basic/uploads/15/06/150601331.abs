Title: Lorentz breaking supersymmetry and Horava-Lifshitz-like models
Authors: M. Gomes and J. Queiruga and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We present a Lorentz-breaking supersymmetric algebra characterized by a critical exponent $z$. Such construction requires a non trivial modification of the supercharges and superderivatives. The improvement of renormalizability for supersymmetric scalar QED is shown and the K\"ahlerian effective potentials are calculated in different cases. We also show how the theory flows naturally to the Lorentz symmetric case at low energies.
