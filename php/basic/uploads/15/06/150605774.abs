Title: Ramond Equations of Motion in Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Theodore Erler and Sebastian Konopka and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We extend the recently constructed NS superstring field theories in the small Hilbert space to give classical field equations for all superstring theories, including Ramond sectors. We also comment on the realization of supersymmetry in this framework.
