Title: Evolution and endpoint of the black string instability: Large D solution
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Ryotaku Suzuki and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: We derive a simple set of non-linear, (1+1)-dimensional partial differential equations that describe the dynamical evolution of black strings and branes to leading order in the expansion in the inverse of the number of dimensions D. These equations are easily solved numerically. Their solution shows that thin enough black strings are unstable to developing inhomogeneities along their length, and at late times they asymptote to stable non-uniform black strings. This proves an earlier conjecture about the endpoint of the instability of black strings in a large enough number of dimensions. If the initial black string is very thin, the final configuration is highly non-uniform and resembles a periodic array of localized black holes joined by short necks. We also present the equations that describe the non-linear dynamics of Anti-deSitter black branes at large D.
