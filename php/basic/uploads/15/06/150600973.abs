Title: A gauge field theory of fermionic Continuous-Spin Particles
Authors: X. Bekaert and M. Najafizadeh and M. R. Setare
Abstract: In this letter, we suggest a local covariant action for a gauge field theory of fermionic Continuous-Spin Particles (CSPs). The action is invariant under gauge transformations without any constraint on both the gauge field and the gauge transformation parameter. The Fang-Fronsdal equations for a tower of massless fields with all half-integer spins arise as a particular limit of the equation of motion of fermionic CSPs.
