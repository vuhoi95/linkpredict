Abstract: This work presents concisely the results obtained from the analysis of the two-point function of the gauge field in the $SU(2)$ and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge theories, in the Landau gauge, coupled to a scalar Higgs field in the fundamental or adjoint representation. Non-perturbative effects are considered by taking into account the Gribov ambiguity. In general, in both Yang-Mills models the gluon propagator has non-trivial contributions of physical and non-physical modes, which clearly depends on the group representation of the Higgs field. These results were presented during the Fourth Winter Workshop on Non-perturbative Quantum Field Theory, which took place in Sophia-Antipolis - France.
