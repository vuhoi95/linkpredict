Abstract: We present how the surface/state correspondence, conjectured in arXiv:1503.03542, works in the setup of AdS3/CFT2 by generalizing the formulation of cMERA. The boundary states in conformal field theories play a crucial role in our formulation and the bulk diffeomorphism is naturally taken into account. We give an identification of bulk local operators which reproduces correct scalar field solutions on AdS3 and bulk scalar propagators. We also calculate the information metric for a locally excited state and show that it is given by that of 2d hyperbolic manifold, which is argued to describe the time slice of AdS3.
