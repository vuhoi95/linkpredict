Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability conditions and phase transitions of charged black hole solutions in massive gravity. We point out the effects of massive parameter on stability conditions of these black holes and show how massive coefficients affect the phase transitions of these black holes. We also study the effects of boundary topology on thermodynamical behavior of the system. In addition, we give some arguments regarding the role of higher dimensions and highlight the effect of the charge in thermodynamical behavior. Then, we extend our study to geometrothermodynamical aspect of these solutions and show that employed approach for studying black holes geometrothermodynamics is an effective method.
