Title: Entropy in locally-de Sitter spacetimes
Authors: A. Araujo and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: As quotient spaces, Minkowski and de Sitter are fundamental spacetimes in the sense that they are known "a priori", independently of Einstein equation. They represent different non-gravitational backgrounds for the construction of physical theories. If general relativity is constructed on a de Sitter spacetime, the underlying kinematics will no longer be ruled by Poincar\'e, but by the de Sitter group. In this case the definition of diffeomorphism changes, producing concomitant changes in the notions of energy and entropy. These changes are explicitly discussed for the case of the Schwarzschild solution, in which the black hole and the de Sitter horizons show up as a unique entangled system. Such entanglement, together with energy conservation, create a constraint between the black hole activity and the evolution of the de Sitter radius, providing a new scenario for the study of cosmology.
