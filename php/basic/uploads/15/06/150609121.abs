Title: Scalar - Tensor gravity with scalar -matter direct coupling and its  cosmological probe
Authors: Jik Su Kim and Chol Jun Kim and Sin Chol Hwang and Yong Hae Ko
Abstract: SNIA and CMB datasets have shown both of evolving Newton's "constant" and a signature of the coupling of scalar field to matter. These observations motivate the consideration of the scalar-matter coupling in Jordan frame in the framework of scalar-tensor gravity. So far, majority of the works on the coupling of scalar matter has performed in Einstein frame in the framework of minimally coupled scalar fields. In this work, we generalize the original scalar-tensor theories of gravity introducing a direct coupling of scalar to matter in the Jordan frame. The combined consideration of both evolving Newton's constant and scalar-matter coupling using the recent observation datasets, shows features different from the previous works. The analysis shows a vivid signature of the scalar-matter coupling. The variation rate of the Newton's constant is obtained rather greater than that determined in the previous works.
