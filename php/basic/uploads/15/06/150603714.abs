Title: Gravitomagnetism in Massive Gravity
Authors: Kezban Tasseten and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: Massive gravity in the weak field limit is described by the Fierz-Pauli theory with 5 degrees of freedom in four dimensions. In this theory, we calculate the gravitomagnetic effects (potential energy) between two point-like, spinning sources that also orbit around each other in the limit where the spins and the velocities are small. Spin-spin, spin-orbit and orbit-orbit interactions in massive gravity theory have rather remarkable, discrete differences from their counterparts in General Relativity. Our computation is applicable for large distances, for example, for interaction between galaxies or galaxy clusters where massive gravity is expected to play a role. We also extend the computations to quadratic gravity theories in four dimensions and find the lowest order gravitomagnetic effects and show that at small separations quadratic gravity behaves differently than General Relativity.
