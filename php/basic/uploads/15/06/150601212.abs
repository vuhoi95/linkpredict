Title: Geometrical measures of non-Gaussianity generated from single field  Inflationary models
Authors: M. Junaid and D. Pogosyan
Abstract: We have calculated the third order moments of scalar curvature perturbations in configuration space for different inflationary models. We developed a robust numerical technique to compute the bispectrum for different models that have some features in the inflationary potential. From the bispectrum we evaluated moments analytically in the slow roll regime while we devised a numerical mechanism to calculated these moments for non slow roll single field inflationary models with standard kinetic term that are minimally coupled to gravity. With help of these third order moments one can directly predict many non-Gaussian and geometrical measures of CBM distributions in the configuration space. Thus, we have devised a framework to calculate different third order moments and geometrical measures, e.g. Minkowski functionals or skeleton statistic, generated by different single field models of inflation.
