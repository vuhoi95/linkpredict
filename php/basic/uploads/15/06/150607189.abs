Title: An analytical formula for the vacuum polarization of rotating black  holes
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Zain H. Saleem and Alejandro Satz
Abstract: We give an analytical formula for the vacuum polarization of a massless minimally coupled scalar field at the horizon of a rotating black hole with subtracted geometry. This is the first example of an exact, analytical result for a four-dimensional rotating black hole.
