Title: Quantum and classical areas of black hole thermodynamics
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: Most calculations of black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity indicate a term proportional to the area eigenvalue A with a correction involving the logarithm of A. This violates the additivity of the entropy. An entropy proportional to A, with a correction term involving the logarithm of the classical area k, which is consistent with the additivity of entropy, is derived in both U(1) and SU(2) formulations.
