Title: Minimal theory of massive gravity
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: We propose a new theory of massive gravity with only two propagating degrees of freedom. After defining the theory in the unitary gauge in the vielbein language, we shall perform a Hamiltonian analysis to count the number of physical degrees of freedom, and then study some phenomenologies. While the homogeneous and isotropic background cosmology and the tensor linear perturbations around it are described by exactly the same equations as those in the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity, the scalar and vector gravitational degrees of freedom are absent in the new theory at the fully nonlinear level. Hence the new theory provides a stable nonlinear completion of the self-accelerating cosmological solution that was originally found in the dRGT theory.
