Title: ADE Little String Theory on a Riemann Surface (and Triality)
Authors: Mina Aganagic and Nathan Haouzi
Abstract: We initiate the study of (2,0) little string theory of ADE type using its definition in terms of IIB string compactified on an ADE singularity. As one application, we derive a 5d ADE quiver gauge theory that describes the little string compactified on a sphere with three full punctures, at low energies. As a second application, we show the partition function of this theory equals the 3-point conformal block of ADE Toda CFT, q-deformed. To establish this, we generalize the A_n triality of \cite{AHS} to all ADE Lie algebras; IIB string perspective is crucial for this as well.
