Title: Helicity-0 spinning particles
Authors: Giovanni Salesi and Laura Deleidi
Abstract: We show that a self-consistent classical theory of the spin, based on a very general Lagrangian extending the Newtonian dynamics, does predict the special case of helicity-0 particles, which at the same time are endowed with nonzero spin and zero intrinsic angular momentum.
