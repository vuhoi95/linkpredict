Title: Gravitational resonances on $f(R)$-brane
Authors: Hao Yu and Yuan Zhong and Bao-Min Gu and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate various $f(R)$-brane models and compare their gravitational resonance structures with the corresponding general relativity (GR)-branes. {Starting from some known GR-brane solutions}, we derive thick $f(R)$-brane solutions such that the metric, scalar field, and scalar potential coincide with those of the corresponding GR-branes. {We find that for branes generated by a single or several canonical scalar fields, there is no obvious distinction between the GR-branes and corresponding $f(R)$-branes in terms of gravitational resonance structure.} Then we discuss the branes generated by K-fields. In this case, there could exist huge differences between GR-branes and $f(R)$-branes.
