Title: Splitting Spacetime and Cloning Qubits: Linking No-Go Theorems across  the ER=EPR Duality
Authors: Ning Bao and Jason Pollack and Grant N. Remmen
Abstract: We analyze the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics through the lens of the proposed ER=EPR (Einstein-Rosen = Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) duality between entanglement and wormholes. In particular, we find that the no-cloning theorem is dual on the gravity side to the no-go theorem for topology change, violating the axioms of which allows for wormhole stabilization and causality violation. Such a duality between important no-go theorems elucidates the proposed connection between spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement.
