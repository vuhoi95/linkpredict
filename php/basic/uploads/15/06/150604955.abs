Abstract: Realizations of $\kappa$-Minkowski space linear in momenta are studied for time-, space- and light-like deformations. We construct and classify all such linear realizations and express them in terms of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ generators. There are three one-parameter families of linear realizations for time-like and space-like deformations, while for light-like deformations, there are only four linear realizations. The relation between deformed Heisenberg algebra, star product, coproduct of momenta and twist operator is presented. It is proved that for each linear realization there exists Drinfeld twist satisfying normalization and cocycle conditions. $\kappa$-deformed $\mathfrak{igl}(n)$-Hopf algebras are presented for all cases. The $\kappa$-Poincar\'e-Weyl and $\kappa$-Poincar\'e-Hopf algebras are discussed. Left-right dual $\kappa$-Minkowski algebra is constructed from the transposed twists. The corresponding realizations are nonlinear. All known Drinfeld twists related to $\kappa$-Minkowski space are obtained from our construction. Finally, some physical applications are discussed.
