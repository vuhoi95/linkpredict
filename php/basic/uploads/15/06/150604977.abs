Title: Scalar instabilities in bimetric gravity: The Vainshtein mechanism and  structure formation
Authors: Edvard Mortsell and Jonas Enander
Abstract: We investigate the observational consequences of scalar instabilities in bimetric theory, under the assumption that the Vainshtein mechanism restores general relativity within a certain distance from gravitational sources. We argue that early time instabilities have a negligible impact on observed structures. Assuming that the instabilities affect sub-horizon density fluctuations, we constrain the redshift, z_i, below which instabilities are ruled out. For the "minimal" beta_1-model, observational constraints are close to the theoretical expectations of z_i = 0.5, potentially allowing the model to be ruled in or out with a more detailed study, possibly including secondary cosmic microwave background constraints.
