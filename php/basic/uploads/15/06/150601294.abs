Title: All gaugings and stable de Sitter in D=7 half-maximal supergravity
Authors: Giuseppe Dibitetto and Jose J. Fernández-Melgarejo and Diego Marqués
Abstract: We study the general formulation of gauged supergravity in seven dimensions with sixteen supercharges keeping duality covariance by means of the embedding tensor formalism. We first classify all inequivalent duality orbits of consistent deformations. Secondly, we analyse the complete set of critical points in a systematic way. Interestingly, we find the first examples of stable de Sitter solutions within a theory with such a large amount of supersymmetry.
