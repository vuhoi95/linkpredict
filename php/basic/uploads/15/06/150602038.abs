Title: Three-point correlator of twist-2 operators in BFKL limit
Authors: Ian Balitsky and Vladimir Kazakov and Evgeny Sobko
Abstract: We compute the correlation function of three twist-2 operators in N = 4 SYM in the leading BFKL approximation at any N_c. In this limit, the result is applicable to other gauge theories, including QCD.
