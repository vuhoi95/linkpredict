Title: Baryon number conservation in Bose-Einstein condensate black holes
Authors: Florian KÃ¼hnel and Marit Sandstad
Abstract: Primordial black holes are studied in the Bose-Einstein condensate description of space-time. The question of baryon-number conservation is investigated with emphasis on possible formation of bound states of the system's remaining captured baryons. This leads to distinct predictions for both the formation time, which for the naively natural assumptions is shown to lie between $10^{-12}\.\srm$ to $10^{12}\.\srm$ after Big Bang, as well as for the remnant's mass, yielding approximately $3 \cdot 10^{23}\.{\rm kg}$ in the same scheme. The consequences for astrophysically formed black holes are also considered.
