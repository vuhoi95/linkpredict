Title: Counting the Massive Vacua of N=1* Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Antoine Bourget and Jan Troost
Abstract: We compute the number of massive vacua of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory mass-deformed to preserve N=1 supersymmetry, for any gauge group G. We use semi-classical techniques and efficiently reproduce the known counting for A,B and C-type gauge groups, present the generating function for both O(2n) and SO(2n), and compute the supersymmetric index for gauge groups of exceptional type. A crucial role is played by the classification of nilpotent orbits, as well as global properties of their centralizers. We give illustrative examples of new features of our analysis for the D-type algebras.
