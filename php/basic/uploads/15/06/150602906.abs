Title: New Symmetries of QED
Authors: Daniel Kapec and Monica Pate and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: The soft photon theorem in U(1) gauge theories with only massless charged particles has recently been shown to be the Ward identity of an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry group. This symmetry group is comprised of gauge transformations which approach angle-dependent constants at null infinity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to all U(1) theories, including those with massive charged particles such as QED.
