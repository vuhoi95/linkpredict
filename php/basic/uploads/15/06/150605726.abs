Title: The General Bopp's shifts Matrix Method and the Non-Commutative  Symplectic Induction Formalism
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and C. Neves
Abstract: In this article we will generalize the Bopp's shifts and, consequently, the star- product, by using the non-commutative (NC) symplectic induction formalism. This procedure allows us to introduce 4(N-1) NC parameters into a N-dimensional system. After that, this general version of Bopp's shifts will be applied in some very simple models: the one and two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. From this application, we will show that different choices for NC algebra among the symplectic variables generates, in dynamically point of view, different NC systems. Further, this gives room to figure out the role played by the NC parameter in these systems as being the role usually played by a background magnetic field in such systems and, also, the distinct NC systems could be interpreted as being quantum versions for the original harmonic oscillator, since quantum features of these classical system could be revealed.
