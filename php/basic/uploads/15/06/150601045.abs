Title: Flowing to Higher Dimensions: A New Strongly-Coupled Phase on M2 Branes
Authors: Krzysztof Pilch and Alexander Tyukov and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We describe a one-parameter family of new holographic RG flows that start from $AdS_4 \times S^7$ and go to $\widehat{AdS_5} \times {\cal B}_6$, where ${\cal B}_6$ is conformal to a K\"ahler manifold and $\widehat{AdS_5}$ is Poincar\'e $AdS_5$ with one spatial direction compactified and fibered over ${\cal B}_6$. The new solutions "flow up dimensions," going from the $(2+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory on M2 branes in the UV to a $(3+1)$-dimensional field theory on intersecting M5 branes in the infra-red. The M2 branes completely polarize into M5 branes along the flow and the Poincar\'e sections of the $\widehat{AdS_5}$ are the $(3+1)$-dimensional common intersection of the M5 branes. The emergence of the extra dimension in the infra-red suggests a new strongly-coupled phase of the M2 brane and ABJM theories in which charged solitons are becoming massless. The flow solution is first analyzed by finding a four-dimensional $N \! = \! 2$ supersymmetric flow in $N \! = \! 8$ gauged supergravity. This is then generalized to a one parameter family of non-supersymmetric flows. The infra-red limit of the solutions appears to be quite singular in four dimensions but the uplift to eleven-dimensional supergravity is remarkable and regular (up to orbifolding). Our construction is a non-trivial application of the recently derived uplift formulae for fluxes, going well beyond the earlier constructions of stationary points solutions. The eleven-dimensional supersymmetry is also analyzed and shows how, for the supersymmetric flow, the M2-brane supersymmetry in the UV is polarized entirely into M5-brane supersymmetry in the infra-red.
