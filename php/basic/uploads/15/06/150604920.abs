Title: Gravitational waves induced by spinor fields
Authors: Kaixi Feng and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: In realistic model-building, spinor fields with various masses are present. During inflation, spinor field may induce gravitational waves as a second order effect. In this paper, we calculate the contribution of single massive spinor field to the power spectrum of primordial gravitational wave by using retarded Green propagator. We find that the correction is scale-invariant and of order $H^4/M_P^4$ for arbitrary spinor mass $m_{\psi}$. Additionally, we also observe that when $m_\psi \gtrsim H$, the dependence of correction on $m_\psi/H$ is nontrivial.
