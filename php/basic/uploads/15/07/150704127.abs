Abstract: We study $SO(32)$ heterotic string theory on torus with magnetic fluxes. Non-vanishing fluxes can lead to non-universal gauge kinetic functions for $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)_Y$ which is the important features of $SO(32)$ heterotic string theory in contrast to the $E_8\times E_8$ theory. It is found that the experimental values of gauge couplings are realized with ${\cal O}(1)$ values of moduli fields based on the realistic models with the $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry and three chiral generations of quarks and leptons without chiral exotics.
