Title: Quantum Tunneling of Massive Spin-1 Particles From Non-stationary  Metrics
Authors: I. Sakalli and A. Övgün
Abstract: We focus on the HR of massive vector (spin-1) particles tunneling from Schwarzschild BH expressed in the Kruskal-Szekeres (KS) and dynamic Lemaitre (DL) coordinates. Using the Proca equation (PE) together with the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and the WKB methods, we show that the tunneling rate, and its consequence Hawking temperature are well recovered by the quantum tunneling of the massive vector particles.
