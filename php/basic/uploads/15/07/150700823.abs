Title: Gluon Reggeization in Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: V. S. Fadin and M. G. Kozlov and A. V. Reznichenko
Abstract: The proof of the multi-Regge form of multiple production amplitudes in the next-to-leading logarithmic approximation is presented for Yang-Mills theories with fermions and scalars in any representations of the colour group and with any Yukawa-type interaction. Explicit expressions for the Reggeized gauge boson trajectory, the Reggeon vertices and the impact factors are given. Fulfilment of the bootstrap conditions is proved.
