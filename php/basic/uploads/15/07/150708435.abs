Title: N=1 superfield description of six-dimensional supergravity
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We express the action of six-dimensional supergravity in terms of four-dimensional N=1 superfields, focusing on the moduli dependence of the action. The gauge invariance of the action in the tensor-vector sector is realized in a quite nontrivial manner, and it determines the moduli dependence of the action. The resultant moduli dependence is intricate, especially on the shape modulus. Our result is reduced to the known superfield actions of six-dimensional global SUSY theories and of five-dimensional supergravity by replacing the moduli superfields with their background values and by performing the dimensional reduction, respectively.
