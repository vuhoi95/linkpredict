Title: Twistor form of massive 6D superparticle
Authors: Alasdair J. Routh and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The massive six-dimensional (6D) superparticle with manifest (n,0) supersymmetry is shown to have a supertwistor formulation in which its "hidden" (0,n) supersymmetry is also manifest. The mass-shell constraint is replaced by Spin(5) spin-shell constraints which imply that the quantum superparticle has zero superspin, for n=1 it propagates the 6D Proca supermultiplet.
