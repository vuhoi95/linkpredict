Title: Shear Viscosities of Photons in Strongly Coupled Plasmas
Authors: Di-Lun Yang and Berndt Müller
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity of thermalized photons in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) at weak coupling and $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma (SYMP) at both strong and weak couplings. We find that the shear viscosity due to the photon-parton scattering up to the leading order of electromagnetic coupling is suppressed when the coupling of the QGP/SYMP is increased, which stems from the blue-shift of the thermal-photon spectrum at strong coupling. In addition, the shear viscosity rapidly increases near the deconfinement transition in a phenomenological model analogous to the QGP.
