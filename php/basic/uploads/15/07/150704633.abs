Title: Entanglement renormalization and integral geometry
Authors: Xing Huang and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We revisit the applications of integral geometry in AdS$_3$ and argue that the metric of the kinematic space can be realized as the entanglement contour, which is defined as the additive entanglement density. From the renormalization of the entanglement contour, we can holographically understand the operations of disentangler and isometry in multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. Furthermore, a renormalization group equation of the long-distance entanglement contour is then derived. We then generalize this integral geometric construction to higher dimensions and in particular demonstrate how it works in bulk space of homogeneity and isotropy.
