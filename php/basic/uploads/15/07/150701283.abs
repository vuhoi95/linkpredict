Title: Topology and arithmetic of resultants, II: the resultant $=1$  hypersurface (with an appendix by C. Cazanave)
Authors: Benson Farb and Jesse Wolfson
Abstract: We consider the moduli space $\mathcal{R}_n$ of pairs of monic, degree $n$ polynomials whose resultant equals $1$. We relate the topology of these algebraic varieties to their geometry and arithmetic. In particular, we compute their \'{e}tale cohomology, the associated eigenvalues of Frobenius, and the cardinality of their set of $\mathbb{F}_q$-points. When $q$ and $n$ are coprime, we show that the \'etale cohomology of $\mathcal{R}_{n/\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q}$ is pure, and of Tate type if and only if $q\equiv 1$ mod $n$. We also deduce the values of these invariants for the finite field counterparts of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_n$ of $SU(2)$ monopoles of charge $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and the associated moduli space $X_n$ of strongly centered monopoles. An appendix by Cazanave gives an alternative and elementary computation of the point counts.
