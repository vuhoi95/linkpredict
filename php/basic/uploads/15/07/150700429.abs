Title: Spontaneous parametric down conversion with a depleted pump as an  analogue for black hole evaporation/particle production
Authors: Paul M. Alsing and Michael L. Fanto
Abstract: We present an analytical formulation of the recent one-shot decoupling model of Br\`adler and Adami [arXiv:1505.0284] and compute the resulting "Page Information" curves, for the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom, and emitted Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. We argue that black hole evaporation/particle production has a very close analogy to the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion, when the pump is allowed to deplete.
