Title: SIMP model at NNLO in chiral perturbation theory
Authors: Martin Hansen and Kasper Langaeble and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological viability of a recently proposed class of composite dark matter models where the relic density is determined by 3 to 2 number-changing processes in the dark sector. Here the pions of the strongly interacting field theory constitute the dark matter particles. By performing a consistent next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading order chiral perturbative investigation we demonstrate that the leading order analysis cannot be used to draw conclusions about the viability of the model. We further show that higher order corrections substantially increase the tension with phenomenological constraints challenging the viability of the simplest realisation of the strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) paradigm.
