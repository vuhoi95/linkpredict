Title: On Gauge Enhancement and Singular Limits in $G_2$ Compactifications of  M-theory
Authors: James Halverson and David R. Morrison
Abstract: We study the physics of singular limits of $G_2$ compactifications of M-theory, which are necessary to obtain a compactification with non-abelian gauge symmetry or massless charged particles. This is more difficult than for Calabi-Yau compactifications, due to the absence of calibrated two-cycles that would have allowed for direct control of W-boson masses as a function of moduli. Instead, we study the relationship between gauge enhancement and singular limits in $G_2$ moduli space where an associative or coassociative submanifold shrinks to zero size; this involves the physics of topological defects and sometimes gives indirect control over particle masses, even though they are not BPS. We show how a lemma of Joyce associates the class of a three-cycle to any $U(1)$ gauge theory in a smooth $G_2$ compactification. If there is an appropriate associative submanifold in this class then in the limit of nonabelian gauge symmetry it may be interpreted as a gauge theory worldvolume and provides the location of the singularities associated with non-abelian gauge or matter fields. We identify a number of gauge enhancement scenarios related to calibrated submanifolds, including Coulomb branches and non-isolated conifolds, and also study examples that realize them.
