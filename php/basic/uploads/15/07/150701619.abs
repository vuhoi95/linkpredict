Title: M-theory and G_2 Manifolds
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: In this talk we report on recent progress in describing compactifications of string theory and M-theory on G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. We include the infinite set of alpha'-corrections and describe the entire tower of massless and massive Kaluza-Klein modes resulting from such compactifications.
