Title: Relation between the Reducibility Structures and between the Master  Actions in the Witten Formulation and the Berkovits Formulation of Open  Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Yuki Iimori and Shingo Torii
Abstract: Developing the analysis in JHEP 03 (2014) 044 [arXiv:1312.1677] by the present authors et al., we clarify the relation between the Witten formulation and the Berkovits formulation of open superstring field theory at the level of the master action, namely the solution to the classical master equation in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, which is the key for the path-integral quantization. We first scrutinize the reducibility structure, a detailed gauge structure containing the information about ghost string fields. Then, extending the condition for partial gauge fixing introduced in the above-mentioned paper to the sector of ghost string fields, we investigate the master action. We show that the reducibility structure and the master action under partial gauge fixing of the Berkovits formulation can be regarded as the regularized versions of those in the Witten formulation.
