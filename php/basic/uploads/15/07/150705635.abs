Title: Effective string theory for vortex lines in fluids and superfluids
Authors: Bart Horn and Alberto Nicolis and Riccardo Penco
Abstract: We discuss the effective string theory of vortex lines in ordinary fluids and low-temperature superfluids, by describing the bulk fluid flow in terms of a two-form field to which vortex lines can couple. We derive the most general low-energy effective Lagrangian that is compatible with (spontaneously broken) Poincare invariance and worldsheet reparameterization invariance. This generalizes the effective action developed by Lund and Regge and by Endlich and Nicolis. By applying standard field-theoretical techniques, we show that certain low-energy coupling constants -- most notably the string tension -- exhibit RG running already at the classical level. We discuss applications of our techniques to the study of Kelvin waves, vortex rings, and the coupling to bulk sound modes.
