Title: F-theory and N=1 Quivers from Polyvalent Geometry
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Moulay Brahim Sedra
Abstract: We study four dimensional quiver gauge models from F-theory compactified on fourfolds with hyper-K\"{a}hler structure. Using intersecting complex toric surfaces, we derive a class of N=1 quivers with charged fundamental matter placed on external nodes. The emphasis is on how local Calabi-Yau equations solve the corresponding physical constraints including the anomaly cancelation condition. Concretely, a linear chain of SU(N) groups with flavor symmetries has been constructed using polyvalent toric geometry.
