Authors: M. A. L. Capri and D. Fiorentini and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: The non-perturbative nilpotent exact BRST symmetry of the Gribov-Zwanziger action in the Landau gauge constructed in [ arXiv:1506.06995 [hep-th]] is generalized to the case of Euclidean Yang-Mills theories quantized in the maximal Abelian gauge. The resulting diagonal gluon propagator is evaluating in dimensions D=4,3,2. In D=4,3 a decoupling type behavior is found in the infrared region, while in D=2 a scaling type behavior emerges.
