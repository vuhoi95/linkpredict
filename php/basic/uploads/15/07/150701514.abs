Abstract: We introduce a simple model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking. It is like a supersymmetric version of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a spin one composite. The simplest version of the model as presented here has a single chiral superfield (multiplet) with a four-superfield interaction. The latter has the structure of the square of the superfield magnitude square. A vacuum condensate of the latter is illustrated to develop giving rise to supersymmetry breaking with a soft mass term for the superfield. We report also the effective theory picture with a real superfield composite, illustrating the matching effective potential analysis and the vacuum solution conditions for the components. The nature of its fermionic part as the Goldstone mode is presented. Phenomenological application to the supersymmetric standard model is plausible.
