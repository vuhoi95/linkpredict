Title: Extracting information about the initial state from the black hole  radiation
Authors: Kinjalk Lochan and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: The crux of the black hole information paradox is related to the fact that the complete information about the initial state of a quantum field in a collapsing spacetime is not available to future asymptotic observers, belying the expectations from a unitary quantum theory. We study the imprints of the initial quantum state contained in a specific class of distortions of the black hole radiation and identify the classes of in-states which can be partially/fully reconstructed from the information contained within. Even for the general in-state, we can uncover some specific information. These results suggest that a \textit{classical} collapse scenario ignores this richness of information in the resulting spectrum and a consistent quantum treatment of the entire collapse process might allow us to retrieve much more information from the spectrum of the final radiation.
