Title: Exact Teleparallel Gravity of Binary Black Holes
Authors: W. El Hanafy and G. G. L. Nashed
Abstract: An exact solution of two singularities in the teleparallel equivalent to general relativity theory has been obtained. A holographic visualization of the binary black holes (BBHs) space-time, due to the non vanishing torsion scalar field, has been given. The acceleration tensor of BBHs space-time has been calculated. The results identify the repulsive gravity zones of the BBHs field. The total conserved quantities of the BBHs has been evaluated. Possible gravitational radiation emission by the system has been calculated without assuming a weak field initial data.
