Title: Extra $Z^\prime$s and $W^\prime$s in Heterotic--String Derived Models
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Marco Guzzi
Abstract: The ATLAS collaboration recently recorded possible excess in the di--boson production at the di--boson invariant mass at around 2 TeV. Such an excess may be produced if there exist additional $Z^\prime$ and/or $W^\prime$ at that scale. We survey the extra $Z^\prime$s and $W^\prime$s that may arise from semi--realistic heterotic string vacua in the free fermionic formulation in seven distinct cases including: $U(1)_{Z^\prime}\in SO(10)$; family universal $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ not in $SO(10)$; non--universal $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$; hidden sector $U(1)$ symmetries and kinetic mixing; left--right symmetric models; Pati--Salam models; leptophobic and custodial symmetries. Each case has a distinct signature associated with the extra symmetry breaking scale. In one of the cases we explore the discovery potential at the LHC using resonant leptoproduction. Existence of extra vector boson with the reported properties will significantly constrain the space of allowed string vacua.
