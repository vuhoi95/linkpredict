Title: Generalized Parametrization Dependence in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Holger Gies and Benjamin Knorr and Stefan Lippoldt
Abstract: We critically examine the gauge, and field-parametrization dependence of renormalization group flows in the vicinity of non-Gau\ss{}ian fixed points in quantum gravity. While physical observables are independent of such calculational specifications, the construction of quantum gravity field theories typically relies on off-shell quantities such as $\beta$ functions and generating functionals and thus face potential stability issues with regard to such generalized parametrizations. We analyze a two-parameter class of covariant gauge conditions, the role of momentum-dependent field rescalings and a class of field parametrizations. Using the product of Newton and cosmological constant as an indicator, the principle of minimum sensitivity identifies stationary points in this parametrization space which show a remarkable insensitivity to the parametrization. In the most insensitive cases, the quantized gravity system exhibits a non-Gau\ss{}ian UV stable fixed point, lending further support to asymptotically free quantum gravity. One of the stationary points facilitates an analytical determination of the quantum gravity phase diagram and features ultraviolet and infrared complete RG trajectories with a classical regime.
