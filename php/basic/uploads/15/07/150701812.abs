Title: BV quantization and the algebraic index
Authors: Ryan E. Grady and Qin Li and Si Li
Abstract: Into a differential geometric setting, we import the physical interpretation of index theorems via semi-classical analysis in topological quantum field theory. We construct a one-dimensional (mathematical) quantum field theory of AKSZ type in the BV formalism. Its quantization requires quantum corrections for classical local functionals at all loops, which are solved exactly by Fedosov's Abelian connections on Weyl bundles over symplectic manifolds. By consideration of the observables in our effective BV theory, we extend Fedosov's Abelian connections on Weyl bundles to a flat structure on a bundle of BV algebras. This allows us to utilize the tool of BV integration to obtain the trace map associated to the deformation quantization. This leads to a simple proof of the algebraic index theorem which corresponds to the one-loop computation in topological quantum mechanics.
