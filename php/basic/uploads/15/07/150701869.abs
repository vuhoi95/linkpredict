Title: The classical double copy for Taub-NUT spacetime
Authors: A. Luna and R. Monteiro and D. O'Connell and C. D. White
Abstract: The double copy is a much-studied relationship between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes. Recently, this was generalised to an infinite family of classical solutions to Einstein's equations, namely stationary Kerr-Schild geometries. In this paper, we extend this to the Taub-NUT solution in gravity, which has a double Kerr-Schild form. The single copy of this solution is a dyon, whose electric and magnetic charges are related to the mass and NUT charge in the gravity theory. Finally, we find hints that the classical double copy extends to curved background geometries.
