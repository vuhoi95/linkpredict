Title: Semiclassical fermion pair creation in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Cl√©ment Stahl and Eckhard Strobel
Abstract: We present a method to semiclassically compute the pair creation rate of bosons and fermions in de Sitter spacetime. The results in the bosonic case agree with the ones in the literature. We find that for the constant electric field the fermionic and bosonic pair creation rate are the same. This analogy of bosons and fermions in the semiclassical limit is known from several flat spacetime examples.
