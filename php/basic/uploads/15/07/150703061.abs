Title: Type II chiral affine Lie algebras and string actions in doubled space
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We present affine Lie algebras generated by the supercovariant derivatives and the supersymmetry generators for the left and right moving modes in the doubled space. Chirality is manifest in our doubled space as well as the T-duality symmetry. We present gauge invariant bosonic and superstring actions preserving the two-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and the kappa-symmetry where doubled spacetime coordinates are chiral fields. The doubled space becomes the usual space by dimensional reduction constraints.
