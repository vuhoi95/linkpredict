Title: $θ$-dependence of the lightest meson resonances in QCD
Authors: Neramballi Ripunjay Acharya and Feng-Kun Guo and Maxim Mai and Ulf-G. Meißner
Abstract: We derive the pion mass and the elastic pion-pion scattering amplitude in the QCD theta-vacuum up to next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory. Using the modified inverse amplitude method, we study the theta-dependence of the mass and width of the light scalar meson sigma(500) and the vector meson rho(770).
