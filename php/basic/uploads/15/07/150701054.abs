Title: Black hole entropy and Lorentz-diffeomorphism Noether charge
Authors: Ted Jacobson and Arif Mohd
Abstract: We show that, in the first or second order orthonormal frame formalism, black hole entropy is the horizon Noether charge for a combination of diffeomorphism and local Lorentz symmetry involving the Lie derivative of the frame. The Noether charge for diffeomorphisms alone is unsuitable, since a regular frame cannot be invariant under the flow of the Killing field at the bifurcation surface. We apply this formalism to Lagrangians polynomial in wedge products of the frame field 1-form and curvature 2-form, including general relativity, Lovelock gravity, and "topological" terms in four dimensions.
