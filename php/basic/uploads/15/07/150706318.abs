Title: Junctions of surface operators and categorification of quantum groups
Authors: Sungbong Chun and Sergei Gukov and Daniel Roggenkamp
Abstract: We show how networks of Wilson lines realize quantum groups U_q(sl(m)), for arbitrary m, in 3d SU(N) Chern-Simons theory. Lifting this construction to foams of surface operators in 4d theory we find that rich structure of junctions is encoded in combinatorics of planar diagrams. For a particular choice of surface operators we reproduce known mathematical constructions of categorical representations and categorified quantum groups.
