Abstract: We study the partition function ${\cal N}=1$ 5D $U(N)$ gauge theory with $g$ adjoint hypermultiplets and show that for massless adjoint hypermultiplets it is equal to the partition function of a two dimensional topological field on a genus $g$ Riemann surface. We describe the topological field theory by its amplitudes associated with cap, propagator and pair of pants. These basic amplitudes are open topological string amplitudes associated with certain Calabi-Yau threefolds in the presence of Lagrangian branes.
