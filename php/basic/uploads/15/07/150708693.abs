Title: Enhanced Casimir effect for doped graphene
Authors: M. Bordag and I. Fialkovsky and D. Vassilevich
Abstract: We analyze the Casimir interaction of doped graphene. To this end we derive a simple expression for the finite temperature polarization tensor with a chemical potential. It is found that doping leads to a strong enhancement of the Casimir force reaching almost $60\%$ in quite realistic situations. This result should be important for planning and interpreting the Casimir measurements, especially taking into account that the Casimir interaction of undoped graphene is rather weak.
