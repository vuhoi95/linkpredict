Title: Axion-like dark matter particle may explain the anomalies in the Cosmic  Microwave Background dipole

Abstract: Axions/axion-like particles (ALPs) may constitute a major part of dark matter. Recent studies have shown that dark matter axions can thermalize and form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a long correlation length. The thermalization scenario for the ALPs is similar. We find that for the linear regime of perturbation, the ALPs differ from ordinary point-like dark matter particles, with additional terms in the first-order velocity equation. The differences are especially compelling for lighter ALPs. Moreover, axions/ALPs with long correlation lengths can be thermalized due to gravitational interaction, altering the large scale entropy. We propose that the spontaneous breakdown in symmetry due to the formation of BEC can explain the anomalies in the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole.
