Title: Pure de Sitter Supergravity
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Daniel Z. Freedman and Renata Kallosh and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: Using superconformal methods we derive an explicit de Sitter supergravity action invariant under spontaneously broken local ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry. The supergravity multiplet interacts with a nilpotent goldstino multiplet. We present a complete locally supersymmetric action including the graviton and the fermionic fields, gravitino and goldstino, no scalars. In the global limit when supergravity multiplet decouples, our action reproduces the Volkov-Akulov theory. In the unitary gauge where goldstino vanishes we recover pure supergravity with the positive cosmological constant. The classical equations of motion, with all fermions vanishing, have a maximally symmetric solution: de Sitter space.
