Title: Analytic continuation of nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the  time-like region
Authors: Pedro Alberto and Alessandro Drago and Simone Moretti and Simone Pacetti
Abstract: The possibility to compute nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region by analytic continuation of their space-like expressions has been explored in the framework of the Skyrme model. We have developed a procedure to solve analytically Fourier transforms of the nucleon electromagnetic current and hence to obtain form factors defined in all kinematical regions and fulfilling the first-principles requirements. The results are discussed and compared to data, both in space-like and time-like region.
