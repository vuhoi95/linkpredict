Title: Exact results for Wilson loops in orbifold ABJM theory
Authors: Hao Ouyang and Jun-Bao Wu and Jia-ju Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the exact results for circular 1/4 and 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in the $d=3$ ${\mathcal N}=4$ super Chern-Simons-matter theory that could be obtained by orbifolding Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory. The partition function of the ${\mathcal N}=4$ orbifold ABJM theory has been computed previously in the literature. In this paper, we re-derive it using a slightly different method. We calculate the vacuum expectation values of the circular 1/4 BPS Wilson loops in fundamental representation and of circular 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in arbitrary representations. We use both the saddle point approach and Fermi gas approach. The results for Wilson loops are in accord with the available gravity results.
