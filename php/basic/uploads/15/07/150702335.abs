Title: Chern-Simons Supergravity in D=3 and Maxwell superalgebra
Authors: P. K. Concha and O. Fierro and E. K. Rodr√≠guez and P. Salgado
Abstract: We present the construction of the $D=3$ Chern-Simons supergravity action without cosmological constant from the minimal Maxwell superalgebra $s\mathcal{M}_{3}$. This superalgebra contains two Majorana fermionic charges and can be obtained from the $\mathfrak{osp}\left( 2|1\right) \otimes\mathfrak{sp}\left( 2\right) $ superalgebra using the abelian semigroup expansion procedure. The components of the Maxwell invariant tensor are explicitly derived.
