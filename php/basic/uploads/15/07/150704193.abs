Title: Integrability and conformal data of the dimer model
Authors: Alexi Morin-Duchesne and Jorgen Rasmussen and Philippe Ruelle
Abstract: The central charge of the dimer model on the square lattice is still being debated in the literature. In this paper, we provide evidence supporting the consistency of a $c=-2$ description. Using Lieb's transfer matrix and its description in terms of the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ at $\beta = 0$, we provide a new solution of the dimer model in terms of the model of critical dense polymers on a tilted lattice and offer an understanding of the lattice integrability of the dimer model. The dimer transfer matrix is analysed in the scaling limit and the result for $L_0-\frac c{24}$ is expressed in terms of fermions. Higher Virasoro modes are likewise constructed as limits of elements of $TL_n$ and are found to yield a $c=-2$ realisation of the Virasoro algebra, familiar from fermionic $bc$ ghost systems. In this realisation, the dimer Fock spaces are shown to decompose, as Virasoro modules, into direct sums of Feigin-Fuchs modules, themselves exhibiting reducible yet indecomposable structures. In the scaling limit, the eigenvalues of the lattice integrals of motion are found to agree exactly with those of the $c=-2$ conformal integrals of motion. Consistent with the expression for $L_0-\frac c{24}$ obtained from the transfer matrix, we also construct higher Virasoro modes with $c=1$ and find that the dimer Fock space is completely reducible under their action. However, the transfer matrix is found not to be a generating function for the $c=1$ integrals of motion. Although this indicates that Lieb's transfer matrix description is incompatible with the $c=1$ interpretation, it does not rule out the existence of an alternative, $c=1$ compatible, transfer matrix description of the dimer model.
