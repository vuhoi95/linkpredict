Title: Dimensional reduction of four-dimensional topologically massive gauge  theory
Authors: R. Kumar and Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: We study topologically massive (B \wedge F) Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in four dimensions, and reduce them to three dimensions by assuming that the fields do not propagate in one of the spatial directions. For certain gauge choices the reduced theories are the Jackiw-Pi models of massive gauge fields.
