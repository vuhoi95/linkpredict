Title: Energy conditions in mimetic-$f(R)$ gravity
Authors: Maryam Shiravand and Zahra Haghani and Shahab Shahidi
Abstract: The energy conditions of mimetic-$f(R)$ gravity theory, together with the Dolgov-Kawasaki instability will be analysed. It will be shown that the condition for the stability of the theory against Dolgov-Kawasaki is equivalent to the standard $f(R)$ gravity theory. The Brans-Dicke equivalence of the theory is also discussed in more details. We will then obtain the parameter space of the theory in some special forms of $f(R)$, which violates the strong energy condition while satisfying the weak, null and dominant energy conditions.
