Title: 5d fixed points from brane webs and O7-planes
Authors: Oren Bergman and Gabi Zafrir
Abstract: We explore the properties of five-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories living on 5-brane webs in orientifold 7-plane backgrounds. These include $USp(2N)$ and $SO(N)$ gauge theories with fundamental matter, as well as $SU(N)$ gauge theories with symmetric and antisymmetric matter. We find a number of new 5d fixed point theories that feature enhanced global symmetries. We also exhibit a number of new 5d dualities.
