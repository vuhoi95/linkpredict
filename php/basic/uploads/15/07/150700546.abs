Abstract: In this paper, we investigate in some detail the holographic ferromagnetic phase transition in an AdS${_4}$ black brane background by introducing a massive 2-form field coupled to the Maxwell field strength in the bulk. In the two probe limits, one is to neglect the back reaction of the 2-form field to the background geometry and to the Maxwell field, and the other to neglect the back reaction of both the Maxwell field and the 2-form field, we find that the spontaneous magnetization and the ferromagnetic phase transition always happen when the temperature gets low enough with similar critical behavior. We calculate the DC resistivity in a semi-analytical method in the second probe limit and find it behaves as the colossal magnetic resistance effect in some materials. In the case with the first probe limit, we obtain the off-shell free energy of the holographic model near the critical temperature and compare with the Ising-like model. We also study the back reaction effect and find that the phase transition is always second order. In addition, we find an analytical Reissner-Norstr\"om-like black brane solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-2-form field theory with a negative cosmological constant.
