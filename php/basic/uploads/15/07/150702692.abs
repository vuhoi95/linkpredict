Authors: Karunava Sil and Aalok Misra
Abstract: Some Physics (obtaining lattice-compatible deconfinement temperature, some transport coefficients and Einstein's relation) and Mathematics (torsion classes and supersymmetry) issues pertaining to the delocalized SYZ type IIA mirror of [1] and its M theory uplift in the MQGP limit of [2], are discussed.
