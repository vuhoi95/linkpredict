Title: Covariance in models of loop quantum gravity: Gowdy systems
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Suddhasattwa Brahma
Abstract: Recent results in the construction of anomaly-free models of loop quantum gravity have shown obstacles when local physical degrees of freedom are present. Here, a set of no-go properties is derived in polarized Gowdy models, raising the question whether these systems can be covariant beyond a background treatment. As a side product, it is shown that normal deformations in classical polarized Gowdy models can be Abelianized.
