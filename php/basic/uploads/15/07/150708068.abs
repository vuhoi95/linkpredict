Title: Anharmonic Noncommutative Oscillator at Finite Temperature
Authors: H. Sarvari Karaj-Abad and A. Jahan
Abstract: Classical and quantum anharmonic noncommutative oscillators with quartic self-interacting potential are considered and the effect of self-interaction term on the free energy and partition function of both models is calculated to first order in coupling constant.
