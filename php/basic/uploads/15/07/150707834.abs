Abstract: For a massless gas with constant cross section in a homogeneous, isotropically expanding spacetime we reformulate the relativistic Boltzmann equation as a set of non-linear coupled moment equations. For a particular initial condition this set can be solved exactly, yielding the first analytical solution of the Boltzmann equation for an expanding system. The non-equilibrium behavior of this relativistic gas can be mapped onto that of a homogeneous, static non-relativistic gas of Maxwell molecules.
