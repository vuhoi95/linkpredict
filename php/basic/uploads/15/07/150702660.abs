Title: A $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric $AdS_4$ Solution in M-theory with  Purely Magnetic Flux
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Niall T. Macpherson and Jes√∫s Montero
Abstract: We find a new $\mathcal{N}=2$ $AdS_4$ solution in M-theory supported by purely magnetic flux via a sequence of abelian and non-abelian T-dualities. This provides the second known example in this class besides the uplift of the Pernici and Sezgin solution to 7d gauged supergravity constructed in the eighties. We compute the free energy of the solution, and show that it scales as $N^{3/2}$. It is intriguing that even though the natural holographic interpretation is in terms of M5-branes wrapped on a special Lagrangian 3-cycle, this solution does not exhibit the expected $N^3$ behavior.
