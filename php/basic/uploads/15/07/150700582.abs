Title: Entanglement constant for conformal families
Authors: Pawel Caputa and Alvaro Veliz-Osorio
Abstract: We show that in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories, exciting a state with a local operator increases the Renyi entanglement entropies by a constant which is the same for every member of the conformal family. Hence, it is an intrinsic parameter that characterises local operators from the perspective of quantum entanglement. In rational conformal field theories this constant corresponds to the logarithm of the quantum dimension of the primary operator. We provide several detailed examples for the second Renyi entropies and a general derivation.
