Title: Generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem in a soluble out of  equilibrium model
Authors: A. L. M. Britto and Ashok K. Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: In the context of an exactly soluble out of equilibrium (quenched) model, we study an extension of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. This involves a modified differential form of this relation, with an effective temperature which may have an explicit dependence on time scales.
