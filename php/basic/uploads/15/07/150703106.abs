Title: Saddle point inflation in string-inspired theory
Authors: Yuta Hamada and Hikaru Kawai and Kiyoharu Kawana
Abstract: The observed value of the Higgs mass indicates the possibility that there is no supersymmetry below the Planck scale and that the Higgs can play the role of the inflaton. We examine the general structure of the saddle point inflation in string-inspired theory without supersymmetry. We point out that the string scale is fixed to be around the GUT scale $\sim10^{16}$GeV in order to realize successful inflation. We find that the inflaton can be naturally identified with the Higgs field.
