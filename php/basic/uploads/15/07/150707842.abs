Title: Properties of Nilpotent Supergravity
Authors: E. Dudas and S. Ferrara and A. Kehagias and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: We construct Supergravity models where the goldstino multiplet has a gravitational origin, being dual to the chiral curvature superfield. Supersymmetry is nonlinearly realized due to a nilpotent constraint, while the goldstino arises from $\gamma$-traces of the gauge-invariant gravitino field strength. After duality transformations one recovers, as expected, the standard Volkov-Akulov Lagrangian coupled to Supergravity, but the gravitational origin of the goldstino multiplet restricts the available types of matter couplings. We also construct explicitly some inflationary models of this type, which contain both the inflaton and the nilpotent superfield.
