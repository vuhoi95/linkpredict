Title: Quartic interaction vertex in the massive integer higher spin field  theory in a constant electromagnetic field
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. A. Krykhtin
Abstract: We consider the massive integer higher spin fields coupled to an external constant electromagnetic field in flat space of arbitrary dimension and find a gauge invariant quartic interaction vertex which is quadratic in dynamical higher spin field and quadratic in external field. Construction of the vertex is based on the BRST approach to higher spin filed theory where no off-shell constraints on the fields and on the gauge parameters are imposed from the very beginning (unconstrained formulation).
