Title: Diffeomorphism-invariant observables and their nonlocal algebra
Authors: William Donnelly and Steven B. Giddings
Abstract: Gauge-invariant observables for quantum gravity are described, with explicit constructions given primarily to leading order in Newton's constant, analogous to and extending constructions first given by Dirac in quantum electrodynamics. These can be thought of as operators that create a particle, together with its inseparable gravitational field, and reduce to usual field operators of quantum field theory in the weak-gravity limit; they include both Wilson-line operators, and those creating a Coulombic field configuration. We also describe operators creating the field of a particle in motion; as in the electromagnetic case, these are expected to help address infrared problems. An important characteristic of the quantum theory of gravity is the algebra of its observables. We show that the commutators of the simple observables of this paper are nonlocal, with nonlocality becoming significant in strong field regions, as predicted previously on general grounds.
