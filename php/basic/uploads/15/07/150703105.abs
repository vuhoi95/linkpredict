Title: Insulator/metal phase transition and colossal magnetoresistance in  holographic model
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Run-Qiu Yang
Abstract: Within massive gravity, we construct a gravity dual for insulator/metal phase transition and colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect found in some manganese oxides materials. In heavy graviton limit, a remarkable magnetic-field-sensitive DC resistivity peak appears at the Curie temperature, where an insulator/metal phase transition happens and the magnetoresistance is scaled with the square of field-induced magnetization. We find that metallic and insulating phases coexist below the Curie point and the relation with the electronic phase separation is discussed.
