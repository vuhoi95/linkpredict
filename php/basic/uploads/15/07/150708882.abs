Title: $n$-point amplitudes with a single negative-helicity graviton
Authors: Sam D. Alston and David C. Dunbar and Warren B. Perkins
Abstract: We construct an expression for the n-point one-loop graviton scattering amplitude with a single negative helicity external leg using an augmented recursion technique. We analyse the soft-limits of these amplitudes and demonstrate that they have soft behaviour beyond the conjectured universal behaviour.
