Title: Boundary Operators of BCFW Recursion Relation
Authors: Qingjun Jin and Bo Feng
Abstract: We show that boundary contributions of BCFW recursions can be interpreted as the form factors of some composite operators which we call 'boundary operators'. The boundary operators can be extracted from the operator product expansion of deformed fields. We also present an algorithm to compute the boundary operators using path integral.
