Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Fedor Levkovich-Maslyuk and Grigory Sizov
Abstract: We obtain an analytical expression for the Next-to-Next-to-Leading order of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) Pomeron eigenvalue in planar SYM N=4 using Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) integrability based method. The result is verified with more than 60 digits precision using the numerical method developed by us in a previous paper. As a byproduct we developed a general analytic method of solving the QSC perturbatively.
