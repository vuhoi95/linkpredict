Title: String Theory Realizations of the Nilpotent Goldstino
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Fernando Quevedo and Angel M. Uranga
Abstract: We describe in detail how the spectrum of a single anti-D3-brane in four-dimensional orientifolded IIB string models reproduces precisely the field content of a nilpotent chiral superfield with the only physical component corresponding to the fermionic goldstino. In particular we explicitly consider a single anti-D3-brane on top of an O3-plane in warped throats, induced by $(2,1)$ fluxes. More general systems including several anti-branes and other orientifold planes are also discussed. This provides further evidence to the claim that non-linearly realized supersymmetry due to the presence of antibranes in string theory can be described by supersymmetric theories including nilpotent superfields. Implications to the KKLT and related scenarios of de Sitter moduli stabilization, to cosmology and to the structure of soft SUSY-breaking terms are briefly discussed.
