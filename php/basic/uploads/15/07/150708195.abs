Title: Rapidity dependence in holographic heavy ion collisions
Authors: Wilke van der Schee and Bjoern Schenke
Abstract: We present an attempt to closely mimic the initial stage of heavy ion collisions within holography, assuming a decoupling of longitudinal and transverse dynamics in the very early stage. We subsequently evolve the obtained initial state using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, and compare results to experimental data. We present results for charged hadron pseudo-rapidity spectra and directed and elliptic flow as functions of pseudo-rapidity for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200\,{\rm GeV}$ Au-Au and $2.76\,{\rm TeV}$ Pb-Pb collisions. The directed flow interestingly turns out to be quite sensitive to the viscosity. The results can explain qualitative features of the collisions, but the rapidity spectra in our current model is narrower than the experimental data.
