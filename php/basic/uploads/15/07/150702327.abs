Title: When electric charge becomes also magnetic
Authors: Tiago C. Adorno and Dmitry M. Gitman and Anatoly E. Shabad
Abstract: In nonlinear electrodynamics, QED included, we find a static solution to the field equations with an electric charge as its source, which is comprised of homogeneous parallel magnetic and electric fields, and a radial spherically-nonsymmetric long-range magnetic field, whose magnetic charge is proportional to the electric charge and also depends on the homogeneous component of the solution.
