Title: Beyond Fab Four
Authors: E. Babichev and C. Charmousis and D. Langlois and R. Saito
Abstract: We show that the two additional Lagrangians that appear in theories beyond Horndeski can be reexpressed in terms of simple generalizations of the "John" and "Paul" terms of the Fab Four theories. We find that these extended Fab Four satisfy the same properties of self-tuning as the original Fab Four.
