Title: Black hole solutions in Einstein-charged scalar field theory
Authors: Supakchai Ponglertsakul and Sam Dolan and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We investigate possible end-points of the superradiant instability for a charged black hole with a reflecting mirror. By considering a fully coupled system of gravity and a charged scalar field, hairy black hole solutions are obtained. The linear stability of these black hole solutions is studied.
