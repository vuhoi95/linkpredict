Title: The exact Schur index of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM
Authors: Jun Bourdier and Nadav Drukker and Jan Felix
Abstract: The Witten index counts the difference in the number of bosonic and fermionic states of a quantum mechanical system. The Schur index, which can be defined for theories with at least $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry in four dimensions is a particular refinement of the index, dependent on one parameter $q$ serving as the fugacity for a particular set of charges which commute with the hamiltonian and some supersymmetry generators. This index has a known expression for all Lagrangian and some non-Lagrangian theories as a finite dimensional integral or a complicated infinite sum. In the case of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with gauge group $U(N)$ we rewrite this as the partition function of a gas of $N$ non interacting and translationally invariant fermions on a circle. This allows us to perform the integrals and write down explicit expressions for fixed $N$ as well as the exact all orders large $N$ expansion.
