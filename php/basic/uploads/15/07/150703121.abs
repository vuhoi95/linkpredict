Authors: Li-Qing Fang and Xiao-Mei Kuang and Bin Wang and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: We investigate the holographic fermionic phase transition induced by the effective impurity in holography, which is introduced by massless scalar fields in Einstein-Maxwell-massless scalar gravity. We obtain a phase diagram in $(\alpha, T)$ plane separating the Fermi liquid phase and the non-Fermi liquid phase.
