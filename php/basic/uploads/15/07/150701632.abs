Title: Bounds on large extra dimensions from the simulation of black hole  events at the LHC
Authors: Shaoqi Hou and Benjamin Harms and Marco Cavaglia
Abstract: If large extra dimensions exist, the Planck scale may be as low as a TeV and microscopic black holes may be produced in high-energy particle collisions at this energy scale. We simulate microscopic black hole formation at the Large Hadron Collider and compare the simulation results with recent experimental data by the Compact Muon Solenoid collaboration. The absence of observed black hole events in the experimental data allows us to set lower bounds on the Planck scale and various parameters related to microscopic black hole formation for a number ($3-6$) of extra dimensions. Our analysis sets lower bounds on the fundamental Planck scale ranging from 0.6 TeV to 4.8 TeV for black holes fully decaying into Standard Model particles and 0.3 TeV to 2.8 TeV for black holes settling down to a remnant, depending on the minimum allowed black hole mass at formation. Formation of black holes with mass less than 5.2 TeV to 6.5 TeV (SM decay) and 2.2 TeV to 3.4 TeV (remnant) is excluded at 95\% C.L. Our analysis shows consistency with and difference from the CMS results.
