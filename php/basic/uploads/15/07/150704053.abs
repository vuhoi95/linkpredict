Title: Toward a Gravity Dual of Glueball Inflation
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Peter Suranyi and L. C. Rohana Wijewardhana
Abstract: We summarize and extend our work on nonsupersymmetric solutions of a 5d consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity, that is relevant for gauge/gravity duality. The fields in this 5d theory are the five-dimensional metric and a set of scalars. We find solutions of the 5d equations of motion, which represent dS_4 foliations over the fifth (radial) dimension. In each solution at least one scalar has a nontrivial radial profile. These scalars are interpreted as glueballs in the dual gauge theory, living in 4d de Sitter space. We explain why this lays a foundation for building gravity duals of glueball inflation models.
