Title: N=4 Supersymmetric AdS5 Vacua and their Moduli Spaces
Authors: Jan Louis and Hagen Triendl and Marco Zagermann
Abstract: We classify the N=4 supersymmetric AdS5 backgrounds that arise as solutions of five-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity. We express our results in terms of the allowed embedding tensor components and identify the structure of the associated gauge groups. We show that the moduli space of these AdS vacua is of the form SU(1,m)/(U(1)x SU(m)) and discuss our results regarding holographically dual N=2 SCFTs and their conformal manifolds.
