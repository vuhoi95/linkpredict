Title: High-Scale Inflation and the Tensor Tilt
Authors: Daniel Baumann and Hayden Lee and Guilherme L. Pimentel
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel observational signature of gravitational corrections during slow-roll inflation. We study the coupling of the inflaton field to higher-curvature tensors in models with a minimal breaking of conformal symmetry. In that case, the most general correction to the tensor two-point function is captured by a coupling to the square of the Weyl tensor. We show that these scenarios lead to a correction to the tilt of the tensor power spectrum and hence a violation of the tensor consistency condition. We arrive at the same conclusion through an analysis in conformal perturbation theory.
