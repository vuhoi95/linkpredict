Title: Building a doped Mott system by holography
Authors: Yi Ling and Peng Liu and Chao Niu and Jian-Pin Wu
Abstract: We construct a holographic model in the framework of Q-lattices whose dual exhibits metal-insulator transitions. By introducing an interacting term between the Q-lattice and the electromagnetic field in bulk geometry, we find such kind of transition can be Mott-like. The evidences are presented as follows. i) The transition from a metallic phase to an insulating phase occurs when the lattice constant becomes larger. ii) A hard gap in the insulating phase can be manifestly observed in the optical conductivity. Nevertheless, in the zero temperature limit this model exhibits novel metallic behavior, featured by a gap as well as a zero-frequency mode with tiny spectral weight. It implies that our model is dual to a doped Mott system in one dimension where umklapp scattering is frozen at zero temperature. The similarity between this model and some organic linear chain conductors is briefly discussed.
