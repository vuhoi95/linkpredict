Title: Phantom Dark Energy Spinors in Einstein-Cartan Gravity
Authors: Yu-Chiao Chang and Mariam Bouhmadi-LÃ³pez and Pisin Chen
Abstract: A class of dynamical dark energy models is constructed through an extended version of fermion fields called ELKO spinors, which are spin one half with mass dimension one. We find that if the ELKO spinor interacts with torsion fields in a homogeneous and isotropic universe, then it does not imply any future dark energy singularity or any abrupt event, though the fermion has a negative kinetic energy. In fact, the equation of state of this dark energy model will asymptotically approach the value $w=-1$ from above without crossing the phantom divide and inducing therefore a de Sitter state. Consequently, we expect the model to be stable because no phantom field will be created. At late time, the torsion fields will vanish as the ELKO spinors dilute. As would be expected intuitively, this result is unaffected by the presence of cold dark matter although the proof is not as straightforward as in general relativity.
