Title: Solutions of Mathisson-Papapetrou equations for highly relativistic  spinning particles
Authors: Roman Plyatsko and Mykola Fenyk and Oleksandr Stefanyshyn
Abstract: Different types of essentially nongeodesic motions of highly relativistic spinning particles in Schwarzschild's and Kerr's background which follows from the Mathisson-Papapetrou (MP) equations are considered. It is shown that dependently on the correlation of signs of the spin and the particle's orbital velocity the spin-gravity coupling acts as a significant repulsive or attractive force. Numerical estimates for electrons, protons, and neutrinos in the gravitational field of black holes are presented. The correspondence between the general relativistic Dirac equation and MP equations is discussed. It is stressed that for the highly relativistic motions the adequate supplementary condition for the MP equations is the Mathisson-Pirani condition. In the following it is important to study the possible role of the highly relativistic spin-gravity coupling in astrophysics, cosmology, and high energy physics.
