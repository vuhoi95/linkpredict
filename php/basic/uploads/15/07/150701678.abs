Title: Exact Instanton Expansion of ABJM Partition Function
Authors: Yasuyuki Hatsuda and Sanefumi Moriyama and Kazumi Okuyama
Abstract: We review recent progress in determining the partition function of the ABJM theory in the large N expansion, including all of the perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. Especially, we will focus on how these exact expansions are obtained from various beautiful relations to Fermi gas system, topological string theory, integrable model and supergroup.
