Title: Oscillating Shells in Anti-de Sitter Space
Authors: Javier Mas and Alexandre Serantes
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a spherically symmetric thin shell of perfect fluid embedded in d-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space-time. In global coordinates, besides collapsing solutions, oscillating solutions are found where the shell bounces back and forth between two radii. The parameter space where these oscillating solutions exist is scanned in arbitrary number of dimensions. As expected AdS3 appears to be singled out.
