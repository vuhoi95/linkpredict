Title: On Yangian symmetry of scattering amplitudes and the dilatation operator  in N=4 super Yang-Mills
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Paul Heslop and Gabriele Travaglini and Donovan Young
Abstract: It is known that the Yangian of PSU(2,2|4) is a symmetry of the tree-level S-matrix of N=4 super Yang-Mills. On the other hand, the complete one-loop dilatation operator in the same theory commutes with the level-one Yangian generators only up to certain boundary terms found by Dolan, Nappi and Witten. Using a result by Zwiebel, we show how the Yangian symmetry of the tree-level S-matrix of N=4 super Yang-Mills implies precisely the Yangian invariance, up to boundary terms, of the one-loop dilatation operator.
