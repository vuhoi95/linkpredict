Title: Generalized entanglement entropy and holography
Authors: Nana Cabo Bizet and Octavio Obreg√≥n
Abstract: In this work, we first introduce a generalized von Neumann entropy that depends only on the density matrix. This is based on a previous proposal by one of us modifying the Shannon entropy by considering non-equilibrium systems on stationary states, and an entropy functional depending only on the probability. We propose a generalization of the replica trick and find that the resulting modified von Neumann entropy is precisely the previous mentioned entropy that was obtained by other assumptions. Then, we address the question whether alternative entanglement entropies can play a role in the gauge/gravity duality. Our focus are 2d CFT and their gravity duals. Our results show corrections to the von Neumann entropy $S_0$ that are larger than the usual $UV$ ones and also than the corrections to the length dependent $AdS_3$ entropy which result comparable to the $UV$ ones. The correction terms due to the new entropy would modify the Ryu-Takayanagi identification between the CFT and the gravitational $AdS_3$ entropies.
