Title: Factorisation and holomorphic blocks in 4d
Authors: Fabrizio Nieri and Sara Pasquetti
Abstract: We study N=1 theories on Hermitian manifolds of the form M^4=S^1xM^3 with M^3 a U(1) fibration over S^2, and their 3d N=2 reductions. These manifolds admit an Heegaard-like decomposition in solid tori D^2xT^2 and D^2xS^1. We prove that when the 4d and 3d anomalies are cancelled the matrix integrands in the Coulomb branch partition functions can be factorised in terms of 1-loop factors on D^2xT^2 and D^2xS^1 respectively. By evaluating the Coulomb branch matrix integrals we show that the 4d and 3d partition functions can be expressed as sums of products of 4d and 3d holomorphic blocks.
