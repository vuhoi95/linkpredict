Title: Products of Thermodynamic Parameters for the Generalized Charged  Rotating Black Hole and the Reissner-Nordstrom Black Hole with Global  Monopole
Authors: Bushra Majeed and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of Kerr-Newman-Kasuya black hole and the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with a global monopole on inner and outer horizons. Products of surface gravities, surface temperatures, Komar energies, electromagnetic potentials, angular velocities, areas, entropies, horizon radii and the irreducible masses at the Cauchy and the event horizons are calculated. It is observed that the product of surface gravities, surface temperature product and product of Komar energies, electromagnetic potentials and angular velocities at horizons are not universal quantities for these black holes. Products of areas and entropies at horizons are independent of masses of black holes. Heat capacity is calculated for the generalized charged rotating black hole and phase transition is observed, under certain conditions on r. ?E
