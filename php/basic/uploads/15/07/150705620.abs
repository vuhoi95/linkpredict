Title: Stress tensor correlators in three-dimensional gravity
Authors: Arjun Bagchi and Daniel Grumiller and Wout Merbis
Abstract: We calculate holographically arbitrary n-point correlators of the boundary stress tensor in three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative or vanishing cosmological constant. We provide explicit expressions up to 5-point (connected) correlators and show consistency with the Galilean conformal field theory Ward identities and recursion relations of correlators, which we derive. This provides a novel check of flat space holography in three dimensions.
