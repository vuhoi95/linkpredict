Title: AdS3 Holography for 1/4 and 1/8 BPS geometries
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Emanuele Moscato and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: Recently a new class of 1/8-BPS regular geometries in type IIB string theory was constructed in arXiv:1503.01463. In this paper we provide a precise description of the semiclassical states dual, in the AdS/CFT sense, to these geometries. In explicit examples we show that the holographic 1-point functions and the Ryu-Takayanagi's Entanglement Entropy for a single small interval match the corresponding CFT calculations performed by using the proposed dual states. We also discuss several new examples of such precision holography analysis in the 1/4-BPS sector and provide an explicit proof that the small interval derivation of the Entanglement Entropy used in arXiv:1405.6185 is fully covariant.
