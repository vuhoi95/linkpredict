Title: Fundamental Symmetries of the Modified Anyonic Particle
Authors: Salman Abarghouei Nejad and Mehdi Dehghani and Majid Monemzadeh
Abstract: We try to increase the fundamental symmetries of the anyonic particle with the help of the symplectic formalism of constrained systems and gauging the model. The main idea of this approach is based on the embedding of the model in an extended phase space. After the gauging process had done, we obtain generators of gauge transformations of the model. Finally, by extracting the corresponding Poisson structure of all constraints, we compare the effect of gauging on the the phase spaces, the number of physical degrees of freedom, and canonical structures of both primary and gauged models.
