Title: An Extremal N=2 Superconformal Field Theory
Authors: Nathan Benjamin and Ethan Dyer and A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Shamit Kachru
Abstract: We provide an example of an extremal chiral ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theory at $c=24$. The construction is based on a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ orbifold of the theory associated to the $A_{1}^{24}$ Niemeier lattice. The statespace is governed by representations of the sporadic group $M_{23}$.
