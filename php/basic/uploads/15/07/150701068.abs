Title: Yang-Mills theories and quadratic forms
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Lars Brink and Mahendra Mali
Abstract: We show that the Hamiltonian of (N=1;d=10) super Yang-Mills can be expressed as a quadratic form in a very similar manner to that of the (N=4;d=4) theory. We find a similar quadratic form structure for pure Yang-Mills theory but this feature, in the non-supersymmetric case, seems to be unique to four dimensions. We discuss some consequences of this feature.
