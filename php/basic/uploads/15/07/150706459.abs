Title: Lorentz invariant deformations of momentum space
Authors: Valerio Astuti and Laurent Freidel
Abstract: In relative locality theories the geometric properties of phase space depart from the standard ones given by the fact that spaces of momenta are linear fibers over a spacetime base manifold. In particular here it is assumed that the momentum space is non linear and can therefore carry non trivial metric and composition law. We classify to second order all possible such deformations that preserve Lorentz invariance. We show that such deformations still exists after quotienting out by diffeomorphisms only if the non linear addition is non associative.
