Title: Chiral asymmetry in propagation of soliton defects in crystalline  backgrounds
Authors: Adrian Arancibia and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: By applying Darboux-Crum transformations to a Lax pair formulation of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, we construct new sets of multi-soliton solutions to it as well as to the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. The obtained solutions exhibit a chiral asymmetry in propagation of different types of defects in crystalline backgrounds. We show that the KdV solitons of pulse and compression modulation types, which support bound states in semi-infinite and finite forbidden bands in the spectrum of the perturbed quantum one-gap Lame system, propagate in opposite directions with respect to the asymptotically periodic background. A similar but more complicated picture also appears for the multi-kink-antikink mKdV solitons that propagate with a privileged direction over topologically trivial or topologically nontrivial crystalline background in dependence on position of energy levels of the trapped bound states in the spectral gaps of the associated Dirac system. An exotic N=4 nonlinear supersymmetric structure incorporating Lax-Novikov integrals of a pair of perturbed Lame systems is shown to underlie the Miura-Darboux-Crum construction. It unifies the KdV and mKdV solutions, detects the defects and distinguishes their types, and identifies the types of crystalline backgrounds.
