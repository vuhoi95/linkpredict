Abstract: We consider the integrable open-chain transfer matrix corresponding to a Y=0 brane at one boundary, and a Y_theta=0 brane (rotated with the respect to the former by an angle theta) at the other boundary. We determine the exact eigenvalues of this transfer matrix in terms of solutions of a corresponding set of Bethe equations.
