Abstract: On-shell diagrams \cite{2006math......9764P} have become an important tool employed in the study of $\mathcal{N}=4$ scattering amplitudes since its introduction by Arkani-Hamed et al in a seminal work \cite{GeometryOnshell}. In this work we extend these techniques to higher-loop nonplanar on-shell diagrams without external BCFW-bridges. To compute the leading singularities for these diagrams we introduce an auxiliary external momentum line so that we can, again, deploy the systematic method introduced in \cite{Chen:2014ara} to decompose the on-shell diagrams by successive BCFW-bridges and reduce it to planar diagrams--using the CCD permutation relation of Yangian invariants \cite{du2014permutation}--whose top-forms are well-known. The top-form of the on-shell diagram with the auxiliary line can then be obtained by performing the chain of BCFW-integrations in the inverse order, as prescribed in our companion paper. To recover the top-form of the original diagram without the external BCFW-bridge, a soft limit for the auxiliary line is taken. We obtain the evolutions of the Grassmannian integral and the geometric constraints under the soft limit. This, together with \cite{Chen:2014ara}, completes the top-form description of leading singularities in nonplanar scattering amplitudes of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) which is valid for arbitrary higher-loops beyond MHV (Maximally-Helicity-Violation).
