Title: Heavy ${\bar Q}Q$ free energy from hadronic states
Authors: E. Megias and E. Ruiz Arriola and L. L. Salcedo
Abstract: Within the spirit of the Hadron Resonance Gas model, we study a representation of the heavy $\bar{Q}Q$ free energy at temperatures below the phase transition in terms of the string and heavy-light hadrons. We discuss the string breaking phenomenon and the relevance of avoided crossings between the fundamental string and the hadron spectrum. Good agreement with lattice data is achieved.
