Title: Charged Einstein-aether black holes and Smarr formula
Authors: Chikun Ding and Anzhong Wang and Xinwen Wang
Abstract: In the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-aether theory, we present two new classes of exact charged black hole solutions, which are asymptotically flat and possess the universal as well as Killing horizons. We also construct the Smarr formulas, and calculate the temperatures of the horizons, using the Smarr mass-area relation. We find that, in contrast to the neutral case, such obtained temperature is not proportional to its surface gravity at any of the two kinds of the horizons. Einstein-Maxwell-aether black holes with the cosmological constant and their topological cousins are also given.
