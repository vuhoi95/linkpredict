Title: Quantum Entanglement of Fermionic Local Operators
Authors: Masahiro Nozaki and Tokiro Numasawa and Shunji Matsuura
Abstract: In this paper we study the time evolution of (Renyi) entanglement entropies for locally excited states in four dimensional free massless fermionic field theory. Locally excited states are defined by being acted by various local operators on the ground state. Their excesses are defined by subtracting (Renyi) entanglement entropy for the ground state from those for locally excited states. They finally approach some constant if the subsystem is given by half of the total space. They have spin dependence. They can be interpreted in terms of quasi-particles.
