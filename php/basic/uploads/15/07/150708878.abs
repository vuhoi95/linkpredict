Abstract: Based on an earlier introduced new class of generalized gravity-matter models defined in terms of two independent non-Riemannian volume forms (alternative generally covariant integration measure densities) on the space-time manifold, we derive an effective "Einstein-frame" theory featuring the following remarkable properties: (i) We obtain effective potential for the cosmological scalar field possessing two infinitely large flat regions which allows for a unified description of both early universe inflation as well as of present dark energy epoch; (ii) For a specific parameter range the model possesses a non-singular stable "emergent universe" solution which describes an initial phase of evolution that precedes the inflationary phase.
