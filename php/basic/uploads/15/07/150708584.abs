Title: New realizations of the supergroup D(2,1;Î±) in N=4 superconformal  mechanics
Authors: S. Fedoruk and E. Ivanov
Abstract: We present new explicit realizations of the most general N=4, d=1 superconformal symmetry D(2,1;\alpha) in the models of N=4 superconformal mechanics based on the reducible multiplets (1,4,3)\oplus(0,4,4), (3,4,1)\oplus(0,4,4) and (4,4,0)\oplus(0,4,4). We start from the manifestly supersymmetric superfield actions for these systems and then descend to the relevant off- and on-shell component actions from which we derive the D(2,1;\alpha) (super)charges by the Noether procedure. Some peculiarities of these realizations of D(2,1;\alpha) are discussed. We also construct a new D(2,1;\alpha) invariant system by joining the multiplets (3,4,1) and (4,4,0) in such a way that they interact with each other through an extra (0,4,4) multiplet. New fermionic conformal couplings appear as the result of elimination of the appropriate auxiliary fields.
