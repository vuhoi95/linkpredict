Abstract: We consider six-dimensional supergravity with gauge group $SO(10)\times U(1)_A$, compactified on the orbifold $T^2 / \mathbb{Z}_2$. Three quark-lepton generations arise as zero modes of a bulk $\bf16$-plet due to magnetic flux of the anomalous $U(1)_A$. Boundary conditions at the four fixed points break $SO(10)$ to subgroups whose intersection is the Standard Model gauge group. The gauge and Higgs sector consist of "split" $SO(10)$ multiplets. As consequence of the $U(1)_A$ flux, squarks and sleptons are much heavier than gauge bosons, Higgs bosons, gauginos and higgsinos. We thus obtain a picture similar to "split supersymmetry." The flavor structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices is determined by the symmetry breaking at the orbifold fixed points.
