Title: Exact solutions for Weyl fermions with gravity
Authors: Roberto Cianci and Luca Fabbri and Stefano Vignolo
Abstract: We consider the single-handed spinor field in interaction with its own gravitational field described by the set of field equations given by Weyl field equations written in terms of derivatives that are covariant with respect to the gravitational connection plus Einstein field equations soured with the energy tensor of the spinor: for the Weyl spinor and the ensuing spacetime of Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou structure, we will find all exact solutions. The obtained solution for the metric tensor is that of a PP-wave spacetime while the spinor field is a flag-dipole.
