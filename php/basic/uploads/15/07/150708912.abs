Title: E11 and exceptional field theory
Authors: Alexander G. Tumanov and Peter West
Abstract: We demonstrate that exceptional field theory is a truncation of the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and its first fundamental as proposed in 2003. Evaluating the simple equations of the E11 approach, and using the commutators of the E11 algebra, we find the equations of exceptional field theory after making a radical truncation. This procedure does not respect any of the higher level E11 symmetries and so these are lost. We suggest that the need for the section condition in exceptional field theory could be a consequence of the truncation.
