Title: Partially Massless Monopoles and Charges
Authors: Kurt Hinterbichler and Rachel A. Rosen
Abstract: Massive higher spin fields on de Sitter space exhibit enhanced gauge symmetries at special values of the mass. These fields are known as "partially massless." We study the structure of the charges and Gauss laws which characterize sources for the partially massless spin-2. Despite having a simple scalar gauge symmetry, there is a rich structure of gauge charges. The charges come in electric and magnetic varieties, each taking values in the fundamental representation of the de Sitter group. We find two invariant electric-like charges and two invariant magnetic-like charges and we find the point-like monopole solutions which carry these charges, analogous to the electric point charge solution and Dirac monopole solution of Maxwell electrodynamics. These solutions are related by partially massless duality, analogous to the electromagnetic duality that relates electric to magnetic charges.
