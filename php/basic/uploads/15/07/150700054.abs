Title: Effective thermodynamics of isolated entangled squeezed and coherent  states
Authors: King Karl R. Seroje and Rafael S. dela Rosa and Francis N. C. Paraan
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is calculated exactly for mode-partitioned isolated systems such as the two-mode squeezed state and the multi-mode Silbey-Harris polaron ansatz state. Effective thermodynamic descriptions of the correlated partitions are constructed to present quantum information theory concepts in the language of thermodynamics. Boltzmann weights are obtained from the entanglement spectrum by deriving the exact relationship between an effective temperature and the physical entanglement parameters. The partition function of the resulting effective thermal theory can be obtained directly from the single-copy entanglement.
