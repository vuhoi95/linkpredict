Title: Cyclic universe from Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Francesco Cianfrani and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman and Giacomo Rosati
Abstract: We discuss how a cyclic model for the flat universe can be constructively derived from Loop Quantum Gravity. This model has a lower bounce, at small values of the scale factor, which shares many similarities with that of Loop Quantum Cosmology. We find that quantum gravity corrections can be also relevant at energy densities much smaller than the Planckian one and that they can induce an upper bounce at large values of the scale factor.
