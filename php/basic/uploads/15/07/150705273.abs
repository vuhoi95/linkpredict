Title: Inflation in exponential scalar model and finite-time singularity  induced instability
Authors: S. D. Odintsov and V. K. Oikonomou
Abstract: We investigate how a Type IV future singularity can be included in the cosmological evolution of a well-known exponential model of inflation. In order to achieve this we use a two scalar field model, in the context of which the incorporation of the Type IV singularity can be consistently done. In the context of the exponential model we study, when a Type IV singularity is included in the evolution, an instability occurs in the slow-roll parameters, and in particular on the second slow-roll parameter. Particularly, if we abandon the slow-roll condition for both the scalars we shall use, then the most consistent description of the dynamics of the inflationary era is provided by the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\epsilon_H$ and $\eta_H$. Then, the second Hubble slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$, which measures the duration of the inflationary era, becomes singular at the point where the Type IV singularity is chosen to occur, while the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_H$ is regular there. Therefore, this infinite singularity indicates that the occurrence of the finite-time singularity is responsible for the instability in the scalar field model we study. This sort of instability has it's imprint on the dynamical system that can be constructed from the cosmological equations, with the dynamical system being unstable. In addition, the instability due to the singularity mechanism we propose, is discussed in the context of other inflationary scalar potentials. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a singularity in the Hubble slow-roll parameters and we also critically discuss qualitatively, what implications could this effect have on the graceful exit problem of the exponential model.
