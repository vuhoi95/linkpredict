Title: Non-minimal scalar multiplets, supersymmetry breaking and dualities
Authors: Fotis Farakos and Ondřej Hulík and Pavel Kočí and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We study supersymmetry breaking in theories with non-minimal multiplets (such as the complex linear or CNM multiplets), by using superspace higher derivative terms which give rise to new supersymmetry breaking vacuum solutions on top of the standard supersymmetric vacuum. We illustrate the decoupling of the additional massive sectors inside the complex linear and the CNM multiplets and show that only the Goldstino sector is left in the low energy limit. We also discuss the duality between non-minimal scalar multiplets and chiral multiplets in the presence of superspace higher derivatives. From the superspace Noether procedure we calculate the supercurrents, and we show that in the supersymmetry breaking vacuum the chiral superfield X which enters the Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent conservation equation does indeed flow in the IR to the chiral constrained Goldstino superfield. We also provide a description of the Goldstino sector in terms of the Samuel-Wess superfield for the supersymmetry breaking mechanism at hand.
