Title: Precision Predictions for the Primordial Power Spectra of Scalar  Potential Models of Inflation
Authors: D. J. Brooker and N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We exploit a new numerical technique for evaluating the tree order contributions to the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra for scalar potential models of inflation. Among other things we develop a good analytic approximation for the nonlocal corrections from evolution before and after horizon crossing.
