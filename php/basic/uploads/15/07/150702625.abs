Title: On the Localisation of 4-Dimensional Brane-World Black Holes II: the  general case
Authors: P. Kanti and N. Pappas and T. Pappas
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a number of scalar field theories in a attempt to find analytically 5-dimensional, localised-on-the-brane, black-hole solutions. Extending a previous analysis, we assume a generalised Vaidya ansatz for the 5-dimensional metric tensor that allows for time-dependence, non-trivial profile of the mass function in terms of the bulk coordinate and a deviation from the over-restricting Schwarzschild-type solution on the brane. In order to support such a solution, we study a variety of theories including single or multiple scalar fields, with canonical or non-canonical kinetic terms, minimally or non-minimally coupled to gravity. We demonstrate that for such a metric ansatz and for a carefully chosen, non-isotropic in 5 dimensions, energy-momentum tensor, solutions that have the form of a Schwarzschild-(Anti)de Sitter or Reissner-Nordstrom type of solution do emerge, however, the resulting profile of the mass-function along the bulk coordinate, when allowed, is not the correct one to eliminate the bulk singularities.
