Title: Hydrodynamics of a Black Brane in Gauss-Bonnet Massive Gravity
Authors: Mehdi Sadeghi and Shahrokh Parvizi
Abstract: A black brane solution to a Gauss-Bonnet massive gravity is introduced. In the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, the viscosity to entropy ratio is found by the Green-Kubo formula. The result indicates violation of the well-known KSS bound as expected in a higher derivative theory. Setting mass zero gives back the known viscosity to entropy ratio dependent on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while without Gauss-Bonnet term, a nonzero mass parameter doesn't contribute to the ratio which saturates the bound of $1/4\pi$.
