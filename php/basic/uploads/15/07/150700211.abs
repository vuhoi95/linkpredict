Title: A Note on Holographic Non-Relativistic Goldstone Bosons
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Andrea Marzolla and Andrea Mezzalira and Daniel Naegels
Abstract: We consider a holographic set-up where relativistic invariance is broken by a chemical potential, and a non-abelian internal symmetry is broken spontaneously. We use the tool of holographic renormalization in order to infer what can be learned purely by analytic boundary considerations. We find that the expected Ward identities are correctly reproduced. In particular, we obtain the identity which implies the non-commutation of a pair of broken charges, which leads to the presence of Goldstone bosons with quadratic dispersion relations.
