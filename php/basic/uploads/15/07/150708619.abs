Title: Component action of nilpotent multiplet coupled to matter in 4  dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity
Authors: Fuminori Hasegawa and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We construct the component action of the system including an ordinary matter and a nilpotent multiplet in global and local supersymmetric framework. The higher dimensional operators of not only Goldstino but also matter and gravitino fields are shown, which appear due to nonlinearly realized supersymmetry.
