Title: Phenomenology of effective geometries from quantum gravity
Authors: Ricardo Gallego Torrom√© and Marco Letizia and Stefano Liberati
Abstract: In a recent paper (arXiv:1412.6000) a general mechanism for emergence of cosmological space-time geometry from a quantum gravity setting was devised and departure from standard dispersion relations for elementary particle were predicted. We elaborate here on this approach extending the results obtained in that paper and showing that generically such a framework will not lead to higher order modified dispersion relations in the matter sector. Furthermore, we shall discuss possible phenomenological constraints to this scenarios showing that space-time will have to be by nowadays classical to a very high degree in order to be consistent with current observations.
