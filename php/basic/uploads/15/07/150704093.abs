Title: From $r$-Spin Intersection Numbers to Hodge Integrals
Authors: Xiang-Mao Ding and Yuping Li and Lingxian Meng
Abstract: Generalized Kontsevich Matrix Model (GKMM) with a certain given potential is the partition function of $r$-spin intersection numbers. We represent this GKMM in terms of fermions and expand it in terms of the Schur polynomials by boson-fermion correspondence, and link it with a Hurwitz partition function and a Hodge partition by operators in a $\widehat{GL}(\infty)$ group. Then, from a $W_{1+\infty}$ constraint of the partition function of $r$-spin intersection numbers, we get a $W_{1+\infty}$ constraint for the Hodge partition function. The $W_{1+\infty}$ constraint completely determines the Schur polynomials expansion of the Hodge partition function.
