Title: Loop quantum gravity coupled to a scalar field
Authors: Jerzy Lewandowski and Hanno Sahlmann
Abstract: We reconsider the Rovelli-Smolin model of gravity coupled to the Klein-Gordon time field with an eye towards capturing the degrees of freedom of the scalar field lost in the framework in which time is deparametrized by the scalar field. Several new results for loop quantum gravity are obtained: (i) a Hilbert space for the gravity-matter system and a non-standard representation of the scalar field thereon is constructed, (ii) a new operator for the scalar constraint of the coupled system is defined and investigated, (iii) methods for solving the constraint are developed. Commutators of the new constraint do not vanish, but seem to reproduce a part of the Dirac algebra. This, however, poses problems for finding solutions. Hence the states we consider -- and perhaps the whole setup -- still needs some improvement. As a side result we describe a representation of the gravitational degrees of freedom in which the flux is diagonal. This representation bears a strong resemblance to the BF vacuum of Dittrich and Geiller.
