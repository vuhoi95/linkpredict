Title: The Relativistic Blackbody Spectrum in Inertial and Non-Inertial  Reference Frames
Authors: Jeff Lee and Gerald Cleaver
Abstract: By invoking inverse temperature as a van Kampen-Isreal future-directed timelike 4-vector, this paper derives the Relativistic Blackbody Spectrum, the Relativistic Wien's Displacement Law, and the Relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann Law in inertial and non-inertial reference frames.
