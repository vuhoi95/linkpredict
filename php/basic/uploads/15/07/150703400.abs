Title: Global two-monopoles
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Jarah Evslin
Abstract: Global two-monopoles are unstable in their simplest formulation. We construct a model with a metric-like prefactor which we show can stabilize the global two-monopoles. The stabilizing construction is realized with a Skyrme sector where the metric-like prefactor is a function of the Skyrmion profile.
