Title: BRST invariance in Coulomb gauge QCD
Authors: A. Andrasi and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: In the Coulomb gauge, the Hamiltonian of QCD contains terms of order h^2, identified by Christ and Lee, which are non-local but instantaneous. The question is addressed how these terms fit in with BRST invariance. Our discussion is confined to the simplest, O(g^4), example.
