Title: Open Mirror Symmetry for Higher Dimensional Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces
Authors: Yoshinori Honma and Masahide Manabe
Abstract: Compactifications with fluxes and branes motivate us to study various enumerative invariants of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper, we study non-perturbative corrections depending on both open and closed string moduli for a class of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds in general dimensions. Our analysis is based on the methods using relative cohomology and generalized hypergeometric system. For the simplest example of compact Calabi-Yau fivefold, we explicitly derive the associated Picard-Fuchs differential equations and compute the quantum corrections in terms of the open and closed flat coordinates. Implications for a kind of open-closed duality are also discussed.
