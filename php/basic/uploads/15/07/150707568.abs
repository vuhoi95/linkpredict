Title: Deformations on Tilted Tori and Moduli Stabilisation at the Orbifold  Point
Authors: Michael Blaszczyk and Gabriele Honecker and Isabel Koltermann
Abstract: We discuss deformations of orbifold singularities on tilted tori in the context of Type IIA orientifold model building with D6-branes on special Lagrangian cycles. Starting from $T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$, we mod out an additional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry to describe phenomenologically appealing backgrounds and reduce to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\Omega\mathcal{R}$ invariant orbits of deformations. While D6-branes carrying SO(2N) or USp(2N) gauge groups do not constrain deformations, D6-branes with U(N) gauge groups develop non-vanishing D-terms if they couple to previously singular, now deformed cycles. We present examples for both types of D6-branes, and in a three-generation Pati-Salam model on $T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_6')$ we find that ten out of 15 twisted complex structure moduli are indeed stabilised at the orbifold point by the existence of the brane stacks.
