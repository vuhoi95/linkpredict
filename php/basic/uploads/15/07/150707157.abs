Abstract: It is shown that the consideration of the braneworld consistency conditions within the framework of bulk modified gravities allows for the existence of thick branes in the five- dimensional case with compact extra dimension. In studing the specific consistency conditions in the Brans-Dicke gravity we were able to show that the brane generating scalar field potential is relevant for relaxing the gravitational constraints.
