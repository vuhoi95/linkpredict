Title: On the Lorentz-breaking theory with higher derivatives in spinor sector
Authors: J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and C. Marat Reyes
Abstract: We consider the two-point function of the gauge field in Lorentz-breaking theories with higher-derivative extension of the Dirac Lagrangian. We show that the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term naturally arises in this theory as a quantum correction being perfectly finite and thus displaying no ambiguities. Also, the finiteness of this term at low energy limit and the absence of large Lorentz violating corrections allows to avoid the fine-tuning problem.
