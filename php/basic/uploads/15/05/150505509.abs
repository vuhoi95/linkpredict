Title: Superradiance in stars
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Richard Brito and Joao L. Rosa
Abstract: It has long been known that dissipation is a crucial ingredient in the superradiant amplification of wavepackets off rotating objects. We show that, once appropriate dissipation mechanisms are included, stars are also prone to superradiance and superradiant instabilities. In particular, ultra-light dark matter with small interaction cross section with the star material or self-annihilation can trigger a superradiant instability. On long timescales, the instability strips the star of most of its angular momentum. Whether or not new stationary configurations surrounded by scalar condensates exist, remains to be seen.
