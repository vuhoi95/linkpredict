Title: Static and Dynamic Hairy Planar Black Holes
Authors: Zhong-Ying Fan and H. Lu
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity in general dimensions, coupled to a scalar field either minimally or non-minimally, together with a generic scalar potential. By making appropriate choices of the scalar potential, we obtain large classes of new scalar hairy black holes that are asymptotic to anti-de Sitter spacetimes in planar coordinates. For some classes of solutions, we can promote the scalar charge to be dependent on the advanced or retarded times in the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, and obtain exact dynamic solutions. In particular, one class of the collapse solutions describe the evolution from the AdS vacua to some stable black hole states, driven by a conformally-massless scalar. It is an explicit demonstration of nonlinear instability of the AdS vacuum that is stable at the linear level.
