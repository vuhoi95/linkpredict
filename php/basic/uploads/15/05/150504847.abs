Title: New Type of Hamiltonians Without Ultraviolet Divergence for Quantum  Field Theories
Authors: Stefan Teufel and Roderich Tumulka
Abstract: We propose a novel type of Hamiltonians for quantum field theories. They are mathematically well-defined (and in particular, ultraviolet finite) without any ultraviolet cut-off such as smearing out the particles over a nonzero radius; rather, the particles are assigned radius zero. We describe explicit examples of such Hamiltonians. Their definition, which is best expressed in the particle-position representation of the wave function, involves a novel type of boundary condition on the wave function, which we call an interior-boundary condition. The relevant configuration space is one of a variable number of particles, and the relevant boundary consists of the configurations with two or more particles at the same location. The interior-boundary condition relates the value (or derivative) of the wave function at a boundary point to the value of the wave function at an interior point (here, in a sector of configuration space corresponding to a lesser number of particles).
