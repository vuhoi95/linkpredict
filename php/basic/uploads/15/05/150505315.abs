Title: Uncovering the effective spacetime: Lessons from the effective field  theory rationale
Authors: Carlos Barceló and Raúl Carballo-Rubio and Luis J. Garay
Abstract: The cosmological constant problem can be understood as the failure of the decoupling principle behind effective field theory, so that some quantities in the low-energy theory are extremely sensitive to the high-energy properties. While this reflects the genuine character of the cosmological constant, finding an adequate effective field theory framework which avoids this naturalness problem may represent a step forward to understand nature. Following this intuition, we consider a minimal modification of the structure of general relativity which as an effective theory permits to work consistently at low energies, i.e., below the quantum gravity scale. This effective description preserves the classical phenomenology of general relativity and the particle spectrum of the standard model, at the price of changing our conceptual and mathematical picture of spacetime.
