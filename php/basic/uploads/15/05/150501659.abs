Title: $A_\infty$ structure from the Berkovits formulation of open superstring  field theory
Authors: Theodore Erler and Yuji Okawa and Tomoyuki Takezaki
Abstract: By formulating open superstring field theory based on the small Hilbert space of the superconformal ghost sector, an action for the Neveu-Schwarz sector with an $A_\infty$ structure has recently been constructed. We transform this action to the Wess-Zumino-Witten-like form and show that this theory is related to the Berkovits formulation of open superstring field theory based on the large Hilbert space by partial gauge fixing and field redefinition.
