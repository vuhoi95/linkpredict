Title: Thermodynamics of static dyonic AdS black holes in the $Ï‰$-deformed  Kaluza-Klein gauged supergravity theory
Authors: Shuang-Qing Wu and Shoulong Li
Abstract: We study thermodynamical properties of static dyonic AdS black holes in four-dimensional $\omega$-deformed Kaluza-Klein gauged supergravity theory, and find that the differential first law requires a modification via introducing a new pair of thermodynamical conjugate variables (X, Y). To ensure such a modification, we then apply the quasi-local ADT formalism developed in Ref. [20] to calculate the quasi-local conserved charge and identify that the new pair is precisely the one previously introduced to modify the differential form of first law.
