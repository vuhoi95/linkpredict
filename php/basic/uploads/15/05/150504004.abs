Title: T-duality, Quotients and Currents for Non-Geometric Closed Strings
Authors: Ioannis Bakas and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We use the canonical description of T-duality as well as the formulation of T-duality in terms of chiral currents to investigate the geometric and non-geometric faces of closed string backgrounds originating from principal torus bundles with constant H-flux. Employing conformal field theory techniques, the non-commutative and non-associative structures among generalized coordinates in the so called Q-flux and R-flux backgrounds emerge by gauging the Abelian symmetries of an enlarged Rocek-Verlinde sigma-model and projecting the associated chiral currents of the enlarged theory to the T-dual coset models carrying non-geometric fluxes.
