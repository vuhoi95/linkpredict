Title: P-T phase diagram of a holographic s+p model from Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: Zhang-Yu Nie and Hui Zeng
Abstract: In this paper, we study the holographic s+p model in 5-dimensional bulk gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We work in the probe limit and give the $\Delta$-T phase diagrams at three different values of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient to show the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet term. We also construct the P-T phase diagrams for the holographic system using two different definitions of the pressure and compare the results.
