Abstract: We consider a quartic interaction of the Higgs and Goldberger-Wise fields, which connects the mechanism of the extra dimension size stabilization with spontaneous symmetry breaking on our brane and gives rise to a coupling of the Higgs field to the radion and its KK tower. We estimate a possible influence of this coupling on the Higgs-radion mixing and study restrictions on model parameters from the LHC data.
