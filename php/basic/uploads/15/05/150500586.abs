Title: The double scaling limit of the multi-orientable tensor model
Authors: Razvan Gurau and Adrian Tanasa and Donald R. Youmans
Abstract: In this paper we study the double scaling limit of the multi-orientable tensor model. We prove that, contrary to the case of matrix models but similarly to the case of invariant tensor models, the double scaling series are convergent. We resum the double scaling series of the two point function and of the leading singular part of the four point function. We discuss the behavior of the leading singular part of arbitrary correlation functions. We show that the contribution of the four point function and of all the higher point functions are enhanced in the double scaling limit. We finally show that all the correlation functions exhibit a singularity at the same critical value of the double scaling parameter which, combined with the convergence of the double scaling series, suggest the existence of a triple scaling limit.
