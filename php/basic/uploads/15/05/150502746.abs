Title: Two-loop five-point amplitudes of super Yang-Mills and supergravity in  pure spinor superspace
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Oliver Schlotterer
Abstract: Supersymmetric integrands for the two-loop five-point amplitudes in ten-dimensional super Yang--Mills and type II supergravity are proposed. The kinematic numerators are manifestly local and satisfy the duality between color and kinematics described by Bern, Carrasco and Johansson. Our results are expected to reproduce the integrated two-loop amplitudes in dimensions $D<7$. The UV divergence in the critical dimension $D=7$ matches the low-energy limit of the corresponding superstring amplitudes and is written in terms of SYM tree amplitudes.
