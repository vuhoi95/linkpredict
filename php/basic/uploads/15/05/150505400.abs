Title: Gradient flows in three dimensions
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and C. Poole
Abstract: The a-function is a proposed quantity defined for quantum field theories which has a monotonic behaviour along renormalisation group flows, being related to the beta-functions via a gradient flow equation involving a positive definite metric. We demonstrate the existence of a candidate a-function for renormalisable Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, involving scalar and fermion fields, in both non-supersymmetric and supersymmetric cases.
