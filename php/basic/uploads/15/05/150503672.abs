Title: Dark Energy and Normalization of the Cosmological Wave Function
Authors: Peng Huang and Yue Huang and Miao Li and Nan Li
Abstract: Dark energy is investigated from the perspective of quantum cosmology. It is found that, together with an appropriate normal ordering factor $q$, only when there is dark energy then can the cosmological wave function be normalized. This interesting observation may require further attention.
