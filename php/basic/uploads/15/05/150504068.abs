Abstract: We obtain an exact analytic expression for the quasinormal modes of a noncommutative massless scalar field in the background of a massive spinless BTZ black hole up to the first order in the deformation parameter. We also show that the equations of motion governing these quasinormal modes are identical in form to the equations of motion of a commutative massive scalar field in the background of a fictitious massive spinning BTZ black hole. This results hints at a duality between the commutative and noncommutative systems in the background of a BTZ black hole. Using the obtained results for quasinormal mode frequencies, the area and entropy spectra for the BTZ black hole in the presence of noncommutativity are calculated. In particular, the separations between the neighboring values of these spectra are determined and it is found that they are nonuniform. Therefore, it appears that the noncommutativity leads to a non-equispaced (discrete) area and entropy spectra.
