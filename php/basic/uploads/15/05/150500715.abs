Title: On the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in a Horava-Lifshitz-like QED
Authors: T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We show the absence of the ABJ anomaly for the Horava-Lifshitz-like QED with any even $z$. Besides of this, we study the graph contributing to the ABJ anomaly at non-zero temperature and extend the Fujikawa's methodology of studying the integral measure for our model.
