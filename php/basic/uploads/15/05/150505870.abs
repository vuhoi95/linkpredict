Title: The Fall of Black Hole Firewall: Natural Nonmaximal Entanglement for  Page Curve
Authors: Masahiro Hotta and Ayumu Sugita
Abstract: The black hole firewall conjecture is based on Page curve hypothesis, which claims that entanglement between black hole and Hawking radiation is almost maximum. The hypothesis is inspired by Lubkin-Lloyd-Pagels-Page theorem for degenerate systems with zero Hamiltonian. Adopting canonical typicality for nondegenerate systems with nonvanishing Hamiltonians, the entanglement becomes nonmaximal,and energetic singularities (firewalls) do not emerge for general systems. For static thermal pure states of black hole and Hawking radiation, entanglement entropy equals thermal entropy of the smaller system.
