Title: 2D Poisson Sigma Models with Gauged Vectorial Supersymmetry
Authors: Roberto Bonezzi and Per Sundell and Alexander Torres-Gomez
Abstract: In this note, we gauge the rigid vectorial supersymmetry of the two-dimensional Poisson sigma model presented in arXiv:1503.05625. We show that the consistency of the construction does not impose any further constraints on the differential Poisson algebra geometry than those required for the ungauged model. We conclude by proposing that the gauged model provides a first-quantized framework for higher spin gravity.
