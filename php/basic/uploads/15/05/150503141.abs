Title: Parity Breaking Transport in Lifshitz Hydrodynamics
Authors: Carlos Hoyos and Adiel Meyer and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We derive the constitutive relations of first order charged hydrodynamics for theories with Lifshitz scaling and broken parity in $2+1$ and $3+1$ spacetime dimensions. In addition to the anomalous (in $3+1$) or Hall (in $2+1$) transport of relativistic hydrodynamics, there is an additional non-dissipative transport allowed by the absence of boost invariance. We analyze the non-relativistic limit and use a phenomenological model of a strange metal to argue that these effects can be measured in principle by using electromagnetic fields with non-zero gradients.
