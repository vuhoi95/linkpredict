Title: An analytic regularisation scheme on curved spacetimes with applications  to cosmological spacetimes
Authors: Antoine Géré and Thomas-Paul Hack and Nicola Pinamonti
Abstract: We develop a renormalisation scheme for time--ordered products in interacting field theories on curved spacetimes which consists of an analytic regularisation of Feynman amplitudes and a minimal subtraction of the resulting pole parts. This scheme is directly applicable to spacetimes with Lorentzian signature, manifestly generally covariant, invariant under any spacetime isometries present and constructed to all orders in perturbation theory. Moreover, the scheme captures correctly the non--geometric state--dependent contribution of Feynman amplitudes and it is well--suited for practical computations. To illustrate this last point, we compute explicit examples on a generic curved spacetime, and demonstrate how momentum space computations in cosmological spacetimes can be performed in our scheme. In this work, we discuss only scalar fields in four spacetime dimensions, but we argue that the renormalisation scheme can be directly generalised to other spacetime dimensions and field theories with higher spin, as well as to theories with local gauge invariance.
