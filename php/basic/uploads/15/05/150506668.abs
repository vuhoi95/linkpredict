Title: Effective Theory of Large-Scale Structure with Primordial  Non-Gaussianity

Abstract: We develop the effective theory of large-scale structure for non-Gaussian initial conditions. The effective stress tensor in the dark matter equations of motion contains new operators, which originate from the squeezed limit of the primordial bispectrum. Parameterizing the squeezed limit by a scaling and an angular dependence, captures large classes of primordial non-Gaussianity. Within this parameterization, we classify the possible contributions to the effective theory. We show explicitly how all terms consistent with the symmetries arise from coarse graining the dark matter equations of motion and its initial conditions. We also demonstrate that the system is closed under renormalization and that the basis of correction terms is therefore complete. The relevant corrections to the matter power spectrum and bispectrum are computed numerically and their relative importance is discussed.
