Title: Large field inflation from D-branes
Authors: Dagoberto Escobar and Aitor Landete and Fernando Marchesano and Diego Regalado
Abstract: We propose new large field inflation scenarios built on the framework of F-term axion monodromy. Our setup is based on string compactifications where D-branes create potentials for closed string axions via F-terms. Because the source of the axion potential is different from the standard sources of moduli stabilisation, it is possible to lower the inflaton mass as compared to other massive scalars. We discuss a particular class of models based on type IIA flux compactifications with D6-branes. In the small field regime they describe supergravity models of quadratic chaotic inflation with a stabiliser field. In the large field regime the inflaton potential displays a flattening effect due to Planck suppressed corrections, allowing to easily fit the cosmological parameters of the model within current experimental bounds.
