Title: On some 1/4 BPS Wilson-'t Hooft loops
Authors: Chang-Yong Liu and Li Qin
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the 1/4 BPS Wilson-'t Hooft loops in $\mathcal{N}$=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We use the bulk D3-brane solutions with both electric and magnetic charges on its world-volume to describe some of 1/4 BPS Wilson-'t Hooft loops. The D3-brane supersymmetric solutions are derived form requiring $\kappa$-symmetry. We find the two consistent constraints for Killing spinors and calculate the conserved charges of straight 1/4 BPS Wilson-'t Hooft loops and expectation values of circular 1/4 BPS Wilson-'t Hooft loops separately.
