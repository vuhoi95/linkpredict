Title: Emerging Hawking-like Radiation from Gravitational Bremsstrahlung Beyond  the Planck Scale
Authors: Marcello Ciafaloni and Dimitri Colferai and Gabriele Veneziano
Abstract: We argue that, as a consequence of the graviton's spin-2, its bremsstrahlung in trans-planckian-energy ($E\gg M_P$) gravitational scattering at small deflection angle can be nicely expressed in terms of helicity-transformation phases and their transfer within the scattering process. The resulting spectrum exhibits deeply sub-planckian characteristic energies of order $M_P^2/E \ll M_P$ (reminiscent of Hawking radiation), a suppressed fragmentation region, and a reduced rapidity plateau, in broad agreement with recent classical estimates.
