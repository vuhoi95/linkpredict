Title: Scale-invariant breaking of conformal symmetry
Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Alexander Zhiboedov
Abstract: Known examples of unitary relativistic scale but not conformal-invariant field theories (SFTs) can be embedded into conventional conformal field theories (CFTs). We show that any SFT which is a subsector of a unitary CFT is a free theory. Our discussion applies to an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and explains triviality of known SFTs in four spacetime dimensions. We comment on examples of unitary SFTs which are not captured by our construction.
