Title: The holographic Weyl semi-metal
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Yan Liu
Abstract: We present a holographic model of a Weyl semi-metal. We show that upon varying a mass parameter the model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a topologically non-trivial state to a trivial one. The order parameter for this phase transition is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We give an interpretation of the results in terms of a holographic RG flow and compare to a weakly coupled field theoretical model. Since there are no quasiparticle excitations in the strongly coupled holographic model the topological phase can not be bound to notions of topology in momentum space.
