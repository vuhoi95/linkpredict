Title: A "Lagrangian" for a non-Lagrangian theory
Authors: Abhijit Gadde and Shlomo S. Razamat and Brian Willett
Abstract: We suggest an N=1 Lagrangian flowing in the infra-red to the N=2 rank one superconformal field theory with E_6 flavor symmetry. We utilize this description to compute several supersymmetric partition functions.
