Title: The Epsilon-Expansion from Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Slava Rychkov and Zhong Ming Tan
Abstract: Conformal multiplets of $\phi$ and $\phi^3$ recombine at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, as a consequence of the equations of motion. Using this fact and other constraints from conformal symmetry, we reproduce the lowest nontrivial order results for the anomalous dimensions of operators, without any input from perturbation theory.
