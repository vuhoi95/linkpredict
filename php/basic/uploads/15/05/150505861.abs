Title: Supervertices and Non-renormalization Conditions in Maximal Supergravity  Theories
Authors: Yifan Wang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We construct higher derivative supervertices in an effective theory of maximal supergravity in various dimensions, in the super spinor helicity formalism, and derive non-renormalization conditions on up to 14-derivative order couplings from supersymmetry. These non-renormalization conditions include Laplace type equations on the coefficients of $R^4$, $D^4R^4$, and $D^6R^4$ couplings. We also find additional constraining equations, which are consistent with previously known results in the effective action of toroidally compactified type II string theory, and elucidate many features thereof.
