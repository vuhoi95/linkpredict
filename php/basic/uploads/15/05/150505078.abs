Title: Nature abhors a horizon
Authors: Per Kraus and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: The information paradox can be resolved if we recognize that the wavefunctional in gravity $\Psi[g]$ should be considered on the {\it whole} of superspace, the space of possible $g$. The largeness of the Bekenstein entropy implies a vast space of gravitational solutions, which are conjectured to be fuzzball configurations. In the WKB approximation, the wavefunctional for a collapsing shell is oscillatory in a small region of superspace, and the classical approximation picks out this part. But the wavefunctional will be damped (`under the barrier') in the remainder of this vast superspace. We perform a simple computation to show that at the threshold of black hole formation, the barrier is lowered enough to make the latter part oscillatory; this alters the classical evolution and avoids horizon formation.
