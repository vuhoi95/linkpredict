Title: Abelian Gauge Invariance of the WZ-type Coupling in ABJM Theory
Authors: Dongmin Jang and Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: We construct the interaction terms between the worldvolume fields of multiple M2-branes and 3-form gauge field of 11-dimensional supergravity, in the context of ABJM theory. The obtained Wess-Zumino-type coupling is simultaneously invariant under the U$_{\textrm{L}}(N)\times$U$_{\textrm{R}}(N)$ non-Abelian gauge transformation of the ABJM theory and the Abelian gauge transformation of the 3-form field in 11-dimensional supergravity.
