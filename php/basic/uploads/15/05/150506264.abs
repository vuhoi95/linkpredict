Title: Dyonic Reissner-Nordström black hole: extended Dirac quantization from  5D invariants
Authors: Jesús Martín Romero and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: The aim of present work is to extend the application of Weitzeb\"{o}ck Induced Matter Theory (WIMT) to a dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Hole (RNBH), by proposing a condition compatible with a quantization relation between gravitational mass and both magnetic and electric charges from a geometric product defined as an invariant in 5D.
