Title: Local zeta regularization and the scalar Casimir effect II. Some  explicitly solvable cases
Authors: Davide Fermi and Livio Pizzocchero
Abstract: In Part I of this series of papers we have described a general formalism to compute the vacuum effects of a scalar field via local (or global) zeta regularization. In the present Part II we exemplify the general formalism in a number of cases which can be solved explicitly by analytical means. More in detail we deal with configurations involving parallel or perpendicular planes and we also discuss the case of a three-dimensional wedge.
