Title: Basics of the pressuron
Authors: Olivier Minazzoli and Aur√©lien Hees
Abstract: The pressuron is a specific case of a dilaton-like field that leads to a decoupling of the scalar-field in the field equation for pressureless fluids. Hence, the pressuron recovers general relativity in the limit of weak pressure. Here we review its basics.
