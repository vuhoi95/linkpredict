Title: Differential approach to on-shell scalar products in six-vertex models
Authors: W. Galleas and J. Lamers
Abstract: In this work we obtain hierarchies of partial differential equations describing on-shell scalar products for two types of six-vertex models. More precisely, six-vertex models with two different diagonal boundary conditions are considered: the case with boundary twists and the case with open boundary conditions. Solutions and properties of our partial differential equations are also discussed.
