Title: Newton-Cartan (super)gravity as a non-relativistic limit
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Jan Rosseel and Thomas Zojer
Abstract: We define a procedure that, starting from a relativistic theory of supergravity, leads to a consistent, non-relativistic version thereof. As a first application we use this limiting procedure to show how the Newton-Cartan formulation of non-relativistic gravity can be obtained from general relativity. Then we apply it in a supersymmetric case and derive a novel, non-relativistic, off-shell formulation of three-dimensional Newton-Cartan supergravity.
