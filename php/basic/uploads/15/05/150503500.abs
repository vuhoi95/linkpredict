Title: Rigid 4D N=2 supersymmetric backgrounds and actions
Authors: Daniel Butter and Gianluca Inverso and Ivano Lodato
Abstract: We classify all N=2 rigid supersymmetric backgrounds in four dimensions with both Lorentzian and Euclidean signature that preserve eight real supercharges, up to discrete identifications. Among the backgrounds we find specific warpings of S^3 x R and AdS_3 x R, AdS_2 x S^2 and H^2 x S^2 with generic radii, and some more exotic geometries. We provide the generic two-derivative rigid vector and hypermultiplet actions and analyze the conditions imposed on the special Kahler and hyperkahler target spaces.
