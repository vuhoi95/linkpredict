Title: Thermalization of Quark-Gluon Plasma in Magnetic Field at Strong  Coupling
Authors: Kiminad A. Mamo and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study thermalization of strongly coupled gauge theory plasma in the presence of magnetic field using the AdS/CFT correspondence. We utilize the falling energy-shell model as a holographic description of gauge theory plasma undergoing thermalization, and find the effect of magnetic field on thermalization time in various space-time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that magnetic field universally hastens thermalization of strongly coupled gauge theory plasma.
