Title: Conversion of second-class constraints and resolving the zero curvature  conditions in the geometric quantization theory
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov
Abstract: In the approach to the geometric quantization, based on the conversion of second-class constraints, we resolve the respective non-linear zero curvature conditions for the extended symplectic potential. From the zero curvature conditions, we deduce new, linear, equations for the extended symplectic potential. Then we show that being the linear equations satisfied, their solution does certainly satisfy the non-linear zero curvature condition, as well. Finally, we give the functional resolution to the new linear equations, and then deduce the respective path integral representation. We do our consideration as to the general case of a phase superspace where both Boson and Fermion coordinates are present on equal footing.
