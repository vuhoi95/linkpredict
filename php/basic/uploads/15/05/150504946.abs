Title: D-brane on Deformed AdS_3 times S^3
Authors: Malak Khouchen and Josef Kluso≈à
Abstract: We study D1-brane in AdS_3 times S^3 kappa-deformed background with non-trivial dilaton and Ramond-Ramond fields. We consider purely time-dependent and spatially-dependent ansatz where we study the solutions of the equations of motion for D1-brane in given background. We find that the behavior of these solutions crucially depends on the value of the parameter a that was introduced in [arXiv:1411.1066 [hep-th]].
