Abstract: We revisit the study of singular points in the Coulomb branch of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD in four dimensions with gauge group $SU(N)$ and odd number of flavors. For certain choices of the mass parameters these vacua are not lifted by a mass term for the chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation. By using recent results about the M5 brane description of $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories we study the resulting vacua and argue that the low-energy effective theory has a simple Lagrangian description involving a free chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation of the flavor symmetry group, a system somewhat reminiscent of the standard low-energy pion description of the real-world QCD. This fact is quite remarkable in view of the fact that the underlying $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT (the Argyres-Douglas systems) are strongly-coupled non-local theories of quarks and monopoles.
