Title: Entanglement Tsunami in (1+1)-Dimensions
Authors: Stefan Leichenauer and Mudassir Moosa
Abstract: We study the time dependence of the entanglement entropy of disjoint intervals following a global quantum quench in (1+1)-dimensional CFTs at large-$c$ with a sparse spectrum. The result agrees with a holographic calculation but differs from the free field theory answer. In particular, a simple model of free quasiparticle propagation is not adequate for CFTs with a holographic dual. We elaborate on the entanglement tsunami proposal of Liu and Suh and show how it can be used to reproduce the holographic answer.
