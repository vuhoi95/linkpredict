Abstract: We report on the mean-field study of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in static magnetic fields within a simple model of a parity-breaking Weyl semimetal given by the lattice Wilson-Dirac Hamiltonian with constant chiral chemical potential. We consider both the mean-field renormalization of the model parameters and nontrivial corrections to the CME originating from re-summed ladder diagrams with arbitrary number of loops. We find that on-site repulsive interactions affect the chiral magnetic conductivity almost exclusively through the enhancement of the renormalized chiral chemical potential. Our results suggest that nontrivial corrections to the chiral magnetic conductivity due to inter-fermion interactions are not relevant in practice, since they only become important when the CME response is strongly suppressed by the large gap in the energy spectrum.
