Title: Local zeta regularization and the scalar Casimir effect III. The case  with a background harmonic potential
Authors: Davide Fermi and Livio Pizzocchero
Abstract: Applying the general framework for local zeta regularization proposed in Part I of this series of papers, we renormalize the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor (and of the total energy) for a scalar field in presence of an external harmonic potential.
