Title: Universal Corrections to Black Hole Entropy in $\mathcal{N} \geq 2$  Supergravity
Authors: Anthony M. Charles and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We embed general solutions to 4D Einstein-Maxwell theory into $\mathcal{N} \geq 2$ supergravity and study quadratic fluctuations of the supergravity fields around the background. We compute one-loop quantum corrections for all fields and show that the $c$-anomaly vanishes for complete $\mathcal{N}=2$ multiplets. Logarithmic corrections to the entropy of Kerr-Newman black holes are therefore universal and independent of black hole parameters.
