Title: Emergent Chern-Simons excitations due to electron--phonon interaction
Authors: Andreas Sinner and Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We address the problem of Dirac fermions interacting with longitudinal phonons. A gap in the spectrum of fermions leads to the emergence of the Chern--Simons excitations in the spectrum of phonons. We study the effect of those excitations on observable quantities: the phonon dispersion, the phonon spectral density, and the Hall conductivity.
