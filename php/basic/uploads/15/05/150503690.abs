Title: Bloch Wave Function for the Periodic Sphaleron Potential and  Unsuppressed Baryon and Lepton Number Violating Processes
Authors: S. -H. Henry Tye and Sam S. C. Wong
Abstract: For the periodic sphaleron potential in the electroweak theory, we find the one-dimensional time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Chern-Simons number as the coordinate, construct the Bloch wave function and determine the corresponding conducting (pass) band structure. We show that the baryon-lepton number violating processes can take place without the exponential tunneling suppression (at zero temperature) at energies around and above the barrier height (sphaleron energy) at 9.0 TeV. Phenomenologically, probable detection of such processes at LHC is discussed.
