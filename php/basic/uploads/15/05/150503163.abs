Title: Hartman-Fletcher effect for array of complex barriers
Authors: Ananya Ghatak and Mohammad Hasan and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We calculate the time taken by a wave packet to tunnel through a series of complex barrier potentials using stationary phase method to show its saturation (Hartman-Fletcher effect) with number of barriers in various situations. We numerically study the effect of the coupling between the elastic and inelastic channels, width of the individual barrier, separation between the consecutive barriers on the saturation of tunneling time. Nature of HF effect has further been investigated for more realistic barriers with random inelasticity and also for emissive inelastic channels.
