Title: On the anomalies in Lorentz-breaking theories

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the chiral anomaly in a Lorentz-breaking extension of QED which, besides the common terms that are present in the Standard Model Extension, includes some dimension-five nonminimal couplings. We find, using the Fujikawa formalism, that these nonminimal couplings induce new terms in the anomaly which depend on the Lorentz-violating parameters. Perturbative calculations are also carried out in order to investigate whether or not new ambiguous Carroll-Field-Jackiw terms are induced in the effective action.
