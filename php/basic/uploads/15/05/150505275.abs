Title: Transport Process in Multi-Junctions of Quantum Systems
Authors: Taro Kimura and Masaki Murata
Abstract: We consider the junction of multiple one-dimensional systems and study how conserved currents transport at the junction. To characterize the transport process, we introduce reflection/transmission coefficients by applying boundary conformal field theory. We compute the reflection/transmission coefficients for some examples to derive the closed formulas. The formulas demonstrate spin-flip transport, where the spin polarization is flipped at the junction.
