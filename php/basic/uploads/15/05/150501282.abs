Title: Stationary black holes: Large $D$ analysis
Authors: Ryotaku Suzuki and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: We consider the effective theory of the large D stationary black hole. By solving Einstein equation with a cosmological constant using the 1/D expansion in near zone of a black hole we obtain the effective equation for the stationary black hole. The effective equation describes the Myers-Perry black hole, bumpy black holes and, possibly, the black ring solution as its solutions. In this effective theory the black hole is represented as the embedded membrane in the background, i.e., Minkowski or Anti-de Sitter spacetime and its mean curvature is given by the redshifted surface gravity by the background geometry and the local Lorentz boost. The local Lorentz boost property of the effective equation is observed also in the metric. In fact we show that the leading order metric of the Einstein equation in the 1/D expansion is generically regarded as the Lorentz boosted Schwarzschild black hole. We apply this Lorentz boost property of the stationary black hole solution to solve the perturbation equation. As a result we obtain the analytic formula for the quasinormal mode of the singly rotating Myers-Perry black hole in the 1/D expansion.
