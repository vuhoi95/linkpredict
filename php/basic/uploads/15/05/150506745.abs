Title: Structure Constants and Integrable Bootstrap in Planar N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: Benjamin Basso and Shota Komatsu and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative framework for computing structure constants of single-trace operators in the N=4 SYM theory at large N. Our approach features new vertices, with hexagonal shape, that can be patched together into three- and possibly higher-point correlators. These newborn hexagons are more elementary and easier to deal with than the three-point functions. Moreover, they can be entirely constructed using integrability, by means of a suitable bootstrap program. In this letter, we present our main results and conjectures for these vertices, and match their predictions for the three-point functions with both weak and strong coupling data available in the literature.
