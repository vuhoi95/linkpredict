Title: Multipolar test body equations of motion in generalized gravity theories
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Dirk Puetzfeld
Abstract: We give an overview of the derivation of multipolar equations of motion of extended test bodies for a wide set of gravitational theories beyond the standard general relativistic framework. The classes of theories covered range from simple generalizations of General Relativity, e.g. encompassing additional scalar fields, to theories with additional geometrical structures which are needed for the description of microstructured matter. Our unified framework even allows to handle theories with nonminimal coupling to matter, and thereby for a systematic test of a very broad range of gravitational theories.
