Title: Discretization effects in $N_c=2$ QCD and Random Matrix Theory
Authors: Mario Kieburg and Jacobus Verbaarschot and Savvas Zafeiropoulos
Abstract: We summarize the analytical solution of the Chiral Perturbation Theory for the Hermitian Wilson Dirac operator of $N_c=2$ QCD with quarks in the fundamental representation. Results have been obtained for the quenched microscopic spectral density, the distribution of the chiralities over the real modes and the chiral condensate. The analytical results are compared with results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the corresponding Random Matrix Theory.
