Title: Constraints on Operator Ordering from Third Quantization
Authors: Yoshiaki Ohkuwa and Mir Faizal and Yasuo Ezawa
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the third quantized formalism. We will demonstrate that for certain operator ordering, the early stages of the universe are dominated by quantum fluctuations, and the universe becomes classical at later stages during the cosmic expansion. This is physically expected, if the universe is formed from quantum fluctuations in the third quantized formalism. So, we will argue that this physical requirement can be used to constrain the form of the operator ordering chosen. We will explicitly demonstrate this to be the case for two different cosmological models.
