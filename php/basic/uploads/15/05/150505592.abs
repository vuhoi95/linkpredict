Title: Constraining CPT-even and Lorentz-violating nonminimal couplings with  the electron magnetic and electric dipole moments
Authors: Jonas B. Araujo and Rodolfo Casana and Manoel M. Ferreira Jr
Abstract: We analyse some dimension-five CPT-even and Lorentz-violating nonminimal couplings between fermionic and gauge fields in the context of the Dirac equation. After evaluating the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, we discuss the behavior of the terms under discrete symmetries and analyse the implied effects. We then use the anomalous magnetic dipole moment and electron electric dipole moment measurements to reach upper bounds of $1$ part in $10^{20}$ and $10^{24}$ $\left( eV\right) ^{-1}$, improving the level of restriction on such couplings by at least 8 orders of magnitude. These upper bounds are also transferred to the Sun-centered frame by considering the Earth's rotational motion.
