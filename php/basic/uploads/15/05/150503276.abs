Title: Local zeta regularization and the scalar Casimir effect IV. The case of  a rectangular box
Authors: Davide Fermi and Livio Pizzocchero
Abstract: Applying the general framework for local zeta regularization proposed in Part I of this series of papers, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value of several observables (in particular, of the stress-energy tensor and of the total energy) for a massless scalar field confined within a rectangular box of arbitrary dimension.
