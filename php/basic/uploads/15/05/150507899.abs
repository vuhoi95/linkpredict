Authors: R. A. C. Correa and A. de Souza Dutra and J. A. de Oliveira and M. G. Garcia
Abstract: In this work we analyze a system consisting in two-dimensional position-dependent massive particles in the presence of a Morse-like potential in two spatial dimensions. We obtain the exact wavefunctions and energies for a complete set of eigenstates for a given dependence of the mass with the spatial variables.
