Title: Large distance expansion of Mutual Information for disjoint disks in a  free scalar theory
Authors: Cesar A. Ag√≥n and Isaac Cohen-Abbo and Howard J. Schnitzer
Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading order term in the long-distance expansion of the mutual information for free scalars in three space-time dimensions. The geometry considered is two disjoint disks separated by a distance $r$ between their centers. No evidence for non-analyticity in the R\'enyi parameter $n$ for the continuation $n \rightarrow 1$ in the next-to-leading order term is found.
