Title: Ambitwistor pure spinor string in a type II supergravity background
Authors: Osvaldo Chandia and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: We construct the ambitwistor pure spinor string in a general type II supergravity background in the semi-classical regime. Almost all supergravity constraints are obtained from nilpotency of the BRST charge and further consistency conditions from additional world-sheet symmetries. We also discuss the case of $AdS_5\times S^5$ background.
