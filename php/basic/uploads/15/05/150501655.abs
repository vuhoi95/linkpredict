Title: Coupled SU(3)-structures and Supersymmetry
Authors: Anna Fino and Alberto Raffero
Abstract: We review coupled ${\rm SU}(3)$-structures, also known in the literature as restricted half-flat structures, in relation to supersymmetry. In particular, we study special classes of examples admitting such structures and the behaviour of flows of ${\rm SU}(3)$-structures with respect to the coupled condition.
