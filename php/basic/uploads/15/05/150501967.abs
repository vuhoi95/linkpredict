Title: Non relativistic diffeomorphism and the geometry of the fractional  quantum Hall effect
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: We show that our recently proposed method\cite{BMM1,BMM2,BMM3,BM4} of constructing nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariant field theories by gauging the Galilean symmetry provides a natural connection with the geometry of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Specifically, the covariant derivative that appears on gauging, exactly reproduces the form that yields the Hall viscosity and Wen-Zee shift \cite{CYF}.
