Title: NLO Higgs Effective Field Theory and kappa-framework
Authors: Margherita Ghezzi and Raquel Gomez-Ambrosio and Giampiero Passarino and Sandro Uccirati
Abstract: A consistent framework for studying Standard Model deviations is developed. It assumes that New Physics becomes relevant at some scale beyond the present experimental reach and uses the Effective Field Theory approach by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian and by computing relevant processes at the next-to-leading order, extending the original kappa-framework.
