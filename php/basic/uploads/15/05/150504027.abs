Title: Revisiting slow-roll inflation in nonminimal derivative coupling with  potentials
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon and Bum-Hoon Lee
Abstract: We investigate the slow-roll inflation in the nonminimal derivative coupling (NDC) model with exponential, quadric, and quartic potentials. It was known that this model provides an enhanced slow-roll inflation induced by gravitationally enhanced friction even for a steep exponential potential. In the phase portrait, the inflationary attractor is described by the slow-roll equation. Introducing the autonomous form, the inflation is regarded as an emergence from the saddle point and it leaves this fixed point along the slow-roll equation. We show explicitly that if one uses the NDC with potentials, the slow-roll inflation is easier to be implemented than the canonical coupling with the same potentials.
