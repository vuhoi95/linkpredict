Title: Exact coefficients for higher dimensional operators with sixteen  supersymmetries
Authors: Wei-Ming Chen and Yu-tin Huang and Congkao Wen
Abstract: We consider constraints on higher dimensional operators for supersymmetric effective field theories. In four dimensions with maximal supersymmetry and SU(4) R-symmetry, we demonstrate that the coefficients of abelian operators F^n with MHV helicity configurations must satisfy a recursion relation, and are completely determined by that of F^4. As the F^4 coefficient is known to be one-loop exact, this allows us to derive exact coefficients for all such operators. We also argue that the results are consistent with the SL(2,Z) duality symmetry. Breaking SU(4) to Sp(4), in anticipation for the Coulomb branch effective action, we again find an infinite class of operators whose coefficient that are determined exactly. We also consider three-dimensional N=8 as well as six-dimensional N=(2,0),(1,0) and (1,1) theories. In all cases, we demonstrate that the coefficient of dimension-six operator must be proportional to the square of that of dimension-four.
