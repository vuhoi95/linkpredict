Abstract: We study chaotic motions of a classical string in a near Penrose limit of AdS$_5\times T^{1,1}$. It is known that chaotic solutions appear on $R\times T^{1,1}$, depending on initial conditions. It may be interesting to ask whether the chaos persists even in Penrose limits or not. In this paper, we show that sub-leading corrections in a Penrose limit provide an unstable separatrix, so that chaotic motions are generated as a consequence of collapsed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori. Our analysis is based on deriving a reduced system composed of two degrees of freedom by supposing a winding string ansatz. Then, we provide support for the existence of chaos by computing Poincare sections. In comparison to the AdS$_5\times T^{1,1}$ case, we argue that no chaos lives in a near Penrose limit of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, as expected from the classical integrability of the parent system.
