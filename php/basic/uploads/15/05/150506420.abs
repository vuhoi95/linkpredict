Title: The 290 fixed-point sublattices of the Leech lattice
Authors: Gerald Hoehn and Geoffrey Mason
Abstract: We determine the orbits of fixed-point sublattices of the Leech lattice with respect to the action of the Conway group Co_0. There are 290 such orbits. Detailed information about these lattices, the corresponding coinvariant lattices, and the stabilizing subgroups, is tabulated in several tables.
