Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and R. Loganayagam and Gim Seng Ng
Abstract: Recent derivations of Cardy-like formulae in higher dimensional field theories have opened up a way of computing, via AdS/CFT, universal contributions to black hole entropy from gravitational Chern-Simons terms. Based on the manifestly covariant formulation of the differential Noether charge for Chern-Simons terms proposed in arXiv:1407.6364, we compute the entropy and asymptotic charges for the rotating charged AdS black holes in higher dimensions at leading order of the fluid/gravity derivative expansion in the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons system. This gives a result that exactly matches the field theory predictions from Cardy-like formulae.
