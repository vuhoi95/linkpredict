Title: Accelerating universe as a result of an adjustment mechanism
Authors: Prado Martin-Moruno and Nelson J. Nunes
Abstract: In this essay we propose that the theory of gravity's vacuum is described by a de Sitter geometry. Under this assumption we consider an adjustment mechanism able to screen any value of the vacuum energy of the matter fields. We discuss the most general scalar-tensor cosmological models with second order equations of motion that have a fixed de Sitter critical point for any kind of material content. These models give rise to interesting cosmological evolutions that we shall discuss.
