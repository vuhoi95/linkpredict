Title: P-V criticality of charged dilatonic black holes
Authors: M. H. Dehghani and S. Kamrani and A. Sheykhi
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the critical behavior of charged black holes of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity in the presence of two Liouville-type potentials which make the solution asymptotically neither flat nor AdS and has a parameter $% \Lambda $ treated as a thermodynamic quantity that can vary. We obtain a Smarr-type relation for charged dilatonic black holes and find out that the volume is different from the geometrical volume. We study the analogy of the Van der Waals liquid-gas system with the charged dilatonic black hole system while we treat the black hole charge as a fixed external parameter. Moreover, we show that the critical values for pressure, temperature and volume are physical provided the coupling constant of dilaton gravity is less than one and the horizon is sphere. Finally, we calculate the critical exponents and show that they are universal and are independent of the details of the system although the thermodynamic quantities depend on the dilaton parameter and the dimension of the spacetime.
