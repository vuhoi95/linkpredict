Title: Complete integrability of geodesic motion in Sasaki-Einstein toric  $Y^{p,q}$ spaces
Authors: Elena Mirela Babalic and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: We construct explicitly the constants of motion for geodesics in the $5$-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$. To carry out this task we use the knowledge of the complete set of Killing vectors and Killing-Yano tensors on these spaces. In spite of the fact that we generate a multitude of constants of motion, only five of them are functionally independent implying the complete integrability of geodesic flow on $Y^{p,q}$ spaces. In the particular case of the homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein manifold $T^{1,1}$ the integrals of motion have simpler forms and the relations between them are described in detail.
