Title: Entangled squeezed states in noncommutative spaces with minimal length  uncertainty relations
Authors: Sanjib Dey and VÃ©ronique Hussin
Abstract: We provide an explicit construction of entangled states in a noncommutative space with nonclassical states, particularly with the squeezed states. Noncommutative systems are found to be more entangled than the usual quantum mechanical systems. The noncommutative parameter provides an additional degree of freedom in the construction by which one can raise the entanglement of the noncommutative systems to fairly higher values beyond the usual systems. Despite of having classical-like behaviour, coherent states in noncommutative space produce little amount of entanglement and therefore they possess slight nonclassicality as well, which are not true for the coherent states of ordinary harmonic oscillator.
