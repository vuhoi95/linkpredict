Title: Scattering of Nucleons in the Classical Skyrme Model
Authors: David Foster and Nicholas S. Manton
Abstract: Classically spinning B=1 Skyrmions can be regarded as approximations to nucleons with quantised spin. Here, we investigate nucleon-nucleon scattering through numerical collisions of spinning Skyrmions. We identify the dineutron/diproton and dibaryon short-lived resonance states, and also the stable deuteron state. Our simulations lead to predictions for the polarisation states occurring in right angle scattering. Videos of our numerical results are shown at http://www.bristoltheory.org/people/david.foster/skyrmevideos/.
