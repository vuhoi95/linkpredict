Abstract: We study braneworld models in the presence of scalar field in a five-dimensional geometry with a single extra dimension of infinite extent, with gravity modified to include a function of the Ricci scalar. We develop a procedure that allows to obtain analytical solution for the braneworld configuration in a diversity of models, in the much harder case where the Ricci scalar is non constant quantity.
