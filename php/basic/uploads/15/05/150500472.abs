Title: CP Violation and Baryogenesis in the Presence of Black Holes
Authors: Tom Banks and Willy Fischler
Abstract: In a recent paper[1] Kundu and one of the present authors showed that there were transient but observable CP violating effects in the decay of classical currents on the horizon of a black hole, if the Lagrangian of the Maxwell field contained a CP violating angle {\theta}. In this paper we demonstrate that a similar effect can be seen in the quantum mechanics of QED: a non-trivial Berry phase in the QED wave function is produced by in-falling electric charges. We also investigate whether CP violation, of this or any other type, might be used to produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe, in models where primordial black hole decay contributes to the matter content of the present universe. This can happen both in a variety of hybrid inflation models, and in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation[2].
