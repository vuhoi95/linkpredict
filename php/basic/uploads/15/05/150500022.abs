Title: Unimodular Gravity Redux
Authors: E. Álvarez and S. González-Martín and M. Herrero-Valea and C. P. Martín
Abstract: It is well known that the problem of the cosmological constant appears in a new light in Unimodular Gravity. In particular, the zero momentum piece of the potential does not automatically produce a corresponding cosmological constant. Here we show that quantum corrections do not renormalize the classical value of this observable.
