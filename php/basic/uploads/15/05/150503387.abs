Title: Kundt solutions of Minimal Massive 3D Gravity
Authors: Nihat Sadik Deger and Ozgur Sarioglu
Abstract: We construct Kundt solutions of Minimal Massive Gravity theory and show that, similar to Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG), most of them are constant scalar invariant (CSI) spacetimes, that correspond to deformations of round and warped (A)dS. We also find an explicit non-CSI Kundt solution at the merger point. Finally, we give their algebraic classification with respect to the traceless Ricci tensor (Segre classification) and show that their Segre-types match with the types of their counterparts in TMG.
