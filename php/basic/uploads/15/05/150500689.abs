Abstract: Geometrical coupling in a co-dimensional one Randall-Sundrum scenario (RS) is used to study resonances of $p-$form fields. The resonances are calculated using the transfer matrix method. The model studied consider the standard RS with delta-like branes, and branes generated by kinks and domain-wall as well. The parameters are changed to control the thickness of the smooth brane. With this a very interesting pattern is found for the resonances. The geometrical coupling does not generate resonances for the reduced $p-$form in all cases considered.
