Title: Gravitons to Photons -- attenuation of gravitational waves
Authors: Preston Jones and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: In this essay we examine the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector (a quantum two-level system) to a gravitational wave background. The spectrum of the Unruh-Dewitt detector is of the same form as some scattering processes or three body decays such as muon-electron scattering or muon decay. Based on this similarity we propose that the Unruh-DeWitt detector response implies a "decay" or attenuation of gravitons, $G$, into photons, $\gamma$, via $G + G \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma $ or $G \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma + G$. Over large distances such a decay/attenuation may have consequences in regard to the detection of gravitational waves.
