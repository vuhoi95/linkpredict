Title: On quantum Freidel-Maillet algebra for non-ultralocal integrable systems
Authors: A. Melikyan and G. Weber
Abstract: We consider the quantum algebra of transition matrices for non-ultralocal integrable systems, and show that a regularization of the singular operator products in the quantum algebra via Sklyanin's product leads to well-defined expressions, reproducing in the classical limit Maillet's symmetrization prescription for Poisson brackets.
