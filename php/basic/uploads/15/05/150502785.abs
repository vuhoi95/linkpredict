Title: Heavy colored SUSY partners from deflected anomaly mediation
Authors: Fei Wang and Wenyu Wang and Jin Min Yang and Yang Zhang
Abstract: We propose a deflected anomaly mediation scenario from SUSY QCD which can lead to both positive and negative deflection parameters (there is a smooth transition between these two deflection parameter regions by adjusting certain couplings). Such a scenario can naturally give a SUSY spectrum in which all the colored sparticles are heavy while the sleptons are light. As a result, the discrepancy between the Brookheaven $g_\mu-2$ experiment and LHC data can be reconciled in this scenario. We also find that the parameter space for explaining the $g_\mu-2$ anomaly at $1\sigma$ level can be fully covered by the future LUX-ZEPLIN 7.2 Ton experiment.
