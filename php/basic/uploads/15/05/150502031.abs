Title: Chern-Simons action for inhomogeneous Virasoro group as an extension of  three dimensional flat gravity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Gaston Giribet and Mauricio Leston
Abstract: We initiate the study of a Chern-Simons action associated to the semi-direct sum of the Virasoro algebra with its coadjoint representation. This model extends the standard Chern-Simons formulation of three dimensional flat gravity and is similar to the higher-spin extension of three dimensional anti-de Sitter or flat gravity. The extension can also be constructed for the exotic but not for the cosmological constant deformation of flat gravity.
