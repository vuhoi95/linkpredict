Title: The boundary effect of anomaly-induced action
Authors: Che-Min Shen and Keisuke Izumi and Pisin Chen
Abstract: We discuss the boundary effect of anomaly-induced action in two-dimensional spacetime, which is ignored in previous studies. Anomaly-induced action, which gives the stress tensor with the same trace as the trace anomaly, can be represented in terms of local operators by introducing an auxiliary scalar field. Although the degrees of freedom of the auxiliary field can in principle describe the quantum states of the original field, the principal relation between them was unclear. We show here that, by considering the boundary effect, the solutions of classical auxiliary fields are naturally related to the quantum states of the original field. We demonstrate this conclusion via several examples such as the flat, black hole and the de Sitter spacetime.
