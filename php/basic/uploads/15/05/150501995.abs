Title: Quantum Corrections to Unimodular Gravity
Authors: Enrique Álvarez and Sergio González-Martín and Mario Herrero-Valea and Carmelo P. Martín
Abstract: The problem of the cosmological constant appears in a new light in Unimodular Gravity. In particular, the zero momentum piece of the potential (that is, the constant piece independent of the matter fields) does not automatically produce a cosmological constant proportional to it. The aim of this paper is to give some details on a calculation showing that quantum corrections do not renormalize the classical value of this observable.
