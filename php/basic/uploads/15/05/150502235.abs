Title: Massive vector multiplet inflation with Dirac-Born-Infeld type action
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We investigate the inflation model with a massive vector multiplet in a case that the action of the vector multiplet is extended to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type one. We show the massive DBI action in 4 dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity, and find that the higher order corrections associated with the DBI-extension make the scalar potential flat with a simple choice of the matter couplings. We also discuss the DBI-extension of the new minimal Starobinsky model, and find that it is dual to a special class of the massive DBI action.
