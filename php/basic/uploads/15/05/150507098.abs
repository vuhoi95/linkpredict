Title: On the reach of perturbative descriptions for dark matter displacement  fields
Authors: Tobias Baldauf and Emmanuel Schaan and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: We study Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) and its regularization in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach. We evaluate the LPT displacement with the same phases as a corresponding $N$-body simulation, which allows us to compare perturbation theory to the non-linear simulation with significantly reduced cosmic variance, and provides a more stringent test than simply comparing power spectra. We reliably detect a non-vanishing leading order EFT coefficient and a stochastic displacement term, uncorrelated with the LPT terms. This stochastic term is expected in the EFT framework, and, to the best of our understanding, is not an artifact of numerical errors or transients in our simulations. This term constitutes a limit to the accuracy of perturbative descriptions of the displacement field and its phases, corresponding to a $1\%$ error on the non-linear power spectrum at $k=0.2 h$/Mpc at $z=0$. Predicting the displacement power spectrum to higher accuracy or larger wavenumbers thus requires a model for the stochastic displacement.
