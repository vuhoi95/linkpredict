Title: Enhancement of hidden symmetries and Chern-Simons couplings
Authors: Marc Henneaux and Axel Kleinschmidt and Victor Lekeu
Abstract: We study the role of Chern--Simons couplings for the appearance of enhanced symmetries of Cremmer--Julia type in various theories. It is shown explicitly that for generic values of the Chern--Simons coupling there is only a parabolic Lie subgroup of symmetries after reduction to three space-time dimensions but that this parabolic Lie group gets enhanced to the full and larger Cremmer--Julia Lie group of hidden symmetries if the coupling takes a specific value. This is heralded by an enhanced isotropy group of the metric on the scalar manifold. Examples of this phenomenon are discussed as well as the relation to supersymmetry. Our results are also connected with rigidity theorems of Borel-like algebras.
