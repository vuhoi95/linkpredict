Title: Sine-square deformation and supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: Kouichi Okunishi and Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We investigate the sine-square deformation (SSD) of free fermions in one-dimensional continuous space. On the basis of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we prove the correspondence between the many-body ground state of the system with SSD and that of the uniform system with periodic boundary conditions. We also discuss the connection between the SSD in the continuous space and its lattice version, where the geometric correction due to the real-space deformation plays an important role in relating the eigenstates of the lattice SSD with those of the continuous SSD.
