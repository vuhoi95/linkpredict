Title: On the fixed point equation of a solvable 4D QFT model
Authors: Harald Grosse and Raimar Wulkenhaar
Abstract: The regularisation of the $\lambda\phi^4_4$-model on noncommutative Moyal space gives rise to a solvable QFT model in which all correlation functions are expressed in terms of the solution of a fixed point problem. We prove that the non-linear operator for the logarithm of the original problem satisfies the assumptions of the Schauder fixed point theorem, thereby completing the solution of the QFT model.
