Abstract: The renormalization problem of (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory quantized on the light front is considered. Extra fields analogous to those used in Pauli-Villars regularization are introduced to restore perturbative equivalence between such quantized theory and conventional formulation in Lorentz coordinates. These fields also provide necessary ultraviolet regularization to the theory. Obtained results allow to construct renormalized Hamiltonian of the theory on the light front.
