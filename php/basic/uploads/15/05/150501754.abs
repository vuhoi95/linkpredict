Title: The axial anomaly, dimensional regularization and Lorentz-violating QED
Authors: Basem Kamal El-Menoufi and G. A. White
Abstract: In order to treat loops in the Lorentz-violating QED model, we present a derivation of the QED axial anomaly that specifically highlights the infrared origin of the effect. This is done using dimensional regularization while treating $\gamma_5$ as a spectator. This enables us to revisit aspects in the fermionic sector of Lorentz-violating QED which have analogous structure to the axial anomaly. In particular, it is shown that both the Chern-Simons and photon mass operators are not induced in the one loop effective action. At lowest order in the Lorentz-violating parameter, we can define a non-relativistic potential that captures the effects of vacuum polarization. This leads to a Zeeman-like effect in vacuum which lifts the two-fold degeneracy of the hydrogen atom S-orbitals.
