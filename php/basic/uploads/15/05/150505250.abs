Title: T-duality simplifies bulk-boundary correspondence
Authors: Varghese Mathai and Guo Chuan Thiang
Abstract: Recently we introduced T-duality in the study of topological insulators. In this paper, we study the bulk-boundary correspondence for three phenomena in condensed matter physics, namely, the quantum Hall effect, the Chern insulator, and time reversal invariant topological insulators. In all of these cases, we show that T-duality trivializes the bulk-boundary correspondence.
