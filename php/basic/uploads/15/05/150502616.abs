Abstract: In de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity and bigravity, a non-minimal matter coupling involving both metrics generically re-introduces the Boulware--Deser (BD) ghost. A non-minimal matter coupling via a simple, yet specific composite metric has been proposed, which eliminates the BD ghost below the strong coupling scale. Working explicitly in the metric formulation and for arbitrary spacetime dimensions, we show that this composite metric is the unique consistent non-minimal matter coupling below the strong coupling scale, which emerges out of two diagnostics, namely, absence of Ostrogradski ghosts in the decoupling limit and absence of the BD ghost from matter quantum loop corrections.
