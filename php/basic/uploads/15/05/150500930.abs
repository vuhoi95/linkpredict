Title: Shear viscosity of the $Î¦^4$ theory from classical simulation
Authors: M. M. Homor and A. Jakovac
Abstract: Shear viscosity of the classical $\Phi^4$ theory is measured using classical microcanonical simulation. To calculate the Kubo formula, we measure the energy-momentum tensor correlation function, and apply the Green-Kubo relation. Being a classical theory, the results depend on the cutoff which should be chosen in the range of the temperature. Comparison with experimentally accessible systems is also performed.
