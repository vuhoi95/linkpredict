Title: The Gribov problem in Noncommutative QED
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Maxim Kurkov and Luigi Rosa and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: It is shown that in the noncommutative version of QED (NCQED) Gribov copies induced by the noncommutativity of space-time appear in the Landau gauge. This is a genuine effect of noncommutative geometry which disappears when the noncommutative parameter vanishes.
