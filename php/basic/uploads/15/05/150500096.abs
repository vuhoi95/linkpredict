Title: DKP Equation in a Rotating Frame with Magnetic Cosmic String Background
Authors: H. Hassanabadi and M. Hosseinpour
Abstract: We study the non-inertial effects on the covariant DKP equation in the curved space-time of a cosmic string. The calculations are done in the presence of a magnetic vector potential in the Coulomb gauge and the analytical solutions for the modified spectrum of the system are reported.
