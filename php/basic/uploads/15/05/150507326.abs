Abstract: Motivated by the ideas of analogue gravity, we have performed experiments in a flume where an analogue White Hole horizon is generated, in the form of a wave blocking region, by suitably tuned uniform fluid (water) flow and counter-propagating shallow water waves. We corroborate earlier experimental observations by finding a critical wave frequency for a particular discharge above which the waves are effectively blocked beyond the horizon. An obstacle, in the form of a bottom wave, is introduced to generate a sharp blocking zone. All previous researchers used this obstacle. A novel part of our experiment is where we do not introduce the obstacle and find that wave blocking still takes place, albeit in a more diffused zone. Lastly we replace the fixed bottom wave obstacle by a movable sand bed to study the sediment transport and the impact of the horizon or wave blocking phenomenon on the sediment profile. We find signatures of the wave blocking zone in the ripple pattern.
