Title: Integrable $Î»$-deformations: Squashing Coset CFTs and $AdS_5\times  S^5$

Abstract: We examine integrable $\lambda$-deformations of $SO(n+1)/SO(n)$ coset CFTs and their analytic continuations. We provide an interpretation of the deformation as a squashing of the corresponding coset $\sigma$-model's target space. We realise the $\lambda$-deformation for $n=5$ case as a solution to supergravity supported by non-vanishing five-form and dilaton. This interpolates between the coset CFT $SO(4,2)/SO(4,1)\times SO(6)/SO(5)$ constructed as a gauged WZW model and the non-Abelian T-dual of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ spacetime.
