Title: Strictly finite range forces from the signum-Gordon field: exact results  in two spatial dimensions
Authors: H. Arodź and J. Karkowski and Z. Świerczyński
Abstract: Exact formula for the force between two identical static point charges coupled to the nonlinear scalar field of two-dimensional signum-Gordon model is obtained. Pertinent solution of the field equation is found in the form of one-dimensional integral. The force exactly vanishes when the distance between the charges exceeds certain critical value.
