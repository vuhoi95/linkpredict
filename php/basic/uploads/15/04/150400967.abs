Title: Fermi-Bose cubic couplings in light-cone field theories
Authors: Y. S. Akshay and Sudarshan Ananth
Abstract: We derive light-cone cubic interaction vertices involving fermions and bosons of arbitrary spin by demanding closure of the Poincar\'e algebra. We derive the three-point scattering amplitude corresponding to these interaction vertices and find that they possess interesting factorization properties, identical to the case of three boson scattering.
