Abstract: We study the one-loop two point functions of the gauge, scalar and spinor fields for a Horava-Lifshitz-like QED with critical exponent $z=2$. It turns out that, in certain cases, the dynamical restoration of the Lorentz symmetry at low energies can take place. We also analyze the three point vertex function of the gauge and spinor fields and prove that the triangle anomaly identically vanishes in this theory.
