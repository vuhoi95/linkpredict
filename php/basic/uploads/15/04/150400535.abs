Title: DC and Hall conductivity in holographic massive Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton  gravity
Authors: Zhenhua Zhou and Jian-Pin Wu and Yi Ling
Abstract: We investigate the holographic DC and Hall conductivity in massive Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) gravity. Two special EMD backgrounds are considered explicitly. One is dyonic Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m-AdS (RN-AdS) geometry and the other one is hyperscaling violation AdS (HV-AdS) geometry. We find that the linear-T resistivity and quadratic-T inverse Hall angle can be simultaneously achieved in HV-AdS models, providing a hint to construct holographic models confronting with the experimental data of strange metal in future.
