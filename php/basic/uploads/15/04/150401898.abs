Title: Generalized supersymmetric cosmological term in N=1 Supergravity
Authors: P. K. Concha and E. K. Rodr√≠guez and P. Salgado
Abstract: An alternative way of introducing the supersymmetric cosmological term in a supergravity theory is presented. We show that the $AdS$-Lorentz superalgebra allows to construct a geometrical formulation of supergravity containing a generalized supersymmetric cosmological constant. The $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity action is built only from the curvatures of the $AdS$-Lorentz superalgebra and corresponds to a MacDowell-Mansouri like action. The extension to a generalized $AdS$-Lorentz superalgebra is also analyzed.
