Title: Antisymmetric tensor field and spontaneous magnetization in holographic  duality
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Run-Qiu Yang
Abstract: A real anti-symmetric tensor field was introduced to realize a holographic magnetic ordered phase in our previous works. However, a more careful analysis shows there is a vector ghost in the model. In this paper we present a modified Lagrangian density for the anti-symmetric tensor, which is ghost free and causality is well-defined, and keeps all the significant results in the original model qualitatively. We show this modified Lagrangian density could come from the dimensional compactification of $p$-form field in String/M-theory. For static curved space-time, we also prove that this modified model is ghost free and dose not violate causality. This new model offers a solid foundation for the application of antisymmetric tensor field in holographic duality, especially for the spontaneous magnetization.
