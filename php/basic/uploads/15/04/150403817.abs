Title: Gauge-Higgs Grand Unification
Authors: Yutaka Hosotani and Naoki Yamatsu
Abstract: $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs grand unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped space is proposed. Orbifold boundary conditions and one brane scalar field reduce $SO(11)$ to the standard model symmetry, which is further broken to $SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{EM}$ by the Hosotani mechanism. In a minimal model quarks and leptons are contained in a multiplet in ${\bf 32}$ of $SO(11)$ in each generation. Proton decay is naturally suppressed by a conserved fermion number.
