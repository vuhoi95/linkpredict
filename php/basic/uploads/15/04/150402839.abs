Title: Light-cone gravity in dS$_4$
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Mahendra Mali
Abstract: We derive a closed form expression for the light-cone Lagrangian describing pure gravity on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. We provide a perturbative expansion, of this Lagrangian, to cubic order in the fields.
