Title: Constraints on cosmic strings from ultracompact minihalos
Authors: Madeleine Anthonisen and Robert Brandenberger and Pat Scott
Abstract: Cosmic strings are expected to form loops. These can act as seeds for accretion of dark matter, leading to the formation of ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs). We perform a detailed study of the accretion of dark matter onto cosmic string loops and compute the resulting mass distribution of UCMHs. We then apply observational limits on the present-day abundance of UCMHs to derive corresponding limits on the cosmic string tension $G\mu$. The bounds are strongly dependent upon the assumed distribution of loop velocities and their impacts on UCMH formation. Under the assumption that a loop can move up to a thousand times its own radius and still form a UCMH, we find a limit of $G\mu\le 5\times10^{-8}$. We show, in opposition to previous results, that strong limits on the cosmic string tension are not obtainable from UCMHs when more stringent (and realistic) requirements are placed on loop velocities.
