Title: Entropic Topological Invariants in Three Dimensions
Authors: Alex Bullivant and Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: We evaluate the entanglement entropy of exactly solvable Hamiltonians corresponding to general families of three-dimensional topological models. We show that the modification to the entropic area law due to three-dimensional topological properties is richer than the two-dimensional case. In addition to the reduction of the entropy caused by non-zero vacuum expectation value of contractible loop operators a new topological invariant appears that increases the entropy if the model consists of non-trivially braiding anyons. As a result the three-dimensional topological entanglement entropy provides only partial information about the two entropic topological invariants.
