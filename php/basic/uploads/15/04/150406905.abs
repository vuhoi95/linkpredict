Title: Inflation from radion gauge-Higgs potential at Planck scale
Authors: Yugo Abe and Takeo Inami and Yoshiharu Kawamura and Yoji Koyama
Abstract: We study whether the inflation is realized based on the radion gauge-Higgs potential obtained from the one-loop calculation in the 5-dimensional gravity coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge theory. We show that the gauge-Higgs can give rise to inflation in accord with the astrophysical data and the radion plays a role in fixing the values of physical parameters. We clarify the reason why the radion dominated inflation and the hybrid inflation cannot occur in our framework.
