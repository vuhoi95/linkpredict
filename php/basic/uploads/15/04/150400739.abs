Authors: M. A. L. Capri and H. C. Toledo and J. A. HelayÃ«l-Neto
Abstract: We present an N=1 supersymmetric generalization of the Maximal Abelian Gauge (MAG) in its superfield and component-field formulations, and discuss its Faddeev-Popov quantization, the associated BRST symmetry and the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity in superspace approach.
