Title: Extended sigma-model in nontrivially deformed field-antifield formalism
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Peter M. Lavrov
Abstract: We propose an action for the extended sigma - models in the most general setting of the kinetic term allowed in the nontrivially deformed field - antifield formalism. We show that the classical motion equations do naturally take their desired canonical form.
