Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy for noncommutative Anti-de Sitter space
Authors: Davood Momeni and Muhammad Raza and Ratbay Myrzakulov
Abstract: A metric is proposed to explore the noncommutative form of the Anti-de Sitter space due to quantum effects. It has been proved that the non commutativity in AdS space induces a single component gravitoelectric field. The holographic Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) algorithm is then applied to compute the entanglement entropy in dual $CFT_2$. This calculation can be exploited to compute UV-IR cutoff dependent central charge of the certain noncommutative $CFT_2$. This non commutative computation of the entanglement entropy can be interpreted in the form of the surface/state correspondence. We have shown that non commutativity increases the dimension of the effective Hilbert space of the dual CFT.
