Title: The equivariant A-twist and gauged linear sigma models on the two-sphere
Authors: Cyril Closset and Stefano Cremonesi and Daniel S. Park
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric gauged linear sigma models (GLSM) on the $\Omega$-deformed sphere, $S^2_\Omega$, which is a one-parameter deformation of the $A$-twisted sphere. We provide an exact formula for the $S^2_\Omega$ supersymmetric correlation functions using supersymmetric localization. The contribution of each instanton sector is given in terms of a Jeffrey-Kirwan residue on the Coulomb branch. In the limit of vanishing $\Omega$-deformation, the localization formula greatly simplifies the computation of $A$-twisted correlation functions, and leads to new results for non-abelian theories. We discuss a number of examples and comment on the $\epsilon_\Omega$-deformation of the quantum cohomology relations. Finally, we present a complementary Higgs branch localization scheme in the special case of abelian gauge groups.
