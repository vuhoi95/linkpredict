Title: Supersymmetric index on T^2 x S^2 and elliptic genus
Authors: Masazumi Honda and Yutaka Yoshida
Abstract: We study partition function of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theory on $T^2 \times S^2$. By applying supersymmetry localization, we show that the $T^2 \times S^2$ partition function is given by elliptic genus of certain two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ theory. As an application, we discuss a relation between 4d Seiberg duality duality and 2d $(0,2)$ triality, proposed by Gadde, Gukov and Putrov. In other examples, we identify 4d theories giving elliptic genera of K3, M-strings and E-strings. In the example of K3, we find that there are two 4d theories giving the elliptic genus of K3. This would imply new four-dimensional duality.
