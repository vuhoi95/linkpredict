Title: The hybrid Seiberg-Witten map, its $Î¸$-exact expansion and the  antifield formalism
Authors: C. P. Martin and David G. Navarro
Abstract: We deduce an evolution equation for an arbitrary hybrid Seiberg-Witten map for compact gauge groups by using the antifield formalism. We show how this evolution equation can be used to obtain the hybrid Seiberg-Witten map as an expansion, which is $\theta$-exact, in the number of ordinary fields. We compute explicitly this expansion up to order three in the number of ordinary gauge fields and then particularize it to case of the Higgs of the noncommutative Standard Model.
