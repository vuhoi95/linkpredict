Title: Quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 charged particle in the presence of  magnetic field with scalar and vector couplings
Authors: Luis B. Castro and Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 charged particle in the presence of magnetic field is analyzed for the general case where scalar and vector couplings are considered. The energy spectra are explicitly computed for different physical situations, as well as their dependencies on the magnetic field strength, spin projection parameter and vector and scalar coupling constants.
