Title: Integrability from 2d N=(2,2) Dualities
Authors: Masahito Yamazaki and Wenbin Yan
Abstract: We study integrable models in the context of the recently discovered Gauge/YBE correspondence, where the Yang-Baxter equation is promoted to a duality between two supersymmetric gauge theories. We study flavored elliptic genus of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ quiver gauge theories, which theories are defined from statistical lattices regarded as quiver diagrams. Our R-matrices are written in terms of theta functions, and simplifies considerably when the gauge groups at the quiver nodes are Abelian. We also discuss the modularity properties of the R-matrix, reduction of 2d index to 1d Witten index, and string theory realizations of our theories.
