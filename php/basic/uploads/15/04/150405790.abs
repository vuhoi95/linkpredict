Title: Curvature Singularity in f(R) Theories of Gravity
Authors: Koushik Dutta and Sukanta Panda and Avani Patel
Abstract: Although $f(R)$ modification of late time cosmology is successful in explaining present cosmic acceleration, it is difficult to satisfy the fifth-force constraint simultaneously. Even when the fifth-force constraint is satisfied, the effective scalar degree of freedom may move to a point (close to its potential minima) in the field space where the Ricci scalar diverges. We elucidate this point further with a specific example of $f(R)$ gravity that incorporates several viable $f(R)$ gravity models in the literature. In particular, we show that the nonlinear evolution of the scalar field in pressureless contracting dust can easily lead to the curvature singularity, making this theory unviable.
