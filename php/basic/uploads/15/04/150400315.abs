Title: BCFW recursion for TMD parton scattering
Authors: A. van Hameren and M. Serino
Abstract: We investigate the application of the BCFW recursion relation to scattering amplitudes with one off-shell particle in a Yang-Mills theory with fermions. We provide a set of conditions of applicability of the BCFW recursion, stressing some important differences with respect to the pure on-shell case. We show how the formulas for Maximally-Helicity-Violating (MHV) configurations with any number of partons, which are well known in the fully on-shell case, are generalized to this kinematic regime. We also derive analytic expressions for all the helicity configurations of the 5-point color-stripped tree-level amplitudes for any of the partons being off the mass shell.
