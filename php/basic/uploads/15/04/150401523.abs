Title: Exceptional field theory: $SO(5,5)$
Authors: Aidar Abzalov and Ilya Bakhmatov and Edvard T. Musaev
Abstract: We construct Exceptional Field Theory for the group $SO(5,5)$ based on the extended (6+16)-dimensional spacetime, which after reduction gives the maximal $D=6$ supergravity. We present both a true action and a duality-invariant pseudo-action formulations. All the fields of the theory depend on the complete extended spacetime. The U-duality group $SO(5,5)$ is made a geometric symmetry of the theory by virtue of introducing the generalised Lie derivative that incorporates a local duality transformation. Tensor hierarchy appears as a natural consequence of the algebra of generalised Lie derivatives that are viewed as gauge transformations. Upon truncating different subsets of the extra coordinates, maximal supergravities in $D=11$ and $D=10$ (type IIB) can be recovered from this theory.
