Title: Green's Functions in Perturbative Quantum Gravity
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We show that the Green's functions in non-linear gauge in the theory of perturbative quantum gravity is expressed as a series in terms of those in linear gauges. This formulation is also holds for operator Green's functions. We further derive the explicit relation between the Green's functions in the theory of perturbative quantum gravity in a pair of arbitary gauges. This process involves some sort of modified FFBRST transformations which is derivable from infinitesimal field-dependent BRST transformations.
