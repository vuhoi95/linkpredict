Title: The two-loop sunrise integral around four space-time dimensions and  generalisations of the Clausen and Glaisher functions towards the elliptic  case
Authors: Luise Adams and Christian Bogner and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We present the result for the finite part of the two-loop sunrise integral with unequal masses in four space-time dimensions in terms of the ${\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^0)$-part and the ${\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^1)$-part of the sunrise integral around two space-time dimensions. The latter two integrals are given in terms of elliptic generalisations of Clausen and Glaisher functions. Interesting aspects of the result for the ${\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^1)$-part of the sunrise integral around two space-time dimensions are the occurrence of depth two elliptic objects and the weights of the individual terms.
