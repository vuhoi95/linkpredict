Title: Phase Transitions in Warped AdS$_3$ Gravity
Authors: Stéphane Detournay and Céline Zwikel
Abstract: We consider asymptotically Warped AdS$_3$ black holes in Topologically Massive Gravity. We study their thermodynamic stability and show the existence of a Hawking-Page phase transition between the black hole and thermal background phases. At zero angular potential, the latter is shown to occur at the self-dual point of the dual Warped Conformal Field Theory partition function, in analogy with the phase transition for BTZ black holes in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. We also discuss how the central and vacuum charges can be obtained from inner horizon mechanics in the presence of a gravitational anomaly.
