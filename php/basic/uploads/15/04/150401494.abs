Title: The Relativity of Chiral Property
Authors: Robert Delbourgo and Paul D. Stack
Abstract: The standard model ascribes distinct properties to different chiralities of fermions. We show how to incorporate this aspect in an extended spacetime-property framework involving two different attributes using a generalized metric which includes gauge fields as well as gravitation. Because the gauge fields are accompanied by coupling constants, all such schemes, including ours, necessitate coupling unification at high energy to ensure universality of gravitational interactions with matter.
