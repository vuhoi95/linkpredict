Title: Infinite circumference limit of conformal field theory
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Tsukasa Tada
Abstract: We argue that an infinite circumference limit can be obtained in 2-dimensional conformal field theory by adopting $L_0-(L_1+L_{-1})/2$ as a Hamiltonian instead of $L_0$. The theory obtained has a circumference of infinite length and hence exhibits a continuous and heavily degenerated spectrum as well as the continuous Virasoro algebra. The choice of this Hamiltonian was inspired partly by the so-called sine-square deformation, which is found in the study of a certain class of quantum statistical systems. The enigmatic behavior of sine-square deformed systems such as the sharing of their vacuum states with the closed boundary systems can be understood by the appearance of an infinite circumference.
