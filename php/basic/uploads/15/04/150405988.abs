Title: Charting Class ${\cal S}_k$ Territory
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Hirotaka Hayashi and Angel Uranga
Abstract: We extend the investigation of the recently introduced class ${\cal S}_k$ of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs, by considering a large family of quiver gauge theories within it, which we denote $\mathcal{S}^1_k$. These theories admit a realization in terms of $\mathbb{Z}_k$ orbifolds of Type IIA configurations of D4-branes stretched among relatively rotated sets of NS-branes. This fact permits a systematic investigation of the full family, which exhibits new features such as non-trivial anomalous dimensions differing from free field values and novel ways of gluing theories. We relate these ingredients to properties of compactification of the 6d (1,0) superconformal ${\cal T}_N^k$ theories on spheres with different kinds of punctures. We describe the structure of dualities in this class of theories upon exchange of punctures, including transformations that correspond to Seiberg dualities, and exploit the computation of the superconformal index to check the invariance of the theories under them.
