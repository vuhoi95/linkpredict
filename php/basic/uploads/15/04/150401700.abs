Title: Supersymmetric Localization for BPS Black Hole Entropy: 1-loop Partition  Function from Vector Multiplets
Authors: Rajesh Kumar Gupta and Yuto Ito and Imtak Jeon
Abstract: We use the techniques of supersymmetric localization to compute the BPS black hole entropy in N=2 supergravity. We focus on the n_v+1 vector multiplets on the black hole near horizon background which is AdS_2 x S^2 space. We find the localizing saddle point of the vector multiplets by solving the localization equations, and compute the exact one loop partition function on the saddle point. Furthermore, we propose the appropriate functional integration measure. Through this measure, the one loop determinant is written in terms of the radius of the physical metric, which depends on the localizing saddle point value of the vector multiplets. The result for the one loop determinant is consistent with the logarithmic corrections to the BPS black hole entropy from vector multiplets.
