Title: Spherical collapse of small masses in the ghost-free gravity
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Andrei Zelnikov and Tiberio de Paula Netto
Abstract: We discuss some properties of recently proposed models of a ghost-free gravity. For this purpose we study solutions of linearized gravitational equations in the framework of such a theory. We mainly focus on the version of the ghost-free theory with the exponential modification $\exp(\Box/\mu^2)\Box^{-1}$ of the free propagator. The following three problems are discussed: (i) Gravitational field of a point mass; (ii) Penrose limit of a point source boosted to the speed of light; and (iii) Spherical gravitational collapse of null fluid. For the first problem we demonstrate that it can be solved by using the method of heat kernels and obtain a solution in a spacetime with arbitrary number of dimensions. For the second problem we also find the corresponding gyraton-type solutions of the ghost-free gravitational equations for any number of dimensions. For the third problem we obtain solutions for the gravitational field for the collapse of both "thin" and "thick" spherical null shells. We demonstrate how the ghost-free modification of the gravitational equations regularize the solutions of the linearized Einstein equations and smooth out their singularities.
