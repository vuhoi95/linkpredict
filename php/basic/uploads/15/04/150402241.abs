Title: Graviton self-energy from worldlines
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Roberto Bonezzi
Abstract: Worldline approaches, when available, often simplify and make more efficient the calculation of various observables in quantum field theories. In this contribution we first review the calculation of the graviton self-energy due to a loop of virtual particles of spin 0, 1/2 and 1, all of which have a well-known worldline description. For the case of the graviton itself, an elegant worldline description is still missing, though one can still describe it by constructing a worldline representation of the differential operators that arise in the quadratic approximation of the Einstein-Hilbert action. We have recently analyzed the latter approach, and we use it here to calculate the one-loop graviton self energy due to the graviton itself in this formalism.
