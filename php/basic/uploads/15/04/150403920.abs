Title: Prospect of probing dark energy using stochastic gravitational waves
Authors: Bikash R. Dinda and Anjan A. Sen
Abstract: We study the possibility of probing dark energy behaviour using gravitational wave experiments like LISA and Advanced LIGO. Using two popular parameterizations for dark energy equation of state, we show that with current sensitivities of LISA and Advanced LIGO to detect the stochastic gravitational waves, it is possible to probe a large section of parameter space for the dark energy equation of state which is allowed by present cosmological observations.
