Title: Arguments towards the construction of a matrix model groundstate
Authors: L. Boulton and M. P. Garcia del Moral and A. Restuccia
Abstract: We discuss the existence and uniqueness of wavefunctions for inhomogenoeus boundary value problems associated to x^2y^2-type matrix model on a bounded domain of R^2. Both properties involve a combination of the Cauchy-Kovalewski Theorem and a explicit calculations.
