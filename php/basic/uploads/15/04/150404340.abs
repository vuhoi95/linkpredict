Title: Rigid Supersymmetry from Conformal Supergravity in Five Dimensions
Authors: Alessandro Pini and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Johannes Schmude
Abstract: We study the rigid limit of 5d conformal supergravity with minimal supersymmetry on Riemannian manifolds. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution is the existence of a conformal Killing vector. Whenever a certain $SU(2)$ curvature becomes abelian the backgrounds define a transversally holomorphic foliation. Subsequently we turn to the question under which circumstances these backgrounds admit a kinetic Yang-Mills term in the action of a vector multiplet. Here we find that the conformal Killing vector has to be Killing. We supplement the discussion with various appendices.
