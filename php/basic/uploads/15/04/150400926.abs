Title: Higher spins in the symmetric orbifold of K3
Authors: Marco Baggio and Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Cheng Peng
Abstract: The symmetric orbifold of K3 is believed to be the CFT dual of string theory on AdS3 x S3 x K3 at the tensionless point. For the case when the K3 is described by the orbifold T4/Z2, we identify a subsector of the symmetric orbifold theory that is dual to a higher spin theory on AdS3. We analyse how the BPS spectrum of string theory can be described from the higher spin perspective, and determine which single-particle BPS states are accounted for by the perturbative higher spin theory.
