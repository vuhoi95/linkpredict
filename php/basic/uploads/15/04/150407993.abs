Title: Higgs Mechanism, Phase Transitions, and Anomalous Hall Effect in  Three-Dimensional Topological Superconductors

Abstract: We demonstrate that the Higgs mechanism in three-dimensional topological superconductors exhibits unique features with experimentally observable consequences. The Higgs model we discuss has two superconducting components and an axion-like magnetoelectric term with the phase difference of the superconducting order parameters playing the role of the axion field. Due to this additional term, quantum electromagnetic and phase fluctuations lead to a robust topologically non-trivial state that holds also in the presence of interactions. In this sense, we show that the renormalization flow of the topologically nontrivial phase cannot be continuously deformed into a topologically non-trivial one. One consequence of our analysis of quantum critical fluctuations, is the possibility of having a first-order phase transition in the bulk and a second-order phase transition on the surface. We also explore another consequence of the axionic Higgs electrodynamics, namely, the anomalous Hall effect. In the low frequency London regime an anomalous Hall effect is induced in the presence of an applied electric field parallel to the surface. This anomalous Hall current is induced by a Lorentz-like force arising from the axion term, and it involves the relative superfluid velocity of the superconducting components. The anomalous Hall current has a negative sign, a situation reminiscent of, but quite distinct in physical origin from the anomalous Hall effect observed in high-$T_c$ superconductors. In contrast to the latter, the anomalous Hall effect in topological superconductors is non-dissipative and occurs in the absence of vortices.
