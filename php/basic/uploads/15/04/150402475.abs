Title: Universal features of left-right entanglement entropy
Authors: Diptarka Das and Shouvik Datta
Abstract: We show the presence of universal features in the entanglement entropy of regularized boundary states for (1+1)-d conformal field theories on a circle when the reduced density matrix is obtained by tracing over right/left-moving modes. We derive a general formula for the left-right entanglement entropy in terms of the central charge and the modular S matrix of the theory. When the state is chosen to be an Ishibashi state, this measure of entanglement is shown to reproduce the spatial entanglement entropy of a (2+1)-d topological quantum field theory. We explicitly evaluate the left-right entanglement entropies for the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model and the su(2)_k WZW model as examples.
