Title: Hamiltonian operator for loop quantum gravity coupled to a scalar field
Authors: Emanuele Alesci and Mehdi Assanioussi and Jerzy Lewandowski and Ilkka MÃ¤kinen
Abstract: We present the construction of a physical Hamiltonian operator in the deparametrized model of loop quantum gravity coupled to a free scalar field. This construction is based on the use of the recently introduced curvature operator, and on the idea of so-called "special loops". We discuss in detail the regularization procedure and the assignment of the loops, along with the properties of the resulting operator. We compute the action of the squared Hamiltonian operator on spin network states, and close with some comments and outlooks.
