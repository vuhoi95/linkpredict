Title: A pair of extremal charged black holes on Kerr-Taub-bolt space
Authors: Ken Matsuno and Hideki Ishihara and Masashi Kimura
Abstract: We construct asymptotically Kaluza-Klein solutions in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory which represent a pair of extremal, charged, static black holes on Kerr-Taub-bolt space. Regularity conditions require that the topology of spatial infinity and that of each black hole are not S$^3$, but different lens spaces. We show that for a given topology at spatial infinity, there are an infinite number of different horizon topologies for the black hole pair. We briefly discuss a generalization to the case with a positive cosmological constant.
