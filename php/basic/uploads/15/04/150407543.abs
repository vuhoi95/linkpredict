Title: False Vacuum Transitions - Analytical Solutions and Decay Rate Values
Authors: R. A. C. Correa and P. H. R. S. Moraes and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: In this work we show a class of oscillating configurations for the evolution of the domain walls in Euclidean space. The solutions are obtained analytically. Phase transitions are achieved from the associated fluctuation determinant, by the decay rates of the false vacuum.
