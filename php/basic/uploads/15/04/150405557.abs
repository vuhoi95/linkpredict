Title: The Hyperbolic Geometry of Cosmological Attractors
Authors: John Joseph M. Carrasco and Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde and Diederik Roest
Abstract: Cosmological alpha-attractors give a natural explanation for the spectral index n_s of inflation as measured by Planck while predicting a range for the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, consistent with all observations, to be measured more precisely in future detection of gravity waves. Their embedding into supergravity exploits the hyperbolic geometry of the Poincare disk or half-plane. These geometries are isometric under Mobius transformations, which include the shift symmetry of the inflaton field. We introduce a new Kahler potential frame that explicitly preserves this symmetry, enabling the inflaton to be light. Moreover, we include higher-order curvature deformations, which can stabilize a direction orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory. We illustrate this new framework by stabilizing the single superfield alpha-attractors.
