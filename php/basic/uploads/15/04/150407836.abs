Title: Universal turbulence on branes in holography
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Mitsuhiro Nishida and Akihiko Sonoda
Abstract: At a meson melting transition in holographic QCD, a weak turbulence of mesons was found with critical embeddings of probe D-branes in gravity duals. The turbulent mesons have a power-law energy distribution $\varepsilon_n \propto (\omega_n)^\alpha$ where $\omega_n$ is the mass of the $n$-th excited resonance of the meson tower. In this paper, we find that the turbulence power $\alpha$ is universal, irrespective of how the transition is driven, by numerically calculating the power in various static brane setups at criticality. We also find that the power $\alpha$ depends only on the cone dimensions of the probe D-branes.
