Title: Bifid Throats for Axion Monodromy Inflation
Authors: Ander Retolaza and Angel M. Uranga and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We construct a simple explicit local geometry providing a `bifid throat' for 5-brane axion monodromy. A bifid throat is a throat that splits into two daughter throats in the IR, containing a homologous 2-cycle family reaching down into each daughter throat. Our example consists of a deformed $\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the conifold, which provides us with an explicit holographic dual of the bifid throat including D3-branes and fractional 5-branes at the toric singularities of our setup. Having the holographic description in terms of the dual gauge theory allows us to address the effect of 5-brane-antibrane pair backreaction including the warping effects. This leads to the size of the backreaction being small and controllable after imposing proper normalization of the inflaton potential and hence the warping scales.
