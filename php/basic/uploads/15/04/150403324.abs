Title: Emergent scale invariance of disordered horizons
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and David M. Ramirez and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: We construct planar black hole solutions in AdS_3 and AdS_4 in which the boundary CFT is perturbed by marginally relevant quenched disorder. We show that the entropy density of the horizon has the scaling temperature dependence s \sim T^{(d-1)/z} (with d=2,3). The dynamical critical exponent z is computed numerically and, at weak disorder, analytically. These results lend support to the claim that the perturbed CFT flows to a disordered quantum critical theory in the IR.
