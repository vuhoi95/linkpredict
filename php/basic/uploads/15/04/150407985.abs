Title: Entanglement entropy in two dimensional string theory
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and Edward Mazenc
Abstract: To understand an emergent spacetime is to understand the emergence of locality. Entanglement entropy is a powerful diagnostic of locality, because locality leads to a large amount of short distance entanglement. Two dimensional string theory is among the very simplest instances of an emergent spatial dimension. We compute the entanglement entropy in the large $N$ matrix quantum mechanics dual to two dimensional string theory, in the semiclassical limit of weak string coupling. We isolate a logarithmically large, but finite, contribution that corresponds to the short distance entanglement of the tachyon field in the emergent spacetime. From the spacetime point of view, the entanglement is regulated by a nonperturbative `graininess' of space.
