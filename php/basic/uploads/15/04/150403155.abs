Title: Fusion rules for the logarithmic $N=1$ superconformal minimal models I:  the Neveu-Schwarz sector
Authors: Michael Canagasabey and Jorgen Rasmussen and David Ridout
Abstract: It is now well known that non-local observables in critical statistical lattice models, polymers and percolation for example, may be modelled in the continuum scaling limit by logarithmic conformal field theories. Fusion rules for such theories, sometimes referred to as logarithmic minimal models, have been intensively studied over the last ten years in order to explore the representation-theoretic structures relevant to non-local observables. Motivated by recent lattice conjectures, this work studies the fusion rules of the $N=1$ supersymmetric analogues of these logarithmic minimal models in the Neveu-Schwarz sector. Fusion rules involving Ramond representations will be addressed in a sequel.
