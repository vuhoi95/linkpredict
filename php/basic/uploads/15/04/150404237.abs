Title: (Anti-)BRST and (Anti-)co-BRST Symmetries of a System of Rigid Rotor:  Augmented Supervariable Approach
Authors: T. Bhanja and N. Srinivas and R. P. Malik
Abstract: We derive the nilpotent (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for the system of a rigid rotor by exploiting the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST restrictions on the (anti-)chiral supervariables that are defined on the appropriately chosen (1, 1)-dimensional super-submanifolds of the general (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold on which, our 1D system of a rigid rotor is considered within the framework of augmented supervariable approach. The general (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold is parameterized by the superspace coordinates (t, \theta, \bar\theta) where t is the bosonic evolution parameter and (\theta, \bar\theta) are the Grassmannian variables which obey the standard relationships: {\theta}^2 = {\bar\theta}^2 = 0, {\theta}\,{\bar\theta} + {\bar\theta}\,{\theta} = 0. One of the key results of our present investigation is the observation that we do not require the theoretical strength of (dual-)horizontality conditions anywhere (while deriving the above symmetries). We also provide the geometrical interpretations for the symmetry invariance and nilpotency property. Furthermore, in our present endeavor, we concisely offer some relevant remarks on the property of absolute anticommutativity.
