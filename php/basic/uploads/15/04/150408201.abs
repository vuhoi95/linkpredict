Abstract: The effect of the electric field on the creation of spin 1/2 particles from vacuum in the (1+1) dimensional de-Sitter space-time is studied. The Dirac equation with a constant electric field is solved by introducing an unitary transformation. Then the canonical method based on Bogoliubov transformation is applied to calculate the pair creation probability and the density of created particles both for positive or negative wave vector. By doing summation over all allowed states, the number of created particles per unit of time per unit of length and the imaginary part of the Schwinger effective action are expressed in closed forms. It is shown that the electric field leads to a significant enhancement of the particle creation. The weak expansion case and the limit H=0, where dS space reduces to the flat Minkowski space-time, are discussed.
