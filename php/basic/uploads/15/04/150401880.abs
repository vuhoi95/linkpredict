Title: On the Massless Vector Fields in a Rindler Space
Authors: Roberto Soldati and Caterina Specchia
Abstract: We study the quantum theory of the mass-less vector fields on the Rindler space. We evaluate the Bogoliubov coefficients by means of a new technique based upon the use of light-front coordinates and Mellin transform. We briefly comment about the ensuing Unruh effect and its consequences.
