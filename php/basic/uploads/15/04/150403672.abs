Title: Tao Probing the End of the World
Authors: Sung-Soo Kim and Masato Taki and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: We introduce a new type IIB 5-brane description for the E-string theory which is the world-volume theory on the M5-brane probing the end of the world M9-brane. The E-string in the new realization is depicted as spiral 5-branes web equipped with the cyclic structure which is key to uplifting to six dimensions. Utilizing the topological vertex to the 5-brane web configuration enables us to write down a combinatorial formula for the generating function of the E-string elliptic genera, namely the full partition function of topological strings on the local 1/2 K3 surface.
