Title: Matter coupled Dirac-Born-Infeld action in 4-dimensional N=1 conformal  supergravity
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: We construct the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in the context of N=1 conformal supergravity and its possible extensions including matter couplings. We especially focus on the Volkov-Akulov constraint, which is important to avoid ghost modes from the higher derivative terms. In the case with matter couplings, we find the modified D-term potential.
