Title: "Quantizations" of isomonodromic Hamiltonian Garnier system with two  degrees of freedom
Authors: D. P. Novikov and B. I. Suleimanov
Abstract: We construct solutions of analogues of the nonstationary Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the polynomial isomonodromic Hamiltonian Garnier system with two degrees of freedom. This solutions are obtained from solutions of systems of linear ordinary differential equations whose compatibility condition is the Garnier system. This solutions upto explicit transform also satisfy the Belavin --- Polyakov --- Zamolodchikov equations with four time variables and two space variables.
