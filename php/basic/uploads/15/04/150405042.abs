Title: On the Schr{รถ}dinger-Newton equation and its symmetries: a geometric  view
Authors: C. Duval and Serge Lazzarini
Abstract: The \SN (SN) equation is recast on purely geometrical grounds, namely in terms of Bargmann structures over $(\d+1)$-dimensional Newton-Cartan (NC) spacetimes. Its maximal group of invariance, which we call the SN group, is determined as the group of conformal Bargmann automorphisms that preserve the coupled Schr\"odinger and NC gravitational field equations. Canonical unitary representations of the SN group are worked out, helping us recover, in particular, a very specific occurrence of dilations with dynamical exponent $z=(\d+2)/3$.
