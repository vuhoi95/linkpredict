Title: Gravitational Correction to Fuzzy String in Metastable Brane  Configuration
Authors: Aya Kasai and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We study dynamics of a cosmic string in a metastable brane configuration in Type IIA string theory. We first discuss a decay process of the cosmic string via a fuzzy brane (equivalently bubble/string bound state) by neglecting gravitational corrections in ten-dimension. We find that depending on the strength of the magnetic field induced on the bubble, the decay rate can be either larger or smaller than that of $O(4)$ symmetric bubble. Then, we investigate gravitational corrections to the fuzzy brane by using the extremal black $NS$-five brane solution, which makes the lifetime of the metastable state longer.
