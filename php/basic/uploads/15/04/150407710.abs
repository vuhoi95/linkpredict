Title: Superconformal Chern-Simons Partition Functions of Affine D-type Quiver  from Fermi Gas
Authors: Sanefumi Moriyama and Tomoki Nosaka
Abstract: We consider the partition function of the superconformal Chern-Simons theories with the quiver diagram being the affine D-type Dynkin diagram. Rewriting the partition function into that of a Fermi gas system, we show that the perturbative expansions in 1/N are summed up to an Airy function, as in the ABJM theory or more generally the theories of the affine A-type quiver. As a corollary, this provides a proof for the previous proposal in the large N limit. For special values of the Chern-Simons levels, we further identify three species of the membrane instantons and also conjecture an exact expression of the overall constant, which corresponds to the constant map in the topological string theory.
