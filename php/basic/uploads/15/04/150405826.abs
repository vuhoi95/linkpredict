Title: Magnetism and rotation in relativistic field theory
Authors: Kazuya Mameda and Arata Yamamoto
Abstract: We investigate the analogy between magnetism and rotation in relativistic theory. In nonrelativistic theory, the exact correspondence between magnetism and rotation is established in the presence of an external trapping potential. Based on this, we analyze relativistic rotation under external trapping potentials. A Landau-like quantization is obtained by considering an energy-dependent potential.
