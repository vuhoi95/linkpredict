Title: Cosmological Relaxation of the Electroweak Scale
Authors: Peter W. Graham and David E. Kaplan and Surjeet Rajendran
Abstract: A new class of solutions to the electroweak hierarchy problem is presented that does not require either weak scale dynamics or anthropics. Dynamical evolution during the early universe drives the Higgs mass to a value much smaller than the cutoff. The simplest model has the particle content of the standard model plus a QCD axion and an inflation sector. The highest cutoff achieved in any technically natural model is 10^8 GeV.
