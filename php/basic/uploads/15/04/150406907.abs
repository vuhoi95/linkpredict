Title: Aspects of the T-duality construction for the Supermembrane theory
Authors: M. P. Garcia del Moral and J. M. Pena and A. Restuccia
Abstract: In this note we explicitly show how the generalization of the T-duality symmetry of the supermembrane theory compactified in M9xT2 can be reduced to a parabolic subgroup of SL(2,Z) that acts non-linearly on the moduli parameters and on the KK and winding charges of the supermembrane. This is a first step towards a deeper understanding of the dual relation between the parabolic type II gauged supergravity in nine dimensions.
