Title: From topological strings to minimal models
Authors: Omar Foda and Jian-Feng Wu
Abstract: We glue four refined topological vertices to obtain the building block of 5D $U(2)$ quiver instanton partition functions. We take the 4D limit of the result to obtain the building block of 4D instanton partition functions which, using the AGT correspondence, are identified with Virasoro conformal blocks. We show that there is a choice of the parameters of the topological vertices that we start with, as well as the parameters and the intermediate states involved in the gluing procedure, such that we obtain Virasoro minimal model conformal blocks.
