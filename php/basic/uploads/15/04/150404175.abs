Title: Orbit method quantization of the AdS$_2$ superparticle
Authors: Martin Heinze and Ben Hoare and George Jorjadze and Luka Megrelidze
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian reduction and canonical quantization of a massive AdS$_2$ superparticle realized on the coset OSP(1|2)/SO(1,1). The phase space of the massive superparticle is represented as a coadjoint orbit of a timelike element of $\mathfrak{osp}$(1|2). This orbit has a well defined symplectic structure and the OSP(1|2) symmetry is realized as the Poisson bracket algebra of the Noether charges. We then construct canonical coordinates given by one bosonic and one fermionic oscillator, whose quantization leads to the Holstein-Primakoff type realization of $\mathfrak{osp}$(1|2). We also perform a similar analysis and discuss new features and inconsistencies in the massless case.
