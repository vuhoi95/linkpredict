Title: Notes on stress energy tensor of neutral blackfolds
Authors: Jafar Sadeghi and Zeinab Amoozad
Abstract: In this paper we review some properties of higher dimensional black holes. We take advantages of fluid/gravity duality and obtain the fluid properties of higher dimensional black holes on the boundary. So we consider two neutral and charged blackfold cases and extract the Brown-York stress energy tensor of fluid. But Brown-York method does not work for all intrinsic metric in the reference spacetime. Surprisingly, in AAds spacetimes the expectation value of the stress tensor in the CFT side solves the problem. In our case the neutral blackfold's spacetime is Ricci-flat. As we know, the compactification of some directions in any asymptotically AdS black brane corresponds to a Ricci-flat spacetime. So by calculating the AAdS form of that metric the dual renormalized holographic stress tensor has been extracted. This stress tensor is conserved and traceless, also it is same as perfect fluid.
