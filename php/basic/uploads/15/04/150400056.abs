Title: Constraining de Sitter Space in String Theory
Authors: David Kutasov and Travis Maxfield and Ilarion Melnikov and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We argue that the heterotic string does not have classical vacua corresponding to de Sitter space-times of dimension four or higher. The same conclusion applies to type II vacua in the absence of RR fluxes. Our argument extends prior supergravity no-go results to regimes of high curvature. We discuss the interpretation of the heterotic result from the perspective of dual type II orientifold constructions. Our result suggests that the genericity arguments used in string landscape discussions should be viewed with caution.
