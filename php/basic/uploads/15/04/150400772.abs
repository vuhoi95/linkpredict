Title: Universal anomalous dimensions at large spin and large twist
Authors: Apratim Kaviraj and Kallol Sen and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: In this paper we consider anomalous dimensions of double trace operators at large spin ($\ell$) and large twist ($\tau$) in CFTs in arbitrary dimensions ($d\geq 3$). Using analytic conformal bootstrap methods, we show that the anomalous dimensions are universal in the limit $\ell\gg \tau\gg 1$. In the course of the derivation, we extract an approximate closed form expression for the conformal blocks arising in the four point function of identical scalars in any dimension. We compare our results with two different calculations in holography and find perfect agreement.
