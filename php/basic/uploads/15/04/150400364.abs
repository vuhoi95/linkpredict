Title: Colored HOMFLY polynomials can distinguish mutant knots
Authors: Satoshi Nawata and P. Ramadevi and Vivek Kumar Singh
Abstract: We illustrate from the viewpoint of braiding operations on WZNW conformal blocks how colored HOMFLY polynomials with multiplicity structure can detect mutations. As an example, we explicitly evaluate the (2,1)-colored HOMFLY polynomials that distinguish a famous mutant pair, Kinoshita-Terasaka and Conway knot.
