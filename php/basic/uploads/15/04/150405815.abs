Title: Nonchiral enhancement of scalar glueball decay in the  Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model
Authors: Frederic Br√ºnner and Anton Rebhan
Abstract: We estimate the consequences of finite masses of pseudoscalar mesons on the decay rates of scalar glueballs in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, a top-down holographic model of low-energy QCD, by extrapolating from the calculable vertex of glueball fields and the eta' meson which follows from the Witten-Veneziano mechanism for giving mass to the latter. Evaluating the effect on the recently calculated decay rates of glueballs in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, we find a strong enhancement of the decay of scalar glueballs into kaons and eta mesons, in fairly close agreement with experimental data on the glueball candidate f0(1710).
