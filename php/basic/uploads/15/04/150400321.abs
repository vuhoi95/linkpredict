Title: On rigid supersymmetry and notions of holomorphy in five dimensions
Authors: Yiwen Pan and Johannes Schmude
Abstract: We study the equations governing rigid N=1 supersymmetry in five dimensions. If the supersymmetry spinor satisfies a reality condition, these are foliations admitting families of almost complex structures on the leaves. In other words, all these manifolds have families of almost Cauchy-Riemann (CR) structures. After deriving integrability conditions under which circumstances the almost CR structure defines a CR manifold or a transversally holomorphic foliation (THF), we discuss implications on localization. We also discuss potential global obstructions to the existence of solutions.
