Title: On Axionic Field Ranges, Loopholes and the Weak Gravity Conjecture
Authors: Jon Brown and William Cottrell and Gary Shiu and Pablo Soler
Abstract: In this short note we clarify some aspects of the impact that the Weak Gravity Conjecture has on models of (generalized) natural inflation. We address in particular certain technical and conceptual concerns recently raised regarding the stringent constraints and conclusions found in our previous work (arXiv:1503.04783). We also point out the difficulties faced by attempts to evade these constraints. These new considerations improve the understanding of the quantum gravity constraints we found and further support the conclusion that it remains challenging for axions to drive natural inflation.
