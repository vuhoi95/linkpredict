Title: Note on uncertainty relations in doubly special relativity and rainbow  gravity
Authors: Edwin J. Son and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We present commutation relations depending on the rainbow functions which are slightly different from the well-known results. However, the advantage of these new commutation relations are compatible with the calculation of the Hawking temperature in the rainbow Schwarzschild black hole.
