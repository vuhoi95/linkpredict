Title: Hadronic Matter in the Robertson-Walker Metric and the Early Universe
Authors: Ivan E. Cunha and Celso C. Barros Jr
Abstract: In this work, the Friedman equations for hadronic matter in the Robertson-Walker metric in the early Universe are obtained. We consider the hadronic phase, formed after the hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma, that means times from 10^{-6}s to 1s. The set of equations is derived and the behavior of the system is studied considering one approximate analytical solution.
