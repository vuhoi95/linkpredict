Title: Non-minimal derivative couplings and inflation in supergravity
Authors: Ioannis Dalianis and Fotis Farakos
Abstract: In this article we motivate and review the embedding of the gravitationally enhanced friction mechanism in supergravity. The very interesting feature is that inflationary models which utilize this mechanism drive inflation for a wider range of parameter values and predict lower values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
