Title: On the coupling of vector fields to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant
Authors: Juan C. Bueno Sanchez and Cesar A. Valenzuela-Toledo
Abstract: Inflationary models including vector fields have attracted a great deal of attention over the past decade. Such an interest owes to the fact that they might contribute to, or even be fully responsible for, the curvature perturbation imprinted in the CMB. However, the necessary breaking of the vector field's conformal invariance during inflation is not without problems. In recent years it has been realized that a number of instabilities endangering the consistency of the theory arise when the conformal invariance is broken by means of a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In this paper we consider a massive vector field non-minimally coupled to gravity through the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and investigate whether the vector can obtain a nearly scale-invariant perturbation spectrum while evading the emergence of perturbative instabilities. We find that the strength of the coupling must be extremely small if the vector field is to have a chance to contribute to the total curvature perturbation.
