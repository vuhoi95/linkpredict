Title: Residual Weyl symmetry out of conformal geometry and its BRS structure
Authors: Jordan Fran√ßois and Serge Lazzarini and Thierry Masson
Abstract: The conformal structure of second order in $m$-dimensions together with the so-called (normal) conformal Cartan connection, is considered as a framework for gauge theories. The dressing field scheme presented in a previous work amounts to a decoupling of both the inversion and the Lorentz symmetries such that the residual gauge symmetry is the Weyl symmetry. On the one hand, it provides straightforwardly the Riemannian parametrization of the normal conformal Cartan connection and its curvature. On the other hand, it also provides the finite transformation laws under the Weyl rescaling of the various geometric objects involved. Subsequently, the dressing field method is shown to fit the BRS differential algebra treatment of infinitesimal gauge symmetry. The dressed ghost field encoding the residual Weyl symmetry is presented. The related so-called algebraic connection supplies relevant combinations found in the literature in the algebraic study of the Weyl anomaly.
