Title: Can Back-Reaction Prevent Eternal Inflation?
Authors: Robert Brandenberger and Renato Costa and Guilherme Franzmann
Abstract: We study the effects which the back-reaction of long wavelength fluctuations exert on stochastic inflation. In the cases of power-law and Starobinsky inflation these effects are too weak to terminate the stochastic growth of the inflaton field. However, in the case of the cyclic Ekpyrotic scenario, the back-reaction effects prevent the unlimited growth of the scalar field.
