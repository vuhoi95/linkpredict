Title: Neutron stars in general second order scalar-tensor theory: the case of  non-minimal derivative coupling
Authors: Adolfo Cisterna and TÃ©rence Delsate and Massimiliano Rinaldi
Abstract: We consider the sector of Horndeski's gravity characterized by the coupling between the kinetic scalar field term and the Einstein tensor. We numerically construct neutron star configurations where the external geometry is identical to the Schwarzschild metric but the interior structure is considerably different from standard general relativity. We constrain the only parameter of this model from the requirement that compact configurations exist, and we argue that solutions less compact than neutron stars, such as white dwarfs, are also supported. Therefore, our model provides an explicit modification of general relativity that is astrophysically viable and does not conflict with Solar System tests.
