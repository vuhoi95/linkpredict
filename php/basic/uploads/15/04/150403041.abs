Title: Symplectic Dirac Equation
Authors: R. G. G. Amorim and S. C. Ulhoa and Edilberto O. Silva
Abstract: Symplectic unitary representations for the Poincar\'{e} group are studied. The formalism is based on the noncommutative structure of the star-product, and using group theory approach as a guide, a consistent physical theory in phase space is constructed. The state of a quantum mechanics system is described by a quasi-probability amplitude that is in association with the Wigner function. As a result, the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are derived in phase space. As an application, we study the Dirac equation with electromagnetic interaction in phase space.
