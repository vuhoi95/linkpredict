Title: On Holographic Non-relativistic Schwinger Effect
Authors: Kazem Bitaghsir Fadafan and Fateme Saiedi
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the Schwinger effect in strongly coupled theories with an anisotropic scaling symmetry in time and spatial direction. We consider Lifshitz and hyperscaling violation theories and use their gravity duals. It is shown that the shape of the potential barrier depends on the parameters of theory. One concludes that the production rate for the pair creation of particle and anti-particle will not be the same as the relativistic case.
