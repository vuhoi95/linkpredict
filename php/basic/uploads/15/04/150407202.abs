Title: Accidental KÃ¤hler Moduli Inflation
Authors: Anshuman Maharana and Markus Rummel and Yoske Sumitomo
Abstract: We study a model of accidental inflation in type IIB string theory where inflation occurs near the inflection point of a small K\"ahler modulus. A racetrack structure helps to alleviate the known concern that string-loop corrections may spoil K\"ahler Moduli Inflation unless having a significant suppression via the string coupling or a special brane setup. Also, the hierarchy of gauge group ranks required for the separation between moduli stabilization and inflationary dynamics is relaxed. The relaxation becomes more significant when we use the recently proposed D-term generated racetrack model.
