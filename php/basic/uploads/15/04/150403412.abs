Title: Constructing an Inflaton Potential by Mimicking Modified Chaplygin Gas
Authors: E. O. Kahya and B. Pourhassan and S. Uraz
Abstract: In this paper, we considered an inflationary model that effectively behaves as a modified Chaplygin gas in the context of quintessence cosmology. We reconstructed the inflaton potential bottom-up and using the recent observational data we fixed the free parameters of the model. We showed that the modified Chaplygin gas inspired model is suitable for both the early and the late time acceleration but has shortcomings between the two periods.
