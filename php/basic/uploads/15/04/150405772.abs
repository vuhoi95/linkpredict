Title: Critical Theory of Two-Dimensional Mott Transition: Integrability and  Hilbert Space Mapping
Authors: Federico L. Bottesi and Guillermo R. Zemba
Abstract: We reconsider the Mott transition in the context of a two-dimensional fermion model with density-density coupling. We exhibit a Hilbert space mapping between the original model and the Double Lattice Chern-Simons theory at the critical point by use of the representation theory of the q-oscillator and Weyl algebras. The transition is further characterized by the ground state modification. The explicit mapping provides a new tool to further probe and test the detailed physical properties of the fermionic lattice model considered here and to enhance our understanding of the Mott transition(s).
