Abstract: In this paper we study a real scalar field as a possible candidate to explain the dark matter in the universe. In the context of a free scalar field with quadratic potential, we have used Union 2.1 SN Ia observational data jointly with a Planck prior over the dark matter density parameter to set a lower limit on the dark matter mass as $m\geq0.12H_0^{-1}$ eV ($c=\hbar=1$). For the recent value of the Hubble constant indicated by the Hubble Space Telescope, namely $H_0=73\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, this leads to $m\geq1.56\times10^{-33}$ eV at 99.7\% c.l. Such value is much smaller than $m\sim 10^{-22}$ eV previously estimated for some models. Nevertheless, it is still in agreement with them once we have not found evidences for a upper limit on the scalar field dark matter mass from SN Ia analysis. In practice, it confirms free real scalar field as a viable candidate for dark matter in agreement with previous studies in the context of density perturbations, which include scalar field self interaction.
