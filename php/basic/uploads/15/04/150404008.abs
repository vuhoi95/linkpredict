Authors: S. Ghaffari and A. Sheykhi and M. H. Dehghani
Abstract: Many dark energy (DE) models have been proposed, in recent years, to explain acceleration of the Universe expansion. It seems necessary to discriminate the various DE models in order to check the viability of each model. Statefinder diagnostic is a useful method which can differentiate various DE models. In this paper, we investigate the statefinder diagnosis parameters for the holographic dark energy (HDE) model in two cosmological setup. First, we study statefinder diagnosis for HDE in the context of flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe in Einstein gravity. Then, we extend our study to the DGP braneworld framework. As system's IR cutoff we chose the Hubble radius and the Granda-Oliveros cutoff inspired by Ricci scalar curvature. We plot the evolution of statefinder parameres $\{r,s\}$ in terms of the redshift parameter $z$. We also compare the results with those obtained for statefinder diagnosis parameters of other DE models, in particular with $\Lambda$CDM model.
