Title: Yangian associated with 2D $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT
Authors: Rui-Dong Zhu and Yutaka Matsuo
Abstract: Recently, Maulik and Okounkov proposed an integrable lattice model where the degree of freedom at each site is identical to the Hilbert space of free boson in two dimensions. We give a brief review of their construction and explain the relation with $\mathcal{W}_n$ algebra and Calogero-Sutherland model. As a generalization, we examine the Yangian associated with $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra which describes a supersymmetric extension of Calogero-Sutherland model and compare it with the literature.
