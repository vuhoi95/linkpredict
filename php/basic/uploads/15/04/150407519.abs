Title: Effective field equation on m-brane embedded in n-dimensional bulk of  Einstein and f(R) gravity
Authors: Sumanta Chakraborty and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We have derived effective gravitational field equations on a lower dimensional hypersurface (known as a brane), placed in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime for both Einstein and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity theories. We have started our analysis on $n$-dimensional bulk from which the effective field equations on a $(n-1)$-dimensional brane has been obtained by imposing $Z_{2}$ symmetry. Subsequently, we have arrived at the effective equations in $(n-2)$-dimensions starting from the effective equations for $(n-1)$ dimensional brane. This analysis has been carried forward and is used to obtain the effective field equations in $(n-m)$-dimensional brane, embedded in a $n$-dimensional bulk. Having obtained the effective field equations in Einstein gravity, we have subsequently generalized the effective field equation in $(n-m)$-dimensional brane which is embedded the $n$-dimensional bulk spacetime endowed with $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity. We have also presented applications of our results in the context of Einstein and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity. In both the cases we have discussed vacuum static spherically symmetric solutions as well as solutions in cosmological context. Implications are also discussed.
