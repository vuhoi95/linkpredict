Title: Finiteness of the Coulomb gauge QCD perturbative effective action
Authors: A. Andrasi and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: At 2-loop order in the Coulomb gauge, individual Feynman graphs contributing to the effective action have energy divergences. It is proved that these cancel in suitable combinations of graphs. This has previously been shown only for transverse external fields. The calculation results in a generalization of the Christ-Lee term which was inserted into the Hamiltonian.
