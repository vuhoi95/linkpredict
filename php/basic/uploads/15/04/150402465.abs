Title: Generalised Structures for $\mathcal{N}=1$ AdS Backgrounds
Authors: Andr√© Coimbra and Charles Strickland-Constable
Abstract: We expand upon a claim made in a recent paper [arXiv:1411.5721] that generic minimally supersymmetric AdS backgrounds of warped flux compactifications of Type II and M theory can be understood as satisfying a straightforward weak integrability condition in the language of $E_{d(d)}\times\mathbb{R}^+$ generalised geometry. Namely, they are spaces admitting a generalised $G$-structure set by the Killing spinor and with constant singlet generalised intrinsic torsion.
