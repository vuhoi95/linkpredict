Title: Infinite matrix product states, boundary conformal field theory, and the  open Haldane-Shastry model
Authors: Hong-Hao Tu and Germ√°n Sierra
Abstract: We show that infinite Matrix Product States (MPS) constructed from conformal field theories can describe ground states of one-dimensional critical systems with open boundary conditions. To illustrate this, we consider a simple infinite MPS for a spin-1/2 chain and derive an inhomogeneous open Haldane-Shastry model. For the spin-1/2 open Haldane-Shastry model, we derive an exact expression for the two-point spin correlation function. We also provide an SU($n$) generalization of the open Haldane-Shastry model and determine its twisted Yangian generators responsible for the highly degenerate multiplets in the energy spectrum.
