Title: Two-loop renormalization of multiflavor $Ï†^3$ theory in six  dimensions and the trace anomaly
Authors: Benjamin Grinstein and Andreas Stergiou and David Stone and Ming Zhong
Abstract: We use the background-field method and the heat kernel to obtain all counterterms to two-loop order of conformally-coupled multiflavor $\phi^3$ theory in six spacetime dimensions, defined in curved spacetime and with spacetime-dependent couplings. We also include spacetime-dependent mass terms for completeness. We use these results to write a general expression for the trace anomaly. With the use of Weyl consistency conditions we are able to show that the strong $a$-theorem for a certain natural candidate quantity $\tilde{a}$ is violated in this theory, and obtain a three-loop expression for the coefficient $a$ of the Euler term in the anomaly.
