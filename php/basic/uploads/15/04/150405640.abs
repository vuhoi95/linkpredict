Title: Holographic entropy of Warped-AdS$_3$ black holes
Authors: Laura Donnay and Gaston Giribet
Abstract: We study the asymptotic symmetries of three-dimensional Warped Anti-de Sitter (WAdS) spaces in three-dimensional New Massive Gravity (NMG). For a specific choice of asymptotic boundary conditions, we find that the algebra of charges is infinite-dimensional and coincides with the semidirect sum of Virasoro algebra with non-vanishing central charge and an affine $\hat{u}(1)_k$ Ka\v{c}-Moody algebra. We show that the WAdS black hole configurations organize in terms of two commuting Virasoro algebras. We identify the Virasoro generators that expand the associated representations in the dual Warped Conformal Field Theory (WCFT) and, by applying the Warped version of the Cardy formula, we prove that the microscopic WCFT computation exactly reproduces the entropy of black holes in WAdS space.
