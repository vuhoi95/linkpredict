Title: Questing for Algebraic Mass Dimension One Spinor Fields
Authors: C. H. Coronado Villalobos and J. M. Hoff da Silva and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: This work deals with new classes of spinors of mass dimension one in Minkowski spacetime. In order to accomplish it, the Lounesto classification scheme and the inversion theorem are going to be used. The algebraic framework shall be revisited by explicating the central point performed by the Fierz aggregate. Then the spinor classification is generalized in order to encompass the new mass dimension one spinors. The spinor operator is shown to play a prominent role to engender the new mass dimension one spinors, accordingly.
