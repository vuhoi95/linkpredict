Title: Classical versus quantum completeness
Authors: Stefan Hofmann and Marc Schneider
Abstract: The notion of quantum-mechanical completeness is adapted to situations where the only adequate description is in terms of quantum field theory in curved space-times. It is then shown that Schwarzschild black holes, although geodesically incomplete, are quantum complete.
