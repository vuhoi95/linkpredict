Title: Relaxation of a Goldstino-like mode due to supersymmetry breaking in  Bose-Fermi mixtures
Authors: Hsin-Hua Lai and Kun Yang
Abstract: In the presence of nonrelativistic supersymmetry, a sharp fermionic collective mode similar to the Goldstino mode in high-energy physics was proposed to be realized in Bose-Fermi mixtures. The Goldstino mode is relaxed (a.k.a. decays) if supersymmetry is explicitly broken, which can be revealed as the broadening of the corresponding spectral function. We find that the situation shares many similarities with the electron spin resonance in magnetic systems and adopt the well-known Kubo-Tomita theory to perform a general analysis of the spectral function lineshape broadening of the Goldstino mode.
