Title: Primordial Gravitational Waves in Bimetric Gravity
Authors: Yuki Sakakihara and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We study primordial tensor power-spectra generated during inflation in bimetric gravity. More precisely, we examine a homogeneous expanding spacetime in a minimal bimetric model with an inflaton and calculate tensor perturbations on the homogeneous background under slow-roll approximation. In terms of the mass eigenstates, only the power-spectrum of the massless state remains constant and both the power-spectrum of the massive state and the cross power-spectrum rapidly decay during inflation. The amplitude of the physical power-spectrum is suppressed due to the flavor mixing. All power-spectra in the flavor eigenstates coincide with each other up to the first order of the slow-roll parameter.
