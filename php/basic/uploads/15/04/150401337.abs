Title: On large families of bundles over algebraic surfaces
Authors: C. Anghel and N. Buruiana
Abstract: The aim of this note is to construct sequences of vector bundles with unbounded rank and discriminant on an arbitrary algebraic surface. This problem, on principally polarized abelian varieties with cyclic Neron-Severi group generated by the polarization, was considered by Nakashima in connection with the Douglas-Reinbacher-Yau conjecture on the Strong Bogomolov Inequality. In particular we show that on any surface, the Strong Bogomolov Inequality $SBI_l$ is false for all $l>4$.
