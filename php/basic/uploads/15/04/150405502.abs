Title: Casimir operator dependences of non-perturbative fermionic QCD  amplitudes
Authors: H. M. Fried and T. Grandou and R. Hofmann
Abstract: In eikonal and quenched approximation, it is argued that the strong coupling fermionic QCD Green's functions and related amplitudes depart from a sole dependence on the SUc(3) quadratic Casimir operator, C2f, evaluated over the fundamental gauge group representation. Noticed in non-relativistic Quark Models and in a non-perturbative generalization of the Schwinger mechanism, an additional dependence on the cubic Casimir operator shows up, in contradistinction with perturbation theory and other non-perturbative approaches. However, it accounts for the full algebraic content of the rank-2 Lie algebra of SUc(3). Though numerically sub-leading effects, cubic Casimir dependences, here and elsewhere, appear to be a signature of the non-perturbative fermonic sector of QCD.
