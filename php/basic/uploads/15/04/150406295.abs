Title: Quantum-corrected self-dual black hole entropy in tunneling formalism  with GUP
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and F. A. Brito and E. Passos
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the Hamilton-Jacobi method to determine the entropy of a self-dual black hole by using linear and quadratic GUPs(generalized uncertainty principles). We have obtained the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of self-dual black holes and its quantum corrections that are logarithm and also of several other types.
