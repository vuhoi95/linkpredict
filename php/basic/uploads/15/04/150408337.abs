Title: Special Lagrangian torus fibrations of complete intersection Calabi-Yau  manifolds: a geometric conjecture
Authors: David R. Morrison and M. Ronen Plesser
Abstract: For complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds in toric varieties, Gross and Haase-Zharkov have given a conjectural combinatorial description of the special Lagrangian torus fibrations whose existence was predicted by Strominger, Yau and Zaslow. We present a geometric version of this construction, generalizing an earlier conjecture of the first author.
