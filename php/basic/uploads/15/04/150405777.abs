Title: Exact solutions of a two-dimensional Kemmer oscillator in the  gravitational field of cosmic string
Authors: Nadjette. Messai and Abdelmalek. Boumali
Abstract: The two dimensional Kemmer oscillator under the influence of the gravitational field produced by a topology such as the cosmic string spacetime and in the presence of a uniform magnetic field as well as without magnetic field are investigated.
