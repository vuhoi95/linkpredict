Title: The Hodge Operator Revisited
Authors: L. Castellani and R. Catenacci and P. A. Grassi
Abstract: We present a new construction for the Hodge operator for differential manifolds based on a Fourier (Berezin)-integral representation. We find a simple formula for the Hodge dual of the wedge product of differential forms, using the (Berezin)-convolution. The present analysis is easily extended to supergeometry and to non-commutative geometry.
