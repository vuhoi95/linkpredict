Title: Renyi Entropy of Free (2,0) Tensor Multiplet and its Supersymmetric  Counterpart
Authors: Jun Nian and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We compute the Renyi entropy and the supersymmetric Renyi entropy for the six-dimensional free (2,0) tensor multiplet. We make various checks on our results, and they are consistent with the previous results about the (2,0) tensor multiplet. As a by-product, we have established a canonical way to compute the Renyi entropy for p-form fields in d-dimensions.
