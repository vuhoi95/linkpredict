Title: Soft Theorems from String Theory
Authors: Paolo Di Vecchia and Raffaele Marotta and Matin Mojaza
Abstract: Soft behaviour of closed string amplitudes involving dilatons, gravitons and anti-symmetric tensors, is studied in the framework of bosonic string theory. The leading double soft limit of gluons is analysed as well, starting from scattering amplitudes computed in the open bosonic string. Field theory expressions are then obtained by sending the string tension to infinity. The presented results have been derived in the papers of Ref.[1].
