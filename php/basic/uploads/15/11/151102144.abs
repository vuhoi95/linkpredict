Title: WAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence in presence of bulk massive gravitons
Authors: Laura Donnay and Gaston Giribet
Abstract: In a previous paper, it has been shown that the entropy of non-extremal black holes in Warped Anti-de Sitter (WAdS) spaces in massive gravity can be computed microscopically in terms of a dual conformal field theory. Here, we extend this computation to a set of asymptotic boundary conditions that, while still gathering the WAdS$_3$ black holes, also allow for new solutions that are not locally equivalent to WAdS$_3$ space, and therefore are associated to the local degrees of freedom of the theory (bulk massive gravitons). After presenting explicit examples of such geometries, we compute the asymptotic charge algebra and show that it is generated by the semi-direct sum of Virasoro algebra and an affine Kac-Moody algebra. The value of the central charge turns out to be exactly the one that leads to reproduce the entropy of the WAdS$_3$ black holes. This result probes the WAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence in presence of bulk gravitons.
