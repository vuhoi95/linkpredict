Abstract: The effect of the minimal length on the thermal properties of a Dirac oscillator is considered. The canonical partition function is well determined by using the method based on Zeta Epstein function. Through this function, all thermodynamics properties, such as the free energy, the total energy, the entropy, and the specific heat, have been determined. Moreover, this study allows us to calculate the values of minimal length \triangle x=\hbar\sqrt{\beta} for some fermionic particles.
