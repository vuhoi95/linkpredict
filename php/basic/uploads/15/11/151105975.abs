Abstract: We study the color-decoration of higher-spin (anti)-de Sitter gravity in three dimensions. We show that the rainbow vacua, which we found recently for the colored gravity theory, also pertain in the colored higher-spin theory. The color singlet spin-two plays the role of first fundamental form (metric). The difference is that when spontaneous breaking of color symmetry takes place, the Goldstone modes of massless spin-two combine with all other spins and become the maximal-depth partially massless fields of the highest spin in the theory, forming a Regge trajectory.
