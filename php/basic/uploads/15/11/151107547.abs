Title: From Linear to Non-linear Supersymmetry via Functional Integration
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Anna Karlsson and Divyanshu Murli
Abstract: We derive a complete pure de Sitter supergravity action with non-linearly realized supersymmetry and its rigid limit, the Volkov-Akulov action, from the corresponding models with linear supersymmetry, by computing the path integral in the limit of infinite sgoldstino mass. In this, we use a non-Gaussian functional integration formula that was recently discovered in a derivation of de Sitter supergravity from the superconformal theory. We also present explicit examples of pure dS supergravity and the case with one matter multiplet. These two simple examples serve as a test and a demo of the universal action formula valid for de Sitter supergravities with general matter coupling.
