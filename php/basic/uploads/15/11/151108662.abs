Title: Wilson Lines and Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Galilean Conformal  Field Theories
Authors: Rudranil Basu and Max Riegler
Abstract: In this paper we will present in more detail a construction using Wilson lines and the corresponding dual Galilean conformal field theory calculations for analytically determining holographic entanglement entropy for flat space in $2+1$ dimensions first presented in hep-th/1410.4089. In addition we will show how the construction using Wilson lines can be expanded to flat space higher-spin theories and determine the thermal entropy of (spin-3 charged) flat space cosmologies using this approach.
