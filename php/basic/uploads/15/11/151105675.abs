Abstract: In the case of using the higher derivative regularization for $N=1$ SQED with $N_f$ flavors the loop integrals giving the $\beta$-function are integrals of double total derivatives in the momentum space. This feature allows to reduce one of the loop integrals to an integral of the $\delta$-function and to derive the NSVZ relation for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the bare coupling constant. In this paper we consider $N=1$ SQED with $N_f$ flavors regularized by the dimensional reduction in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$-scheme. Evaluating the scheme-dependent three-loop contribution to the $\beta$-function proportional to $(N_f)^2$ we find the structures analogous to integrals of the $\delta$-singularities. After adding the scheme-independent terms proportional to $(N_f)^1$ we obtain the known result for the three-loop $\beta$-function.
