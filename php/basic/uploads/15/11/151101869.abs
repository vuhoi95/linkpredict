Title: Two-dimensional manifold with point-like defects
Authors: Vakhid A. Gani and Alexander E. Dmitriev and Sergey G. Rubin
Abstract: We study a class of two-dimensional compact extra spaces isomorphic to the sphere $S^2$ in the framework of multidimensional gravitation. We show that there exists a family of stationary metrics that depend on the initial (boundary) conditions. All these geometries have a singular point. We also discuss the possibility for these deformed extra spaces to be considered as dark matter candidates.
