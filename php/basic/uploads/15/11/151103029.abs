Title: Quantum Fisher and Skew information for Unruh accelerated Dirac qubit
Authors: Subhashish Banerjee and Ashutosh Kumar Alok and S. Omkar
Abstract: We develop a Bloch vector representation of Unruh channel for a Dirac field mode. This is used to provide a unified, analytical treatment of quantum Fisher and Skew information for a qubit subjected to the Unruh channel, both in its pure form as well as in the presence of experimentally relevant external noise channels. The time evolution of Fisher and Skew information is studied along with the impact of external environment parameters such as temperature and squeezing. The external noises are modelled by both purely dephasing phase damping as well as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channels. An interesting interplay between the external reservoir temperature and squeezing on the Fisher and Skew information is observed, in particular, for the action of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel. It is seen that for some regimes, squeezing can enhance the quantum information against the deteriorating influence of the ambient environment. Similar features are also observed for the analogous study of Skew information, highlighting the similar origin of the Fisher and Skew information.
