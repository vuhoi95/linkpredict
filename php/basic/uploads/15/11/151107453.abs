Title: From black holes to flux throats: polarization can resolve the  singularity
Authors: Diego Cohen-Maldonado and Juan Diaz and Thomas Van Riet and Bert Vercnocke
Abstract: Supersymmetry-breaking is a key ingredient for string theory models to be phenomenologically viable. We review the strong analogy in the physics and the methods used for describing non-supersymmetric flux vacua and non-supersymmetric black holes in string theory. We also show how the polarized state could be the key to describing a well-behaved back-reaction of anti-branes in flux backgrounds, shedding a new light on a recent debate in the literature.
