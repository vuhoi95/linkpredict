Title: Black hole microstates in AdS$_4$ from supersymmetric localization
Authors: Francesco Benini and Kiril Hristov and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: This paper addresses a long standing problem, the counting of the microstates of supersymmetric asymptotically AdS black holes in terms of a holographically dual field theory. We focus on a class of asymptotically AdS$_4$ static black holes preserving two real supercharges which are dual to a topologically twisted deformation of the ABJM theory. We evaluate in the large $N$ limit the topologically twisted index of the ABJM theory and we show that it correctly reproduces the entropy of the AdS$_4$ black holes. An extremization of the index with respect to a set of chemical potentials is required. We interpret it as the selection of the exact R-symmetry of the superconformal quantum mechanics describing the horizon of the black hole.
