Abstract: We review the stabilisation of complex structure moduli in Type IIA orientifolds, especially on $T^6 / (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_6^\prime \times \Omega \mathcal{R})$ with discrete torsion, via deformations of $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold singularities. While D6-branes in SO(2N) and USp(2N) models always preserve supersymmetry and thus give rise to flat directions, in an exemplary Pati-Salam model with only U(N) gauge groups ten out of the 15 deformation moduli can be stabilised at the orbifold point.
