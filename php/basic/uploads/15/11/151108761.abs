Title: Associative Yang-Baxter equation for quantum (semi-)dynamical R-matrices
Authors: I. Sechin and A. Zotov
Abstract: In this paper we propose versions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation and higher order $R$-matrix identities which can be applied to quantum dynamical $R$-matrices. As is known quantum non-dynamical $R$-matrices of Baxter-Belavin type satisfy this equation. Together with unitarity condition and skew-symmetry it provides the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and a set of identities useful for different applications in integrable systems. The dynamical $R$-matrices satisfy the Gervais-Neveu-Felder (or dynamical Yang-Baxter) equation. Relation between the dynamical and non-dynamical cases is described by the IRF-Vertex transformation. An alternative approach to quantum (semi-)dynamical $R$-matrices and related quantum algebras was suggested by Arutyunov, Chekhov and Frolov (ACF) in their study of the quantum Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we prove that the ACF elliptic $R$-matrix satisfies the associative Yang-Baxter equation with shifted spectral parameters. Second, we directly prove a simple relation of the IRF-Vertex type between the Baxter-Belavin and the ACF elliptic $R$-matrices predicted previously by Avan and Rollet. It provides the higher order $R$-matrix identities and an explanation of the obtained equations through those for non-dynamical $R$-matrices. As a by-product we also get an interpretation of the intertwining transformation as matrix extension of scalar theta function likewise $R$-matrix is interpreted as matrix extension of the Kronecker function. Relations to the Gervais-Neveu-Felder equation and identities for the Felder's elliptic $R$-matrix are also discussed.
