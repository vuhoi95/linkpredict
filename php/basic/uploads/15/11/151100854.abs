Title: Maximal abelian and Curci-Ferrari gauges in momentum subtraction at  three loops
Authors: J. M. Bell and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: The vertex structure of QCD fixed in the maximal abelian gauge (MAG) and Curci-Ferrari gauge is analysed at two loops at the fully symmetric point for the 3-point functions corresponding to the three momentum subtraction (MOM) renormalization schemes. Consequently the three loop renormalization group functions are determined for each of these three schemes in each gauge using properties of the renormalization group equation.
