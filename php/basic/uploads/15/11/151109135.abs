Title: Effective Tolman temperature induced by trace anomaly
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Yongwan Gim and Wontae Kim
Abstract: Despite the finiteness of the renormalized stress tensor for a scalar field on a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in the Israel-Hartle-Hawking vacuum, the Tolman temperature defined in a proper frame in thermal equilibrium is certainly divergent on the horizon due to the infinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. We pose that the Tolman temperature to rest upon the traceless stress tensor appears incompatible with the renormalized stress tensor accommodating the trace anomaly responsible for the Hawking radiation. So we present a modified Stefan-Boltzmann law relating the renormalized stress tensor to a corresponding effective Tolman temperature. The effective Tolman temperature induced by the trace anomaly turns out to be finite everywhere outside the horizon, and so there does not appear infinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature any more. In particular, it is vanishing on the horizon, so that the equivalence principle is recovered at the horizon. Moreover, the present calculations support that the origin of the outgoing Hawking radiation is a near-horizon quantum region.
