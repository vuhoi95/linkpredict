Title: Twisting algebraically special solutions in five dimensions
Authors: Gabriel Bernardi de Freitas and Mahdi Godazgar and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: We determine the general form of the solutions of the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with cosmological constant for which (i) the Weyl tensor is everywhere type II or more special in the null alignment classification of Coley et al., and (ii) the $3 \times 3$ matrix encoding the expansion, shear and twist of the aligned null direction has rank 2. The dependence of the solution on 2 coordinates is determined explicitly, so the Einstein equation reduces to PDEs in the 3 remaining coordinates, just as for four-dimensional algebraically special solutions. The solutions fall into several families. One of these consists of warped products of four-dimensional algebraically special solutions. The others are new.
