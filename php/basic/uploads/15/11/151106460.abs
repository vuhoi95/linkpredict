Title: Thermodynamic Origin of the Null Energy Condition
Authors: Maulik Parikh and Andrew Svesko
Abstract: We derive the classical null energy condition, understood as a constraint on the Ricci tensor, from the second law of thermodynamics applied to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The derivation provides evidence that the null energy condition, which has usually been regarded as a condition on matter, is fundamentally a property of gravity.
