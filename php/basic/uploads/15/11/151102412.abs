Title: The relativity of Colour
Authors: Paul D Stack and Robert Delbourgo
Abstract: By attaching three anticommuting Lorentz scalar (colour) property coordinates to space-time, with an appropriate extended metric, we unify gravity with chromodynamics: gauge transformations then just correspond to coordinate transformations in the enlarged spacetime-property space.
