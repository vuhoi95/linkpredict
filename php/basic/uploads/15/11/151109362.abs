Abstract: Magnetic impurities are responsible for many interesting phenomena in condensed matter systems, notably the Kondo effect and quantum phase transitions. Here we present a holographic model of a magnetic impurity that captures the main physical properties of the large-spin Kondo effect. We estimate the screening length of the Kondo cloud that forms around the impurity from a calculation of entanglement entropy and show that our results are consistent with the g-theorem.
