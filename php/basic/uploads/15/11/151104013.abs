Title: Evanescent gravitons in Warped Anti-de Sitter space
Authors: Gaston Giribet and Yerko Vasquez
Abstract: Besides black holes, the phase space of three-dimensional massive gravity about Warped-Anti de Sitter (WAdS) space contains solutions that decay exponentially in time. They describe evanescent graviton configurations that, while governed by a wave equation with non-vanishing effective mass, do not carry net gravitational energy. Explicit examples of such solutions have been found in the case of Topologically Massive Gravity; here, we generalize them to a much more general ghost-free massive deformation, with the difference being that the decay rate gets corrected due to the presence of higher-order terms.
