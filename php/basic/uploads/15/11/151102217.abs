Title: Exact Bremsstrahlung and Effective Couplings
Authors: Vladimir Mitev and Elli Pomoni
Abstract: We calculate supersymmetric Wilson loops on the ellipsoid for a large class of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT using the localization formula of Hama and Hosomichi. From them we extract the radiation emitted by an accelerating heavy probe quark as well as the entanglement entropy following the recent works of Lewkowycz-Maldacena and Fiol-Gerchkovitz-Komargodski. Comparing our results with the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM ones, we obtain interpolating functions $f(g^2)$ such that a given $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT observable is obtained by replacing in the corresponding $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM result the coupling constant by $f(g^2)$. These "exact effective couplings" encode the finite, relative renormalization between the $\mathcal{N}=2$ and the $\mathcal{N}=4$ gluon propagator, they interpolate between the weak and the strong coupling. We discuss the range of their applicability.
