Title: Two-dimensional SCFTs from D3-branes
Authors: Francesco Benini and Nikolay Bobev and P. Marcos Crichigno
Abstract: We find a large class of two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs obtained by compactifying four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver gauge theories on a Riemann surface. We study these theories using anomalies and $c$-extremization. The gravitational duals to these fixed points are new AdS$_3$ solutions of IIB supergravity which we exhibit explicitly. Along the way we uncover a universal relation between the conformal anomaly coefficients of four-dimensional and two-dimensional SCFTs connected by an RG flow across dimensions. We also observe an interesting novel phenomenon in which the superconformal R-symmetry mixes with baryonic symmetries along the RG flow.
