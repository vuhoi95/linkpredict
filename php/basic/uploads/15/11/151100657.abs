Title: Grover search and the no-signaling principle
Authors: Ning Bao and Adam Bouland and Stephen P. Jordan
Abstract: Two of the key properties of quantum physics are the no-signaling principle and the Grover search lower bound. That is, despite admitting stronger-than-classical correlations, quantum mechanics does not imply superluminal signaling, and despite a form of exponential parallelism, quantum mechanics does not imply polynomial-time brute force solution of NP-complete problems. Here, we investigate the degree to which these two properties are connected. We examine four classes of deviations from quantum mechanics, for which we draw inspiration from the literature on the black hole information paradox. We show that in these models, the physical resources required to send a superluminal signal scale polynomially with the resources needed to speed up Grover's algorithm. Hence the no-signaling principle is equivalent to the inability to solve NP-hard problems efficiently by brute force within the classes of theories analyzed.
