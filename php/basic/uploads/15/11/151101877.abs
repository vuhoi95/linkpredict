Title: An alternative way to explain how non-commutativity arises in the  bosonic string theory
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and C. Neves
Abstract: In this work we will investigate how the non-commutativity arises into the string theory, \textit{i.e.}, how the bosonic string theory attaches to a D3-brane in the presence of magnetic fields. In order to accomplish the proposal, we departure from the commutative two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which after the application of the general Bopp's shifts Matrix Method, the non-commutative version of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is obtained. After that, this non-commutative harmonic oscillator will be mapped into the bosonic string theory in the light cone frame, which it now appears as a bosonic string theory attached to a D3-brane.
