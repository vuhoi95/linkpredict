Title: Shift-Symmetries at Higher Order
Authors: Steven Abel and Richard J. Stewart
Abstract: The fate of shift-symmetries in effective string models is considered beyond tree-level. Such symmetries have been proposed in the past as a way to maintain a hierarchically small Higgs mass and also play a role in schemes of cosmological relaxation. It is argued that on general grounds one expects shift-symmetries to be restored in the limit of certain asymmetric compactifications, to all orders in perturbation theory. This behaviour is verified by explicit computation of the Kaehler potential to one-loop order.
