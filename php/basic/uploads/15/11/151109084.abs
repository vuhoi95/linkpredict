Title: Polchinski's exact renormalisation group for tensorial theories:  Gaussian universality and power counting
Authors: Thomas Krajewski and Reiko Toriumi
Abstract: In this paper, we use the exact renormalisation in the context of tensor models and tensorial group field theories. As a byproduct, we rederive Gaussian universality for random tensors and provide a general power counting for Abelian tensorial field theories with a closure constraint, leading us to a only five renormalizable theories.
