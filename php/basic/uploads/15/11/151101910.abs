Title: Radiatively Induced Fermi Scale in Grand Unified Theories
Authors: Tommi Alanne and Aurora Meroni and Francesco Sannino and Kimmo Tuominen
Abstract: We consider Grand Unified Theories in which the hierarchy between the unification and the Fermi scale emerges radiatively. Within the Pati-Salam framework, we show that it is possible to construct a viable model where the Higgs is an elementary pseudo-Goldstone boson, and the correct hierarchy is generated.
