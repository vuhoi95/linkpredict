Title: Off-Shell CHY Amplitudes
Authors: C. S. Lam and York-Peng Yao
Abstract: The Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula for on-shell scattering amplitudes are extended off-shell. The off-shell amplitudes are M\"obius invariant, and have the same momentum poles as the on-shell amplitudes. The same technique is also used to obtain off-shell massive scalar and vector boson amplitudes.
