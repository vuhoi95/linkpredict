Title: Instanton Effects in Orientifold ABJM Theory
Authors: Sanefumi Moriyama and Takao Suyama
Abstract: We investigate another supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory called the orientifold ABJM theory, which replaces the unitary supergroup structure of the ABJM theory with an orthosymplectic one. Its non-perturbative structure is completely clarified by considering the duplication of the quiver.
