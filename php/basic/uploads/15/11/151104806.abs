Title: Nonthermal Spectrum of Hawking Radiation
Authors: Yu-Lei Feng and Yi-Xin Chen
Abstract: We show that for the thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation black hole's information loss paradox may still be present, even if including the entanglement information stored in the entangled Minkowski vacuum. And to avoid this inconsistency, the spectrum of Hawking radiation must be nonthermal. After reconsidering the derivation of Hawking effect, we find that the thermal spectrum is actually resulted from the geometric optics approximation in deriving the Bogolubov coefficients. When treated a little more accurately, we obtain some nonthermal spectrum for the Hawing radiation, which reduces to the thermal one in the geometric optics approximation.
