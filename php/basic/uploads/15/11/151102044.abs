Title: Off-trail SUSY
Authors: Karim Benakli and Luc Darm√©
Abstract: We present two distinct topics: I) We describe the propagation of a spin-3/2 state in a background which preserves invariance under space translations and rotations but not under Lorentz boost transformations. We start by building a generalisation of the Volkov-Akulov Lagrangian for a goldstino in a fluid. A super-Higgs mechanism leads to the modified Rarita-Schwinger Lagrangian describing a slow gravitino. We identify the physical propagating degrees of freedom and derive the corresponding equations of motion. This includes some new results. II) Fake Split Supersymmetry Models are proposed to alleviate some of the problems of the original Split SUSY. In particular it is no more necessary to restrict to a Mini-Split scenario as higher values of the supersymmetry breaking scale (Mega-Split) are now allowed. The FSSM relies on swapping the higgsinos for new states in identical gauge group representations but different Yukawa couplings.
