Title: Higgs boson production and decay in 5D warped models
Authors: Mariana Frank and Nima Pourtolami and Manuel Toharia
Abstract: We calculate the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson at the LHC in the context of general 5 dimensional (5D) warped scenarios with a spacetime background modified from the usual $AdS_5$, with SM fields propagating in the bulk. We extend previous work by considering the full flavor structure of the SM, and thus including all possible flavor effects coming from mixings with heavy fermions. We proceed in three different ways, first by only including two complete Kaluza-Klein (KK) levels ($15\times15$ fermion mass matrices), then including three complete KK levels ($21\times21$ fermion mass matrices) and finally we compare with the effect of including the infinite (full) KK towers. We present numerical results for the Higgs production cross section via gluon fusion and Higgs decay branching fractions in both the modified metric scenario and in the usual Randall-Sundrum metric scenario.
