Title: Large N meson propagators from twisted space-time reduced model
Authors: Antonio Gonz√°lez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a new method to calculate meson propagators in the large $N$ limit from twisted space-time reduced model. In this note, we give simulation details for obtaining meson spectra and discuss the smearing technique which should improve the signal of meson propagators in future works.
