Title: Pure contact term correlators in CFT
Authors: Loriano Bonora and Bruno Lima de Souza
Abstract: We discuss the case of correlators in CFT made of pure contact terms, without a corresponding bare part. We show two examples. The first is provided by the conformal limits of a free massive fermion theory in 3d. We show that the (conserved) current correlators are in one-to-one correspondence with the terms of the 3d gauge CS action. The second is the Pontryagin trace anomaly. The corresponding 3-point correlator is nonvanishing even though the corresponding untraced correlator vanishes.
