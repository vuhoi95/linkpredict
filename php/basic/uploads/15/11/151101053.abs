Title: Non-linear duality invariant partially massless models?
Authors: D. Cherney and S. Deser and A. Waldron and G. Zahariade
Abstract: We present manifestly duality invariant, non-linear, equations of motion for maximal depth, partially massless higher spins. These are based on a first order, Maxwell-like formulation of the known partially massless systems. Our models mimic Dirac-Born-Infeld theory but it is unclear whether they are Lagrangian.
