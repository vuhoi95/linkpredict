Title: Model building on the non-factorisable type IIA  $\bf{T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_4\timesÎ©\mathcal{R})}$ orientifold
Authors: Alexander Seifert and Gabriele Honecker
Abstract: We construct global semi-realistic supersymmetric models with intersecting D6-branes on the non-factorisable orientifold $T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_4\times\Omega\mathcal{R})$. The non-factorisable structure gives rise to differences compared to the factorisable case: additional conditions for the three-cycles to be Lagrangian and extra constraints on the wrapping numbers for building fractional cycles.
