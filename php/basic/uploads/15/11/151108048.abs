Title: Bounded orbits for photons as a consequence of extra dimensions
Authors: P. A. Gonzalez and Marco Olivares and Yerko Vasquez
Abstract: In this work, we study the geodesic structure for a geometry described by a spherically symmetric four-dimensional solution embedded into a five-dimensional space known as brane-based spherically symmetric solution. Mainly, we have found that the extra dimension contributes to the particle test mass, that we call the anomalous test mass, which is positive for photons. This fact implies that there are bounded orbits for the photons, like planetary and circular stable orbits that have not been observed for other geometries.
