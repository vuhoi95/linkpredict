Title: The IR Obstruction to UV Completion for Dante's Inferno Model with  Higher-Dimensional Gauge Theory Origin
Authors: Kazuyuki Furuuchi and Yoji Koyama
Abstract: We continue our investigation of large field inflation models obtained from higher-dimensional gauge theories, initiated in our previous study arXiv:1407.1951. We focus on Dante's Inferno model which was the most preferred model in our previous analysis. We point out the relevance of the IR obstruction to UV completion, which constrains the form of the potential of the massive vector field, under the current observational upper bound on the tensor to scalar ratio. We also show that in simple examples of the potential arising from DBI action of a D5-brane and that of an NS5-brane that the inflation takes place in the field range which is within the convergence radius of the Taylor expansion. This is in contrast to the well known examples of axion monodromy inflation where inflaton takes place outside the convergence radius of the Taylor expansion. This difference arises from the very essence of Dante's Inferno model that the effective inflaton potential is stretched in the inflaton field direction compared with the potential for the original field.
