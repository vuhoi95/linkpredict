Title: The effect of entanglement in gravitational photon-photon scattering
Authors: Dennis RÃ¤tzel and Martin Wilkens and Ralf Menzel
Abstract: The differential cross section for gravitational photon-photon scattering calculated in Perturbative Quantum Gravity is shown to depend on the degree of polarization entanglement of the two photons. The interaction between photons in the symmetric Bell state is stronger than between not entangled photons. In contrast, the interaction between photons in the anti-symmetric Bell state is weaker than between not entangled photons. The results are interpreted in terms of quantum interference, and it is shown how they fit into the idea of distance-dependent forces.
