Title: Thermodynamics of Cosmic Defect Network Evolution
Authors: P. P. Avelino and L. Sousa
Abstract: We show that simple thermodynamic conditions determine, to a great extent, the equation of state and dynamics of cosmic defects of arbitrary dimensionality. We use these conditions to provide a more direct derivation of the Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model for the macroscopic dynamics of topological defects of arbitrary dimensionality in a $N+1$-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic universe. We parameterize the modifications to the VOS model associated to the interaction of the topological defects with other fields, including, in particular, a new dynamical degree of freedom associated to the variation of the mass per unit $p$-area of the defects, and compute the corresponding scaling solutions. The observational impact of this new dynamical degree of freedom is also briefly discussed.
