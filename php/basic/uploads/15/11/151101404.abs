Title: Transfer Matrix Formulation of Scattering Theory in Two and Three  Dimensions
Authors: Farhang Loran and Ali Mostafazadeh
Abstract: In one dimension one can dissect a scattering potential $ v(x) $ into pieces $ v_i(x) $ and use the notion of the transfer matrix to determine the scattering content of $ v(x) $ from that of $ v_i(x) $. This observation has numerous practical applications in different areas of physics. The problem of finding an analogous procedure in dimensions larger than one has been an important open problem for decades. We give a complete solution for this problem and discuss some of its applications. In particular we derive an exact expression for the scattering amplitude of the delta-function potential in two and three dimensions and a potential describing a slab laser with a surface line defect. We show that the presence of the defect makes the slab begin lasing for arbitrarily small gain coefficients.
