Title: Friedmann cosmology in Regge-Teitelboim gravity
Authors: A. A. Sheykin and S. A. Paston
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the approach to gravity as a theory of a surface embedded in a flat ambient space. After the brief review of the properties of original theory by Regge and Teitelboim we concentrate on its field-theoretic reformulation, which we call splitting theory. In this theory embedded surfaces are defined through the constant value surfaces of some set of scalar fields in high-dimensional Minkowski space. We obtain an exact expressions for this scalar fields in the case of Friedmann universe. We also discuss the features of quantisation procedure for this field theory.
