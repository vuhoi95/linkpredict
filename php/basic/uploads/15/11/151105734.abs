Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Sudhakar Panda
Abstract: In this article, our prime objective is to study the inflationary paradigm from generalized tachyon (GTachyon) living on the world volume of a non-BPS string theory. The tachyon action is considered here is getting modified compared to the original action. One can quantify the amount of the modification via a power $q$ instead of $1/2$ in the effective action. Using this set up we study inflation from various types of tachyonic potentials, using which we constrain the index $q$ within, $1/2<q<2$, Regge slope $\alpha^{'}$, string coupling constant $g_{s}$ and mass scale of tachyon $M_s$, from the recent Planck 2015 and Planck+BICEP2/Keck Array joint data. We explicitly study the inflationary consequences from single field, assisted field and multi-field tachyon set up. Specifically for single field and assisted field case we derive the results in the quasi-de-Sitter background in which we will utilize the details of cosmological perturbations and quantum fluctuations. Also we derive the expressions for all inflationary observables using any arbitrary vacuum and Bunch-Davies vacuum. For single field and assisted field case we derive-the inflationary flow equations, new sets of consistency relations. Also we derive the field excursion formula for tachyon, which shows that assisted inflation is in more safer side compared to the single field case to validate effective field theory framework. Further we study the features of CMB Angular power spectrum from TT, TE and EE correlations from scalar fluctuations within the allowed range of $q$ for each potentials from single field set-up. We also put constraints from the temperature anisotropy and polarization spectra, which shows that our analysis is consistent with the Planck 2015 data. Finally, using $\delta N$ formalism we derive the expressions for inflationary observables in the context of multi-field tachyons.
