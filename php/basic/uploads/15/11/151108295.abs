Title: Dynamical Restoration of Z_N Symmetry in SU(N)+Higgs Theories
Authors: Minati Biswal and Sanatan Digal and P. S. Saumia
Abstract: We study the Z_N symmetry in SU(N)+Higgs theories with the Higgs field in the fundamental representation. The distributions of the Polyakov loop show that the Z_N symmetry is explicitly broken in the Higgs phase. On the other hand, inside the Higgs symmetric phase the Polyakov loop distributions and other physical observables exhibit the Z_N symmetry. This effective restoration of the Z_N symmetry changes the nature of the confinement-deconfinenement transition. We argue that the Z_N symmetry will lead to time independent topological defect solutions in the Higgs symmetric deconfined phase which will play important role at high temperatures.
