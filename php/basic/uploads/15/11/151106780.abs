Abstract: The quantization of two-dimensional Ho\v{r}ava theory of gravity without the projectability condition is considered. Our study of the Hamiltonian structure of the theory shows that there are two first-class and two second-class constraints. Then, following Dirac we quantize the theory by first requiring that the two second-class constraints be strongly equal to zero. This is carried out by replacing the Poisson bracket by the Dirac bracket. The two first-class constraints give rise to the Wheeler-DeWitt equations, which yield uniquely a plane-wave solution for the wavefunction. We also study the classical solutions of the theory and find that the characteristics of classical spacetimes are encoded solely in the phase of the plane-wave solution in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the foliations $t =$Constant, where $t$ denotes the globally-defined time of the theory.
