Title: Chiral $p\pm ip$ superfluid on a sphere
Authors: Sergej Moroz and Carlos Hoyos and Leo Radzihovsky
Abstract: We consider a spinless fermionic $p\pm ip$ superfluid living on a two-dimensional sphere. Using superfluid hydrodynamics we show that the ground state necessarily exhibits topological defects: either a pair of elementary vortices or a domain wall between $p\pm ip$ phases. In the topologically nontrivial BCS phase we identify the chiral fermion modes localized on the topological defects and compute their low-energy spectrum.
