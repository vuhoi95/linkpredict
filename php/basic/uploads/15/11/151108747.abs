Title: New modes from higher curvature corrections in holography
Authors: Steffen Aksteiner and Yegor Korovin
Abstract: In gravitational theories involving higher curvature corrections the metric describes additional degrees of freedom beyond the graviton. Holographic duality maps these to operators in the dual CFT. We identify infinite families of theories for which these new modes cannot be truncated and the usual Fefferman-Graham expansion needs to be modified. New massive gravity in three dimensions and critical gravity in four dimensions are particular representatives of these families. We propose modified expansion, study the near-boundary behaviour of the metric and derive fall-off properties of the additional modes in theories involving higher derivative corrections.
