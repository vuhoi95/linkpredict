Title: Double-Trace Deformations and Entanglement Entropy in AdS
Authors: Taiki Miyagawa and Noburo Shiba and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We compute the bulk entanglement entropy of a massive scalar field in a Poincare AdS with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition when we trace out a half space. Moreover, by taking into account the quantum back reaction to the minimal surface area, we calculate how much the entanglement entropy changes under a double-trace deformation of a holographic CFT. In the AdS3/CFT2 setup, our result agrees with the known result in 2d CFTs. In higher dimensions, our results offer holographic predictions.
