Title: Minisuperspace quantum supersymmetric cosmology (and its hidden  hyperbolic Kac-Moody structures)
Authors: Thibault Damour and Philippe Spindel
Abstract: This work summarises recent progress obtained by the mini-superpspace quantization of $\mathcal N=1$, $d=4$ supergravity, formulated in the framework of the Bianchi IX cosmological model. The emphasis is put on three main results : the completeness of the solution space obtained, the elements suggesting a hidden Kac-Moody structure of the theory and those leading to conjecture an avoidance of the cosmological singularity by some branches of the wave function of the Universe.
