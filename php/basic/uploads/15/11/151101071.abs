Title: Integration-by-parts reductions from unitarity cuts and algebraic  geometry
Authors: Kasper J. Larsen and Yang Zhang
Abstract: We show that the integration-by-parts reductions of various two-loop integral topologies can be efficiently obtained by applying unitarity cuts to a specific set of subgraphs and solving associated polynomial (syzygy) equations.
