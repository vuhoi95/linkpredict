Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of a real scalar field in the Finslerian Randers spacetime. The Randers spacetime is an anisotropic spacetime whose local Lorentz violation is driven by a background vector which changes the measurements of the intervals. We propose a dynamics for the scalar field in general Finsler spacetimes described by a minimal coupling of the scalar field and the Finsler metric. The coupling is intrinsically defined on the spacetime, and it yields a non-canonical kinetic term for the scalar field. In Randers spacetime, the nonlinear dynamics can be split into a linear and nonlinear regimes, which depend perturbatively on the even and odd powers of the Lorentz-violating parameter, respectively. For a timelike Randers background vector, the quadratic field Hamiltonian and the nonquadratic Hamiltonian up to second derivatives are positive, as well as the particle Hamiltonian. We analyse the plane waves solutions and the modified dispersion relations. In the linear regime, the modified quadratic dispersion relation is free of tachyons. In the nonlinear regime, the quartic dispersion relation obtained up to first-order in the Lorentz-violating parameter yields to ultraviolet superluminal signal which can be avoided by considering the perturbed equation of motion up to second-order.
