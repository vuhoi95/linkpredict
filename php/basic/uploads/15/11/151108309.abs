Title: Semi-Commutative Galois Extension and Reduced Quantum Plane
Authors: Viktor Abramov and Md. Raknuzzaman
Abstract: In this paper we show that a semi-commutative Galois extension of associative unital algebra by means of an element, whose Nth power is equal to the identity element of an algebra, where N is an integer greater or equal to two, induces a structure of graded q-differential algebra, where q is a primitive Nth root of unity. A graded q-differential algebra with differential d, whose Nth power is equal to zero, can be viewed as a generalization of graded differential algebra. The subalgebra of elements of degree zero and the subspace of elements of degree one of a graded q-differential algebra together with a differential d can be considered as a first order noncommutative differential calculus. In this paper we assume that we are given a semi-commutative Galois extension of associative unital algebra, then we show how one can construct the graded q-differential algebra and, when this algebra is constructed, we study its first order noncommutative differential calculus. We also study the subspaces of graded q-differential algebra of degree greater than one which we call the higher order noncommutative differential calculus induced by a semi-commutative Galois extension of associative unital algebra. Finally we show that a reduced quantum plane can be viewed as a semi-commutative Galois extension of a fractional one-dimensional space and we apply the noncommutative differential calculus developed in the previous sections to a reduced quantum plane.
