Title: Charged black strings in a five-dimensional Kasner universe
Authors: Hideki Ishihara and Masashi Kimura and Ken Matsuno
Abstract: We construct time-dependent charged black string solutions in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. In the far region, the spacetime approaches a five-dimensional Kasner universe with a expanding three-dimensional space and a shrinking extra dimension. Near the event horizon, the spacetime is approximately static and has a smooth event horizon. We also study the motion of test particles around the black string and show the existence of quasi-circular orbits. Finally, we briefly discuss the stability of this spacetime.
