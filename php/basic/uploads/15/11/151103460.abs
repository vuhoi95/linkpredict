Title: Sasakian manifolds and M-theory
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Andrea Santi
Abstract: We extend the link between Einstein Sasakian manifolds and Killing spinors to a class of $\eta$-Einstein Sasakian manifolds, both in Riemannian and Lorentzian settings, characterising them in terms of generalised Killing spinors. We propose a definition of supersymmetric M-theory backgrounds on such a geometry and find a new class of such backgrounds, extending previous work of Haupt, Lukas and Stelle.
