Title: Aspects of Ultra-Relativistic Field Theories via Flat-space Holography
Authors: Reza Fareghbal and Ali Naseh and Shahin Rouhani
Abstract: Recently it was proposed that asymptotically flat spacetimes have a holographic dual which is an ultra-relativistic conformal field theory. In this paper we study some aspects of these field theories by using flat space holography. We take the first steps to understand the subject of scale vs conformal symmetry in the ultra-relativistic field theories. We use conservation relation of the stress tensor (which is dictated from the bulk theory and is different from the standard relativistic one) to show that scale symmetry enlarges to full conformal symmetry in the absence of virial current. Also we obtain the conformal anomaly for such a theory via the flat-space holography technique. Furthermore, using flat-space holography we obtain a $C$-function for this theory which is monotonically decreasing from the UV to the IR by employing the null energy condition in the bulk.
