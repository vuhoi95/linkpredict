Title: Quantum Phase Transitions in the BKL Universe
Authors: Giulio D'Odorico and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the classical Bianchi I and Bianchi IX universes. The modified dynamics is well-motivated from the asymptotic safety program where the short-distance behavior of gravity is governed by a non-trivial renormalization group fixed point. The correction terms induce a phase transition in the dynamics of the model, changing the classical, chaotic Kasner oscillations into a uniform approach to a point singularity. The resulting implications for the microscopic structure of spacetime are discussed.
