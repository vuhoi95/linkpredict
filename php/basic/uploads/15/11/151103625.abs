Title: Three-point correlator of twist-2 light-ray operators in N=4 SYM in BFKL  approximation
Authors: Ian Balitsky and Vladimir Kazakov and Evgeny Sobko
Abstract: We present calculation of the correlation function of three twist-2 operators in the BFKL limit. The calculation is performed in N = 4 SYM but the result is valid in other gauge theories such as QCD. The obtained leading order structure constant is exact for any number of colors.
