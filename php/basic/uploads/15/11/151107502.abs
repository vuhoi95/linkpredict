Title: Dynamical Casimir effect in Circuit QED for Nonuniform Trajectories
Authors: Paulina Corona-Ugalde and Eduardo Martin-Martinez and C. M. Wilson and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the superconducting circuit simulation of the dynamical Casimir effect where we consider relativistically moving boundary conditions following different trajectories. We study the feasibility of the setup used in the past to simulate the dynamical Casimir effect to reproduce richer relativistic trajectories differing from purely sinusoidal ones. We show how different relativistic oscillatory trajectories of the boundaries of the same period and similar shape produce a rather different spectrum of particles characteristic of their respective motions.
