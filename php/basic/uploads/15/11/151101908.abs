Title: Towards a Theory of the QCD String
Authors: Sergei Dubovsky and Victor Gorbenko
Abstract: We construct a new model of four-dimensional relativistic strings with integrable dynamics on the worldsheet. In addition to translational modes this model contains a single massless pseudoscalar worldsheet field - the worldsheet axion. The axion couples to a topological density which counts the self-intersection number of a string. The corresponding coupling is fixed by integrability to $Q=\sqrt{7\over 16\pi}\approx 0.37$. We argue that this model is a member of a larger family of relativistic non-critical integrable string models. This family includes and extends conventional non-critical strings described by the linear dilaton CFT. Intriguingly, recent lattice data in $SU(3)$ and $SU(5)$ gluodynamics reveals the presence of a massive pseudoscalar axion on the worldsheet of confining flux tubes. The value of the corresponding coupling, as determined from the lattice data, is equal to $Q_L\approx0.38\pm0.04$.
