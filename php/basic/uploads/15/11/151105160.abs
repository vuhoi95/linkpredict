Title: The Skyrme model in the BPS limit
Authors: C. Adam and C. Naya and J. Sanchez-Guillen and R. Vazquez and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: In this review, we summarise the main features of the BPS Skyrme model which provides a physically well-motivated idealisation of atomic nuclei and nuclear matter: 1) it leads to zero binding energies for classical solitons (while realistic binding energies emerge owing to the semiclassical corrections, the Coulomb interaction and isospin breaking); 2) it describes a perfect non-barotropic fluid already at the microscopic (field theoretical) level which allows to study thermodynamics beyond the mean-field limit. These properties allow for an approximate but analytical calculation of binding energies of the most abundant nuclei, for a determination of the equation of state of skyrmionic matter (both in the full field theory and in a mean-field approximation) as well as the description of neutron stars as Skyrme solitons with a very good agreement with available observational data. All these results suggest that the proper low energy effective model of QCD should be close to the BPS Skyrme model in a certain sense (a "near-BPS Skyrme model"), with a prominent role played by the BPS part.
