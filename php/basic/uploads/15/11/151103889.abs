Title: Photons without vector fields
Authors: Ibrahim Burak Ilhan and Alex Kovner
Abstract: In this note we continue to pursue the question whether gauge theories can be represented in terms of effective "scalar" degrees of freedom. We provide such a consistent representation for a free photon theory in 3+1 dimensions. Building on results of [1] we construct a Lagrangian with a four derivative kinetic term, and demonstrate that despite seeming nonlinearity of the theory it is equivalent to a theory of a free photon.
