Authors: Carlo Ewerz and Ling Lin and Andreas Samberg and Konrad Schade
Abstract: We study the properties of heavy quarks as probes of strongly coupled plasmas with and without chemical potential by means of the gauge/gravity (AdS/CFT) duality. We compute the screening distance of a heavy quark-antiquark pair, its free energy, and the running coupling in large classes of non-conformal models arising as deformations of pure AdS space. We further investigate the energy loss of a heavy quark moving on a circular orbit as an example of an accelerated motion. These observables exhibit universal features independent of the deformation, pointing to strong-coupling universality. Our results should be relevant for processes involving heavy quarks and their bound states in the quark-gluon plasma, including the case of finite net baryon density.
