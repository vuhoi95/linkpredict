Title: The hyperbolic modular double and the Yang-Baxter equation
Authors: D. Chicherin and V. P. Spiridonov
Abstract: We construct a hyperbolic modular double -- an algebra lying in between the Faddeev modular double for $U_q(sl_2)$ and the elliptic modular double. The intertwining operator for this algebra leads to an integral operator solution of the Yang-Baxter equation associated with a generalized Faddeev-Volkov lattice model introduced by the second author. We describe also the L-operator and finite-dimensional R-matrices for this model.
