Title: One-loop Einstein-Hilbert term in minimally supersymmetric type IIB  orientifolds
Authors: Michael Haack and Jin U Kang
Abstract: We evaluate string one-loop contributions to the Einstein-Hilbert term in toroidal minimally supersymmetric type IIB orientifolds with D-branes. These have potential applications to the determination of quantum corrections to the moduli Kahler metric in these models.
