Title: Canonical Typicality of Energy Eigenstates of an Isolated Quantum System
Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Hong Liu
Abstract: Currently there are two main approaches to describe how quantum statistical physics emerges from an isolated quantum many-body system in a pure state: Canonical Typicality (CT) and Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). These two approaches has different but overlapping areas of validity, phenomenology and set of physical outcomes. In this paper we discuss the relation between CT and ETH and propose a formulation of ETH in terms of the reduced density matrix. We provide strong numerical evidences for the proposal.
