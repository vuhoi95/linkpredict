Title: Gravitational localization of scalar zero modes in SU(5) X Z2 branes
Authors: Nelson Pantoja and Rossana Rojas
Abstract: The fluctuations of 5D self-gravitating non-abelian kinks which arise from the breaking of the SU(5) X Z2 symmetric theory are analyzed within the context of brane-worlds. While tensor and vector sectors of these fluctuations behave like its counterparts in the standard abelian Z2 kinks, the mixing between the field excitations of the non-abelian kink and the scalar components of the metric makes the pure scalar sector of the theory very interesting. The spectrum of these scalar fluctuations, which includes gravitationally trapped massless modes on the core of the wall associated to the broken symmetries, is discussed for the two classes of kinks that break SU(5) to its maximal subgroups.
