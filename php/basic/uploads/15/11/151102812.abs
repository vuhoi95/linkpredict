Title: The Massless Spectrum of Heterotic Compactifications
Authors: Xenia de la Ossa and Edward Hardy and Eirik Eik Svanes
Abstract: We discuss the four-dimensional massless spectrum of supersymmetric Minkowski compactifications of ten-dimensional heterotic supergravity, including the anomaly cancelation condition. This can be calculated from restrictions arising from F-term conditions in a four-dimensional effective theory. The results agree with computations of the infinitesimal moduli space recently performed from a ten-dimensional perspective. The paper is based on a talk given by Eirik Eik Svanes in Leuven for the workshop on "The String Theory Universe".
