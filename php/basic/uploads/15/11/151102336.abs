Title: Impact of other scalar fields on oscillons after hilltop inflation
Authors: Stefan Antusch and Stefano Orani
Abstract: Oscillons are spatially localized and relatively stable field fluctuations which can form after inflation under suitable conditions. In order to reheat the universe, the fields which dominate the energy density after inflation have to couple to other degrees of freedom and finally produce the matter particles present in the universe today. In this study, we use lattice simulations in 2+1 dimensions to investigate how such couplings can affect the formation and stability of oscillons. We focus on models of hilltop inflation, where we have recently shown that hill crossing oscillons generically form, and consider the coupling to an additional scalar field which, depending on the value of the coupling parameter, can get resonantly enhanced from the inhomogeneous inflaton field. We find that three cases are realized: without a parametric resonance, the additional scalar field has no effects on the oscillons. For a fast and strong parametric resonance of the other scalar field, oscillons are strongly suppressed. For a delayed parametric resonance, on the other hand, the oscillons get imprinted on the other scalar field and their stability is even enhanced compared to the single-field oscillons.
