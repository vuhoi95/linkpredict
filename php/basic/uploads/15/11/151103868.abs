Title: ${\cal N} = 1$ Euler Anomaly Flow from Dilaton Effective Action
Authors: Vladimir Prochazka and Roman Zwicky
Abstract: We consider ${\cal N} =1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in the conformal window. The running of the gauge coupling is absorbed into the metric by applying a suitable matter superfield- and Weyl-transformation. The computation becomes equivalent to one of a free theory in a curved background carrying the information of the renormalisation group flow. We use the techniques of conformal anomaly matching and dilaton effective action, by Komargodski and Schwimmer, to rederive the difference of the Euler anomaly coefficient $\Delta a \equiv a_{\rm UV} - a_{\rm IR} $ for the ${\cal N} =1$ theory. The structure of $\Delta a $ is therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the Wess-Zumino dilaton action.
