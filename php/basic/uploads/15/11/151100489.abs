Title: Casimir Effect in Horava-Lifshitz-like theories
Authors: I. J. Morales Ulion and E. R. Bezerra de Mello and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper we consider a Lorentz-breaking scalar field theory within the Horava-Lifshtz approach. We investigate the changes that a space-time anisotropy produces in the Casimir effect. A massless real quantum scalar field is considered in two distinct situations: between two parallel plates and inside a rectangular two-dimensional box. In both cases we have adopted specific boundary conditions on the field at the boundary. As we shall see, the energy and the Casimir force strongly depends on the parameter associated with the breaking of Lorentz symmetry and also on the boundary conditions.
