Title: The general de Sitter supergravity component action
Authors: Marjorie Schillo and Ellen van der Woerd and Timm Wrase
Abstract: In this paper we review the appearance and utility of a nilpotent chiral multiplet in the context of supergravity, string theory and cosmology. Coupling a nilpotent chiral superfield to supergravity, one obtains what is called pure dS supergravity, a supergravity theory without scalar degrees of freedom that naturally has de Sitter (dS) solutions, and in which supersymmetry is non-linearly realized. We extend previous results that couple this dS supergravity to chiral and vector multiplets and derive the most general supergravity action for a single nilpotent chiral multiplet coupled to supergravity and an arbitrary number of chiral and vector multiplets.
