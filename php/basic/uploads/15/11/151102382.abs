Title: On the MÃ¶bius transformation in the entanglement entropy of fermionic  chains
Authors: F. Ares and J. G. Esteve and F. Falceto and A. R. de Queiroz
Abstract: There is an intimate relation between entanglement entropy and Riemann surfaces. This fact is explicitly noticed for the case of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians with finite range couplings. After recollecting this fact, we make a comprehensive analysis of the action of the M\"obius transformations on the Riemann surface. We are then able to uncover the origin of some symmetries and dualities of the entanglement entropy already noticed recently in the literature. These results give further support for the use of entanglement entropy to analyse phase transition.
