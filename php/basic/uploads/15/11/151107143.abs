Title: Tensor perturbations of $f(T)$-branes
Authors: Wen-Di Guo and Qi-Ming Fu and Yu-Peng Zhang and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: We explore the tensor perturbation of the $f(T)$ brane embedded in an AdS$_5$ spacetime. With the transverse-traceless condition, we get the tensor perturbation equation of the $f(T)$ brane and show that the stability of this brane system can be ensured. In addition, we take $ f(T)=T+\alpha T^2$ as an example to analyse the localization problem of the graviton zero mode. It is shown that the graviton zero mode can be localized on the brane.
