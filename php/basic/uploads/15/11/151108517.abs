Title: The KLT relations in unimodular gravity
Authors: Daniel J Burger and George F. R. Ellis and Jeff Murugan and Amanda Weltman
Abstract: With this article, we initiate a systematic study of some of the symmetry properties of unimodular gravity, building on much of the known structure of general relativity, and utilising the powerful technology developed in that context. In particular, we show, up to four-points and tree-level, that the KLT relations of perturbative gravity hold for tracefree or unimodular gravity.
