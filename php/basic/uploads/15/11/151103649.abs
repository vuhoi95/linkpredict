Title: Nonperturbative Regulator for Chiral Gauge Theories?
Authors: Dorota M. Grabowska and David B. Kaplan
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative gauge invariant regulator for d-dimensional chiral gauge theories on the lattice. The method involves simulating domain wall fermions in d + 1 dimensions with quantum gauge fields that reside on one d-dimensional surface and are extended into the bulk via gradient flow. The result is a theory of gauged fermions plus mirror fermions, where the mirror fermions couple to the gauge fields via a form factor that becomes exponentially soft with the separation between domain walls. The resultant theory has a local d-dimensional interpretation only if the chiral fermion representation is anomaly free. A physical realization of this construction would imply the existence of mirror fermions in the standard model that are invisible except for interactions induced by vacuum topology, and which could gravitate differently than conventional matter.
