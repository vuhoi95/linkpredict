Title: Constraints on Single-Field Inflation
Authors: David Pirtskhalava and Luca Santoni and Enrico Trincherini
Abstract: Many alternatives to canonical slow-roll inflation have been proposed over the years, one of the main motivations being to have a model, capable of generating observable values of non-Gaussianity. In this work, we (re-)explore the physical implications of a great majority of such models within a single, effective field theory framework (including novel models with large non-Gaussianity discussed for the first time below.) The constraints we apply---both theoretical and experimental---are found to be rather robust, determined to a great extent by just three parameters: the coefficients of the quadratic EFT operators $(\delta N)^2$ and $\delta N \delta E$, and the slow-roll parameter $\varepsilon$. This allows to significantly limit the majority of single-field alternatives to canonical slow-roll inflation. While the existing data still leaves some room for most of the considered models, the situation would change dramatically if the current upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreased down to $r < 10^{-2}$. Apart from inflationary models driven by plateau-like potentials, the single-field model that would have a chance of surviving this bound is the recently proposed slow-roll inflation with weakly-broken galileon symmetry. In contrast to \textit{canonical} slow-roll inflation, the latter model can support $r < 10^{-2}$ even if driven by a convex potential, as well as generate observable values for the amplitude of non-Gaussianity.
