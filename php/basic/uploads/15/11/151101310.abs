Title: Calabi-Yau modular forms in limit: Elliptic Fibrations
Authors: Babak Haghighat and Hossein Movasati and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We study the limit of Calabi-Yau modular forms, and in particular, those resulting in classical modular forms. We then study two parameter families of elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau fourfolds and describe the modular forms arising from the degeneracy loci. In the case of elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau threefolds our approach gives a mathematical proof of many observations about modularity properties of topological string amplitudes starting with the work of Candelas, Font, Katz and Morrison. In the case of Calabi-Yau fourfolds we derive new identities not computed before.
