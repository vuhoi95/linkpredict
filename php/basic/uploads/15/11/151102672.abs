Title: Mayer expansion of the Nekrasov pre potential: the subleading  $Îµ_2$-order
Authors: Jean-Emile Bourgine and Davide Fioravanti
Abstract: The Mayer cluster expansion technique is applied to the Nekrasov instanton partition function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N_c)$ super Yang-Mills. The subleading small $\epsilon_2$-correction to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limiting value of the prepotential is determined by a detailed analysis of all the one-loop diagrams. Indeed, several types of contributions can be distinguished according to their origin: long range interaction or potential expansion, clusters self-energy, internal structure, one-loop cyclic diagrams, etc.. The field theory result derived more efficiently in [1], under some minor technical assumptions, receives here definite confirmation thanks to several remarkable cancellations: in this way, we may infer the validity of these assumptions for further computations in the field theoretical approach.
