Title: The Pentabox Master Integrals with the Simplified Differential Equations  approach
Authors: Costas G. Papadopoulos and Damiano Tommasini and Christopher Wever
Abstract: We present the calculation of massless two-loop Master Integrals relevant to five-point amplitudes with one off-shell external leg and derive the complete set of planar Master Integrals with five on-mass-shell legs, that contribute to many $2\to 3$ amplitudes of interest at the LHC, as for instance three jet production, $\gamma, V, H +2$ jets etc., based on the Simplified Differential Equations approach.
