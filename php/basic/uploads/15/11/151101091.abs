Title: On the scattering of gluons in the GKP string
Authors: Lorenzo Bianchi and Marco S. Bianchi
Abstract: We compute the one-loop S-matrix for the light bosonic excitations of the GKP string at strong coupling. These correspond, on the gauge theory side, to gluon insertions in the GKP vacuum. We perform the calculation by Feynman diagrams in the worldsheet theory and we compare the result to the integrability prediction, finding perfect agreement for the scheme independent part. For scheme dependent rational terms we test different schemes and find that a recent proposal reproduces exactly the integrability prediction.
