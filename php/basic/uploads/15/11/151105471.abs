Title: Derivative expansion and the induced Chern-Simons term in N=1, d=3  superspace
Authors: F. S. Gama and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper we apply a supersymmetric generalization of the method of derivative expansion to compute the induced non-Abelian Chern-Simons term in $\mathcal{N}=1$, $d=3$ superspace, for an arbitrary gauge group.
