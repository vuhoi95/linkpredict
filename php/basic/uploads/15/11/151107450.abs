Title: Quantum Cosmology Near Two Dimensions
Authors: Teresa Bautista and Atish Dabholkar
Abstract: We consider a Weyl-invariant formulation of gravity with a cosmological constant in d-dimensional spacetime and show that near two dimensions the classical action reduces to the timelike Liouville action. We show that the renormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal quantum momentum tensor which satisfies theWard identities in a nontrivial way. The resulting evolution equations for an isotropic, homogeneous universe lead to a slowly decaying vacuum energy and a power-law expansion. We outline the implications for the cosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.
