Title: Thermodynamics of noncommutative high-dimensional AdS black holes with  non-Gaussian smeared matter distributions
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Zhen-Ming Xu
Abstract: Considering non-Gaussian smeared matter distributions, we investigate thermodynamic behaviors of the noncommutative high-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini anti-de Sitter black hole, and obtain the condition for the existence of extreme black holes. We indicate that the Gaussian smeared matter distribution, which is a special case of non-Gaussian smeared matter distributions, is not applicable for the 6- and higher-dimensional black holes due to the hoop conjecture. In particular, the phase transition is analyzed in detail. Moreover, we point out that the Maxwell equal area law maintains for the noncommutative black hole whose Hawking temperature is within a specific range, but fails for that whose the Hawking temperature is beyond this range.
