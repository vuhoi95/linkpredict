Title: N>=2 symmetric superpolynomials
Authors: L. Alarie-VÃ©zina and L. Lapointe and P. Mathieu
Abstract: The theory of symmetric functions has been extended to the case where each variable is paired with an anticommuting one. The resulting expressions, dubbed superpolynomials, provide the natural N=1 supersymmetric version of the classical bases of symmetric functions. Here we consider the case where two independent anticommuting variables are attached to each ordinary variable. The N=2 super-version of the monomial, elementary, homogeneous symmetric functions, as well as the power sums, are then constructed systematically (using an exterior-differential formalism for the multiplicative bases), these functions being now indexed by a novel type of superpartitions. Moreover, the scalar product of power sums turns out to have a natural N=2 generalization which preserves the duality between the monomial and homogeneous bases. All these results are then generalized to an arbitrary value of N. Finally, for N=2, the scalar product and the homogenous functions are shown to have a one-parameter deformation, a result that prepares the ground for the yet-to-be-defined N=2 Jack superpolynomials.
