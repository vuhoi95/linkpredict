Title: The Euclidean quantisation of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes
Authors: Piotr Chruściel and Michael Hörzinger
Abstract: We study the family of Einstein-Maxwell instantons associated with the Kerr-Newman metrics with a positive cosmological constant. This leads to a quantisation condition on the masses and charges of the resulting Euclidean solutions.
