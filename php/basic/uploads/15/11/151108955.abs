Title: Entanglement entropy at holographic interfaces
Authors: Michael Gutperle and John D. Miller
Abstract: In this note we calculate the holographic entanglement entropy in the presence of a conformal interface for a geometric configuration in which the entangling region ${\cal A}$ lies on one side of the interface. For the supersymmetric Janus solution we find exact agreement between the holographic and CFT calculation of the entanglement entropy.
