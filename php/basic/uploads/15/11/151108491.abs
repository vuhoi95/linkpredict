Title: Exact Zero Vacuum Energy in twisted SU(N) Principal Chiral Field
Authors: Sebastien Leurent and Evgeny Sobko
Abstract: We present a finite set of equations for twisted PCF model. At the special twist in the root of unity we demonstrate that the vacuum energy is exactly zero at any size L. Also in SU(2) case we numerically calculate the energy of the single particle state with zero rapidity, as a function of L.
