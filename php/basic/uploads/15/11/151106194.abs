Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Mohammad M. Qaemmaqami and Ali Naseh and Ahmad Shirzad
Abstract: We study holographic renormalization of 3D minimal massive gravity using the Chern-Simons-like formulation of the model. We explicitly present Gibbons- Hawking term as well as all counterterms needed to make the action finite in terms of dreibein and spin-connection. This can be used to find correlation functions of stress tensor of holographic dual field theory.
