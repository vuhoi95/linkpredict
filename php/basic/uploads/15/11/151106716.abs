Title: One-Loop Soft Theorems via Dual Superconformal Symmetry
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Edward Hughes and Bill Spence and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We study soft theorems at one loop in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory through finite order in the infrared regulator and to subleading order in the soft parameter {\delta}. In particular, we derive a universal constraint from dual superconformal symmetry, which we use to bootstrap subleading log {\delta} behaviour. Moreover, we determine the complete infrared-finite subleading soft contribution of n-point MHV amplitudes using momentum twistors. Finally, we compute the subleading log {\delta} behaviour of one-loop NMHV ratio functions at six and seven points, finding that universality holds within but not between helicity sectors.
