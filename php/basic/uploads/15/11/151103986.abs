Title: Brane solutions sourced by a scalar with vanishing potential and  classification of scalar branes
Authors: M. Cadoni and E. Franzin and M. Serra
Abstract: We derive exact brane solutions of minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity in d+2 dimensions with a vanishing scalar potential. The solutions are conformal to the Lifshitz spacetime and have several properties, which make them interesting for holographic applications. In particular, the dual QFT is characterized by hyperscaling violation. We show that our solutions, together with the AdS brane and the domain wall sourced by an exponential potential, give the complete list of scalar branes sourced by a generic potential having simple (scale-covariant) scaling symmetries. This allows us to give a complete classification of both simple and interpolating brane solution of minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity, which may be very useful for holographic applications.
