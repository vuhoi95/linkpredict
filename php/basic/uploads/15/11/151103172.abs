Title: Projecting the graviton to probe higher or lower dimensions
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and Spyridon Talaganis
Abstract: In this paper, we will discuss how in Einstein's theory a graviton can be enforced to probe fewer space-time dimensions in the deep ultraviolet (UV) as compared to far infrared (IR), and vice-versa. In particular, from a $D$ dimensional gravitational action in the IR we can project the $D$ dimensional graviton to probe only $2\leq N\leq D-1$ dimensions in the deep UV. Such projections of a graviton propagator can be thought of as an alternative to compactification. We will briefly explain the physical interpretation and consequences of such a dimensional transmutation.
