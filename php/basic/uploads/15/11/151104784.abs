Title: 10D Massive Type IIA Supergravities as the uplift of Parabolic M2-brane  Torus bundles
Authors: Maria Pikar Garcia del Moral and Alvaro Restuccia
Abstract: We remark that the two 10D massive deformations of the $N=2$ maximal type IIA supergravity (Romans and HLW supergravity) are associated to the low energy limit of the uplift to 10D of M2-brane torus bundles with parabolic monodromy linearly and non-linearly realized respectively. Romans supergravity corresponds to M2-brane compactified on a twice-punctured torus bundle.
