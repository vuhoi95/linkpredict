Title: Particle creation and annihilation at interior boundaries:  One-dimensional models
Authors: Stefan Keppeler and Martin Sieber
Abstract: We describe creation and annihilation of particles at external sources in one spatial dimension in terms of interior-boundary conditions (IBCs). We derive explicit solutions for spectra, (generalised) eigenfunctions, as well as Green functions, spectral determinants, and integrated spectral densities. Moreover, we introduce a quantum graph version of IBC-Hamiltonians.
