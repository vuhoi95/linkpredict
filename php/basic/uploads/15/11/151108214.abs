Title: 3D $Ï„_{RR}$-minimization in AdS$_4$ gauged supergravity
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Alessandra Gnecchi
Abstract: In this paper we propose the identification in AdS4 N = 2 gauged supergravity of the coefficient $\tau_{RR}$ of 3D N = 2 SCFTs. We constraint the structure of this function in supergravity by combining the results from unitarity, holography and localization. We show that our conjectured function is minimized by the exact R-charge, corresponding to a gravitational attractor for the scalars in the special geometry. We identify this mechanism with the supergravity dual of the $\tau_{RR}$-minimization. We check this proposal in the ABJM model, comparing with the expectations from localization and the AdS/CFT duality. We comment also on some possible relations with the black hole microstate counting, recently obtained from the application of localization techniques.
