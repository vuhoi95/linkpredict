Title: Higher dimensional holographic superconductors in Born-Infeld  electrodynamics with backreaction
Authors: Debabrata Ghorai and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: In this paper, we analytically investigate the properties of holographic superconductors in higher dimensions in the framework of Born-Infeld electrodynamics taking into account the backreaction of the spacetime using the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue method. In the background of pure Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, based on a perturbative approach, we obtain the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density. Higher value of the backreaction and Born-Infeld parameters result in a harder condensation to form in both cases. The analytical results are found to agree with the existing numerical results. We also derive an expression for the condensation operator in $d$-dimensions which yields the critical exponent to be $1/2$.
