Title: Gauge-Higgs Grand Unification
Authors: Yutaka Hosotani and Naoki Yamatsu
Abstract: Gauge-Higgs grand unification is formulated. By extending $SO(5) \times U(1)_X$ gauge-Higgs electroweak unification, strong interactions are incorporated in $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped space. Quarks and leptons are contained in spinor and vector multiplets of $SO(11)$. Although the KK scale can be as low as $10 $ TeV, proton decay is forbidden by a conserved fermion number in the absence of Majorana masses of neutrinos.
