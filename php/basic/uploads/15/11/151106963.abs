Title: RÃ©nyi entropy and the thermodynamic stability of black holes
Authors: Viktor G. Czinner and Hideo Iguchi
Abstract: Thermodynamic stability of black holes, described by the R\'enyi formula as equilibrium compatible entropy function, is investigated. It is shown that within this approach, asymptotically flat, Schwarzschild black holes can be in stable equilibrium with thermal radiation at a fixed temperature. This implies that the canonical ensemble exists just like in anti-de Sitter space, and nonextensive effects can stabilize the black holes in a very similar way as it is done by the gravitational potential of an anti-de Sitter space. Furthermore, it is also shown that a Hawking-Page-like black hole phase transition occurs at a critical temperature which depends on the $q$-parameter of the R\'enyi formula.
