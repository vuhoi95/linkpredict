Abstract: We present an investigation of spinning black holes in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet--dilaton (EGBd) theory. The solutions are found within a non-perturbative approach, by directly solving the field equations. These stationary axially symmetric black holes are asymptotically flat. They possess a non-trivial scalar field outside their regular event horizon. We present an overview of the parameter space of the solutions together with a study of their basic properties. We point out that the EGBd black holes can exhibit some physical differences when compared to the Kerr solution. For example, their mass is always bounded from below, while their angular momentum can exceed the Kerr bound, Also, in contrast to the Kerr case, the extremal solutions are singular, with the scalar field diverging on the horizon.
