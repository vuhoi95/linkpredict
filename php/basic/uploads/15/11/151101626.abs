Title: Universal Superspace Unitary Operator for Some Interesting Abelian  Models: Superfield Approach
Authors: T. Bhanja and N. Srinivas and R. P. Malik
Abstract: Within the framework of augmented version of superfield formalism, we derive the superspace unitary operator and show its usefulness in the derivation of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations for a set of interesting models for the Abelian 1-form gauge theories. These models are (i) a one (0+1)-dimensional (1D) toy model of a rigid rotor, (ii) the two (1+1)-dimensional (2D) modified versions of the Proca and anomalous Abelian 1-form gauge theories, and (iii) the 2D self-dual bosonic gauge field theory. We provide, in some sense, the alternatives to the horizontality condition (HC) and the gauge invariant restrictions (GIRs) in the language of the above superspace (SUSP) unitary operator. One of the key observations of our present endeavor is the result that the SUSP unitary operator and its hermitian conjugate are found to be the same for all the Abelian models under consideration (including the 4D interacting Abelian 1-form gauge theories with Dirac and complex scalar fields which have been discussed earlier). Thus, we establish the universality of the SUSP operator for the above Abelian theories.
