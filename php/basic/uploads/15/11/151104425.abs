Title: Quantum supersymmetric FRW cosmology with a scalar field
Authors: C. Ramírez and V. Vázquez-Báez
Abstract: We analyze the quantum supersymmetric cosmological FRW model with a scalar field, with a conditional probability density and the scalar field identified as time. The Hilbert space has a spinorial structure and there is only one consistent solution, with a conserved probability density. The dynamics of the scale factor is obtained from its mean value. The uncertainty relations are fulfilled and the corresponding fluctuations are consistent with a semiclassical Universe. We give two examples which turn out to have negative potential.
