Title: Relationship between Fujikawa's Method and the Background Field Method  for the Scale Anomaly
Authors: Chris L. Lin and Carlos R. Ordonez
Abstract: We show the equivalence between Fujikawa's method for calculating the scale anomaly and the diagrammatic approach to calculating the effective potential via the background field method, for an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory. Fujikawa's method leads to a sum of terms, each one superficially in one-to-one correspondence with a vacuum diagram of the 1-loop expansion. From the viewpoint of the classical action, the anomaly results in a breakdown of the Ward identities due to a scale-dependence of the couplings, whereas in terms of the effective action, the anomaly is the result of the breakdown of Noether's theorem due to explicit symmetry breaking terms of the effective potential.
