Title: Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for O(2N) sigma models with integrable diagonal  boundaries
Authors: Tamas Gombor and Laszlo Palla
Abstract: The finite volume problem of O(2N) sigma models with integrable diagonal boundaries on a finite interval is investigated. The double row transfer matrix is diagonalized by Algebraic Bethe Ansatz. The boundary Bethe Yang equations for the particle rapidities and the accompanying Bethe Ansatz equations are derived.
