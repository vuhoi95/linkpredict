Title: Scale invariant behavior in a large N matrix model
Authors: Rajamani Narayanan and Herbert Neuberger
Abstract: Eigenvalue distributions of properly regularized Wilson loop operators are used to study the transition from ultra-violet (UV) behavior to infra-red (IR) behavior in gauge theories coupled to matter that potentially have an IR fixed point (FP). We numerically demonstrate emergence of scale invariance in a matrix model that describes $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to two flavors of massless adjoint fermions in the large $N$ limit. The eigenvalue distribution of Wilson loops of varying sizes cannot be described by a universal lattice beta-function connecting the UV to the IR.
