Title: Equation for one-loop divergences in two dimensions and its application  to higher spin fields
Authors: H. P. Popova and K. V. Stepanyantz
Abstract: A simple formula for one-loop logarithmic divergences on the background of a two-dimensional curved space-time is derived for theories for which the second variation of the action is a nonminimal second order operator with small nonminimal terms. In particular, this formula allows to calculate terms which are integrals of total derivatives. As an application of the result, one-loop divergences for the higher spin fields on the constant curvature background are obtained in a nonminimal gauge, which depends on two parameters. By an explicit calculation we demonstrate that with the considered accuracy the result is gauge independent. Moreover, the result appeared to be independent of the spin $s$ for $s\ge 3$.
