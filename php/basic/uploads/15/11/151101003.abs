Title: Luminosity of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays and bounds on magnetic  luminosity of radio-loud active galactic nuclei
Authors: C. H. Coimbra-Ara√∫jo and R. C. Anjos
Abstract: We investigate the production of magnetic flux from rotating black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compare it with the upper limit of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR) luminosities, calculated from observed integral flux of GeV-TeV gamma rays for nine UHECR AGN sources. We find that, for the expected range of black hole rotations (0.44<a<0.80), the corresponding bounds of theoretical magnetic luminosities from AGNs coincides with the calculated UHECR luminosity. We argue that such result possibly can contribute to constrain AGN magnetic and dynamic properties as phenomenological tools to explain the requisite conditions to proper accelerate the highest energy cosmic rays.
