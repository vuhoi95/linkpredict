Title: Nernst branes with Lifshitz asymptotics in N=2 gauged supergravity
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and M. Haack and S. Nampuri
Abstract: We discuss two classes of non-supersymmetric interpolating solutions in N=2, D=4 gauged supergravity, that flow from either a z=2 Lifshitz geometry or a conformal AdS background to the near-horizon geometry of a Nernst brane. We obtain these solutions by constructing a z=2 supersymmetric Lifshitz solution in the STU model from a first-order rewriting of the action, then lifting it up to a five-dimensional background and subsequently modifying this five-dimensional solution by a two-parameter family of deformations. Under reduction, these give four-dimensional non-supersymmetric Nernst brane solutions. This is a step towards resolving the Lifshitz tidal force singularity in the context of N=2 gauged supergravity and suggests an approach to encoding the Nernst brane in terms of the Schroedinger symmetry group of the holographically dual field theory.
