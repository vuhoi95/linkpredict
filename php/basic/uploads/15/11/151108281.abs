Title: Fluids and vortex from constrained fluctuations around C-metric black  hole
Authors: Xin Hao and Bin Wu and Liu Zhao
Abstract: By foliating the four-dimensional C-metric black hole spacetime, we consider a kind of initial-value-like formulation of the vacuum Einstein's equation, the holographic inception data is a double consisting of the induced metric and the Brown-York energy momentum tensor on an arbitrary starter hypersurface. Then by perturbing the inception data that generates the background spacetime, it is shown that, in an appropriate limit, the fluctuation modes are governed by the continuity equation and the Cauchy momentum equation which describe the momentum transport in non-relativistic viscous fluid. Moreover, since the 2-dimensional near horizon hypersurface is always conformally flat, we can map the fluid system onto a flat Newtonian space and thus establishing yet another example of the Gravity/Flat space fluid correspondence found recently in our works. It turns out that the flat space fluid behaves as a pure vortex.
