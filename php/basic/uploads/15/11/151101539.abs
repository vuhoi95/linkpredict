Title: Worldsheet matter for electric flux strings
Authors: Daniel Ben-Zion and Diptarka Das and John McGreevy
Abstract: We develop a scheme to make exactly solvable gauge theories whose electric flux lines host (1+1)-dimensional topological phases. We use this exact `decorated-string-net' framework to construct several classes of interesting models. In particular, we construct an exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid whose (gapped) elementary excitations form doublets under an internal symmetry, and hence may be regarded as spin-carrying spinons. The model may be formulated, and is solvable, in any number of dimensions, on any bipartite graph. Another example, in any dimension, has $Z_2$ topological order and anyons which are Kramers' doublets of time reversal symmetry. Further, we make exactly solvable models of 3d topological paramagnets.
