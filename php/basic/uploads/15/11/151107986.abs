Title: Holographic Schwinger Effect in a D-Instanton Background
Authors: Majid Dehghani and Parvin Dehghani
Abstract: Schwinger effect in the presence of instantons will be considered here. Using AdS/CFT conjecture in the near horizon limit of D3-D(-1) background, we will calculate the potential between a quark-antiquark pair in an external electric field. It will be shown that the presence of instantons tend to suppress the pair creation effect. Another feature of this confining theory common with others, is the existence of a lower value of electric field that Schwinger effect can occur. We also investigate the profile of a trailing string in this background and the drag force excreted on it.
