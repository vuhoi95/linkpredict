Title: Rotating Black Holes and Coriolis Effect
Authors: Xiaoning Wu and Yi Yang and Pei-Hung Yuan and Chia-Jui Cho
Abstract: In this work, we consider the fluid/gravity correspondence for general rotating black holes. By using the Petrov-like boundary condition in near horizon limit, we study the correspondence between gravitational perturbation and fluid equation. We find that the dual fluid equation for rotating black holes contains a Coriolis force term, which is closely related to the angular velocity of the black hole horizon. This can be seen as a dual effect for the frame-dragging effect of rotating black hole under the holographic picture.
