Abstract: This paper discuss an intrinsic relation among congruent relations \cite{CLPZ}, cyclotomic expansion and Volume Conjecture for $SU(n)$ invariants. Motivated by the congruent relations for $SU(n)$ invariants obtained in our previous work \cite{CLPZ}, we study certain limits of the $SU(n)$ invariants at various roots of unit. First, we prove a new symmetry property for the $SU(n)$ invariants by using a symmetry of colored HOMFLYPT invariants. Then we propose some conjectural formulas including the cyclotomic expansion conjecture and volume conjecture for $SU(n)$ invariants (specialization of colored HOMFLYPT invariants). We also give the proofs of these conjectural formulas for the case of figure-eight knot.
