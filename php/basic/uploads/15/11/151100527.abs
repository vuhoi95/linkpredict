Title: Quasi-local conserved charges in Lorentz-diffeomorphism covariant theory  of gravity
Authors: H. Adami and M. R. Setare
Abstract: In this paper, using the combined Lorentz-diffeomorphism symmetry, we find a general formula for quasi-local conserved charge of the covariant gravity theories in first order formalism of gravity. We simplify the general formula for Lovelock theory of gravity. Afterwards, we apply the obtained formula on BHT gravity to obtain energy and angular momentum of the rotating OTT black hole solution in the context of this theory.
