Title: Holographic thermalization in a top-down confining model
Authors: B. Craps and E. J. Lindgren and A. Taliotis
Abstract: It is interesting to ask how a confinement scale affects the thermalization of strongly coupled gauge theories with gravity duals. We study this question for the AdS soliton model, which underlies top-down holographic models for Yang-Mills theory and QCD. Injecting energy via a homogeneous massless scalar source that is briefly turned on, our fully backreacted numerical analysis finds two regimes. Either a black brane forms, possibly after one or more bounces, after which the pressure components relax according to the lowest quasinormal mode. Or the scalar shell keeps scattering, in which case the pressure components oscillate and undergo modulation on time scales independent of the (small) shell amplitude. We show analytically that the scattering shell cannot relax to a homogeneous equilibrium state, and explain the modulation as due to a near-resonance between a normal mode frequency of the metric and the frequency with which the scalar shell oscillates.
