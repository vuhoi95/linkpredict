Title: Renormalizability of the Schr√∂dinger Functional
Authors: A. D. Kennedy and Stefan Sint
Abstract: Symanzik showed that quantum field theory can be formulated on a space with boundaries by including suitable surface interactions in the action to implement boundary conditions. We show that to all orders in perturbation theory all the divergences induced by these surface interactions can be absorbed by a renormalization of their coefficients.
