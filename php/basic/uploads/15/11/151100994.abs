Title: New Setting for Spontaneous Gauge Symmetry Breaking?
Authors: R. Jackiw and S. Y. Pi
Abstract: Over half century ago Carl Brans participated in the construction of a viable deformation of the Einstein gravity theory. Their suggestion involves expanding the tensor-based theory by a scalar field. But experimental support has not materialized. Nevertheless the model continues to generate interest and new research. The reasons for the current activity is described in this essay, which is dedicated to Carl Brans on his eightieth birthday.
