Title: Higher SPT's and a generalization of anomaly in-flow
Authors: Ryan Thorngren and Curt von Keyserlingk
Abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of bosons in $d$ spatial dimensions have been characterized by the action of the protecting global symmetry $G$ on their boundary. The symmetry acts on the boundary in a way that would be impossible to realize in a purely $d-1$ dimensional system i.e., without the bulk. This is often formalized by saying the $G$ symmetry is anomalous when the boundary theory is gauged. Simultaneously gauging the symmetry on the boundary and in the bulk yields a gauge-invariant composite system. One says there is an anomaly in-flow from the boundary to the bulk. Recently it has been appreciated that some anomalies are too severe to be regulated by an SPT bulk. These do not satisfy anomaly in-flow in the traditional sense. However, we show that these anomalous systems can be regulated as the symmetric boundaries of the newly discovered higher SPT phases. These higher SPT's are protected by a symmetry $d$-group, a higher categorical version of a group which can charge not just particles but also strings, volumes, etc. This structure emerges naturally from computation of the anomaly. One can interpret these severe anomalies as producing an emergent higher-form gauge field when $G$ is gauged, and this gauge field participates in the bulk topological action.
