Title: Fluctuations in horizon-fluid lead to negative bulk viscosity
Authors: Swastik Bhattacharya and S. Shankaranarayanan
Abstract: Einstein equations projected on to a black hole horizon gives rise to Navier-Stokes equations. Horizon-fluids typically possess unusual features like negative bulk viscosity and it is not clear whether a statistical mechanical description exists for such fluids. In this work, we provide an explicit derivation of the Bulk viscosity of the horizon-fluid based on the theory of fluctuations a la Kubo. The main advantage of our approach is that our analysis remains for the most part independent of the details of the underlying microscopic theory and hence the conclusions reached here are model independent. We show that the coefficient of bulk viscosity for the horizon-fluid matches exactly with the value found from the equations of motion for the horizon-fluid.
