Title: The holographic principle in general relativity: the case of Petrov type  D vacuum spacetimes
Authors: Rituparno Goswami and George F. R. Ellis
Abstract: We consider the holographic principle in the case of standard General relativity theory. We show that at least in the case of vacuum Petrov type D spacetimes that admit a non-trivial Killing tensor and which encompass all the astrophysical black hole spacetimes, it is equivalent to the null initial value theorem for general relativity.
