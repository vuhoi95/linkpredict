Title: Holographic superconductor in hyperscaling violation geometry with  Maxwell-dilaton coupling
Authors: Shao-Jun Zhang and Qiyuan Pan and Elcio Abdalla
Abstract: We re-investigate the holographic superconductor in hyperscaling violation geometry by considering the coupling between the probed Maxwell field and the background dilaton. We find that the phenomenon of superconductivity still exists, but with properties affected by such a coupling. The critical temperature decreases as the hyperscaling violation exponent is increased. The influence of the dynamical exponent on the critical temperature becomes complicated which depends on the mass of the probed scalar field and the hyperscaling violation exponent. The results of the frequency gap show a large deviation from the expected universal relation.
