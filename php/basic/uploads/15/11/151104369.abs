Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of lattice gauge theories from the local operational point of view, and, similar to Soni and Trivedi (arXiv:1510.07455), we show that the usual entanglement entropy for a spatial bipartition can be written as the sum of an undistillable gauge part and of another part corresponding to the LOCC distillable entanglement, which is obtained by depolarizing the local superselection sectors. We demonstrate that the distillable entanglement is zero for pure abelian gauge theories in the weak coupling limit, while it is in general nonzero for the nonabelian case. We also consider gauge theories with matter, and show in a perturbative approach how area laws -- including a topological correction -- emerge for the distillable entanglement.
