Title: Vortex in holographic two-band superfluid/superconductor
Authors: Mu-Sheng Wu and Shang-Yu Wu and Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We construct numerically static vortex solutions in a holographic model of two-band superconductor with an interband Josephson coupling in both the superfluid and superconductor regime. We investigate the effects of the interband coupling on the order parameter of each superconducting band in the vortex solution, and we find that it is different for each of the two bands. We compute also the free energy, critical magnetic field, magnetic penetration length and coherence lengths for the two bands, and we study their dependence on the interband coupling and temperature. Interestingly, we find that the coherence lengths of the two bands are close to identical.
