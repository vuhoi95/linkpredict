Title: KÃ¤hlerian Effective Potentials for Chern-Simons-Matter Theories
Authors: J. M. Queiruga and A. C. Lehum and Mir Faizal
Abstract: In this paper, we will calculate the effective potential for a theory of multiple M2-branes. As the theory of multiple M2-branes can be described by a Chern-Simons-matter theory, this will be done by calculating the K\"ahlerian effective potential for a Chern-Simons-matter theory. This calculation will be performed in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superspace formalism. We will initially study an Abelian Chern-Simons-matter theory, and then generalize those results to the full non-Abelian Chern-Simons-matter theory. We will obtain explicit expressions for the superpropagators for this theory. These superpropagators will be used to calculate the one-loop effective potential.
