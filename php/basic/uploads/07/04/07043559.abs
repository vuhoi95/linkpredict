Abstract: We discuss how all variant 10d and 11d maximal supergravities, including star supergravities and supergravities in different signatures, can be obtained as different real slices of three complex actions. As an application we study the recently introduced domain-wall/cosmology correspondence in this approach. We give an example in 9d and 10d where the domain-wall and corresponding cosmology can be viewed as different real slices of the same complex solution. We argue how in this case the pseudo-supersymmetry of the cosmological solutions can be understood as the invariance under supersymmetry of a variant supergravity.
