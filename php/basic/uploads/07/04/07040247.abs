Abstract: The supersymmetric solutions of N=2, D=4 minimal ungauged and gauged supergravity are classified according to the fraction of preserved supersymmetry using spinorial geometry techniques. Subject to a reasonable assumption in the 1/2-supersymmetric time-like case of the gauged theory, we derive the complete form of all supersymmetric solutions. This includes a number of new 1/4- and 1/2-supersymmetric possibilities, like gravitational waves on bubbles of nothing in AdS_4.
