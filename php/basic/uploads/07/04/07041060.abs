Title: Deformation of Dijkgraaf-Vafa Relation via Spontaneously Broken N=2  Supersymmetry
Authors: Hiroshi Itoyama and Kazunobu Maruyoshi
Abstract: It is known that the fermionic shift symmetry of the N=1, U(N) gauge model with a superpotential of an adjoint chiral superfield is replaced by the second (spontaneously broken) supersymmetry in the N=2, U(N) gauge model with a prepotential and Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters. Based on a diagrammatic analysis, we demonstrate how the well-known form of the effective superpotential in the former model is modified in the latter. A set of two equations on the one-point functions stating the Konishi anomaly is modified accordingly.
