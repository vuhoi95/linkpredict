Title: Gravitational Duality Transformations on (A)dS4
Authors: Robert G. Leigh and Anastasios C. Petkou
Abstract: We discuss the implementation of electric-magnetic duality transformations in four-dimensional gravity linearized around Minkowski or (A)dS4 backgrounds. In the presence of a cosmological constant duality generically modifies the Hamiltonian, nevertheless the bulk dynamics is unchanged. We pay particular attention to the boundary terms generated by the duality transformations and discuss their implications for holography.
