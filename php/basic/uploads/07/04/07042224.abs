Abstract: We consider the bosonic sector of a N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons-Higgs theory in 2+1 dimensions. The gauge group is U(1)xU(N) and has N_f flavors of fundamental matter fields. The model supports non-Abelian (axially symmetric) vortices when N_f\geq N, which have internal (orientational) moduli. When N_f > N, the solutions acquire additional collective coordinates parameterizing their transverse size. We solve the BPS equations numerically and obtain local (N_f = N) and semi-local (N_f > N) string solutions.
