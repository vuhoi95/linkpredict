Title: Comments on Charges and Near-Horizon Data of Black Rings
Authors: Kentaro Hanaki and Keisuke Ohashi and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We study how the charges of the black rings measured at the asymptotic infinity are encoded in the near-horizon metric and gauge potentials, independent of the detailed structure of the connecting region. Our analysis clarifies how different sets of four-dimensional charges can be assigned to a single five-dimensional object under the Kaluza-Klein reduction. Possible choices are related by the Witten effect on dyons and by the large gauge transformation in four and five dimensions, respectively.
