Title: Descent Relations in Cubic Superstring Field Theory
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and R. V. Gorbachev and P. B. Medvedev and D. V. Rychkov
Abstract: The descent relations between string field theory (SFT) vertices are characteristic relations of the operator formulation of SFT and they provide self-consistency of this theory. The descent relations <V_2|V_1> and <V_3|V_1> in the NS fermionic string field theory in the kappa and discrete bases are established. Different regularizations and schemes of calculations are considered and relations between them are discussed.
