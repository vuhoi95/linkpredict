Title: Classification of Supersymmetric Lattice Gauge Theories by Orbifolding
Authors: Poul H. Damgaard and So Matsuura
Abstract: We provide a general classification of supersymmetric lattice gauge theories that can be obtained from orbifolding of theories with four and eight supercharges. We impose at least one preserved supercharge on the lattice and Lorentz invariance in the naive continuum limit. Starting with four supercharges, we obtain one two-dimensional lattice gauge theory, identical to the one already given in the literature. Starting with eight supercharges, we obtain a unique three-dimensional lattice gauge theory and infinitely many two-dimensional lattice theories. They can be classified according to seven distinct groups, five of which have two preserved supercharges while the others have only one.
