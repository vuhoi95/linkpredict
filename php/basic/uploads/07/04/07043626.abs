Title: The Casimir Force in Randall Sundrum Models
Authors: Mariana Frank and Ismail Turan and Lorric Ziegler
Abstract: We discuss and compare the effects of one extra dimension in the Randall Sundrum models on the evaluation of the Casimir force between two parallel plates. We impose the condition that the result reproduce the experimental measurements within the known uncertainties in the force and the plate separation, and get an upper bound kR < 20 if the curvature parameter k of AdS_5 is equal to the Planck scale. Although the upper bound decreases as k decreases, kR ~ 12, which is the required value for solving the hierarchy problem, is consistent with the Casimir force measurements. For the case where the 5th dimension is infinite, the correction to the Casimir force is very small and negligible.
