Title: World-sheet scattering in AdS_5 x S^5 at two loops
Authors: T. Klose and T. McLoughlin and J. A. Minahan and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We study the AdS_5 x S^5 sigma-model truncated to the near-flat-space limit to two-loops in perturbation theory. In addition to extending previously known one-loop results to the full SU(2|2)^2 S-matrix we calculate the two-loop correction to the dispersion relation and then compute the complete two-loop S-matrix. The result of the perturbative calculation can be compared with the appropriate limit of the conjectured S-matrix for the full theory and complete agreement is found.
