Title: Shell-mediated tunnelling between (anti-)de Sitter vacua
Authors: Stefano Ansoldi and Lorenzo Sindoni
Abstract: We give an extensive study of the tunnelling between arbitrary (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes separated by an infinitesimally thin relativistic shell in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. In particular, we find analytically an exact expression for the tunnelling amplitude. The detailed spacetime structures that can arise are discussed, together with an effective "regularization scheme" for "before tunnelling" configurations.
