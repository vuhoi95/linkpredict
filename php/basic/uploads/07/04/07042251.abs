Title: Boundaries and the Casimir effect in non-commutative space-time
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Alessandro Gruppuso and Benjamin Harms and Octavian Micu
Abstract: We calculate modifications to the scalar Casimir force between two parallel plates due to space-time non-commutativity. We devise a heuristic approach to overcome the difficulties of describing boundaries in non-commutative theories and predict that boundary corrections are of the same order as non-commutative volume corrections. Further, both corrections have the form of more conventional finite surface effects.
