Title: Fermionic construction of partition function for multi-matrix models and  multi-component TL hierarchy
Authors: John Harnad and Alexander Yu. Orlov
Abstract: We use $p$-component fermions $(p=2,3,...)$ to present $(2p-2)N$-fold integrals as a fermionic expectation value. This yields fermionic representation for various $(2p-2)$-matrix models. Links with the $p$-component KP hierarchy and also with the $p$-component TL hierarchy are discussed. We show that the set of all (but two) flows of $p$-component TL changes standard matrix models to new ones.
