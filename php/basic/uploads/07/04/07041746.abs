Title: Tunnelling from black holes and tunnelling into white holes
Authors: Bhramar Chatterjee and A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: Hawking radiation is nowadays being understood as tunnelling through black hole horizons. Here, the extension of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to tunnelling for non-rotating and rotating black holes in different non-singular coordinate systems not only confirms this quantum emission from black holes but also reveals the new phenomenon of absorption into white holes by quantum mechanical tunnelling. The role of a boundary condition of total absorption or emission is also clarified.
