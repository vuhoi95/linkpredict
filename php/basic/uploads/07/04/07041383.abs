Title: How far is it to a sudden future singularity of pressure?
Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Tomasz Denkiewicz and Martin A. Hendry
Abstract: We discuss the constraints coming from current observations of type Ia supernovae on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of pressure (with the scale factor and the energy density regular). We show that such a sudden singularity may happen in the very near future (e.g. within ten million years) and its prediction at the present moment of cosmic evolution cannot be distinguished, with current observational data, from the prediction given by the standard quintessence scenario of future evolution. Fortunately, sudden future singularities are characterized by a momentary peak of infinite tidal forces only; there is no geodesic incompletness which means that the evolution of the universe may eventually be continued throughout until another ``more serious'' singularity such as Big-Crunch or Big-Rip.
