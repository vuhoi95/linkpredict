Title: Bouncing Universe with Quintom Matter
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Taotao Qiu and Yun-Song Piao and Mingzhe Li and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: The bouncing universe provides a possible solution to the Big Bang singularity problem. In this paper we study the bouncing solution in the universe dominated by the Quintom matter with an equation of state (EoS) crossing the cosmological constant boundary. We will show explicitly the analytical and numerical bouncing solutions in three types of models for the Quintom matter with an phenomenological EoS, the two scalar fields and a scalar field with a modified Born-Infeld action.
