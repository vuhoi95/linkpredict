Title: More supersymmetric Wilson loops
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Simone Giombi and Riccardo Ricci and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: We present a large new family of Wilson loop operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. For an arbitrary curve on the three dimensional sphere one can add certain scalar couplings to the Wilson loop so it preserves at least two supercharges. Some previously known loops, notably the 1/2 BPS circle, belong to this class, but we point out many more special cases which were not known before and could provide further tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
