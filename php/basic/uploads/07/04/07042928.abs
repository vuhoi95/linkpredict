Title: Higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants of the Grassmannian, and the  Pfaffian Calabi-Yau threefolds
Authors: Shinobu Hosono and Yukiko Konishi
Abstract: We solve Bershadsky-Cecotti-Ooguri-Vafa (BCOV) holomorphic anomaly equation to determine the higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants ($g \leq 5$) of the derived equivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds, which are of the appropriate codimensions in the Grassmannian Gr(2,7) and the Pfaffian Pf(7).
