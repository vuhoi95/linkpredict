Title: The 2d Gross-Neveu Model at Finite Temperature and Density with Finite  Corrections
Authors: Jean-Loic Kneur and Marcus Benghi Pinto and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: We use the linear $\delta$ expansion, or optimized perturbation theory, to evaluate the effective potential for the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature and density obtaining analytical equations for the critical temperature, chemical potential and fermionic mass which include finite $N$ corrections. Our results seem to improve over the traditional large-N predictions.
