Title: Cosmological Casimir effect with maximum planckian momentum and  accelerating universe
Authors: F. Briscese and A. Marciano
Abstract: We develop here a mechanism that, without making use of a cosmological constant, reproduces an accelerating universe. This is done by taking into account Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theory allows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution term to Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerous quantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to the existence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, together with the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentum dispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimir vacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universe expansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of the resulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state for Casimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongs to a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations. We emphasize that our result relies, once a fundamental length is introduced in Casimir effect, just on general arguments thus it is independent on an explicit form of the energy-momentum dispersion relation.
