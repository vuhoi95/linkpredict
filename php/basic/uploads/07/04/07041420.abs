Title: Renormalization of Hamiltonian QCD
Authors: A. Andrasi and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: We study to one-loop order the renormalization of QCD in the Coulomb gauge using the Hamitonian formalism. Divergences occur which might require counter-terms outside the Hamiltonian formalism, but they can be cancelled by a redefinition of the Yang-Mills electric field.
