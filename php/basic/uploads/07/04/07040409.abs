Title: On the over-barrier reflection in quantum mechanics with multiple  degrees of freedom
Authors: D. G. Levkov and A. G. Panin and S. M. Sibiryakov
Abstract: We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system, where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflection changes non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain "optimal" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially larger probability than at other energies.
