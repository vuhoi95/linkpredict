Title: Fermionic approach to the evaluation of integrals of rational symmetric  functions
Authors: John Harnad and Alexander Yu. Orlov
Abstract: We use the fermionic construction of two-matrix model partition functions to evaluate integrals over rational symmetric functions. This approach is complementary to the one used in the paper ``Integrals of Rational Symmetric Functions, Two-Matrix Models and Biorthogonal Polynomials'' \cite{paper2}, where these integrals were evaluated by a direct method.
