Title: An Exact Bosonization Rule for c=1 Noncritical String Theory
Authors: N. Ishibashi and A. Yamaguchi
Abstract: We construct a string field theory for c=1 noncritical strings using the loop variables as the string field. We show how one can express the nonrelativistic free fermions which describes the theory, in terms of these string fields.
