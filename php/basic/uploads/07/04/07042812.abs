Title: Fermions in Self-dual Vortex Background on a String-like Defect
Authors: Yu-Xiao Liu and Li Zhao and Xin-Hui Zhang and Yi-Shi Duan
Abstract: By using the self-dual vortex background on extra two-dimensional Riemann surfaces in 5+1 dimensions, the localization mechanism of bulk fermions on a string-like defect with the exponentially decreasing warp-factor is obtained. We give the conditions under which localized spin 1/2 and 3/2 fermions can be obtained.
