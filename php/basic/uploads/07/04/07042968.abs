Title: Are Bosonic Replicas Faulty?
Authors: Vladimir Al. Osipov and Eugene Kanzieper
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing discussion about a seeming asymmetry in the performance of fermionic and bosonic replicas, we present an exact, nonperturbative approach to zero-dimensional replica field theories belonging to the broadly interpreted "beta=2" Dyson symmetry class. We then utilise the formalism developed to demonstrate that the bosonic replicas do correctly reproduce the microscopic spectral density in the QCD inspired chiral Gaussian unitary ensemble. This disproves the myth that the bosonic replica field theories are intrinsically faulty.
