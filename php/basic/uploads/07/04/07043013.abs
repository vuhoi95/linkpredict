Title: On the Universal Tachyon and Geometrical Tachyon
Authors: J. Kluson and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study properties of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in the background of k NS5-branes, with one transverse direction compactified on a circle, from the point of view of Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We present the analysis of two different embedding of non-BPS D(p+1)-brane in given background and study the classical solutions of given world-volume theory. We argue for the configuration of a non-BPS D(p+1)-brane which allows us to find solutions of the equations of motion that give unified descriptions of G and U-type branes.
