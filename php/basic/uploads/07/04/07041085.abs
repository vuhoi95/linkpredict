Title: Gauge Mediation in String Theory
Authors: Teruhiko Kawano and Hirosi Ooguri and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We show that a large class of phenomenologically viable models for gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking based on meta-stable vacua can be realized in local Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory.
