Title: Fermionic formulas for (1,p) logarithmic model characters in Î¦_{2,1}  quasiparticle realisation
Authors: B. Feigin and E. Feigin and I. Tipunin
Abstract: We give expressions for the characters of $(1,p)$ logarithmic conformal field models in the Gordon-type form. The formulas are obtained in terms of ``quasiparticles'' that are Virasoro $\Phi_{2,1}$ primary fields and generalize the symplectic fermions.
