Title: A dual lagrangian for non-Abelian tensor gauge fields
Authors: Jessica K. Barrett and George Savvidy
Abstract: For non-Abelian tensor gauge fields of the lower rank we have found an alternative expression for the field strength tensors, which transform homogeneously with respect to the complementary gauge transformations and allow us to construct the dual Lagrangian.
