Title: Quantum Effects in Black Holes from the Schwarzschild Black String?
Authors: Alessandro Fabbri and Giovanni Paolo Procopio
Abstract: The holographic conjecture for black holes localized on a 3-brane in Randall-Sundrum braneworld models RS2 predicts the existence of a classical 5D time dependent solution dual to a 4D evaporating black hole. After briefly reviewing recent criticism and presenting some difficulties in the holographic interpretation of the Gregory-Laflamme instability, we simulate some basic features of such a solution by studying null geodesics of the Schwarzschild black string, in particular those propagating nontrivially in the bulk, and using holographic arguments.
