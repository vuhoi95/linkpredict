Title: On a class of non-simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds
Authors: Vincent Bouchard and Ron Donagi
Abstract: We obtain a detailed classification for a class of non-simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds which are of potential interest for a wide range of problems in string phenomenology. These threefolds arise as quotients of Schoen's Calabi-Yau threefolds, which are fiber products over P1 of two rational elliptic surfaces. The quotient is by a freely acting finite abelian group preserving the fibrations. Our work involves a classification of restricted finite automorphism groups of rational elliptic surfaces.
