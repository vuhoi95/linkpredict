Title: Irreducible three-loop contributions to the pressure in Yang-Mills  thermodynamics
Authors: Dariush Kaviani and Ralf Hofmann
Abstract: In the effective theory for the deconfining phase of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics we compute estimates for the moduli of the irreducible three-loop diagrams contributing to the pressure. Our numerical results are in agreement with general expectations.
