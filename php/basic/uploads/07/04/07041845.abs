Title: The Lee-Wick Standard Model
Authors: Benjamin Grinstein and Donal O'Connell and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: We construct a modification of the standard model which stabilizes the Higgs mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections, using ideas originally discussed by Lee and Wick in the context of a finite theory of quantum electrodynamics. The Lagrangian includes new higher derivative operators. We show that the higher derivative terms can be eliminated by introducing a set of auxiliary fields; this allows for convenient computation and makes the physical interpretation more transparent. Although the theory is unitary, it does not satisfy the usual analyticity conditions.
