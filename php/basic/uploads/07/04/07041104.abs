Abstract: A four-dimensional Lorentz-breaking non-Abelian Chern-Simons like action is generated as a one-loop perturbative correction via an appropriate Lorentz-breaking coupling of the non-Abelian gauge field to the spinor field. This term is shown to be regularization dependent but nevertheless it can be found unambiguously in different regularization schemes at zero and finite temperature.
