Title: Electroweak Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance
Authors: Robert Foot and Archil Kobakhidze and Raymond R. Volkas
Abstract: We point out that it is possible to associate the electroweak Higgs boson with the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, thus resolving the hierarchy problem in a technically natural way. We illustrate this idea with two specific gauge models. Besides being consistent with all currently available experimental data, both models maintain the predictive power of the standard model, since the first model has only one additional parameter beyond the standard model, and the second has the same number of free parameters as the standard model.
