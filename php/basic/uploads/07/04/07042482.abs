Title: Effective SO Superpotential for N=1 Theory with N_f Fundamental Matter
Authors: Pravina Borhade and P. Ramadevi
Abstract: Motivated by the duality conjecture of Dijkgraaf and Vafa between supersymmetric gauge theories and matrix models, we derive the effective superpotential of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group SO(N_c) and arbitrary tree level polynomial superpotential of one chiral superfield in the adjoint representation and N_f fundamental matter multiplets. For a special point in the classical vacuum where the gauge group is unbroken, we show that the effective superpotential matches with that obtained from the geometric engineering approach.
