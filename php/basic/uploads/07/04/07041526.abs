Title: Proof of the Labastida-Marino-Ooguri-Vafa Conjecture
Authors: Kefeng Liu and Pan Peng
Abstract: Based on large N Chern-Simons/topological string duality, in a series of papers, J.M.F. Labastida, M. Marino, H. Ooguri and C. Vafa conjectured certain remarkable new algebraic structure of link invariants and the existence of infinite series of new integer invariants. In this paper, we provide a proof of this conjecture. Moreover, we also show these new integer invariants vanish at large genera.
