Title: Non-geometric fluxes as supergravity backgrounds
Authors: Fernando Marchesano and Waldemar Schulgin
Abstract: We consider examples of D=4 string theory vacua which, although globally non-geometric, admit a local description in terms of D=10 supergravity backgrounds. We analyze such backgrounds and find that the supersymmetry spinors vary non-trivially along the internal manifold, reproducing the interpolating supergravity solutions found by Frey and Grana. Finally, we propose a simple, local expression for non-geometric fluxes in terms of the internal spinors of the compactification.
