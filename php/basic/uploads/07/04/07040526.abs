Abstract: Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin (WKB) approximation for fractional systems is investigated in this paper using the fractional calculus. In the fractional case the wave function is constructed such that the phase factor is the same as the Hamilton's principle function "S". To demonstrate our proposed approach two examples are investigated in details.
