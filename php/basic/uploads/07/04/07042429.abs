Title: The Topological Theory of the Milnor Invariant $\barÎ¼(1,2,3)$
Authors: Lorenzo Leal and Jesus Pineda
Abstract: We study a topological Abelian gauge theory that generalizes the Abelian Chern-Simons one, and that leads in a natural way to the Milnor's link invariant $\bar{\mu}(1,2,3)$ when the classical action on-shell is calculated.
