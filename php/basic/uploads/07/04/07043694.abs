Title: On The Spectrum of Yang-Mills Theory in 2+1 Dimensions, Analytically
Authors: R. G. Leigh and D. Minic and A. Yelnikov
Abstract: We review our recent work on the glueball spectrum of pure Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions. The calculations make use of Karabali-Nair corner variables in the Hamiltonian formalism, and involve a determination of the leading form of the ground-state wavefunctional.
