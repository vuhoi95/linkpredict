Title: Cascading Quivers from Decaying D-branes
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Chethan Krishnan and Stanislav Kuperstein
Abstract: We use an argument analogous to that of Kachru, Pearson and Verlinde to argue that cascades in L^{a,b,c} quiver gauge theories always preserve the form of the quiver, and that all gauge groups drop at each step by the number M of fractional branes. In particular, we demonstrate that an NS5-brane that sweeps out the S^3 of the base of L^{a,b,c} destroys M D3-branes.
