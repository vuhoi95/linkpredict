Title: Callan-Symanzik method for $m$-axial Lifshitz points
Authors: Paulo R. S. Carvalho and Marcelo M. Leite
Abstract: We introduce the Callan-Symanzik method in the description of anisotropic as well as isotropic Lifshitz critical behaviors. Renormalized perturbation theories are defined by normalization conditions with nonvanishing masses and at zero external momenta. The orthogonal approximation is employed to obtain the critical indices $\eta_{L2}$, $\nu_{L2}$, $\eta_{L4}$ and $\nu_{L4}$ diagramatically at least up to two-loop order in the anisotropic criticalities. This approximation is also utilized to compute the exponents $\eta_{L4}$ and $\nu_{L4}$ in the isotropic case. Furthermore, we compute those exponents exactly for the isotropic behaviors at the same loop order. The results obtained for all exponents are in perfect agreement with those previously derived in the massless theories renormalized at nonzero external momenta.
