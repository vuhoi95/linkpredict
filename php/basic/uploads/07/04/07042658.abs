Abstract: The proof of the fact that there are no nontrivial, consistent cross-couplings that can be added between the Weyl graviton and the massless Rarita-Schwinger field is accomplished by means of a cohomological approach, based on the deformation of the solution to the master equation from the antifield-Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. The procedure developed here relies on the assumptions of locality, smoothness, (background) Lorentz invariance, Poincare invariance, and preservation of the number of derivatives with respect to each field (the last hypothesis was made only in antighost number zero).
