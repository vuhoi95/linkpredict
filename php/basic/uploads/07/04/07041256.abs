Abstract: The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore, quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally, such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation. The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number violating operators and R-parity violation.
