Title: Multiple scalar particle decay and perturbation generation
Authors: Ki-Young Choi and Jinn-Ouk Gong
Abstract: We study the evolution of the universe which contains a multiple number of non-relativistic scalar fields decaying into both radiation and pressureless matter. We present a powerful analytic formalism to calculate the matter and radiation curvature perturbations, and find that our analytic estimates agree with full numerical results within an error of less than one percent. Also we discuss the isocurvature perturbation between matter and radiation components, which may be detected by near future cosmological observations, and point out that it crucially depends on the branching ratio of the decay rate of the scalar fields and that it is hard to make any model independent predictions.
