Abstract: We present a method for generating new deformed solutions starting from systems of two real scalar fields for which defect solutions and orbits are known. The procedure generalizes the approach introduced in a previous work [Phys. Rev. D 66, 101701(R) (2002)], in which it is shown how to construct new models altogether with its defect solutions, in terms of the original model and solutions. As an illustration, we work out an explicit example in detail.
