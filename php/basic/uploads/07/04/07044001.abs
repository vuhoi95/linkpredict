Title: Warping and Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Jessie Shelton and Gonzalo Torroba
Abstract: We analyze supersymmetry breaking by anti-self-dual flux in the deformed conifold. This theory has been argued to be a dual realization of susy breaking by antibranes. As such, one might expect it to lead to a hierarchically small breaking scale, but only if the warp factor is taken into account. We verify this by explicitly computing the warp-modified moduli space metric. This leads to a new term, with a power-like divergence at the conifold point, which lowers the breaking scale. We finally point out various puzzles regarding the gauge theory interpretation of these results.
