Authors: Yi-hong Gao and Jonathan P. Shock and Wei-shui Xu and Ding-fang Zeng
Abstract: In this paper, we will consider the chiral symmetry breaking in the holographic model constructed from the intersecting brane configuration, and investigate the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with this symmetry breaking.
