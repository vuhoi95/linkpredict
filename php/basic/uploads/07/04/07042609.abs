Title: A-infinity structure on simplicial complexes
Authors: V. Dolotin and A. Morozov and Sh. Shakirov
Abstract: A discrete (finite-difference) analogue of differential forms is considered, defined on simplicial complexes, including triangulations of continuous manifolds. Various operations are explicitly defined on these forms, including exterior derivative and exterior product. The latter one is non-associative. Instead, as anticipated, it is a part of non-trivial A-infinity structure, involving a chain of poly-linear operations, constrained by nilpotency relation: (d + \wedge + m + ...)^n = 0 with n=2.
