Title: Constraints on Regge models from perturbation theory
Authors: Jorge Mondejar and Antonio Pineda
Abstract: We study the constraints that the operator product expansion imposes on large $N_c$ inspired QCD models for current-current correlators. We focus on the constraints obtained by going beyond the leading-order parton computation. We explicitly show that, assumed a given mass spectrum: linear Regge behavior in $n$ (the principal quantum number) plus corrections in $1/n$, we can obtain the logarithmic (and constant) behavior in $n$ of the decay constants within a systematic expansion in $1/n$. Our example shows that it is possible to have different large $n$ behavior for the vector and pseudo-vector mass spectrum and yet comply with all the constraints from the operator product expansion.
