Title: Spectral action on noncommutative torus
Authors: D. Essouabri and B. Iochum and C. Levy and A. Sitarz
Abstract: The spectral action on noncommutative torus is obtained, using a Chamseddine--Connes formula via computations of zeta functions. The importance of a Diophantine condition is outlined. Several results on holomorphic continuation of series of holomorphic functions are obtained in this context.
