Title: Phases of three dimensional large N QCD on a continuum torus
Authors: R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger and F. Reynoso
Abstract: It is established by numerical means that continuum large N QCD defined on a three dimensional torus can exist in four different phases. They are (i) confined phase; (ii) deconfined phase; (iii) small box at zero temperature and (iv) small box at high temperatures.
