Title: On the Non-relativistic Limit of Linear Wave Equations for Zero and  Unity Spin Particles
Authors: P. Yu. Moshin and J. L. Tomazelli
Abstract: The non-relativistic limit of the linear wave equation for zero and unity spin bosons of mass $m$ in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau representation is investigated by means of a unitary transformation, analogous to the Foldy-Wouthuysen canonical transformation for a relativistic electron. The interacting case is also analyzed, by considering a power series expansion of the transformed Hamiltonian, thus demonstrating that all features of particle dynamics can be recovered if corrections of order $1/m^{2}$ are taken into account through a recursive iteration procedure.
