Title: An Alternative Topological Field Theory of Generalized Complex Geometry
Authors: Noriaki Ikeda and Tatsuya Tokunaga
Abstract: We propose a new topological field theory on generalized complex geometry in two dimension using AKSZ formulation. Zucchini's model is $A$ model in the case that the generalized complex structuredepends on only a symplectic structure. Our new model is $B$ model in the case that the generalized complex structure depends on only a complex structure.
