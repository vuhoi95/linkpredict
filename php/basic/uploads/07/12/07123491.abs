Title: Gluon Scattering in Deformed N=4 SYM
Authors: Yaron Oz and Stefan Theisen and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: We consider gluon and gluino scattering amplitudes in large N beta-deformed N=4 SYM with real beta. A direct inspection of the planar diagrams shows that the scattering amplitudes to all orders in perturbation theory are the same as in the undeformed N=4 SYM theory. Using the dual sigma-model description, we find the same equality at strong coupling to all orders in the sigma-model loop expansion. Finally, we show that the same analysis holds for gluon scattering amplitudes in a three-parameter deformation of planar N=4 SYM that breaks all the supersymmetry.
