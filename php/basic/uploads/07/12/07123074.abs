Title: Lattice Actions for Yang-Mills Quantum Mechanics with Exact  Supersymmetry
Authors: Simon Catterall and Anosh Joseph
Abstract: We derive lattice actions for Yang-Mills quantum mechanics for models with $\cQ=4, 8$ and 16 supercharges which possess an exact supersymmetry at non-zero lattice spacing. These are obtained by dimensional reduction of twisted versions of the corresponding super Yang-Mills theories in $D=2, 3$ and 4 dimensions.
