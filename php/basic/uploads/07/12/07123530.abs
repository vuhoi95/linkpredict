Title: Deep inelastic structure functions from supergravity at small x
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: Deep inelastic structure functions can be calculated from supergravity when the Bjorken parameter $x$ satisfies $ x > 1/\sqrt{gN} $. We consider a gauge theory with very large 't Hooft coupling $gN$ in order to investigate the region $x << 1$. In this case the center of mass energy is large enough to increase the number of hadronic constituents of the final state. We calculate the structure functions in terms of the number of final hadronic constituents. At small $x$ we find a scaling law similar to geometric scaling but with $\gamma_s = 0.5 $ and $ \lambda = 1 $.
