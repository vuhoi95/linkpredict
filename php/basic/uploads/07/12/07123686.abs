Title: The fate of conformal symmetry in the non-linear Schr√∂dinger theory
Authors: M. O. de Kok and J. W. van Holten
Abstract: The free Schroedinger theory in d space dimensions is a non-relativistic conformal field theory. The interacting non-linear theory preserves this symmetry in specific numbers of dimensions at the classical (tree) level. This holds in particular for the Phi^4-theory in d = 2. We compute the full quantum corrections to the 4-point function to show that the symmetry is broken by an anomalous contribution proportional to the exact beta-function
