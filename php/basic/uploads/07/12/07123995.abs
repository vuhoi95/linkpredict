Title: BRST charge for nonlinear algebras
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and P. M. Lavrov
Abstract: We study the construction of the classical nilpotent canonical BRST charge for the nonlinear gauge algebras where a commutator (in terms of Poisson brackets) of the constraints is a finite order polynomial of the constraints.
