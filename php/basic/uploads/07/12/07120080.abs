Title: Universal Landauer conductance in chiral symmetric 2d systems
Authors: Daniel G. Barci and Luis E. Oxman
Abstract: We study transport properties of an arbitrarily shaped ultraclean graphene sheet, adiabatically connected to leads,composed by the same material. If the localized interactions do not destroy chiral symmetry, we show that the conductance is quantized, since it is dominated by the quasi one-dimensional leads. As an example, we show that smooth structural deformations of the graphene plane do not modify the conductance quantization.
