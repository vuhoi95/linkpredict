Title: Soliton solutions in relativistic field theories and gravitation
Authors: Joaquin Diaz-Alonso and Diego Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: We report on some recent results on a class of relativistic lagrangian field theories supporting non-topological soliton solutions and their applications in the contexts of Gravitation and Cosmology. We analyze one and many-components scalar fields and gauge fields.
