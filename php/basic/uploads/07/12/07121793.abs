Title: D-brane Instantons in 4D Supersymmetric String Vacua
Authors: Nikolas Akerblom and Ralph Blumenhagen and Dieter Lust and Maximilian Schmidt-Sommerfeld
Abstract: We review some aspects of D-instantons in intersecting D-brane models. In particular, we present applications of the recently proposed instanton calculus to computations of charged matter superpotential couplings and corrections to the gauge kinetic function in the low energy effective action of type IIA orientifolds. As an interesting byway, we also discuss how one-loop corrections to the gauge kinetic function can be deduced from gauge threshold corrections in the type IIA setting.
