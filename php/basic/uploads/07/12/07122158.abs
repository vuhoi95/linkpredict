Title: Extended su(2)_k and restricted U_q sl(2)
Authors: Ludmil Hadjiivanov and Paolo Furlan
Abstract: Global gauge symmetry becomes more intricate in low dimensional QFT. We survey the mathematical concepts leading to the relevant analogues of the (D=4) Doplicher-Haag-Roberts theory of superselection sectors and internal symmetry. We also review a recently uncovered duality between braid and quantum group representations in an extension of the chiral su(2)_k WZNW model for nonnegative integer level k.
