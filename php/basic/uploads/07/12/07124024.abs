Title: WKB Approximation in Noncommutative Gravity
Authors: Maja Buric and John Madore and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We consider the quasi-commutative approximation to a noncommutative geometry defined as a generalization of the moving frame formalism. The relation which exists between noncommutativity and geometry is used to study the properties of the high-frequency waves on the flat background.
