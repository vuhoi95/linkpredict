Title: Quantum corrections to the noncommutative kink
Authors: R. A. Konoplya and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We calculate quantum corrections to the mass of noncommutative phi^4 kink in (1+1) dimensions for intermediate and large values of the noncommutativity parameter theta. All one-loop divergences are removed by a mass renormalization (which is different from the one required in the topologically trivial sector). For large theta quantum corrections to the mass grow linearly with theta signaling about possible break down of the perturbative expansion.
