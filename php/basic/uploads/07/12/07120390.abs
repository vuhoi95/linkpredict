Title: Noncommutative Wess-Zumino-Witten actions and their Seiberg-Witten  invariance
Authors: Justo Lopez-Sarrion and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We analyze the noncommutative two-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten model and its properties under Seiberg-Witten transformations in the operator formulation. We prove that the model is invariant under such transformations even for the noncritical (non chiral) case, in which the coefficients of the kinetic and Wess-Zumino terms are not related. The pure Wess-Zumino term represents a singular case in which this transformation fails to reach a commutative limit. We also discuss potential implications of this result for bosonization.
