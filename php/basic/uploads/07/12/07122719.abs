Title: Horizons and Tunneling in the Euclidean False Vacuum
Authors: Kate Marvel and Neil Turok
Abstract: In the thin-wall approximation, the decay of a gravitating false vacuum to a lower-energy state is affected by the cosmological horizon structure in both spaces. The nucleation radius of a bubble of true vacuum depends on the surface tension of its boundary and equals the false vacuum cosmological horizon at a critical tension. We argue that there is no tunneling instanton solution beyond the critical tension and argue that there is therefore a bound on allowed membrane tension in theories which rely on semiclassical tunneling to relax the cosmological constant.
