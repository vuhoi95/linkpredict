Title: Oscillons and Domain Walls
Authors: Mark Hindmarsh and Petja Salmi
Abstract: Oscillons, extremely long-lived localized oscillations of a scalar field, are shown to be produced by evolving domain wall networks in quartic theory in two spatial dimensions. We study the oscillons in frequency space using the classical spectral function at zero momentum, and obtain approximate information of their velocity distribution. In order to gain some insight onto the dilute oscillon 'gas' produced by the domain walls, we prepare a denser gas by filling the simulation volume with oscillons boosted in random directions. We finish the study by revisiting collisions between oscillons and between an oscillon and a domain wall, showing that in the latter case they can pass straight through with minimal distortion.
