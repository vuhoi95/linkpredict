Title: Half-Twisted (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg Models
Authors: Ilarion V. Melnikov and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We compute correlators of chiral operators in (0,2) supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg theories. The class of theories and the correlators we study are relevant for extending and testing mirror symmetry away from the (2,2) locus. More generally, these methods provide alpha'-exact results about certain superpotential couplings in compactifications of the heterotic string.
