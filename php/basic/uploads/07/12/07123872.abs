Title: Restrictions over two-dimensional gauge models with Thirring-like  interaction
Authors: D. Dalmazi and A. de Souza Dutra
Abstract: Some years ago, it was shown how fermion self-interacting terms of the Thirring-type impact the usual structure of massless two-dimensional gauge theories [1]. In that work only the cases of pure vector and pure chiral gauge couplings have been considered and the corresponding Thirring term was also pure vector and pure chiral respectively, such that the vector (or chiral) Schwinger model should not lose its chirality structure due to the addition of the quartic interaction term. Here we extend this analysis to a generalized vector and axial coupling both for the gauge interaction and the quartic fermionic interactions. The idea is to perform quantization without losing the original structure of the gauge coupling. In order to do that we make use of an arbitrariness in the definition of the Thirring-like interaction.
