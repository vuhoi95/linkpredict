Title: The instability of intersecting fuzzy spheres
Authors: Takehiro Azuma and Subrata Bal and Jun Nishimura
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum stability of general configurations representing many fuzzy spheres in dimensionally reduced Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons models with and without supersymmetry. By performing one-loop perturbative calculations around such configurations, we find that intersecting fuzzy spheres are classically unstable in the class of models studied in this paper. We also discuss the large-N limit of the one-loop effective action as a function of the distance of fuzzy spheres. This shows, in particular, that concentric fuzzy spheres with different radii, which are identified with the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles, are perturbatively stable in the bosonic model and in the D=10 supersymmetric model.
