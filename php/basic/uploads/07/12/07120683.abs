Title: Loop Quantization of Polarized Gowdy Model on $T^3$: Classical Theory
Authors: Kinjal Banerjee and Ghanashyam Date
Abstract: The vacuum Gowdy models provide much studied, non-trivial midi-superspace examples. Various technical issues within Loop Quantum Gravity can be studied in these models as well as one can hope to understand singularities and their resolution in the loop quantization. The first step in this program is to reformulate the model in real connection variables in a manner that is amenable to loop quantization. We begin with the unpolarized model and carry out a consistent reduction to the polarized case. Carrying out complete gauge fixing, the known solutions are recovered.
