Title: Multiple Scattering Methods in Casimir Calculations
Authors: Kimball A. Milton and Jef Wagner
Abstract: Multiple scattering formulations have been employed for more than 30 years as a method of studying the quantum vacuum or Casimir interactions between distinct bodies. Here we review the method in the simple context of $\delta$-function potentials, so-called semitransparent bodies. (In the limit of strong coupling, a semitransparent boundary becomes a Dirichlet one.) After applying the method to rederive the Casimir force between two semitransparent plates and the Casimir self-stress on a semitransparent sphere, we obtain expressions for the Casimir energies between disjoint parallel semitransparent cylinders and between disjoint semitransparent spheres. Simplifications occur for weak and strong coupling. In particular, after performing a power series expansion in the ratio of the radii of the objects to the separation between them, we are able to sum the weak-coupling expansions exactly to obtain explicit closed forms for the Casimir interaction energy. The same can be done for the interaction of a weak-coupling sphere or cylinder with a Dirichlet plane. We show that the proximity force approximation (PFA), which becomes the proximity force theorem when the objects are almost touching, is very poor for finite separations.
