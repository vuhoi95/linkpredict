Title: Matrix Model Maps and Reconstruction of AdS SUGRA Interactions
Authors: Sera Cremonini and Robert de Mello Koch and Antal Jevicki
Abstract: We consider the question of reconstructing (cubic) SUGRA interactions in AdS/CFT. The method we introduce is based on the matrix model maps (MMP) which were previously successfully employed at the linearized level. The strategy is to start with the map for 1/2 BPS configurations which is exactly known (to all orders) in the hamiltonian framework. We then use the extension of the matrix model map with the corresponding Ward identities to completely specify the interaction. A central point in this construction is the non-vanishing of off-shell interactions (even for highest-weight states).
