Title: Two-Dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics: Two Fixed Centers of  Force
Authors: M. A. Gonzalez Leon and J. Mateos Guilarte and M. de la Torre Mayado
Abstract: The problem of building supersymmetry in the quantum mechanics of two Coulombian centers of force is analyzed. It is shown that there are essentially two ways of proceeding. The spectral problems of the SUSY (scalar) Hamiltonians are quite similar and become tantamount to solving entangled families of Razavy and Whittaker-Hill equations in the first approach. When the two centers have the same strength, the Whittaker-Hill equations reduce to Mathieu equations. In the second approach, the spectral problems are much more difficult to solve but one can still find the zero-energy ground states.
