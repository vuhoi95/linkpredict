Title: Duality Symmetric Strings, Dilatons and O(d,d) Effective Actions
Authors: David S. Berman and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We calculate the background field equations for the T-duality symmetric string building on previous work by including the effect of the Dilaton up to two-loops. Inclusion of the Dilaton allows us to obtain the full beta functionals of the duality symmetric sigma model. We are able to interpret the result in terms of a dimensionally reduced O(d,d) invariant target space effective action.
