Title: Generalised integrable Hubbard models
Authors: James Drummond and Giovanni Feverati and Luc Frappat and Eric Ragoucy
Abstract: We construct the XX and Hubbard-like models based on unitary superalgebras gl(N|M) generalizing Shastry's and Maassarani's approach. We introduce the R-matrix of the gl(N|M) XX-type model; the one of the Hubbard-like model is defined by "coupling" two independent XX models. In both cases, we show that the R-matrices satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We derive the corresponding local Hamiltonian in the transfer matrix formalism and we determine its symmetries. A perturbative calculation "\`a la Klein and Seitz" is performed. Some explicit examples are worked out. We give a description of the two-particle scattering.
