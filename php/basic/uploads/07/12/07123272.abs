Title: Half-Twisted Correlators from the Coulomb Branch
Authors: Jock McOrist and Ilarion V. Melnikov
Abstract: We compute correlators of chiral operators in half-twisted (0,2) supersymmetric gauged linear sigma models. Our results give simple algebraic formulas for a (0,2) generalization of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of compact toric varieties. We derive compact expressions for deformed quantum cohomology relations and apply our general method to several examples.
