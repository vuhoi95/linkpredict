Title: Enriques and Octonionic Magic Supergravity Models
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Sergio Ferrara
Abstract: We reconsider the Enriques Calabi Yau (FHSV) model and its string derivation and argue that the Octonionic magic supergravity theory admits a string interpretation closely related to the Enriques model. The uplift to D=6 of the Octonionic magic model has 16 abelian vectors related to the rank of Type I and Heterotic strings.
