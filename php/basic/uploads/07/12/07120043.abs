Title: Duality Orbits, Dyon Spectrum and Gauge Theory Limit of Heterotic String  Theory on T^6
Authors: Shamik Banerjee and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: For heterotic string theory compactified on T^6, we derive the complete set of T-duality invariants which characterize a pair of charge vectors (Q,P) labelling the electric and magnetic charges of the dyon. Using this we can identify the complete set of dyons to which the previously derived degeneracy formula can be extended. By going near special points in the moduli space of the theory we derive the spectrum of quarter BPS dyons in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory with simply laced gauge groups. The results are in agreement with those derived from field theory analysis.
