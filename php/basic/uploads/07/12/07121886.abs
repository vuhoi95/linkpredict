Title: Boundary form factors in finite volume
Authors: M. Kormos and G. Takacs
Abstract: We describe the volume dependence of matrix elements of local boundary fields to all orders in inverse powers of the volume. Using the scaling boundary Lee-Yang model as testing ground, we compare the matrix elements extracted from boundary truncated conformal space approach to exact form factors obtained using the bootstrap method. We obtain solid confirmation for the boundary form factor bootstrap, which is different from all previously available tests in that it is a non-perturbative and direct comparison of exact form factors to multi-particle matrix elements of local operators, computed from the Hamiltonian formulation of the quantum field theory.
