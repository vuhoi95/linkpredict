Title: Boundary Ring: a way to construct approximate NG solutions with polygon  boundary conditions: I. Z_n-symmetric configurations
Authors: H. Itoyama and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: We describe an algebro-geometric construction of polygon-bounded minimal surfaces in ADS_5, based on consideration of what we call the "boundary ring" of polynomials. The first non-trivial example of the Nambu-Goto (NG) solutions for Z_6-symmetric hexagon is considered in some detail. Solutions are represented as power series, of which only the first terms are evaluated. The NG equations leave a number of free parameters (a free function). Boundary conditions, which fix the free parameters, are imposed on truncated series. It is still unclear if explicit analytic formulas can be found in this way, but even approximate solutions, obtained by truncation of power series, can be sufficient to investigate the Alday-Maldacena -- BDS/BHT version of the string/gauge duality.
