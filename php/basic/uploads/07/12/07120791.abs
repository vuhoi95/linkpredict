Title: Microscopic Theory of Black Hole Superradiance
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Roberto Emparan and Alessandro Maccarrone
Abstract: We study how black hole superradiance appears in string microscopic models of rotating black holes. In order to disentangle superradiance from finite-temperature effects, we consider an extremal, rotating D1-D5-P black hole that has an ergosphere and is not supersymmetric. We explain how the microscopic dual accounts for the superradiant ergosphere of this black hole. The bound 0< omega < m Omega_H on superradiant mode frequencies is argued to be a consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics for the spin-carrying degrees of freedom in the dual CFT. We also compute the superradiant emission rates from both sides of the correspondence, and show their agreement.
