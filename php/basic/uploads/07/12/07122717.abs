Authors: A. Chatzistavrakidis and P. Manousselis and N. Prezas and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: In the present contribution we extend our previous work by considering the coset space dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein--Yang--Mills theories including scalar fluctuations as well as Kaluza--Klein excitations of the compactification metric and we describe the gravity-modified rules for the reduction of non-abelian gauge theories.
