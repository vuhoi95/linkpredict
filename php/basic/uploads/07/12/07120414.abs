Title: Instanton Calculus and Loop Operator in Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
Authors: Hiroaki Kanno and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: We compute one-point function of the glueball loop operator in the maximally confining phase of supersymmetric gauge theory using instanton calculus. In the maximally confining phase the residual symmetry is the diagonal U(1) subgroup and the localization formula implies that the chiral correlation functions are the sum of the contributions from each fixed point labeled by the Young diagram. The summation can be performed exactly by operator formalism of free fermions, which also featured in the equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of P^1. By taking the Laplace transformation of the glueball loop operator, we find an exact agreement with the previous results for the generating function (resolvent) of the glueball one-point functions.
