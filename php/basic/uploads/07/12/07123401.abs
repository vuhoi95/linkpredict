Title: The Noncommutative Geometry of the Quantum Projective Plane
Authors: Francesco D'Andrea and Ludwik Dabrowski and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: We study the spectral geometry of the quantum projective plane CP^2_q, a deformation of the complex projective plane CP^2, the simplest example of a spin^c manifold which is not spin. In particular, we construct a Dirac operator D which gives a 0^+ summable spectral triple, equivariant under U_q(su(3)). The square of D is a central element for which left and right actions on spinors coincide, a fact that is exploited to compute explicitly its spectrum.
