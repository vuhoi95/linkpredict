Title: Singularities of the Magnon Boundstate S-Matrix
Authors: Nick Dorey and Keisuke Okamura
Abstract: We study the conjectured exact S-matrix for the scattering of BPS magnon boundstates in the spin-chain description of planar N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills. The conjectured S-matrix exhibits both simple and double poles at complex momenta. Some of these poles lie parametrically close to the real axis in momentum space on the branch where particle energies are positive. We show that all such poles are precisely accounted for by physical processes involving one or more on-shell intermediate particles belonging to the known BPS spectrum.
