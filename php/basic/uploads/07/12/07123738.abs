Title: Comments on Multiple M2-branes
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Neil Lambert
Abstract: Recently a three-dimensional field theory was derived that is consistent with all the symmetries expected of the worldvolume action for multiple M2-branes. In this note we examine several physical predictions of this model and show that they are in agreement with expected M2-brane dynamics. In particular, we discuss the quantization of the Chern-Simons coefficient, the vacuum moduli space, a massive deformation leading to fuzzy three-sphere vacua, and a possible large n limit. In this large n limit, the fuzzy funnel solution correctly reproduces the mass of an M5-brane.
