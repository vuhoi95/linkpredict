Title: Localized Solutions of the Non-Linear Klein-Gordon Equation in Many  Dimensions
Authors: M. V. Perel and I. V. Fialkovsky
Abstract: We present a new complex non-stationary particle-like solution of the non-linear Klein-Gordon equation with several spatial variables. The construction is based on reduction to an ordinary differential equation.
