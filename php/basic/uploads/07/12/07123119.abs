Title: Space-time uncertainty relation from quantum and gravitational  principles
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Yong Xiao
Abstract: By collecting both quantum and gravitational principles, a space-time uncertainty relation $(\delta t)(\delta r)^{3}\geqslant\pi r^{2}l_{p}^{2}$ is derived. It can be used to facilitate the discussion of several profound questions, such as computational capacity and thermodynamic properties of the universe and the origin of holographic dark energy. The universality and validity of the proposed relation are illustrated via these examples.
