Title: Type IIA orientifolds and orbifolds on non-factorizable tori
Authors: Tetsuji Kimura and Mitsuhisa Ohta and Kei-Jiro Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate Type II orientifolds on non-factorizable torus with and without its oribifolding. We explicitly calculate the Ramond-Ramond tadpole from string one-loop amplitudes, and confirm that the consistent number of orientifold planes is directly derived from the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. We furthermore classify orientifolds on non-factorizable Z_N x Z_M orbifolds, and construct new supersymmetric Type IIA orientifold models on them.
