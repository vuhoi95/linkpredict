Title: Supergravitons from one loop perturbative N=4 SYM
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Maciej Trzetrzelewski
Abstract: We determine the partition function of 1/16 BPS operators in N=4 SYM at weak coupling at the one-loop level in the planar limit. This partition function is significantly different from the one computed at zero coupling. We find that it coincides precisely with the partition function of a gas of 1/16 BPS `supergravitons' in AdS_5xS^5.
