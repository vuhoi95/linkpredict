Title: Singular Monopoles via the Nahm Transform
Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis and Brian Durcan
Abstract: We present explicit expressions for the fields of a charge one BPS monopole with two Dirac singularities. These are solutions of the nonlinear Bogomolny equations with the gauge group U(2) or SO(3). We derive these expressions by applying the technique of the Nahm transform. By exploring various limits we find a number of other solutions.
