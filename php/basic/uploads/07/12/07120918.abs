Title: Some thoughts about matrix coordinate transformations
Authors: J. Adam and B. Janssen and W. Troost and W. Van Herck
Abstract: Matrix coordinate transformations are defined as substitution operators without requiring an ordering prescription or an inclusion function from the Abelian coordinate transformations. We construct transforming objects mimicking most of the properties of tensors. We point out some problems with the matrix generalization of contravariant vectors. We suggest to use the substitution operators to search for an inclusion function.
