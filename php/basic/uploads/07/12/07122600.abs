Title: Integration of Superforms and Super-Thom Class
Authors: Pietro A. Grassi and Matteo Marescotti
Abstract: We address the basic problem of constructing the Thom class for a supermanifold. Given a cohomological class of a supermanifold and the restriction of the supermanifold to its bosonic submanifold, the Thom class gives a prescription to define the integral over the bosonic submanifold in terms of the integral over the entire supermanifold. In addition, we provide some new interesting examples of supermanifolds obtained by extending a given bosonic manifold, we discuss the construction of superforms of special type (which transform as Berezinian under change of supercoordinates) and we define the de Rham cohomology. We review the construction of the Thom class in the conventional geometry and we discuss the extension to the supermanifolds. Then, we compute explicitly the Thom class for the case of CP^{(1|2)} and, as expected, the result is singular. We provide a regularization technique to handle the fermionic Thom class in practical applications. We conclude with some remarks about Calabi-Yau spaces and their embedding into super-CY.
