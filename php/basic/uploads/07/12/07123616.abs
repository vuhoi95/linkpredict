Title: New BPS Configurations of BMN Matrix Theory
Authors: Jens Hoppe and Ki-Myeong Lee
Abstract: We explore the 1/2 BPS configurations in BMN matrix theory with SO(3) angular momentum of $SO(3)\times SO(6)$ symmetry. The fluctuation analysis of the BPS configurations near the abelian solutions and also the fuzzy two sphere vacua reveals how nonabelian BPS configurations emerge. Especially the irreducible nonabelian configurations seem to have the maximal angular momentum of order $N^3$, beyond which they collapse to abelian ones. We also find some new BPS configurations explicitly.
