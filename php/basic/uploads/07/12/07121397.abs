Title: Metastable Domains of the Landscape
Authors: Michael Dine and Guido Festuccia and Alexander Morisse and Korneel van den Broek
Abstract: We argue that the vast majority of flux vacua with small cosmological constant are unstable to rapid decay to a big crunch. Exceptions are states with large compactification volume and supersymmetric and approximately supersymmetric states. Neither weak string coupling, warping, or the existence of very light particles are, by themselves, enough to render states reasonably metastable. We speculate, as well, about states which might be cosmological attractors.
