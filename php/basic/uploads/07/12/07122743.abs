Title: A Generalized Scaling Function for AdS/CFT
Authors: Lisa Freyhult and Adam Rej and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We study a refined large spin limit for twist operators in the sl(2) sector of AdS/CFT. We derive a novel non-perturbative equation for the generalized two-parameter scaling function associated to this limit, and analyze it at weak coupling. It is expected to smoothly interpolate between weakly coupled gauge theory and string theory at strong coupling.
