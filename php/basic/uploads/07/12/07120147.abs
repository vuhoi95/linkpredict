Title: Coincidence limit and generalized interaction term structure in  multigravity
Authors: Steven Duplij and Albert Kotvytskiy
Abstract: Generalized structure of the interaction term of multigravity is analyzed in detail. The coincidence limit of any multigravity theory is defined and the compatibility equation for the interaction potential is derived which is studied in the weak perturbation limit of metric. The most general properties of the invariant volume and the scalar potential of multigravity are investigated. The general formula for multigravity invariant volume using three means (arithmetic, geometric and harmonic) is derived. The Pauli-Fierz mass term for bigravity in the weak field limit is obtained.
