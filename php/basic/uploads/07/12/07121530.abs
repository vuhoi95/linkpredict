Title: Supersymmetric N=2 Einstein-Yang-Mills monopoles and covariant  attractors
Authors: M. Huebscher and P. Meessen and T. Ortin and S. Vaula
Abstract: We present two generic classes of supersymmetric solutions of N=2, d=4 supergravity coupled to non-Abelian vector supermultiplets with a gauge group that includes an SU(2) factor. The first class consists of embeddings of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole and in the examples considered it has a fully regular, asymptotically flat space-time metric without event horizons. The other class of solutions consists of regular non-Abelian extreme black holes. There is a covariant attractor at the horizon of these non-Abelian black holes.
