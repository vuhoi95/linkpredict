Abstract: Using embedding of complex curves in the complex projective plane $\bf{P }^{2}$, we develop a \emph{non planar} topological 3-vertex formalism for topological strings on the family of local Calabi-Yau threefolds $X^{(m,-m,0) }=\mathcal{O}(m)\oplus \mathcal{O}(-m)\to E^{(t,\infty)}$. The base $E^{(t,\infty)}$ stands for the degenerate elliptic curve with Kahler parameter $t$; but a large complex structure $\mu $; i.e $| \mu | \longrightarrow \infty $. We also give first results regarding A-model topological string amplitudes on $X^{(m,-m,0)}$. The 2D $U(1) $ gauged $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric sigma models of the degenerate elliptic curve $ E^{(t,\infty)}$ as well as for the family $X^{(m,-m,0)}$ are studied and the role of D- and F-terms is explicitly exhibited.
