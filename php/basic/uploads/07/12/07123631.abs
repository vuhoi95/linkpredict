Title: Three dimensional noncommutative bosonization
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Subir Ghosh and T. Shreecharan
Abstract: We consider the extension of the 2+1-dimensional bosonization process in Non-Commutative (NC) spacetime. We show that the large mass limit of the effective action obtained by integrating out the fermionic fields in NC spacetime leads to the NC Chern-Simons action. The present result is valid to all orders in the noncommutative parameter $\theta$. We also discuss how the NC Yang-Mills action is induced in the next to leading order.
