Title: Holographic Calculation of Boundary Entropy
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Andreas Karch and Tadashi Takayanagi and Ethan G. Thompson
Abstract: We use the holographic proposal for calculating entanglement entropies to determine the boundary entropy of defects in strongly coupled two-dimensional conformal field theories. We study several examples including the Janus solution and show that the boundary entropy extracted from the entanglement entropy as well as its more conventional definition via the free energy agree with each other. Maybe somewhat surprisingly we find that, unlike in the case of a conformal field theory with boundary, the entanglement entropy for a generic region in a theory with defect carries detailed information about the microscopic details of the theory. We also argue that the g-theorem for the boundary entropy is closely related to the strong subadditivity of the entanglement entropy.
