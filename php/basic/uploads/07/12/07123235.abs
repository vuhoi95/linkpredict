Title: Topological BPS charges in 10 and 11-dimensional supergravity
Authors: Andrew K. Callister and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetry algebras of the 10 and 11 dimensional maximal supergravities. We construct expressions from which the topological charge structure of the algebras can be determined in supersymmetric curved backgrounds. These are interpreted as the topological charges of the 1/2-BPS states that are found in the theories. We consider charges for all the M-, NS- and D-branes as well as the Kaluza Klein monopoles. We also show that the dimensional reduction relations between the 11-d and IIA charges, and T-duality relations of the IIA and IIB charges match those found for the branes themselves. Finally we consider the massive versions of the IIA and 11-d theories and find that the expressions for the charges, with a slight modification, are still valid in those instances.
