Abstract: We study a random matrix model for the statistical properties of the purity of a bipartite quantum system at a finite (fictitious) temperature. This enables us to write the generating function for the cumulants, for both balanced and unbalanced bipartitions. It also unveils an unexpected feature of the system, namely the existence of two phase transitions, characterized by different spectra of the density matrices. One of the critical phases is described by the statistical mechanics of random surfaces, the other is a second-order phase transition.
