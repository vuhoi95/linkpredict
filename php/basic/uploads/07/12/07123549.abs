Title: Boundary Spectra in Superspace Sigma-Models
Authors: Thomas Quella and Volker Schomerus and Thomas Creutzig
Abstract: In this note we compute exact boundary spectra for D-instantons in sigma-models on the supergroup PSL(2|2). Our results are obtained through an explicit summation of the perturbative expansion for conformal dimensions to all orders in the curvature radius. The analysis exploits several remarkable properties of the perturbation series that arises from rescalings of the metric on PSL(2|2) relative to a fixed Wess-Zumino term. According to Berkovits, Vafa and Witten, the models are relevant in the context of string theory on AdS3 with non-vanishing RR-flux. The note concludes with a number of comments on various possible generalizations to other supergroups and higher dimensional supercoset theories.
