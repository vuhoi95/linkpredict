Title: Correspondence between the 3-form and non-minimal multiplet in  supersymmetry
Authors: Georges Girardi and Richard Grimm and Benjamin Labonne and Jean Orloff
Abstract: In analogy to the chiral-linear multiplet correspondence we establish a relationship between the 3-form (or gaugino condensate) multiplet and a coupled non-minimal (0,1/2) multiplet, illustrated by a simple explicit example.
