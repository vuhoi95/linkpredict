Title: Wrapping at four loops in N=4 SYM
Authors: F. Fiamberti and A. Santambrogio and C. Sieg and D. Zanon
Abstract: We present the planar four-loop anomalous dimension of the composite operator tr(phi[Z,phi]Z) in the flavour SU(2) sector of the N=4 SYM theory. At this loop order wrapping interactions are present: they give rise to contributions proportional to zeta(5) increasing the level of transcendentality of the anomalous dimension. In a sequel of this paper all the details of our calculation will be reported.
