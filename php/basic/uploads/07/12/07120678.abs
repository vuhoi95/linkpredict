Title: An Action Principle for the Masses of Dirac Particles
Authors: Felix Finster and Stefan Hoch
Abstract: A variational principle is introduced which minimizes an action formulated for configurations of vacuum Dirac seas. The action is analyzed in position and momentum space. We relate the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations to the notion of state stability. Examples of numerical minimizers are constructed and discussed.
