Title: Mechanics and Quantum Supermechanics of a Monopole Probe Including a  Coulomb Potential
Authors: Steven G. Avery and Jeremy Michelson
Abstract: A supersymmetric Lagrangian used to study D-particle probes in a D6-brane background is exactly soluble. We present an analysis of the classical and quantum mechanics of this theory, including classical trajectories in the bosonic theory, and the exact quantum spectrum and wavefunctions, including both bound and unbound states.
