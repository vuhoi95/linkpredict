Title: Asymptotic analysis of the Skyrmed monopole
Authors: Y. Brihaye and J. Burzlaff and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We consider a variant of the Georgi Glashow model in the BPS limit, augmented by a higher derivative Skyrme-like term, which is the simplest YMH model that can support monopole bound states. The spherically symetric solutions are studied with a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, which strongly suggest that the solutions converge to a finite energy configuration in the limit of infinite coupling of the Skyrme-like term.
