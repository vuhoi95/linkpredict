Title: The black hole dynamical horizon and generalized second law of  thermodynamics
Authors: Song He and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: The generalized second law of thermodynamics for a system containing a black hole dynamical horizon is proposed in a covariant way. Its validity is also tested in case of adiabatically collapsing thick light shells.
