Abstract: We consider a class of super-conformal beta-deformed N=1 gauge theories dual to string theory on $AdS_5 \times X$ with fluxes, where $X$ is a deformed Sasaki-Einstein manifold. The supergravity backgrounds are explicit examples of Generalised Calabi-Yau manifolds: the cone over $X$ admits an integrable generalised complex structure in terms of which the BPS sector of the gauge theory can be described. The moduli spaces of the deformed toric N=1 gauge theories are studied on a number of examples and are in agreement with the moduli spaces of D3 and D5 static and dual giant probes.
