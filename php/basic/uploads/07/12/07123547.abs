Title: Invariant conserved currents in gravity theories: diffeomorphisms and  local gauge symmetries
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and Guillermo F. Rubilar
Abstract: Previously, we have developed a general method to construct invariant conserved currents and charges in gravitational theories with Lagrangians that are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations. This approach is now generalized to the case when the local Lorentz group is replaced by an arbitrary local gauge group. The particular examples include the Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity with Abelian and non-Abelian local internal symmetries, and the metric-affine gravity in which the local Lorentz spacetime group is extended to the local general linear group.
