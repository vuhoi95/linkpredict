Title: Modified spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern by brane-bulk interaction  terms
Authors: Francesco Coradeschi and Stefania De Curtis and Daniele Dominici and Jos√© R. Pelaez
Abstract: We show how translational invariance can be broken by the vacuum that drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of extra-dimensional extensions of the Standard Model, when delta-like interactions between brane and bulk scalar fields are present. We explicitly build some examples of vacuum configurations, which induce the spontaneous symmetry breaking, and have non trivial profile in the extra coordinate.
