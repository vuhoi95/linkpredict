Title: Comment on "Viscous hydrodynamics relaxation time from AdS/CFT  correspondence"
Authors: Makoto Natsuume and Takashi Okamura
Abstract: This is a comment to hep-th/0703243. The paper determined the relaxation time tau_pi of the shear viscous stress for the N=4 SYM from AdS/CFT correspondence. The purpose of this comment is to point out that the value of tau_pi is 3 times larger than their result if one takes into account an additional term in the hydrodynamic equation.
