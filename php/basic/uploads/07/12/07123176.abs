Title: Decomposition and Oxidation of the N-Extended Supersymmetric Quantum  Mechanics Multiplets
Authors: Zhanna Kuznetsova and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: We furnish an algebraic understanding of the inequivalent connectivities (computed up to $N\leq 10$) of the graphs associated to the irreducible supermultiplets of the N-extended Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. We prove that the inequivalent connectivities of the N=5 and N=9 irreducible supermultiplets are due to inequivalent decompositions into two sets of N=4 (respectively, N=8) supermultiplets. "Oxido-reduction" diagrams linking the irreducible supermultiplets of the N=5,6,7,8 supersymmetries are presented. We briefly discuss these results and their possible applications.
