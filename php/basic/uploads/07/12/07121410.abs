Title: Gauge Dependence in the Nonlinearly Realized Massive SU(2) Gauge Theory
Authors: Daniele Bettinelli and Ruggero Ferrari and Andrea Quadri
Abstract: The implementation of the 't Hooft alpha-gauge in the symmetrically subtracted massive gauge theory based on the nonlinearly realized SU(2) gauge group is discussed. The gauge independence of the self-mass of the gauge bosons is proven by cohomological techniques.
