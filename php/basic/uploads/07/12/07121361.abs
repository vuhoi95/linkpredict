Title: Comments on the Boundary Scattering Phase
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Diego H. Correa
Abstract: We present a simple solution to the crossing equation for an open string worldsheet reflection matrix, with boundaries preserving a SU(1|2)^2 residual symmetry, which constrains the boundary dressing factor. In addition, we also propose an analogous crossing equation for the dressing factor where extra boundary degrees of freedom preserve a SU(2|2)^2 residual symmetry.
