Title: D=5 SU(2)xU(1) Gauged Supergravity from D=11 Supergravity
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Oscar Varela
Abstract: We consider the most general class of supersymmetric solutions of D=11 supergravity consisting of a warped product of AdS_5 with a six-dimensional internal manifold N_6, which are dual to N=2 super conformal field theories in d=4. For any such N_6 we construct the full non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz for the reduction of D=11 supergravity on N_6 down to D=5 SU(2)xU(1) gauged supergravity, at the level of the bosonic fields. This allows one to uplift any solution of the D=5 supergravity to obtain a solution of D=11 supergravity for any given N_6. Using an explicit N_6, corresponding to M5-branes wrapping holomorphic curves in a Calabi-Yau two-fold, we uplift some solutions and comment upon their interpretation.
