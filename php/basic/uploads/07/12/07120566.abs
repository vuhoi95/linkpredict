Title: Dirac-Coulomb scattering with plane wave energy eigenspinors on de  Sitter expanding universe
Authors: Ion I. Cotaescu and Crucean Cosmin
Abstract: The lowest order contribution of the amplitude of Dirac-Coulomb scattering in de Sitter spacetime is calculated assuming that the initial and final states of the Dirac field are described by exact solutions of the free Dirac equation on de Sitter spacetime with a given energy and helicity. We find that the total energy is conserved in the scattering process.
