Title: Fundamental Plasmid Strings and Black Rings
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Roberto Emparan and Alberto Iglesias
Abstract: We construct excited states of fundamental strings that admit a semiclassical description as rotating circular loops of string. We identify them with the supergravity solutions for rotating dipole rings. The identification involves a precise match of the mass, radius and angular momentum of the two systems. Moreover, the degeneracy of the string state reproduces the parametric dependence of the entropy in the supergravity description. When the solutions possess two macroscopic angular momenta, they are better described as toroidal configurations (tubular loops) instead of loops of string. We argue that the decay of the string state can be interpreted as superradiant emission of quanta from the ergoregion of the rotating ring.
