Title: Generating AdS String Solutions
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin and Chrysostomos Kalousios and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We use a Pohlmeyer type reduction to generate classical string solutions in AdS spacetime. In this framework we describe a correspondence between spikes in AdS_3 and soliton profiles of the sinh-Gordon equation. The null cusp string solution and its closed spinning string counterpart are related to the sinh-Gordon vacuum. We construct classical string solutions corresponding to sinh-Gordon solitons, antisolitons and breathers by the inverse scattering technique. The breather solutions can also be reproduced by the sigma model dressing method.
