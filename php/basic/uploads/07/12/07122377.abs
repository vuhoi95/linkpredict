Title: High-order perturbative expansions of multi-parameter Phi^4 quantum  field theories
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We present high-order pertubative expansions of multi-parameter Phi^4 quantum field theories with an N-component fundamental field, containing up to 4th-order polynomials of the field. Multi-parameter Phi^4 theories generalize the simplest O(N)-symmetric Phi^4 theories, and describe more complicated symmetry breaking patterns. These notes collect several high-order perturbative series of physically interesting multi-parameter Phi^4 theories, to five or six loops. We consider the O(M)XO(N)-symmetric Phi^4 model, the so-called MN model, and a spin-density-wave Phi^4 model containing five quartic terms.
