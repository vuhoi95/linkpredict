Title: Halos of Unified Dark Matter Scalar Field
Authors: Daniele Bertacca and Nicola Bartolo and Sabino Matarrese
Abstract: We investigate the static and spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for a scalar field with non-canonical kinetic term, assumed to provide both the dark matter and dark energy components of the Universe. In particular, we give a prescription to obtain solutions (dark halos) whose rotation curve v_c(r) is in good agreement with observational data. We show that there exist suitable scalar field Lagrangians that allow to describe the cosmological background evolution and the static solutions with a single dark fluid.
