Abstract: We propose a universal geometric formulation of gauged supergravity in terms of a twisted doubled torus. We focus on string theory (M-theory) reductions with generalized Scherk-Schwarz twists residing in the O(n,n) (E_{7(7)}) duality group. The set of doubled geometric fluxes, associated with the duality twists and identified naturally with the embedding tensor of gauged supergravity, captures all known fluxes, i.e. physical form fluxes, ordinary geometric fluxes, as well as their non-geometric counterparts. Furthermore, we propose a prescription for obtaining the effective geometry embedded in the string theory twisted doubled torus or in the M-theory megatorus and apply it for several models of geometric and non-geometric flux compactifications.
