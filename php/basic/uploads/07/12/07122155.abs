Title: Instability of the Time Dependent Horava-Witten Model
Authors: B. Cuadros-Melgar and C. E. Pellicer
Abstract: We consider scalar perturbations in the time-dependent Ho\u{r}ava-Witten Model in order to probe its stability. We show that during the non-singular epoque the model evolves without instabilities until it encounters the curvature singularity where a big crunch is supposed to occur. We compute the frequencies of the scalar field oscillation during the stable period and show how the oscillations can be used to prove the presence of such a singularity.
