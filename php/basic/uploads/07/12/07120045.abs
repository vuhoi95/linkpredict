Authors: Kimball A. Milton and Ines Cavero-Pelaez and Prachi Parashar and K. V. Shajesh and Jef Wagner
Abstract: The construction of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum electrodynamics is reviewed. In particular, the massless version of the theory in 1+1 dimensions (the Schwinger model) is solved. Difficulties with unitarity of the $S$-matrix are discussed.
