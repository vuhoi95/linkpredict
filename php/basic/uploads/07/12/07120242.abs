Title: Gravitational corrections to Standard Model vacuum decay
Authors: Gino Isidori and Vyacheslav S. Rychkov and Alessandro Strumia and Nikolaos Tetradis
Abstract: We refine and update the metastability constraint on the Standard Model top and Higgs masses, by analytically including gravitational corrections to the vacuum decay rate. Present best-fit ranges of the top and Higgs masses mostly lie in the narrow metastable region. Furthermore, we show that the SM potential can be fine-tuned in order to be made suitable for inflation. However, SM inflation results in a power spectrum of cosmological perturbations not consistent with observations.
