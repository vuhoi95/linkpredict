Title: Baryon number violation and a new electroweak interaction
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: We introduce a new supercurrent in the electroweak sector of the standard model. Its interaction with the hypergauge field influences the mass of the Z boson but has no effect on the W^\pm-boson masses. In the leptonic sector it affects the numerical value of the vector and axial coupling constants between neutral currents and the Z boson, and a comparison with experimental values yields an upper bound to the strength of the coupling between the supercurrent and the hypergauge field. In the baryonic sector the supercurrent gives a new contribution to the anomaly equation for baryon number current. As a consequence it may have an effect on baryogenesis.
