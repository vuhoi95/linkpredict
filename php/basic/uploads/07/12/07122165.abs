Title: Isomorphism of critical and off-critical operator spaces in  two-dimensional quantum field theory
Authors: G. Delfino and G. Niccoli
Abstract: For the simplest quantum field theory originating from a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, the Lee-Yang model, we show that the operator space determined by the particle dynamics in the massive phase and that prescribed by conformal symmetry at criticality coincide.
