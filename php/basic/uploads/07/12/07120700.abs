Title: Localizing gravity on Maxwell gauged CP1 model in six dimensions
Authors: Yuta Kodama and Kento Kokubu and Nobuyuki Sawado
Abstract: We shall consider about a 3-brane embedded in six-dimensional space-time with a negative bulk cosmological constant. The 3-brane is constructed by a topological soliton solution living in two-dimensional axially symmetric transverse subspace. Similar to most previous works of six-dimensional soliton models, our Maxwell gauged CP1 brane model can also achieve to localize gravity around the 3-brane. The CP1 field is described by a scalar doublet and derived from O(3) sigma model by projecting it onto two-dimensional complex space. In that sense, our framework is more effective than other solitonic brane models concerning with gauge theory. We shall also discuss about linear stability analysis for our new model by fluctuating all fields.
