Title: The Witten equation, mirror symmetry and quantum singularity theory
Authors: Huijun Fan and Tyler J. Jarvis and Yongbin Ruan
Abstract: For any non-degenerate, quasi-homogeneous hypersurface singularity, we describe a family of moduli spaces, a virtual cycle, and a corresponding cohomological field theory associated to the singularity. This theory is analogous to Gromov-Witten theory and generalizes the theory of r-spin curves, which corresponds to the simple singularity A_{r-1}. We also resolve two outstanding conjectures of Witten. The first conjecture is that ADE-singularities are self-dual; and the second conjecture is that the total potential functions of ADE-singularities satisfy corresponding ADE-integrable hierarchies. Other cases of integrable hierarchies are also discussed.
