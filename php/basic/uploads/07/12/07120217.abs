Title: A Note on Exact Solutions and Attractor Mechanism for Non-BPS Black  Holes
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Da-Wei Pang
Abstract: We obtain two extremal, spherically symmetric, non-BPS black hole solutions to 4D supergravity, one of which carries D2-D6 charges and the other carries D0-D2-D4 charges. For the D2-D6 case, rather than solving the equations of motion directly, we assume the form of the solution and then find that the assumption satisfies the equations of motion and the constraint. Our D2-D6 solution is manifestly dual to the solution presented in 0710.4967. The D0-D2-D4 solution is obtained by performing certain $[SL(2,{\bf Z})]^{3}$ duality transformations on the D0-D4 solution in 0710.4967.
