Title: Defects and Bulk Perturbations of Boundary Landau-Ginzburg Orbifolds
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Daniel Roggenkamp
Abstract: We propose defect lines as a useful tool to study bulk perturbations of conformal field theories, in particular to analyse the induced renormalisation group flows of boundary conditions. As a concrete example we investigate bulk perturbations of N=2 supersymmetric minimal models. To these perturbations we associate a special class of defects between the respective UV and IR theories, whose fusion with boundary conditions indeed reproduces the behaviour of the latter under the corresponding RG flows. v2: Some explanations added in section 4, minor changes.
