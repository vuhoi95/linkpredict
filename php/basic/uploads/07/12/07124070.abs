Title: On 5D Small Black Holes
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Farhad Ardalan and Hajar Ebrahim and Subir Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: Using higher order corrections we argue that five dimensional N=2 and N=4 small black holes exhibit supersymmetry enhancement in near horizon geometry leading to eight and sixteen supercharges, respectively. Using this enhancement at supergravity level we can identify the global supergroup of the near horizon geometry. In particular we show how this supergroup distinguishes between small and large black holes in N=2 case.
