Title: Recent developments for multi-leg QCD amplitudes with massive particles
Authors: Rutger Boels and Christian Schwinn and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We review the extension of modern techniques for the calculation of helicity amplitudes in QCD to massive particles. The focus is on the use of supersymmetric Ward identites that relate amplitudes with massive quarks to those with massive scalars, the application of on-shell recursion relations to amplitudes with massive quarks and an extension of the CSW rules to massive scalars.
