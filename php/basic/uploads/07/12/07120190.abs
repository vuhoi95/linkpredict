Title: A Family of Non-Abelian Kitaev Models on a Lattice: Topological  Confinement and Condensation
Authors: H. Bombin and M. A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: We study a family of non-Abelian topological models in a lattice that arise by modifying the Kitaev model through the introduction of single-qudit terms. The effect of these terms amounts to a reduction of the discrete gauge symmetry with respect to the original systems, which corresponds to a generalized mechanism of explicit symmetry breaking. The topological order is either partially lost or completely destroyed throughout the various models. The new systems display condensation and confinement of the topological charges present in the standard non-Abelian Kitaev models, which we study in terms of ribbon operator algebras.
