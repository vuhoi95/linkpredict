Title: Calabi-Yau Metrics for Quotients and Complete Intersections
Authors: Volker Braun and Tamaz Brelidze and Michael R. Douglas and Burt A. Ovrut
Abstract: We extend previous computations of Calabi-Yau metrics on projective hypersurfaces to free quotients, complete intersections, and free quotients of complete intersections. In particular, we construct these metrics on generic quintics, four-generation quotients of the quintic, Schoen Calabi-Yau complete intersections and the quotient of a Schoen manifold with Z_3 x Z_3 fundamental group that was previously used to construct a heterotic standard model. Various numerical investigations into the dependence of Donaldson's algorithm on the integration scheme, as well as on the Kahler and complex structure moduli, are also performed.
