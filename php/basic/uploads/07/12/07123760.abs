Title: Homolumo Gap and Matrix Model
Authors: I. Andric and L. Jonke and D. Jurman and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: We discuss a dynamical matrix model by which probability distribution is associated with Gaussian ensembles from random matrix theory. We interpret the matrix M as a Hamiltonian representing interaction of a bosonic system with a single fermion. We show that a system of second-quantized fermions influences the ground state of the whole system by producing a gap between the highest occupied eigenvalue and the lowest unoccupied eigenvalue.
