Title: Holography of Non-relativistic String on AdS5xS5
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss a holographic dual of a non-relativistic (NR) string on AdS5xS5. The NR string can be regarded as a semiclassical string around an AdS2 classical solution corresponding to a straight Wilson line in the gauge-theory side. The quadratic action with respect to the fluctuations is composed of free massive and massless scalars, and free massive fermions on the AdS2 world-sheet. We show that the complete agreement of the spectra between the NR string and a conformal quantum mechanics (CQM). Then we show a holographic relation between normalizable modes of the NR string and wave functions in the CQM. Then it may be argued from this result that an AdS2/CFT1 would be realized in AdS5/CFT4. We can really discuss a GKPW-type relation by considering non-normalizable modes of the NR string in Euclidean signature. Those modes give a source term insertion to the Wilson line, which can also be regarded as a small deformation of it.
