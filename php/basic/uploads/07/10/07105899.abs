Title: BCFT and Ribbon Graphs as tools for open/closed string dualities
Authors: Valeria L. Gili and Mauro Carfora and Claudio Dappiaggi
Abstract: In the framework of simplicial models, we construct and we fully characterize a scalar boundary conformal field theory on a triangulated Riemann surface. The results are analysed from a string theory perspective as tools to deal with open/closed string dualities.
