Abstract: The influence of the gravity acceleration on the regularized energy-momentum tensor of the quantized electromagnetic field between two plane parallel conducting plates is derived. A perturbative expansion, to first order in the constant acceleration parameter, of the Green functions involved and of the energy-momentum tensor is derived by means of the covariant geodesic point splitting procedure. The energy-momentum tensor is covariantly conserved and satisfies the expected relation between gauge-breaking and ghost parts.
