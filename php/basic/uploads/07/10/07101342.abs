Title: Marginal Deformations as Lower Dimensional D-brane Solutions in Open  String Field theory
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: By direct calculation we showed that a finite analytic solution for marginal deformation of open string field theory, by a matter primary operator with singular OPE, can be obtained to all orders in the deformation parameter. In particular, we obtained solutions that describe lower dimensional D-branes and our results agree with the results obtained when the same problem is treated in the world-sheet conformal field theory language.
