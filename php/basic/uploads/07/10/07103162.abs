Title: String junctions in curved backgrounds, their stability and dyon  interactions in SYM
Authors: Konstadinos Sfetsos and Konstadinos Siampos
Abstract: We provide a systematic construction of string junctions in curved backgrounds which are relevant in computing, within the gauge/gravity correspondence, the interaction energy of heavy dyons, notably of quark-monopole pairs, in strongly coupled SYM theories. To isolate the configurations of physical interest we examine their stability under small fluctuations and prove several general statements. We present all details, in several examples, involving non-extremal and multicenter D3-brane backgrounds as well as the Rindler space. We show that a string junction could be perturbatively stable even in branches that are not energetically the most favorable ones. We present a mechanical analog of this phenomenon.
