Title: Casimir energy of a spherical shell in $Îº-$Minkowski spacetime
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Chaiho Rim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We study the Casimir energy of a spherical shell of radius $a$ in $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime for a complex field with an asymmetric ordering and obtain the energy up to $O(1/\kappa^2)$. We show that the vacuum breaks particle and anti-particle symmetry if one requires the spectra to be consistent with the blackbody radiation at the commutative limit.
