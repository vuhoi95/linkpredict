Abstract: We study UV properties of the two-dimensional supersymmetric CP^{N-1} model on non(anti)commutative superspace. We show that the deformed model has the same UV property as the ordinary model in the leading order of 1/N and the deformation give rise to UV divergence which cannot be dealt with in the next-to-leading order.
