Abstract: An analytical-numerical analysis of the singular self-adjoint spectral problem for a system of three linear ordinary second-order differential equations defined on the entire real exis is presented. This problem comes to existence in the nonlinear field theory. The dependence of the differential equations on the spectral parameter is nonlinear, which results in a quadratic operator Hermitian pencil.
