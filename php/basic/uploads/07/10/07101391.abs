Title: Integrablility of a Classical $N= 2$ Super Sinh-Gordon Model with Jump  Defects
Authors: J. F. Gomes and L. H. Ymai and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The Lagrangian formalism for the N=2 supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model with a jump defect is considered. The modified conserved momentum and energy are constructed in terms of border functions. The supersymmetric Backlund transformation is given and an one-soliton solution is obtained. The Lax formulation based on the affine super Lie algebra $sl(2,2)$ within the space split by the defect leads to the integrability of the model and henceforth to the existence of an infinite number of constants of motion.
