Title: Strongly coupled large N spectrum of two matrices coupled via a  Yang-Mills interaction
Authors: Martin N. H. Cook and Jo√£o P. Rodrigues
Abstract: We consider the large N spectrum of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of two hermitean matrices coupled via a Yang-Mills interaction. In a framework where one of the matrices is treated exactly and the other is treated as a creation operator impurity, the difference equation associated with the Yang-Mills interaction is derived and solved exactly for two impurities. In this case, the full string tension corrected spectrum depends on two momenta. For a specific value of one of these momenta, the spectrum has the same structure as that of giant magnon bound states. States with general number of impurities are also discussed.
