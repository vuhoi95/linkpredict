Title: Fermion excitations of a tense brane black hole
Authors: H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Jason Doukas and Wade Naylor
Abstract: By finding the spinor eigenvalues for a single deficit angle (d-2)-sphere, we derive the radial potential for fermions on a d-dimensional black hole background that is embedded on a codimension two brane with conical singularity, where the deficit angle is related to the brane tension. From this we obtain the quasi-normal mode spectrum for bulk fermions on such a background. As a byproduct of our method, this also gives a rigorous proof for integer spin fields on the deficit 2-sphere.
