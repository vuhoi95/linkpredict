Title: Supersymmetry in 5d Gravity
Authors: C. S. Lim and Tomoaki Nagasawa and Satoshi Ohya and Kazuki Sakamoto and Makoto Sakamoto
Abstract: We study a 5d gravity theory with a warped metric and show that two N = 2 supersymmetric quantum-mechanical systems are hidden in the 4d spectrum. The supersymmetry can be regarded as a remnant of higher-dimensional general coordinate invariance and turns out to become a powerful tool to determine the physical 4d spectrum and the allowed boundary conditions. Possible extensions of the N = 2 supersymmetry are briefly discussed.
