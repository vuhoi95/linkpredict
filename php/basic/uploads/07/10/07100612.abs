Title: Fermions Tunnelling from Black Holes
Authors: Ryan Kerner and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We investigate the tunnelling of spin 1/2 particles through event horizons. We first apply the tunnelling method to Rindler spacetime and obtain the Unruh temperature. We then apply fermion tunnelling to a general non-rotating black hole metric and show that the Hawking temperature is recovered.
