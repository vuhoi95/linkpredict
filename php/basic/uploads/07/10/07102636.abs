Title: Low energy particle physics and cosmology of nonlinear supersymmetric  general relativity
Authors: K. Shima and M. Tsuda and W. Lang
Abstract: We show a low energy physical meaning of nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity (NLSUSY GR) in asymptotic Riemann-flat space-time by studying the vacuum structure of N = 2 linear supersymmetry (LSUSY) invariant QED, which is equivalent to N = 2 NLSUSY model, in two dimensional space-time. Two different vacuum field configurations of SO(3,1) isometry describe the two different physical vacua, i.e. one breaks spontaneously both U(1) and SUSY and the other breaks spontaneously SUSY alone, where the latter elucidates the mysterious relations between the cosmology and the (low energy) particle physics and gives a new insight into the origin of mass.
