Title: If LHC is a Mini-Time-Machines Factory, Can We Notice?
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: Assuming the hypothesis of TeV-scale multi-dimensional gravity, one can imagine that at LHC not only mini-black-holes (MBH) will be intensively created, but also other exotic gravitational configurations, including hypothetical mini-time-machines (MTM). Like MBH, they should quickly evaporate, but one can wonder if their temporal existence at the moment of high-energy collision can leave any traces in the observable data. We briefly discuss five thinkable effects: (i) change of the energy spectrum due to the frequency-filtration property of MTM, (ii) possible production of anomalously energetic particles, accelerated by passing many times through gravitational field inside the MTM, (iii) acceleration of particle decays, since the proper time of a particle moving inside MTM can strongly exceed the laboratory time, (iv) CPT and naive unitarity violation (thermalization) due to effective non-local interactions caused by MTM and to possible ambiguity in the population of closed world-lines inside MTM, (v) collective effects due to conversion of a single particle into a bunch of its co-existing copies within the MTM. Despite possible particle-antiparticle conversion inside MTM, they do not seem to produce any specific CP-violation effects.
