Title: Hamiltonian approach to Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: H. Reinhardt and W. Schleifenbaum and D. Epple and C. Feuchter
Abstract: The vacuum wave functional of Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory is determined within the variational principle and used to calculate various Green functions and observables. The results show that heavy quarks are confined by a linearly rising potential and gluons cannot propagate over large distances. The 't Hooft loop shows a perimeter law and thus also indicates confinement.
