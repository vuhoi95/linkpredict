Title: Fermion Systems in Discrete Space-Time Exemplifying the Spontaneous  Generation of a Causal Structure
Authors: Alexander Diethert and Felix Finster and Daniela Schiefeneder
Abstract: As toy models for space-time on the Planck scale, we consider examples of fermion systems in discrete space-time which are composed of one or two particles defined on two up to nine space-time points. We study the self-organization of the particles as described by a variational principle both analytically and numerically. We find an effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking which leads to the emergence of a discrete causal structure.
