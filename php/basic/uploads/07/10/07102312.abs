Title: Supercriticality of a Class of Critical String Cosmological Solutions
Authors: Dimitri V. Nanopoulos and Dan Xie
Abstract: For a class of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker type string solutions with compact hyperbolic spatial slices formulated in critical dimension, we find the world sheet conformal field theory which involves the linear dilaton and Wess-Zumino-Witten type model with the compact hyperbolic target space. By analyzing the infrared spectrum, we conclude that the theory is actually supercritical due to the modular invariance of string theory. Thus, taking into account previous results, we conclude that all the simple nontrivial string cosmological solutions are supercritical. A possible explanation of why we are living in D=4 is provided. The interesting relation of this background with the Supercritical String Cosmology (SSC) is pointed out.
