Title: Boundary Value Problem for Black Rings
Authors: Yoshiyuki Morisawa and Shinya Tomizawa and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We study the boundary value problem for asymptotically flat stationary black ring solutions to the five-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations. Assuming the existence of two additional commuting axial Killing vector fields and the horizon topology of $S^1\times S^2$, we show that the only asymptotically flat black ring solution with a regular horizon is the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring solution.
