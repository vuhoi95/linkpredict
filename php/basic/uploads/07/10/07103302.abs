Title: On the Caudrey-Beals-Coifman System and the Gauge Group Action
Authors: Georgi G. Grahovski and Marissa Condon
Abstract: The generalized Zakharov-Shabat systems with complex-valued Cartan elements and the systems studied by Caudrey, Beals and Coifman (CBC systems) and their gauge equivalent are studies. This includes: the properties of fundamental analytical solutions (FAS) for the gauge-equivalent to CBC systems and the minimal set of scattering data; the description of the class of nonlinear evolutionary equations solvable by the inverse scattering method and the recursion operator, related to such systems; the hierarchies of Hamiltonian structures.
