Title: A note on the Hamiltonian formalism for higher-derivative theories
Authors: K. Andrzejewski and J. Gonera and P. Maslanka
Abstract: An alternative version of Hamiltonian formalism for higher-derivative theories is presented. It is related to the standard Ostrogradski approach by a canonical transformation. The advantage of the approach presented is that the Lagrangian is nonsingular and the Legendre transformation is performed in a straightforward way.
