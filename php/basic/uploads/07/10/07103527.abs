Title: Toward theory of quantum Hall effect in graphene
Authors: E. V. Gorbar and V. P. Gusynin and V. A. Miransky
Abstract: We analyze a gap equation for the propagator of Dirac quasiparticles and conclude that in graphene in a magnetic field, the order parameters connected with the quantum Hall ferromagnetism dynamics and those connected with the magnetic catalysis dynamics necessarily coexist (the latter have the form of Dirac masses and correspond to excitonic condensates). This feature of graphene could lead to important consequences, in particular, for the existence of gapless edge states. Solutions of the gap equation corresponding to recently experimentally discovered novel plateaus in graphene in strong magnetic fields are described.
