Title: Warped Phenomenology in the Holographic Basis
Authors: Brian Batell and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: The holographic basis is a novel tool which allows for a quantitative description of elementary/composite mixing in holographic duals of warped models. We apply this tool to bulk fermions in a slice of AdS_5 and determine the precise admixture of elementary source field and composite resonances forming the Standard Model fermions. In particular, for the phenomenologically important case of an IR localized right-handed top quark, we show that the massless eigenstate is approximately a 50/50 elementary-composite admixture. We also translate, in a simple yet quantitative manner, several of the phenomenological successes enjoyed by warped models to the language of partial compositeness.
