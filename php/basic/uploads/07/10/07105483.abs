Abstract: Using a holographic proposal for the entanglement entropy we study its behavior in various supergravity backgrounds. We are particularly interested in the possibility of using the entanglement entropy as way to detect transitions induced by the presence horizons. We consider several geometries with horizons: the black hole in $AdS_3$, nonextremal Dp-branes, dyonic black holes asymptotically to $AdS_4$ and also Schwarzschild black holes in global $AdS_p$ coordinates. Generically, we find that the entanglement entropy does not exhibit a transition, that is, one of the two possible configurations always dominates.
