Title: $Îº$-Minkowski space, scalar field, and the issue of Lorentz  invariance
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman
Abstract: We describe $\kappa$-Minkowski space and its relation to group theory. The group theoretical picture makes it possible to analyze the symmetries of this space. As an application of this analysis we analyze in detail free field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space and the Noether charges associated with deformed spacetime symmetries.
