Title: Relativistic Effects of Mixed Vector-Scalar-Pseudoscalar Potentials for  Fermions in 1+1 Dimensions
Authors: L. B. Castro and A. S. De Castro and M. Hott
Abstract: The problem of fermions in the presence of a pseudoscalar plus a mixing of vector and scalar potentials which have equal or opposite signs is investigated. We explore all the possible signs of the potentials and discuss their bound-state solutions for fermions and antifermions. The cases of mixed vector and scalar P\"{o}schl-Teller-like and pseudoscalar kink-like potentials, already analyzed in previous works, are obtained as particular cases.
