Title: Kinematical Analogy for Marginal Dyon Decay
Authors: Anindya Mukherjee and Sunil Mukhi and Rahul Nigam
Abstract: We describe a kinematical analogy for the marginal decay of 1/4-BPS dyons in 4-dimensional N=4 string compactifications. In this analogy, the electric and magnetic charges play the role of spatial momenta, the BPS mass plays the role of energy, and 1/2-BPS dyons correspond to massless particles. Using SO(12,1) "Lorentz" invariance and standard kinematical formulae in particle physics, we provide simple derivations of the curves of marginal stability. We also show how these curves map into the momentum ellipsoid, and propose some applications of this analogy.
