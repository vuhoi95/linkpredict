Title: Fragmenting D4 branes and coupled q-deformed Yang Mills
Authors: Daniel L. Jafferis and Natalia Saulina
Abstract: We compute the index of BPS states for two stacks of D4-branes wrapped on ample divisors and overlapping over a compact Riemann surface inside non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold. This index is given in terms of U(N) x U(M) q-deformed Yang Mills theory with bifundamental matter. From the factorization in the limit of large D4 charge, we argue that our result computes the jump in the index of BPS states across the wall of the marginal stability for the split flow of a D4 brane fragmenting into a pair of D4 branes.
