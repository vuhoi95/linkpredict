Title: Mirror duality and noncommutative tori
Authors: Eunsang Kim and Hoil Kim
Abstract: In this paper, we study a mirror duality on a generalized complex torus and a noncommutative complex torus. First, we derive a symplectic version of Riemann condition using mirror duality on ordinary complex tori. Based on this we will find a mirror correspondence on generalized complex tori and generalize the mirror duality on complex tori to the case of noncommutative complex tori.
