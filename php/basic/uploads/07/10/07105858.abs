Title: The geometric phases in a background with Lorentz-symmetry violation
Authors: L. R. Ribeiro and E. Passos and C. Furtado and J. R. Nascimento
Abstract: We analyze the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a single neutral spin half particle, with non-zero magnetic and electric dipole moments, moving in an external electromagnetic field in presence of Lorentz symmetry violation background. Also, we study the geometric phase for this model taking into account the parameter that breaks the Lorentz symmetry. We investigate the He-McKellar-Wilkens effect in this context and we verify that Lorentz violation parameter contribute to increase the electric dipole moment of the particle.
