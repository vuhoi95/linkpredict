Title: IIB solutions with N>28 Killing spinors are maximally supersymmetric
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos and D. Roest
Abstract: We show that all IIB supergravity backgrounds which admit more than 28 Killing spinors are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we find that for all N>28 backgrounds the supercovariant curvature vanishes, and that the quotients of maximally supersymmetric backgrounds either preserve all 32 or N<29 supersymmetries.
