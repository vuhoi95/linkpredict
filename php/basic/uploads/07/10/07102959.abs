Title: Galois Group of Elliptic Curves and Flavor Symmetry
Authors: Chuichiro Hattori and Mamoru Matsunaga and Takeo Matsuoka and Kenichi Nakanishi
Abstract: Putting emphasis on the relation between rational conformal field theory (RCFT) and algebraic number theory, we consider a brane configuration in which the D-brane intersection is an elliptic curve corresponding to RCFT. A new approach to the generation structure of fermions is proposed in which the flavor symmetry including the R-parity has its origin in the Galois group on elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM). We study the possible types of the Galois group derived from the torsion points of the elliptic curve with CM. A phenomenologically viable example of the Galois group is presented, in which the characteristic texture of fermion masses and mixings is reproduced and the mixed-anomaly conditions are satisfied.
