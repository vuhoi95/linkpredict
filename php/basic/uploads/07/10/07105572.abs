Authors: F. Bastianelli and U. Nucamendi and C. Schubert and V. M. Villanueva
Abstract: In part 1 of this series compact integral representations had been obtained for the one-loop photon-graviton amplitude involving a charged spin 0 or spin 1/2 particle in the loop and an arbitrary constant electromagnetic field. In this sequel, we study the structure and magnitude of the various polarization components of this amplitude on-shell. Explicit expressions are obtained for a number of limiting cases.
