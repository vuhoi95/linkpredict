Title: Black Hole Thermodynamics and Hamilton-Jacobi Counterterm
Authors: Luzi Bergamin and Daniel Grumiller and Robert McNees and Rene Meyer
Abstract: We review the construction of the universal Hamilton-Jacobi counterterm for dilaton gravity in two dimensions, derive the corresponding result in the Cartan formulation and elaborate further upon black hole thermodynamics and semi-classical corrections. Applications include spherically symmetric black holes in arbitrary dimensions with Minkowski- or AdS-asymptotics, the BTZ black hole and black holes in two-dimensional string theory.
