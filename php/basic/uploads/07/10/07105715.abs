Title: Progress in Gauge Invariant Lagrangian Construction for Massive Higher  Spin Fields
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. A. Krykhtin
Abstract: We review the recently developed general gauge invariant approach to Lagrangian construction for massive higher spin fields in Minkowski and AdS spaces of arbitrary dimension. Higher spin Lagrangian, describing the dynamics of the fields with any spin, is formulated with help of BRST-BFV operator in auxiliary Fock space. No off-shell constraints on the fields and gauge parameters are imposed. The construction is also applied to tensor higher spin fields with index symmetry corresponding to a multirow Young tableau.
