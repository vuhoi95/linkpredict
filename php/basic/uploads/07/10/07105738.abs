Title: Factorization of nonlinear supersymmetry in one-dimensional Quantum  Mechanics. I: general classification of reducibility and analysis of the  third-order algebra
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and A. V. Sokolov
Abstract: We study possible factorizations of supersymmetric (SUSY) transformations in the one-dimensional quantum mechanics into chains of elementary Darboux transformations with nonsingular coefficients. A classification of irreducible (almost) isospectral transformations and of related SUSY algebras is presented. The detailed analysis of SUSY algebras and isospectral operators is performed for the third-order case.
