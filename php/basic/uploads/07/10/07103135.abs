Abstract: Mass shifts induced by one-loop fluctuations of semi-local self-dual vortices are computed. The procedure is based on canonical quantization and heat kernel/ zeta function regularization methods. The issue of the survival of the classical degeneracy in the semi-classical regime is explored.
