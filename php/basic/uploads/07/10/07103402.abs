Title: The 't Hooft Model As A Hologram
Authors: Emanuel Katz and Takemichi Okui
Abstract: We consider the 3d dual of 1+1 dimensional large-N_c QCD with quarks in the fundamental representation, also known as the 't Hooft model. 't Hooft solved this model by deriving a Schroedinger equation for the wavefunction of a parton inside the meson. In the scale-invariant limit, we show how this equation is related by a transform to the equation of motion for a scalar field in AdS_3. We thus find an explicit map between the `parton-x' variable and the radial coordinate of AdS_3. This direct map allows us to check the AdS/CFT prescription from the 2d side. We describe various features of the dual in the conformal limit and to the leading order in conformal symmetry breaking, and make some comments on the 3d theory in the fully non-conformal regime.
