Title: Cosmological equations and Thermodynamics on Apparent Horizon in Thick  Braneworld
Authors: Shao-Feng Wu and Guo-Hong Yang and Peng-Ming Zhang
Abstract: We derive the generalized Friedmann equation governing the cosmological evolution inside the thick brane model in the presence of two curvature correction terms: a four-dimensional scalar curvature from induced gravity on the brane, and a five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet curvature term. We find two effective four-dimensional reductions of the Friedmann equation in some limits and demonstrate that they can be rewritten as the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of thick braneworld.
