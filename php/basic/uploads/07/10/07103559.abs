Title: Separation of Attractors in 1-modulus Quantum Corrected Special Geometry
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Ferrara and A. Marrani and A. Shcherbakov
Abstract: We study the attractor equations for a quantum corrected prepotential F=t^3+i\lambda, with \lambda \in R,which is the only correction which preserves the axion shift symmetry and modifies the geometry. By performing computations in the ``magnetic'' charge configuration, we find evidence for interesting phenomena (absent in the classical limit of vanishing \lambda). For a certain range of the quantum parameter \lambda we find a ``separation'' of attractors, i.e. the existence of multiple solutions to the Attractor Equations for fixed supporting charge configuration. Furthermore, we find that, away from the classical limit, a ``transmutation'' of the supersymmetry-preserving features of the attractors takes place when \lambda reaches a particular critical value.
