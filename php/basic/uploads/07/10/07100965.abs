Title: Holographic Aspects of Electric-Magnetic Dualities
Authors: Sebastian de Haro and Anastasios C. Petkou
Abstract: We review recent work on holographic aspects of electric-magnetic dualities in theories that involve conformally coupled scalars and abelian gauge fields in asymptotically AdS4 spaces. Such models are relevant for the holographic description of M-theory. We also briefly comment on some new results on the holographic properties of generalized electric-magnetic duality in gravity.
