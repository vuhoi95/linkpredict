Title: Compact oscillons in the signum-Gordon model
Authors: H. Arodz and P. Klimas and T. Tyranowski
Abstract: We present explicit solutions of the signum-Gordon scalar field equation which have finite energy and are periodic in time. Such oscillons have a strictly finite size. They do not emit radiation.
