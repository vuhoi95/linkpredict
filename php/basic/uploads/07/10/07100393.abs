Title: Quark scattering amplitudes at strong coupling
Authors: John McGreevy and Amit Sever
Abstract: Following Alday and Maldacena, we describe a string theory method to compute the strong coupling behavior of the scattering amplitudes of quarks and gluons in planar N=2 super Yang-Mills theory in the probe approximation. Explicit predictions for these quantities can be constructed using the all-orders planar gluon scattering amplitudes of N=4 super Yang-Mills due to Bern, Dixon and Smirnov.
