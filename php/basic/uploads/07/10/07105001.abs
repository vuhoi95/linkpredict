Title: Anisotropic inharmonic Higgs oscillator and related (MICZ-)Kepler-like  systems
Authors: Armen Nersessian and Vahagn Yeghikyan
Abstract: We propose the integrable (pseudo)spherical generalization of the four-dimensional anisotropic oscillator with additional nonlinear potential. Performing its Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation we then obtain the pseudospherical generalization of the MICZ-Kepler system with linear and $\cos\theta$ potential terms. We also present the generalization of the parabolic coordinates, in which this system admits the separation of variables. Finally, we get the spherical analog of the presented MICZ-Kepler-like system.
