Title: From multiple integrals to Fredholm determinants
Authors: Alexander Seel and Frank Göhmann and Andreas Klümper
Abstract: We consider a multiple integral representation for the finite temperature density-density correlation functions of the one-dimensional Bose gas with delta function interaction in the limits of infinite and vanishing repulsion. In the former case a known Fredholm determinant is recovered. In the latter case a similar expression appears with permanents replacing determinants.
