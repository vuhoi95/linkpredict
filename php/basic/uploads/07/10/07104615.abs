Title: Nucleon Form Factors and Hidden Symmetry in Holographic QCD
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Mannque Rho and Ho-Ung Yee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: The vector dominance of the electromagnetic form factors both for mesons and baryons arises naturally in holographic QCD, where both the number of colors and the 't Hooft coupling are taken to be very large, offering a bona-fide derivation of the notion of vector dominance. The crucial ingredient for this is the infinite tower of vector mesons in the approximations made which share features that are characteristic of the quenched approximation in lattice QCD. We approximate the infinite sum by contributions from the lowest four vector mesons of the tower which turn out to saturate the charge and magnetic moment sum rules within a few percent and compute them totally free of unknown parameters for momentum transfers Q^2 less than 1GeV^2. We identify certain observables that can be reliably computed within the approximations and others that are not, and discuss how the improvement of the latter can enable one to bring holographic QCD closer to QCD proper.
