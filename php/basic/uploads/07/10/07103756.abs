Title: Complex Langevin Equations and Schwinger-Dyson Equations
Authors: Gerald Guralnik and Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: Stationary distributions of complex Langevin equations are shown to be the complexified path integral solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the associated quantum field theory. Specific examples in zero dimensions and on a lattice are given. Relevance to the study of quantum field theory phase space is discussed.
