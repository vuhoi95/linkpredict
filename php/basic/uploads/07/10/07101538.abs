Title: Integrable boundary conditions and modified Lax equations
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou
Abstract: We consider integrable boundary conditions for both discrete and continuum classical integrable models. Local integrals of motion generated by the corresponding transfer matrices give rise to time evolution equations for the initial Lax operator. We systematically identify the modified Lax pairs for both discrete and continuum boundary integrable models, depending on the classical r-matrix and the boundary matrix.
