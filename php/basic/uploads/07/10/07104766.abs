Title: Gravitational Anomaly and Hawking Radiation of Brane World Black Holes
Authors: Chao-Guang Huang and Jia-Rui Sun and Xiaoning Wu and Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We apply Wilczek and his collaborators' anomaly cancellation approach to the 3-dimensional Schwarzschild- and BTZ-like brane world black holes induced by the generalized C metrics in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. Based on the fact that the horizon of brane world black hole will extend into the bulk spacetime, we do the calculation from the bulk generalized C metrics side and show that this approach also reproduces the correct Hawking radiation for these brane world black holes. Besides, since this approach does not involve the dynamical equation, it also shows that the Hawking radiation is only a kinematic effect.
