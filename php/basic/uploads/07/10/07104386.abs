Title: Quantum stabilization of Z-strings, a status report on D=3+1 dimensions
Authors: O. Schroeder and N. Graham and M. Quandt and H. Weigel
Abstract: We investigate an extension to the phase shift formalism for calculating one-loop determinants. This extension is motivated by requirements of the computation of Z-string quantum energies in D=3+1 dimensions. A subtlety that seems to imply that the vacuum polarization diagram in this formalism is (erroneously) finite is thoroughly investigated.
