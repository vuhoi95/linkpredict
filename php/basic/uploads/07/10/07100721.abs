Title: Noncommutative families of instantons
Authors: Giovanni Landi and Chiara Pagani and Cesare Reina and Walter D. van Suijlekom
Abstract: We construct $\theta$-deformations of the classical groups SL(2,H) and Sp(2). Coacting on the basic instanton on a noncommutative four-sphere $S^4_\theta$, we construct a noncommutative family of instantons of charge 1. The family is parametrized by the quantum quotient of $SL_\theta(2,H)$ by $Sp_\theta(2)$.
