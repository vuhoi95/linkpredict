Title: Lensing and CMB Anisotropies by Cosmic Strings at a Junction
Authors: Robert Brandenberger and Hassan Firouzjahi and Johanna Karouby
Abstract: The metric around straight arbitrarily-oriented cosmic strings forming a stationary junction is obtained at the linearized level. It is shown that the geometry is flat. The sum rules for lensing by this configuration and the anisotropies of the CMB are obtained.
