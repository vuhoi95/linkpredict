Title: Thermodynamical properties of hairy black holes in n spacetimes  dimensions
Authors: Mario Nadalini and Luciano Vanzo and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The issue concerning the existence of exact black hole solutions in presence of non vanishing cosmological constant and scalar fields is reconsidered. With regard to this, in investigating no-hair theorem violations, exact solutions of gravity having as a source an interacting and conformally coupled scalar field are revisited in arbitrary dimensional non asymptotically flat space-times. New and known hairy black hole solutions are discussed. The thermodynamical properties associated with these solutions are investigated and the invariance of the black hole entropy with respect to different conformal frames is proven.
