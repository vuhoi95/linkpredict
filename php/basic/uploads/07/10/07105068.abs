Title: Excitation Spectrum at the Yang-Lee Edge Singularity of 2D Ising Model  on the Strip
Authors: Smain Balaska and John F. McCabe and Tomasz Wydro
Abstract: At the Yang-Lee edge singularity, finite-size scaling behavior is used to measure the low-lying excitation spectrum of the Ising quantum spin chain for free boundary conditions. The measured spectrum is used to identify the CFT that describes the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the 2D Ising model for free boundary conditions.
