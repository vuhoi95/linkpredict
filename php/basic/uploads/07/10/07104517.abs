Title: Gravity Multiplet on KS and BB Backgrounds
Authors: A. Dymarsky and D. Melnikov
Abstract: In this paper we study the spectra of glueballs on the Klebanov-Strassler background and its extension to the baryonic branch. We numerically calculate the mass spectrum of glueballs from the spin 2 ``gravity'' multiplet, which contains the traceless part of the stress-energy tensor and the transverse part of the U(1) R-current. The mass spectra of the corresponding fluctuations in supergravity coincide due to supersymmetry, which is manifest in the effective five-dimensional theory through a Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics transformation. We show that the glueball spectra grow as m^2 ~ Un^2 for large values of the baryonic branch parameter U.
