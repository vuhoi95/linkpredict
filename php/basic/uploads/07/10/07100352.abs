Title: Small x QCD and Multigluon States: a Color Toy Model
Authors: G. P. Vacca and P. L. Iafelice
Abstract: We introduce and study a toy model with a finite number of degrees of freedom whose Hamiltonian presents the same color structure of the BKP system appearing in the studies of QCD in the Regge limit. We address within this toy model the question of the importance of finite number of color corrections with respect to the planar limit case.
