Abstract: We introduce a variety of four-dimensional N = 2 matter multiplets which have not previously appeared explicitly in the literature. Using these, we develop a class of supersymmetric actions supplying a context for a systematic exploration of N = 2 matter theories, some of which include Hypermultiplet sectors in novel ways. We construct an N = 2 supersymmetric field theory in which the propagating fields are realized off-shell exclusively as Lorentz scalars and Weyl spinors and which involves a sector with precisely the R-charge assignments characteristic of Hypermultiplets.
