Title: Electroweak Symmetry Breaking from a Holographic Fourth Generation
Authors: Gustavo Burdman and Leandro Da Rold
Abstract: We consider a model with four generations of standard model fermions propagating in an extra dimension with an AdS background metric. We show that if the zero modes of the fourth generation are highly localized towards the infrared brane, it is possible to break the electroweak symmetry via their condensation, partly driven by their interactions with the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gauge bosons, as well as by the presence of bulk higher-dimensional operators. This dynamical mechanism results in a composite Higgs, which is highly localized and generally heavy. The localization of fermions in the five-dimensional bulk naturally leads to the standard model Yukawa couplings via the action of the bulk higher-dimensional operators, which are suppressed by the Planck scale. We obtain the spectrum of the model and explore some of its phenomenological consequences, both for electroweak precision constraints as well as at the Large Hadron Collider.
