Abstract: It is shown that the generally covariant Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation, formulated in the frame of the Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko tetrad formalism, allows for a non-relativistic approximation if the metric tensor is of a special form. The Pauli equation for a vector particle involves the Riemann curvature tensor explicitly. In analogous way, the procedure of the non-relativistic approximation in the theory of scalar particle, charged and neutral, is investigated in the background of Riemannian space-time. A generalized covariant Schrodinger equation is derived when taking into account non-minimal interaction term through scalar curvature R(x), it substantially differs from the conventional generally covariant Schrodinger equation produced when R(x)=0. It is demonstrated that the the non-relativistic wave function is always complex-valued irrespective of the type of relativistic scalar particle, charged or neutral, taken initially. The theory of vector particle proves the same property: even if the wave function of the relativistic particle of spin 1 is taken real,the corresponding wave function in the non-relativistic approximation is complex-valued.
