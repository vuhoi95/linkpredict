Title: alpha'^2-corrections to extremal dyonic black holes in heterotic string  theory
Authors: Maro Cvitan and Predrag Dominis Prester and Andrej Ficnar
Abstract: We calculate alpha'^2-corrections to the entropy of the 5-dimensional 3-charge and the 4-dimensional 4-charge large extremal black holes using the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory. In the 4-dimensional case, our results are in agreement with the microscopic statistical entropy both for the BPS and the non-BPS black holes. In the more interesting 5-dimensional case, where the direct microscopic stringy description is still unknown, our results for the BPS black holes are in agreement with the results obtained from the action supplemented with R^2-correction obtained by supersymmetric completion of the gravitational Chern-Simons term. This agreement does not extend to the non-BPS black holes, for which we propose a different expression for the entropy. We show that the new expression is supported by certain alpha'^3-order calculations, and by the arguments based on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
