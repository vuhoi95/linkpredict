Title: Hawking radiation in GHS and non-extremal D1-D5 blackhole via covariant  anomalies
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Shailesh Kulkarni
Abstract: We apply the method of Banerjee and Kulkarni (arXiv:0707.2449, [hep-th]) to provide a derivation of Hawking radiation from the GHS (stringy) blackhole which falls in the class of the most general spherically symmetric blackholes ($\sqrt{-g}\neq 1$) and also the non-extremal $D1-D5$ blackhole using only covariant gravitational anomalies.
