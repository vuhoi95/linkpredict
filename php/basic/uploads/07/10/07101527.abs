Title: Vertex-algebraic structure of the principal subspaces of certain  A_1^(1)-modules, II: higher level case
Authors: Corina Calinescu and James Lepowsky and Antun Milas
Abstract: We give an a priori proof of the known presentations of (that is, completeness of families of relations for) the principal subspaces of all the standard A_1^(1)-modules. These presentations had been used by Capparelli, Lepowsky and Milas for the purpose of obtaining the classical Rogers-Selberg recursions for the graded dimensions of the principal subspaces. This paper generalizes our previous paper.
