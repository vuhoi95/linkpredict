Title: Five-dimensional Superfield Supergravity
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli
Abstract: We present a projective superspace formulation for matter-coupled simple supergravity in five dimensions. Our starting point is the superspace realization for the minimal supergravity multiplet proposed by Howe in 1981. We introduce various off-shell supermultiplets (i.e. hypermultiplets, tensor and vector multiplets) that describe matter fields coupled to supergravity. A projective-invariant action principle is given, and specific dynamical systems are constructed including supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models. We believe that this approach can be extended to other supergravity theories with eight supercharges in $D\leq 6$ space-time dimensions, including the important case of 4D N=2 supergravity.
