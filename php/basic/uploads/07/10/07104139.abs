Title: Are There Four-Dimensional Small Black Rings?
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Masaki Shigemori
Abstract: In d>4 dimensions, one can argue for the existence of small black rings using a scaling argument. We apply the same scaling argument to the d=4 case and demonstrate that it fails to say anything about the existence of d=4 small black rings, because stringy corrections get out of control. General relativity theorems say that there does not exist a black hole with toroidal topology for d=4, but we interpret this as saying that, for d=4 small black rings, stringy corrections are crucial which invalidate the assumptions those theorems are based on.
