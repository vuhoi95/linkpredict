Title: Sub-leading contributions to the black hole entropy in the brick wall  approach
Authors: Sudipta Sarkar and S. Shankaranarayanan and L. Sriramkumar
Abstract: [Abridged] We compute the canonical entropy of a quantum scalar field around static and spherically symmetric black holes through the brick wall approach at the higher orders (in fact, up to the sixth order in \hbar) in the WKB approximation. We explicitly show that the brick wall model generally predicts corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in all spacetime dimensions. In four dimensions, we find that the corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are of the form (A^n \log A), while, in six dimensions, the corrections behave as (A^m + A^n \log A), where A denotes the area of the black hole event horizon, and (m, n) < 1. We compare our results with the corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy that have been obtained through the other approaches in the literature, and discuss the implications.
