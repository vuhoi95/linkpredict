Title: Quasilocality of joining/splitting strings from coherent states
Authors: P. -Y. Casteill and R. A. Janik and A. Jarosz and C. Kristjansen
Abstract: Using the coherent state formalism we calculate matrix elements of the one-loop non-planar dilatation operator of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM between operators dual to folded Frolov-Tseytlin strings and observe a curious scaling behavior. We comment on the {\it qualitative} similarity of our matrix elements to the interaction vertex of a string field theory. In addition, we present a solvable toy model for string splitting and joining. The scaling behaviour of the matrix elements suggests that the contribution to the genus one energy shift coming from semi-classical string splitting and joining is small.
