Title: Z'-mediated Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Paul Langacker and Gil Paz and Lian-Tao Wang and Itay Yavin
Abstract: We consider a class of models in which supersymmetry breaking is communicated dominantly via a U'(1) gauge interaction, which also helps solve the \mu problem. Such models can emerge naturally in top-down constructions and are a version of split supersymmetry. The spectrum contains heavy sfermions, Higgsinos, exotics, and Z' ~ 10-100 TeV; light gauginos ~ 100-1000 GeV; a light Higgs ~ 140 GeV; and a light singlino. A specific set of U'(1) charges and exotics is analyzed, and we present five benchmark models. Implications for the gluino lifetime, cold dark matter, and the gravitino and neutrino masses are discussed.
