Title: Isotopic liftings of Clifford algebras and applications in elementary  particle mass matrices
Authors: Roldao da Rocha and Jayme Vaz Jr
Abstract: Isotopic liftings of algebraic structures are investigated in the context of Clifford algebras, where it is defined a new product involving an arbitrary, but fixed, element of the Clifford algebra. This element acts as the unit with respect to the introduced product, and is called isounit. We construct isotopies in both associative and non-associative arbitrary algebras, and examples of these constructions are exhibited using Clifford algebras, which although associative, can generate the octonionic, non-associative, algebra. The whole formalism is developed in a Clifford algebraic arena, giving also the necessary pre-requisites to introduce isotopies of the exterior algebra. The flavor hadronic symmetry of the six u,d,s,c,b,t quarks is shown to be exact, when the generators of the isotopic Lie algebra su(6) are constructed, and the unit of the isotopic Clifford algebra is shown to be a function of the six quark masses. The limits constraining the parameters, that are entries of the representation of the isounit in the isotopic group SU(6), are based on the most recent limits imposed on quark masses.
