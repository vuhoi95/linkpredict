Title: Dual Actions for Born-Infeld and Dp-Brane Theories
Authors: Rong-Xin Miao and Yan-Gang Miao and Shao-Jie Wei
Abstract: Dual actions with respect to U(1) gauge fields for Born-Infeld and $Dp$-brane theories are reexamined. Taking into account an additional condition, i.e. a corollary to the field equation of the auxiliary metric, one obtains an alternative dual action that does not involve the infinite power series in the auxiliary metric given by ref. \cite{s14}, but just picks out the first term from the series formally. New effective interactions of the theories are revealed. That is, the new dual action gives rise to an effective interaction in terms of one interaction term rather than infinite terms of different (higher) orders of interactions physically. However, the price paid for eliminating the infinite power series is that the new action is not quadratic but highly nonlinear in the Hodge dual of a $(p-1)$-form field strength. This non-linearity is inevitable to the requirement the two dual actions are equivalent.
