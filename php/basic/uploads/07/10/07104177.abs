Title: Consistent Truncation to Three Dimensional (Super-)gravity
Authors: Rajesh Kumar Gupta and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: For a general three dimensional theory of (super-)gravity coupled to arbitrary matter fields with arbitrary set of higher derivative terms in the effective action, we give an algorithm for consistently truncating the theory to a theory of pure (super-)gravity with the gravitational sector containing only Einstein-Hilbert, cosmological constant and Chern-Simons terms. We also outline the procedure for finding the parameters of the truncated theory. As an example we consider dimensional reduction on S^2 of the 5-dimensional minimal supergravity with curvature squared terms and obtain the truncated theory without any curvature squared terms. This truncated theory reproduces correctly the exact central charge of the boundary CFT.
