Title: Near Extremal Black Hole Entropy as Entanglement Entropy via AdS2/CFT1
Authors: Tatsuo Azeyanagi and Tatsuma Nishioka and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We point out that the entropy of (near) extremal black holes can be interpreted as the entanglement entropy of dual conformal quantum mechanics via AdS2/CFT1. As an explicit example, we study near extremal BTZ black holes and derive this claim from AdS3/CFT2. We also analytically compute the entanglement entropy in the two dimensional CFT of a free Dirac fermion compactified on a circle at finite temperature. From this result, we clarify the relation between the thermal entropy and entanglement entropy, which is essential for the entanglement interpretation of black hole entropy.
