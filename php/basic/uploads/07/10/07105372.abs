Title: Giant Gravitons - with Strings Attached (III)
Authors: David Bekker and Robert de Mello Koch and Michael Stephanou
Abstract: We develop techniques to compute the one-loop anomalous dimensions of operators in the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are dual to open strings ending on boundstates of sphere giant gravitons. Our results, which are applicable to excitations involving an arbitrary number of open strings, generalize the single string results of hep-th/0701067. The open strings we consider carry angular momentum on an S$^3$ embedded in the S$^5$ of the AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ background. The problem of computing the one loop anomalous dimensions is replaced with the problem of diagonalizing an interacting Cuntz oscillator Hamiltonian. Our Cuntz oscillator dynamics illustrates how the Chan-Paton factors for open strings propagating on multiple branes can arise dynamically.
