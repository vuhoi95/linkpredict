Title: Quasi-exactly solvable quasinormal modes
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho and Hing-Tong Cho
Abstract: We consider quasinormal modes with complex energies from the point of view of the theory of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) models. We demonstrate that it is possible to find new potentials which admit exactly solvable or QES quasinormal modes by suitable complexification of parameters defining the QES potentials. Particularly, we obtain one QES and four exactly solvable potentials out of the five one-dimensional QES systems based on the $sl(2)$ algebra.
