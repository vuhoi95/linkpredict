Title: CPT theorem in a (5+1) Galilean space-time
Authors: M. Kobayashi and M. de Montigny and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: We extend the 5-dimensional Galilean space-time to a (5+1) Galilean space-time in order to define a parity transformation in a covariant manner. This allows us to discuss the discrete symmetries in the Galilean space-time, which is embedded in the (5+1) Minkowski space-time. We discuss the Dirac-type field, for which we give the 8\times 8 gamma matrices explicitly. We demonstrate that the CPT theorem holds in the (5+1) Galilean space-time.
