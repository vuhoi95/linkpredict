Title: Gauge-Dependence of Green's Functions in QCD and QED
Authors: K. Nishijima and A. Tureanu
Abstract: When all Green's functions are known in a given gauge we may raise a question of whether it is possible or not to derive the corresponding ones in a different gauge. The answer is negative in QCD but affirmative in QED provided that we confine ourselves to the covariant gauge characterized by a gauge parameter $\alpha$. We shall discuss the physical significance of this conclusion.
