Title: A new perspective on the Frenkel-Zhu fusion rule theorem
Authors: Alex J. Feingold and Stefan Fredenhagen
Abstract: In this paper we prove a formula for fusion coefficients of affine Kac-Moody algebras first conjectured by Walton [Wal2], and rediscovered in [Fe]. It is a reformulation of the Frenkel-Zhu affine fusion rule theorem [FZ], written so that it can be seen as a beautiful generalization of the classical Parasarathy-Ranga Rao-Varadarajan tensor product theorem [PRV].
