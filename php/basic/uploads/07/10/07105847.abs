Title: Deformed Reissner--Nordstrom solutions in noncommutative gravity
Authors: Pradip Mukherjee and Anirban Saha
Abstract: The leading order corrections to Reissner--Nordstrom solutions of the Einstein's equations on noncommutative space time have been worked out basing on a noncommutative gauge theory of gravity. From the corrcted metric the horizons have been derived and the curvature scalar is also computed. The introduction of noncommutativity leads to the removal of the coordinate singularities.
