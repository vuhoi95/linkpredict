Title: Scattering of Noncommutative Waves and Solitons in a Supersymmetric  Chiral Model in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Christian Gutschwager and Tatiana A. Ivanova and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: Interactions of noncommutative waves and solitons in 2+1 dimensions can be analyzed exactly for a supersymmetric and integrable U(n) chiral model extending the Ward model. Using the Moyal-deformed dressing method in an antichiral superspace, we construct explicit time-dependent solutions of its noncommutative field equations by iteratively solving linear equations. The approach is illustrated by presenting scattering configurations for two noncommutative U(2) plane waves and for two noncommutative U(2) solitons as well as by producing a noncommutative U(1) two-soliton bound state.
