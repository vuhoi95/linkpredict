Title: D1-brane in beta-Deformed Background
Authors: J. Kluson and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study various configurations of rotating and wound D1-brane in AdS_5\times S^5 background and in its beta deformed version. We find giant magnon and spike solutions on the world-volume of D1-brane in AdS_5\times S^5 background. We also analyse the equations of motion of D1-brane in beta-deformed background. We show that in the limit of large electric flux on world-volume of D1-brane they reduce to the equations that describe collection of large number of fundamental strings. We also construct rotating and wound D1-brane solution that has two equal spins on S^5_\gamma.
