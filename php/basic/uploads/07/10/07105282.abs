Title: Scalar Field Equations from Quantum Gravity during Inflation
Authors: E. O. Kahya and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We exploit a previous computation of the self-mass-squared from quantum gravity to include quantum corrections to the scalar evolution equation. The plane wave mode functions are shown to receive no significant one loop corrections at late times. This result probably applies as well to the inflaton of scalar-driven inflation. If so, there is no significant correction to the $\phi \phi$ correlator that plays a crucial role in computations of the power spectrum.
