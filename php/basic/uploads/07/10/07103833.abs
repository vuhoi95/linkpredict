Title: A silence black hole: Hawking radiation at the Hagedorn temperature
Authors: O. Lorente-Espin and P. Talavera
Abstract: We compute semi-classically the Hawking emission for different types of black hole in type II string theory. In particular we analyze the thermal transition between NS5 branes and Little String Theory, finding compelling evidence for information recovering. We find that once the near horizon limit is taken the emission of a full family of models is exactly thermal even if back-reaction is taken into account. Consequently these theories are non-unitary and can not convey any information about the black hole internal states. It is argue that this behaviour matches the string theory expectations. We suggest a plausible reason for the vanishing of the jet-quenching parameter in such theories.
