Title: Modified f(R) gravity unifying R^m inflation with \LambdaCDM epoch
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We consider modified $f(R)$ gravity which may unify $R^m$ early-time inflation with late-time $\Lambda$CDM epoch. It is shown that such model passes the local tests (Newton law, stability of Earth-like gravitational solution, very heavy mass for additional scalar degree of freedom) and suggests the realistic alternative for General Relativity. Various scenarios for future evolution of $f(R)$ $\Lambda$CDM era are discussed.
