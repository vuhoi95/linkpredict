Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems that show statistical properties very distinct from those of bosons or fermions. While their isolated observation has not yet been achieved, here we perform a quantum simulation of anyons on the toric code model. By encoding the model in the multi-partite entangled state of polarized photons, we are able to demonstrate various manipulations of anyonic states and, in particular, their characteristic fractional statistics.
