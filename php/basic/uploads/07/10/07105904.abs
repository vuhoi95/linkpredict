Title: Thermodynamical limit of general gl(N) spin chains II: Excited states  and energies
Authors: N. Crampe and L. Frappat and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We consider the thermodynamical limit of a gl(N) spin chain with arbitrary representation at each site of the chain. We consider excitations (with holes and new strings) above the vacuum and compute their corrections in 1/L to the densities and the energy.
