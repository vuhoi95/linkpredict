Title: Strongly Coupled Plasma Liquids
Authors: Z. Donko and P. Hartmann and G. J. Kalman
Abstract: This paper intends to review some of the prominent properties of strongly coupled classical plasmas having in mind the possible link with the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. Thermodynamic and transport properties of classical liquid-state one-component plasmas are described and features of collective excitations are presented.
