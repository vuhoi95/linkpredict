Authors: Luis C. B. Crispino and Atsushi Higuchi and George E. A. Matsas
Abstract: It has been thirty years since the discovery of the Unruh effect. It has played a crucial role in our understanding that the particle content of a field theory is observer dependent. This effect is important in its own right and as a way to understand the phenomenon of particle emission from black holes and cosmological horizons. Here, we review the Unruh effect with particular emphasis to its applications. We also comment on a number of recent developments and discuss some controversies. Effort is also made to clarify what seems to be common misconceptions.
