Title: Circumventing the No-Go Theorem in Noncommutative Gauge Field Theory
Authors: Masato Arai and Sami Saxell and Anca Tureanu and Nobuhiro Uekusa
Abstract: Stringent restrictions for model building are imposed by a no-go theorem in noncommutative gauge field theory. Circumventing this theorem is crucial for the construction of realistic models of particle interactions. To this end, the noncommutative construction of tensor representations of gauge groups using half-infinite Wilson lines is extended to allow for gauge groups consisting of an arbitrary number of $U_*(N)$ factors. This as well allows representations other than the ones permitted by the no-go theorem.
