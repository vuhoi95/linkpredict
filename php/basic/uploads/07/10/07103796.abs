Title: Sweet Spot Supersymmetry and Composite Messengers
Authors: Masahiro Ibe and Ryuichiro Kitano
Abstract: Sweet spot supersymmetry is a phenomenologically and cosmologically perfect framework to realize a supersymmetric world at short distance. We discuss a class of dynamical models of supersymmetry breaking and its mediation whose low-energy effective description falls into this framework. Hadron fields in the dynamical models play a role of the messengers of the supersymmetry breaking. As is always true in the models of the sweet spot supersymmetry, the messenger scale is predicted to be 10^5 GeV < M_mess < 10^{10} GeV. Various values of the effective number of messenger fields N_mess are possible depending on the choice of the gauge group.
