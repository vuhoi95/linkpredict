Title: Conformal invariance and finiteness theorems for non-planar  beta-deformed N=4 SYM theory
Authors: Federico Elmetti and Andrea Mauri and Marco Pirrone
Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of non-planar beta-deformed N=4 SYM theory using the coupling constant reduction (CCR) formalism. We show that up to order g^10, differently from the planar case, we can remove the scheme dependence in the definition of the theory without reducing to the real beta case. We also compute the gauge beta function up to four loops and see that the generalized finiteness theorems proposed in [hep-th: 0705.1483] still hold.
