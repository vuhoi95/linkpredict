Title: Renormalization of Orientable Non-Commutative Complex $Î¦^6_3$ Model
Authors: Zhituo Wang and Shaolong Wan
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the Grosse-Wulkenhaar type non-commutative orientable complex scalar $\phi^6_3$ theory, with two non-commutative coordinates and the third one commuting with the other two, is renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory. Our proof relies on a multiscale analysis in x space.
