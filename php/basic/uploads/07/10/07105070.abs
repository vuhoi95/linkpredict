Title: Non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory: Associated, color and  color-acoustic metrics for the Wu-Yang monopole model
Authors: A. B. Balakin and H. Dehnen and A. E. Zayats
Abstract: We discuss a non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs model with uniaxial anisotropy in the group space associated with the Higgs field. We apply this theory to the problem of propagation of color and color-acoustic waves in the gravitational background related to the non-minimal regular Wu-Yang monopole.
