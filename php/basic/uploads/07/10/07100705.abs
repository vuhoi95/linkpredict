Title: Hopf Algebras and Congruence Subgroups
Authors: Yorck Sommerhaeuser and Yongchang Zhu
Abstract: We prove that the kernel of the natural action of the modular group on the center of the Drinfel'd double of a semisimple Hopf algebra is a congruence subgroup. To do this, we introduce a class of generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators and endow it with an action of the modular group that is compatible with the original one.
