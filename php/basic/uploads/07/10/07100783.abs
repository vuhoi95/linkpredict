Title: Kramers-Wannier dualities for WZW theories and minimal models
Authors: Christoph Schweigert and Efrossini Tsouchnika
Abstract: We study Kramers-Wannier dualities for Wess-Zumino-Witten theories and (super-)minimal models in the Cardy case, i.e. the case with bulk partition function given by charge conjugation. Using the TFT approach to full rational conformal field theories, we classify those dualities that preserve all chiral symmetries. Dualities turn out to exist for small levels only.
