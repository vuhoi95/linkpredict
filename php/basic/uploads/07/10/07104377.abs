Title: Deformation of Dijkgraaf-Vafa Relation via Spontaneously Broken N=2  Supersymmetry II
Authors: Hiroshi Itoyama and Kazunobu Maruyoshi
Abstract: We consider the matter induced part of the effective superpotential of N=2, U(N) gauge model in which N=2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=1, by using the properties of the chiral ring and the generalized Konishi anomaly equations derived in our previous paper arXiv:0704.1060. It is shown that the effective superpotential is related to the planar free energy of the matrix model by a formula which consists of two parts -- the well-known part due to Dijkgraaf-Vafa and the part that acts as a deformation of the couplings. These couplings are those of the original bare prepotential in the action and at the same time matrix model couplings.
