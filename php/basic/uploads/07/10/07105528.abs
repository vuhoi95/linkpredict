Title: Massive Vector Scattering in Lee-Wick Gauge Theory
Authors: Benjamin Grinstein and Donal O'Connell and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: We demonstrate that amplitudes describing scattering of longitudinally polarized massive vector bosons present in non-Abelian Lee-Wick gauge theory do not grow with energy and, hence, satisfy the constraints imposed by perturbative unitarity. This result contrasts with the widely-known violation of perturbative unitarity in the standard model with a very heavy Higgs. Our conclusions are valid to all orders of perturbation theory and depend on the existence of a formulation of the theory in which all operators are of dimension four or less. This can be thought of as a restriction on the kinds of higher dimension operator which can be included in the higher derivative formulation of the theory.
