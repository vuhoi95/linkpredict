Abstract: We describe the Seiberg-Witten map for the 4D noncommutative BF theory (NCBF). We establish the existence of a map taking the abelian NCBF into its commutative version, in agreement with the hypothesis that such maps are available for any noncommutative theory with Schwarz type topological sectors.
