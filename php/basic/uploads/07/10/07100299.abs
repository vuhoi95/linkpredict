Title: Nonabelian solutions in a Melvin magnetic universe
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We show the existence of D=4 nonabelian solutions approaching asymptotically a dilatonic Melvin spacetime background. An exact solution generalizing the Chamseddine-Volkov soliton for a nonzero external U(1) magnetic field is also reported.
