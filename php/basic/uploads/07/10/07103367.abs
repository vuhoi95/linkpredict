Title: Schiff Theorem Revisited
Authors: R. A. Sen'kov and N. Auerbach and V. V. Flambaum and V. G. Zelevinsky
Abstract: We carefully rederive the Schiff theorem and prove that the usual expression of the Schiff moment operator is correct and should be applied for calculations of atomic electric dipole moments. The recently discussed corrections to the definition of the Schiff moment are absent.
