Title: Enhanced symmetry points and metastable supersymmetry breaking along  pseudo-runaway directions
Authors: Rouven Essig and Kuver Sinha and Gonzalo Torroba
Abstract: We construct a model with long-lived metastable vacua in which all the relevant parameters, including the supersymmetry breaking scale, are generated dynamically by dimensional transmutation. The metastable vacua appear along a pseudo-runaway direction near a point of enhanced symmetry as a result of a balance between non-perturbative and perturbative quantum effects. We show that metastable supersymmetry breaking is a rather generic feature near certain enhanced symmetry points of gauge theory moduli spaces.
