Title: A note on perturbative aspects of Leigh-Strassler deformed N=4 SYM  theory
Authors: Kallingalthodi Madhu and Suresh Govindarajan
Abstract: We carry out a perturbative study of the Leigh-Strassler deformed N=4 SYM theory in order to verify that the trihedral Delta(27) symmetry holds in the quantum theory. We show that the Delta(27) symmetry is preserved to two loops (at finite N) by explicitly computing the superpotential. The perturbative superpotential is not holomorphic in the couplings due to finite contributions. However, there exist coupling constant redefinitions that restore holomorphy. Interestingly, the same redefinitions appear (in the work of Jack, Jones and North[hep-ph/9603386]) if one requires the three-loop anomalous dimension to vanish in a theory where the one-loop anomalous dimension vanishes. However, the two field redefinitions seem to differ by a factor of two.
