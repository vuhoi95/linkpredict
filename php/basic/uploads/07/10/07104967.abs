Title: Black Holes in Supergravity: the non-BPS Branch
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Finn Larsen and Joan Simon
Abstract: We construct extremal, spherically symmetric black hole solutions to 4D supergravity with charge assignments that preclude BPS-saturation. In particular, we determine the ground state energy as a function of charges and moduli. We find that the mass of the non-BPS black hole remains that of a marginal bound state of four basic constituents throughout the entire moduli space and that there is always a non-zero gap above the BPS bound.
