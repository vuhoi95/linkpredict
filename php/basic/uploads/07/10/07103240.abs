Title: Hawking radiation in a Rotating Kaluza-Klein Black Hole with Squashed  Horizons
Authors: Songbai Chen and Bin Wang and Ru-Keng Su
Abstract: We explore the signature of the extra dimension in the Hawking radiation in a rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed horizons. Comparing with the spherical case, we find that the rotating parameter brings richer physics. We obtain the appropriate size of the extra dimension which can enhance the Hawking radiation and may open a window to detect the extra dimensions.
