Title: New non-abelian effects on D branes
Authors: Roberto Iengo and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We extend the Myers dielectric effect to configurations with angular momentum. The resulting time-dependent N D0 brane bound states can be interpreted as describing rotating fuzzy ellipsoids. A similar solution exists also in the presence of a RR magnetic field, that we study in detail. We show that, for any finite N, above a certain critical angular momentum is energetically more favorable for the bound state system to dissociate into an abelian configuration of N D0 branes moving independently. We have investigated this problem in the low-energy expansion of the non-abelian D brane action for generic N. In the case N=2 we find explicit solutions of the full non-abelian Born-Infeld D brane dynamics, which remarkably have the same structure and confirm the features of the low-energy approximation. We further study D string configurations representing fuzzy funnels deformed by the magnetic field and by the rotational motion.
