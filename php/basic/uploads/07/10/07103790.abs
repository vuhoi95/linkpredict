Abstract: We investigate the existence of brane solutions in braneworld scenarios described by real scalar field in the presence of modified $f(R)$ gravity with a single extra dimension. In the case of constant curvature, we obtain first-order differential equations which solve the equations of motion and ease the search for explicit analytical solutions. Several examples of current interest are investigated to illustrate the results of the present work.
