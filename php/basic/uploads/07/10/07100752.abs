Title: The Einstein-Yang-Mills equations from Bianchi identities
Authors: Christian G. Boehmer and Luca Fabbri
Abstract: We suggest a novel extension to the Kaluza-Klein scheme that allows us to obtain consistently all SU(n) Einstein-Yang-Mills theories. This construction is based on allowing the five-dimensional spacetime to carry some non-vanishing torsion; however, the four-dimensional spacetime remains intrinsically torsion-free.
