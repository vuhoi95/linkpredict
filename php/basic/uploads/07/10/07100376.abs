Title: Equivalence of QCD in the epsilon-regime and chiral Random Matrix Theory  with or without chemical potential
Authors: Francesco Basile and Gernot Akemann
Abstract: We prove that QCD in the epsilon-regime of chiral Perturbation Theory is equivalent to chiral Random Matrix Theory for zero and both non-zero real and imaginary chemical potential mu. To this aim we prove a theorem that relates integrals over fermionic and bosonic variables to super-Hermitian or super-Unitary groups also called superbosonization. Our findings extend previous results for the equivalence of the partition functions, spectral densities and the quenched two-point densities. We can show that all k-point density correlation functions agree in both theories for an arbitrary number of quark flavors, for either mu=0 or mu=/=0 taking real or imaginary values. This implies the equivalence for all individual k-th eigenvalue distributions which are particularly useful to determine low energy constants from Lattice QCD with chiral fermions.
