Title: Boundary action of the H3+ model
Authors: V. Fateev and S. Ribault
Abstract: We find the boundary action for Euclidean AdS2 D-branes in H3+. This action is consistent with the D-branes' symmetries and with the H3+-Liouville relation for disc correlators. It can be used for performing free-field calculations in the H3+ model with boundaries. We explicitly perform the Coulomb-like integrals which appear in the free-field calculation of the bulk one-point function, and find agreement with previously known conformal bootstrap results.
