Title: Mesons in marginally deformed AdS/CFT
Authors: Silvia Penati and Marco Pirrone and CarloAlberto Ratti
Abstract: We study the embedding of spacetime filling D7-branes in beta-deformed backgrounds which, according to the AdS/CFT dictionary, corresponds to flavoring beta-deformed N=4 super Yang-Mills. We consider supersymmetric and more general non-supersymmetric three parameter deformations. The equations of motion for quadratic fluctuations of a probe D7-brane wrapped on a deformed three-sphere exhibit a non-trivial coupling between scalar and vector modes induced by the deformation. Nevertheless, we manage to solve them analytically and find that the mesonic mass spectrum is discrete, with a mass gap and a Zeeman-like splitting occurs. Finally we propose the action for the dual field theory as obtained by star-product deformation of super Yang-Mills with fundamental matter.
