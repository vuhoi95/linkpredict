Title: Spectrum-Generating Algebra for Charged Superstrings in Background Gauge  Fields
Authors: Akira Kokado and Gaku Konisi and Takesi Saito
Abstract: The spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) for charged superstrings placed in constant background magnetic fields is constructed. Contrary to the neutral string this algebra is characteristic of including the cyclotron frequency. The Regge intercept and superconformal anomalies are calculated to be shifted by the cyclotron frequency and D-brane parameters from the conventional values.
