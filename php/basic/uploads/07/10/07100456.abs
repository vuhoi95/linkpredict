Title: Hawking Radiation via Higher-spin Gauge Anomalies
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Takeshi Morita and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: We give a higher-spin generalization of the anomaly method for the Hawking radiation from black holes. In the paper arXiv:0710.0453 higher-spin generalizations of the gauge (and gravitational) anomalies in d=2 were obtained. By applying these anomalies to black hole physics, we derive the higher moments of the Hawking fluxes. We also give a higher-spin generalization of the trace anomaly method by Christensen and Fulling.
