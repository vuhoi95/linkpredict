Title: Noncommutative real scalar field theory in 2+1 dimensions at finite  temperature
Authors: C. D. Fosco and G. A. Silva
Abstract: We study thermal effects for a noncommutative real scalar field in 2+1 dimensions including a Grosse-Wulkenhaar term. Using a perturbative expansion for the free energy, we deduce some general properties of the corresponding contributions, in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the model can be consistently interpreted as defined on a finite volume, which is naturally determined by the noncommutativity scale.
