Title: A Note on Separability of Field Equations in Myers-Perry Spacetimes
Authors: Keiju Murata and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We study separability of scalar, vector and tensor fields in 5-dimensional Myers-Perry spacetimes with equal angular momenta. In these spacetimes, there exists enlarged symmetry, $U(2) \simeq SU(2) \times U(1)$. Using the group theoretical method with a twist, we perform the dimensional reduction at the action level and show that both vector and tensor field equations can be reduced to coupled ordinary differential equations. We reveal the structure of couplings between variables. In particular, we have obtained the decoupled master equations for zero modes of a vector field. The same analysis can be done for zero modes of a tensor field. Therefore, our formalism gives a basis for studying stability of Myers-Perry black holes.
