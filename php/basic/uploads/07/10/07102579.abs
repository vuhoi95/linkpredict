Title: Baryons and the Chern-Simons term in holographic QCD with three flavors
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Masaki Murata
Abstract: We study dynamical baryons in the holographic QCD model of Sakai and Sugimoto in the case of three flavors and with special interest in the construction of the Chern-Simons (CS) term. The baryon classical solution in this model is given by the BPST instanton, and we carry out the collective coordinate quantization of the solution. The CS term should give rise to a first class constraint which selects baryon states with right spins. However, the original CS term written in terms of the CS 5-form does not work. We instead propose a new CS term which is gauge invariant and is given as an integral over a six dimensional space having as its boundary the original five dimensional spacetime of the holographic model. Collective coordinate quantization using our new CS term leads to correct baryon states and their mass formula.
