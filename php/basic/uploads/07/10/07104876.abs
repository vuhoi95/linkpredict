Title: D-term Uplifted Racetrack Inflation
Authors: Philippe Brax and Anne-Christine Davis and Stephen C. Davis and Rachel Jeannerot and Marieke Postma
Abstract: It is shown that racetrack inflation can be implemented in a moduli stabilisation scenario with a supersymmetric uplifting D-term. The resulting model is completely described by an effective supergravity theory, in contrast to the original racetrack models. We study the inflationary dynamics and show that the gaugino condensates vary during inflation. The resulting spectral index is n_s = 0.95 as in the original racetrack inflation model. Hence extra fields do not appear to alter the predictions of the model. An equivalent, simplified model with just a single field is presented.
