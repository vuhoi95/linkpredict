Title: Renormalization and Induced Gauge Action on a Noncommutative Space
Authors: Harald Grosse and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: Field theories on deformed spaces suffer from the IR/UV mxing and renormalization is generically spoiled. In work with R. Wulkenhaar, one of us realized a way to cure this desease by adding one more marginal operator. We review these ideas, show the application to $\phi^3$ models and use heat kernel expansion methods for a scalar field theory coupled to an external gauge field on a $\theta$-deformed space and derive noncommutative gauge actions.
