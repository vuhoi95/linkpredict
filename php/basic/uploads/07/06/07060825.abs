Title: Incidence of the boundary shape in the effective theory of fractional  quantum Hall edges
Authors: D. C. Cabra and N. E. Grandi
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic description of a system of strongly interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field in a finite geometry, we construct the boundary low energy effective theory for a fractional quantum Hall droplet taking into account the effects of a smooth edge. The effective theory obtained is the standard chiral boson theory (chiral Luttinger theory) with an additional self-interacting term which is induced by the boundary. As an example of the consequences of this model, we show that such modification leads to a non-universal reduction in the tunnelling exponent which is independent of the filling fraction. This is in qualitative agreement with experiments, that systematically found exponents smaller than those predicted by the ordinary chiral Luttinger liquid theory.
