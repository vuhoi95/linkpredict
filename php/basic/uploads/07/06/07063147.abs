Title: Half-Supersymmetric Solutions in Five-Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Jan B. Gutowski and Wafic A. Sabra
Abstract: We present a systematic classification of half-supersymmetric solutions of gauged N=2, D=5 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets for which at least one of the Killing spinors generate a time-like Killing vector.
