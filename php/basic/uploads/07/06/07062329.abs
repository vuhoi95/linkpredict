Title: Numerical Kaehler-Ricci soliton on the second del Pezzo
Authors: Matthew Headrick and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: The second del Pezzo surface is known by work of Tian-Zhu and Wang-Zhu to admit a unique Kaehler-Ricci soliton. Applying a method described in hep-th/0703057, we use Ricci flow to numerically compute that soliton metric. We numerically compute the value of its Perelman entropy (or Gaussian density).
