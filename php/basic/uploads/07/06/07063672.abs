Abstract: This is the 6th paper in the series developing the formalism to manage the effective scattering theory of strong interactions. Relying on the theoretical scheme suggested in our previous publications we concentrate here on the practical aspect and apply our technique to the elastic pion-nucleon scattering amplitude. We test numerically the pion-nucleon spectrum sum rules that follow from the tree level bootstrap constraints. We show how these constraints can be used to estimate the tensor and vector $NN\rho$ coupling constants. At last, we demonstrate that the tree-level low energy expansion coefficients computed in the framework of our approach show nice agreement with known experimental data. These results allow us to claim that the extended perturbation scheme is quite reasonable from the computational point of view.
