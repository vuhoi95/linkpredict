Title: Scattering of Topological Solitons on Barriers and Holes in Two λ  φ^4 Models
Authors: Jassem H. Al-Alawi and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We present results of our studies of various scattering properties of topological solitons on obstructions in the form of holes and barriers in 1+1 dimensions. Our results are based on two models involving a \phi^4 potential. The obstructions are characterised by a potential parameter, \lambda which has a non-zero value in a certain region of space and zero elsewhere. In the first model the potential parameter is included in the potential and in the second model the potential parameter is included in the metric. Our results are based on numerical simulations and analytical considerations.
