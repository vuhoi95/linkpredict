Title: On Semiclassical Limits of String States
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Alberto Iglesias and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We explore the relation between classical and quantum states in both open and closed (super)strings discussing the relevance of coherent states as a semiclassical approximation. For the closed string sector a gauge-fixing of the residual world-sheet rigid translation symmetry of the light-cone gauge is needed for the construction to be possible. The circular target-space loop example is worked out explicitly.
