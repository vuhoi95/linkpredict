Title: Do unbounded bubbles ultimately become fenced inside a black hole?
Authors: F. S. Guzman and L. Lehner and O. Sarbach
Abstract: We examine the dynamical behavior of recently introduced bubbles in asymptotically flat, five-dimensional spacetimes. Using numerical methods, we find that even bubbles that initially start expanding eventually collapse to a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole.
