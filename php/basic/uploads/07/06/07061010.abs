Title: Relativistic wave equation for one spin-1/2 and one spin-0 particle
Authors: D. A. Kulikov and R. S. Tutik
Abstract: A new approach to the two-body problem based on the extension of the $SL(2,C)$ group to the $Sp(4,C)$ one is developed. The wave equation with the Lorentz-scalar and Lorentz-vector potential interactions for the system of one spin-1/2 and one spin-0 particle with unequal masses is constructed.
