Title: Supersymmetric Hamiltonian Approach to Edge Excitations in $Î½= 5/2$  Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Ming Yu and Xin Zhang
Abstract: A supersymmetric Hamiltonian is constructed for the edge excitations of the Moore-Read (Pfaffian) like state, which is a realization of the N=2 supersymmetric CS model. Fermionic generators and their conjugates are introduced to deal with the fermion pairing, whose condensation form a BCS like state. After Bogoliubov transformation, a N=2 supersymmetric and nonrelativistic Hamiltonian is found to take a known form, which is integrable. The main difference between the Moore-Read state and our BCS like state is that the number of fermion pairs in our formalism is not fixed. However, we have also found that the excited states in our model looks similar but not exactly the same as Moore and Read's.
