Title: Anomaly Analysis of Hawking Radiation from Acoustic Black Hole
Authors: Wontae Kim and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: The Hawking radiation from the three dimensional rotating acoustic black hole is considered from the viewpoint of anomaly cancellation method initiated by Robinson and Wilczek. Quantum field near the horizon is effectively described by two dimensional charged field with a charge identified as the angular momentum m. The fluxes of charge and energy are obtained from the anomaly cancellation condition and regularity at the horizon, and are shown to match with those of the two dimensional black body radiation at the Hawking temperature.
