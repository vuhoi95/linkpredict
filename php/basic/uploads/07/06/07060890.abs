Title: Holographic Mixing Quantified
Authors: Brian Batell and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: We compute the precise elementary/composite field content of mass eigenstates in holographic duals of warped models in a slice of AdS_5. This is accomplished by decomposing the bulk fields not in the usual Kaluza-Klein basis, but rather into a holographic basis of 4D fields, corresponding to purely elementary source or CFT composite fields. Generically, this decomposition yields kinetic and mass mixing between the elementary and composite sectors of the holographic theory. Depending on where the bulk zero mode is localized, the elementary/composite content may differ radically, which we show explicitly for several examples including the bulk Randall-Sundrum graviton, bulk gauge boson, and Higgs boson.
