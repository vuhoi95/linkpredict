Title: Astrophysical Violations of the Kerr Bound as a Possible Signature of  String Theory
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Petr Horava
Abstract: In 4D general relativity, the angular momentum of a black hole is limited by the Kerr bound. We suggest that in string theory, this bound can be breached and compact black-hole-like objects can spin faster. Near such "superspinars," the efficiency of energy transfer from the accreting matter to radiation can reach 100%, compared to the maximum efficiency of 42% of the extremal Kerr (or 6% of the Schwarzschild) black hole. Finding such superspinning objects as active galactic nuclei, GBHCs, or sources of gamma ray bursts, could be viewed as experimental support for string theory.
