Title: A common limit of super Liouville theory and minimal models
Authors: Stefan Fredenhagen and David Wellig
Abstract: We show that N=1 supersymmetric Liouville theory can be continued to central charge c=3/2, and that the limiting non-rational superconformal field theory can also be obtained as a limit of supersymmetric minimal models. This generalises a result known for the non-supersymmetric case. We present explicit expressions for the three-point functions of bulk fields, as well as a set of superconformal boundary states. The main technical ingredient to take the limit of minimal models consists in determining analytic expressions for the structure constants. In the appendix we show in detail how the structure constants of supersymmetric and Virasoro minimal models can be rewritten in terms of Barnes' double gamma functions.
