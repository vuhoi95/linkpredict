Title: Electronic properties of graphene with a topological defect
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and N. D. Vlasii
Abstract: Various types of topological defects in graphene are considered in the framework of the continuum model for long-wavelength electronic excitations, which is based on the Dirac--Weyl equation. The condition for the electronic wave function is specified, and we show that a topological defect can be presented as a pseudomagnetic vortex at the apex of a graphitic nanocone; the flux of the vortex is related to the deficit angle of the cone. The cases of all possible types of pentagonal defects, as well as several types of heptagonal defects (with the numbers of heptagons up to three, and six), are analyzed. The density of states and the ground state charge are determined.
