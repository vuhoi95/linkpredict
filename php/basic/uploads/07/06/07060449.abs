Title: The dyon charge in noncommutative gauge theories
Authors: L. Cieri and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We present an explicit classical dyon solution for the noncommutative version of the Yang-Mills-Higgs model (in the Prasad-Sommerfield limit) with a tehta term. We show that the relation between classical electric and magnetic charges also holds in noncommutative space. Extending the Noether approach to the case of a noncommutative gauge theory, we analyze the effect of CP violation at the quantum level, induced both by the theta term and by noncommutativity and we prove that the Witten effect formula for the dyon charge remains the same as in ordinary space.
