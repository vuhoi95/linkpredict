Authors: P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi and Jivan Singh
Abstract: Reformulation of the generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons has been dicussed in inhomogenous media and corresponding quaternionic equations are derived in compact, simple and unique manner. We have also discussed the monochromatic fields of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons in slowly changing media in a consistent manner.
