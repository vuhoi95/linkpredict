Title: Test Functions Space in Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory
Authors: M. Chaichian and M. Mnatsakanova and A. Tureanu and Yu. Vernov
Abstract: It is proven that the $\star$-product of field operators implies that the space of test functions in the Wightman approach to noncommutative quantum field theory is one of the Gel'fand-Shilov spaces $S^{\beta}$ with $\beta < 1/2$. This class of test functions smears the noncommutative Wightman functions, which are in this case generalized distributions, sometimes called hyperfunctions. The existence and determination of the class of the test function spaces in NC QFT is important for any rigorous treatment in the Wightman approach.
