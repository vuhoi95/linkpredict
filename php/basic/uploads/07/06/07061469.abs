Title: N=4 Supersymmetric MICZ-Kepler systems on S3
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and V. Ohanyan
Abstract: Proceeding from the superfield action for $N=4, d=1$ nonlinear supermultiplet, equipped with the most general potential term, we find the action describing a charged particle on the sphere $S^3$ in the field of $n$ fixed Dirac dyons. We construct the supercharges and Hamiltonian and analyze some particulary interesting potentials corresponding to the N=4 supersymmetric extension of the integrable one- and two-center McIntosh--Cisneros--Zwanziger--Kepler (MICZ-Kepler) systems on $S^3$.
