Title: Cosmological dynamics of exponential gravity
Authors: M. Abdelwahab and S Carloni and P K. S. Dunsby
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the cosmological dynamics based on $\exp (-R/{\Lambda})$ gravity. We apply the dynamical system approach to both the vacuum and matter cases and obtain exact solutions and their stability in the finite and asymptotic regimes. The results show that cosmic histories exist which admit a double de-Sitter phase which could be useful for describing the early and the late-time accelerating universe.
