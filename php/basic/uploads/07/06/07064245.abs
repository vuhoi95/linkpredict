Title: Conformal Invariance = Finiteness and Beta Deformed N=4 SYM Theory
Authors: D. I. Kazakov and L. V. Bork
Abstract: We claim that if by a choice of the couplings the theory can be made conformally invariant (vanishing of the beta functions) it is automatically finite and vice versa. This is demonstrated by explicit example in supersymmetric gauge theory. The formalism is then applied to the beta deformed ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory and it is shown that the requirement of conformal invariance = finiteness can be achieved for any complex parameter of deformations.
