Title: Graceful exit via polymerization of pre-big bang cosmology
Authors: Giuseppe De Risi and Roy Maartens and Parampreet Singh
Abstract: We consider a phenomenological modification of the Pre Big Bang scenario using ideas from the resolution of curvature singularities in Loop Quantum Cosmology. We show that non-perturbative Loop modifications to the dynamics, arising from the underlying polymer representation, can resolve the graceful exit problem. The curvature and the dilaton energy stay finite at all times, in both the string and Einstein frames. In the string frame, the dilaton tends to a constant value at late times after the bounce.
