Title: Generalized St√§ckel Transform and Reciprocal Transformations for  Finite-Dimensional Integrable Systems
Authors: Artur Sergyeyev and Maciej Blaszak
Abstract: We present a multiparameter generalization of the St\"ackel transform (the latter is also known as the coupling-constant metamorphosis) and show that under certain conditions this generalized St\"ackel transform preserves the Liouville integrability, noncommutative integrability and superintegrability. The corresponding transformation for the equations of motion proves to be nothing but a reciprocal transformation of a special form, and we investigate the properties of this reciprocal transformation. Finally, we show that the Hamiltonians of the systems possessing separation curves of apparently very different form can be related through a suitably chosen generalized St\"ackel transform.
