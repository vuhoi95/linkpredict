Title: Growing Matter
Authors: Luca Amendola and Marco Baldi and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: We investigate quintessence cosmologies with a matter component consisting of particles with an increasing mass. While negligible in early cosmology, the appearance of a growing matter component has stopped the evolution of the cosmon field at a redshift around six. In turn, this has triggered the accelerated expansion of the Universe. We propose to associate growing matter with neutrinos. Then the presently observed dark energy density and its equation of state are determined by the neutrino mass.
