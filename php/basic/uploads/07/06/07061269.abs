Title: Metastable Vacua in Brane Worlds
Authors: E. Dudas and J. Mourad and F. Nitti
Abstract: We analyze vacuum decay in brane world setups, where a free scalar field in five dimensions has a localized potential admitting metastable vacua. We study in particular the bounce solution and its properties in flat and warped spaces. In the latter case, placing into a deeply warped region the term in the potential that lifts the vacuum degeneracy, can increase indefinitely the lifetime of the false vacuum. We discuss the application to metastable vacua in supersymmetric brane-world constructions.
