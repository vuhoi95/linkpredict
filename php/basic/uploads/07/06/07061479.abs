Title: SU(N) gauge theories in the presence of a topological term
Authors: Luigi Del Debbio and Haralambos Panagopoulos and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We review recent results on the theta dependence of the ground-state energy and spectrum of four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories, where theta is the coefficient of the CP-violating topological term F-Fdual in the Lagrangian. In particular, we discuss the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice formulation of QCD, which allow the investigation of theta dependence around theta=0 by determining the moments of the topological charge distribution, and their correlations with other observables. The results for N=3 and larger values of N support the scenario obtained by general large-N scaling arguments.
