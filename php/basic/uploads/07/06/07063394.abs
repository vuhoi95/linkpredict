Title: Black Ring Deconstruction
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Thomas S. Levi
Abstract: We present a sample microstate for a black ring in four and five dimensional language. The microstate consists of a black string microstate with an additional D6-brane. We show that with an appropriate choice of parameters the piece involving the black string microstate falls down a long AdS throat, whose M-theory lift is AdS_3 X S^2. We wrap a spinning dipole M2-brane on the S^2 in the probe approximation. In IIA, this corresponds to a dielectric D2-brane carrying only D0-charge. We conjecture this is the first approximation to a cloud of D0-branes blowing up due to their non-abelian degrees of freedom and the Myers effect.
