Title: Dimensional regularization and renormalization of non-commutative QFT
Authors: R. Gurau and A. Tanasa
Abstract: Using the recently introduced parametric representation of non-commutative quantum field theory, we implement here the dimensional regularization and renormalization of the vulcanized $\Phi^{\star 4}_4$ model on the Moyal space.
