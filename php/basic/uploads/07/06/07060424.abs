Title: Divergence of the axial current and fermion density in Gross-Neveu  models
Authors: Felix Karbstein and Michael Thies
Abstract: The divergence of the axial current is used to relate the spatial derivative of the fermion density to the bare fermion mass and scalar/pseudoscalar condensates in 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu models. This serves as a novel test of known results, to explain simple features of the continuous chiral model and to resolve a conflict concerning the assignment of baryon number to certain multi-fermion bound states.
