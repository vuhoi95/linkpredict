Title: Topological Zero-Thickness Cosmic Strings
Authors: Yi-Shi Duan and Zhen-Bin Cao
Abstract: In this paper, based on the gauge potential decomposition and the $\phi-$mapping theories, we study the topological structures and properties of the cosmic strings that arise in the Abelian-Higgs gauge theory in the zero-thickness limit. After a detailed discussion, we conclude that the topological tensor current introduced in our model is a better and more basic starting point than the generally used Nambu-Goto effective action for studying cosmic strings.
