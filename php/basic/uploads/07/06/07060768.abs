Title: Exact Heisenberg operator solutions for multi-particle quantum mechanics
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: Exact Heisenberg operator solutions for independent `sinusoidal coordinates' as many as the degree of freedom are derived for typical exactly solvable multi-particle quantum mechanical systems, the Calogero systems based on any root system. These Heisenberg operator solutions also present the explicit forms of the annihilation-creation operators for various quanta in the interacting multi-particle systems. At the same time they can be interpreted as multi-variable generalisation of the three term recursion relations for multi-variable orthogonal polynomials constituting the eigenfunctions.
