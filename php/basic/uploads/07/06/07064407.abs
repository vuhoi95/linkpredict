Title: Supersymmetric heterotic string backgrounds
Authors: Ulf Gran and George Papadopoulos and Diederik Roest
Abstract: We present the main features of the solution of the gravitino and dilatino Killing spinor equations derived in hep-th/0510176 and hep-th/0703143 which have led to the classification of geometric types of all type I backgrounds. We then apply these results to the supersymmetric backgrounds of the heterotic string. In particular, we solve the gaugino Killing spinor equation together with the other two Killing spinor equations of the theory. We also use our results to classify all supersymmetry conditions of ten-dimensional gauge theory.
