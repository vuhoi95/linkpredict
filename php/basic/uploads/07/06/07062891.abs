Title: Some exact solutions with torsion in 5-D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: F. Canfora and A. Giacomini and S. Willison
Abstract: Exact solutions with torsion in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity are derived. These solutions have a cross product structure of two constant curvature manifolds. The equations of motion give a relation for the coupling constants of the theory in order to have solutions with nontrivial torsion. This relation is not the Chern-Simons combination. One of the solutions has a $AdS_2\times S^3$ structure and is so the purely gravitational analogue of the Bertotti-Robinson space-time where the torsion can be seen as the dual of the covariantly constant electromagnetic field.
