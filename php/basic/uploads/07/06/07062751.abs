Abstract: In 1990, Dyson published a proof due to Feynman of the Maxwell equations assuming only the commutation relations between position and velocity. With this minimal assumption, Feynman never supposed the existence of Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formalism. In the present communication, we review the study of a relativistic particle using ``Feynman brackets.'' We show that Poincar\'e's magnetic angular momentum and Dirac magnetic monopole are the consequences of the structure of the Lorentz Lie algebra defined by the Feynman's brackets. Then, we extend these ideas to the dual momentum space by considering noncommutative quantum mechanics. In this context, we show that the noncommutativity of the coordinates is responsible for a new effect called the spin Hall effect. We also show its relation with the Berry phase notion. As a practical application, we found an unusual spin-orbit contribution of a nonrelativistic particle that could be experimentally tested. Another practical application is the Berry phase effect on the propagation of light in inhomogeneous media.
