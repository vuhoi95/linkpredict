Title: A Yangian Double for the AdS/CFT Classical r-matrix
Authors: Sanefumi Moriyama and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We express the classical r-matrix of AdS/CFT in terms of tensor products involving an infinite family of generators, which takes a form suggestive of the universal expression obtained from a Yangian double. This should provide an insight into the structure of the infinite dimensional symmetry algebra underlying the integrability of the model, and give a clue to the construction of its universal R-matrix. We derive the commutation relations under which the algebra of these new generators close.
