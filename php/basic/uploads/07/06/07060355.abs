Title: Dynamical Symmetries in Supersymmetric Matrix Models
Authors: Volker Bach and Jens Hoppe and Douglas Lundholm
Abstract: We reveal a dynamical SU(2) symmetry in the asymptotic description of supersymmetric matrix models. We also consider a recursive approach for determining the ground state, and point out some additional properties of the model(s).
