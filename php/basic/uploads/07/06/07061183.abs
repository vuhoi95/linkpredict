Title: Aspects of higher curvature terms and U-duality
Authors: Ling Bao and Martin Cederwall and Bengt E. W. Nilsson
Abstract: We discuss various aspects of dimensional reduction of gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action supplemented by a lowest order deformation formed as the Riemann tensor raised to powers two, three or four. In the case of R^2 we give an explicit expression, and discuss the possibility of extended coset symmetries, especially SL(n+1,Z) for reduction on an n-torus to three dimensions. Then we start an investigation of the dimensional reduction of R^3 and R^4 by calculating some terms relevant for the coset formulation, aiming in particular towards E_8(8)/(Spin(16)/Z_2) in three dimensions and an investigation of the derivative structure. We emphasise some issues concerning the need for the introduction of non-scalar automorphic forms in order to realise certain expected enhanced symmetries.
