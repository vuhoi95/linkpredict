Title: The generalized non-linear Schrodinger model on the interval
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Davide Fioravanti and Francesco Ravanini
Abstract: The generalized (1+1)-D non-linear Schrodinger (NLS) theory with particular integrable boundary conditions is considered. More precisely, two distinct types of boundary conditions, known as soliton preserving (SP) and soliton non-preserving (SNP), are implemented into the classical $gl_N$ NLS model. Based on this choice of boundaries the relevant conserved quantities are computed and the corresponding equations of motion are derived. A suitable quantum lattice version of the boundary generalized NLS model is also investigated. The first non-trivial local integral of motion is explicitly computed, and the spectrum and Bethe Ansatz equations are derived for the soliton non-preserving boundary conditions.
