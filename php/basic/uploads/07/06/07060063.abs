Title: N = 2 Supersymmetric QED equivalence of N = 2 Volkov-Akulov model
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We show explicitly in two dimensional spacetime (d = 2) that the N = 2 Volkov-Akulov model is equivalent to the spontaneously broken linear supersymmetry (LSUSY) interacting gauge theory for N = 2 vector and N = 2 scalar supermultiplets. The local gauge interaction of LSUSY is induced by the specific composite structure of the auxiliary fields and the consequent transformations.
