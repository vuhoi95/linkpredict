Title: The Black Di-Ring: An Inverse Scattering Construction
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Chethan Krishnan
Abstract: We use the inverse scattering method (ISM) to derive concentric non-supersymmetric black rings. The approach used here is fully five-dimensional, and has the modest advantage that it generalizes readily to the construction of more general axi-symmetric solutions.
