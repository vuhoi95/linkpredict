Title: Coulomb impurity in graphene
Authors: Rudro R. Biswas and Subir Sachdev and Dam T. Son
Abstract: We consider the problem of screening of an electrically charged impurity in a clean graphene sheet. When electron-electron interactions are neglected, the screening charge has a sign opposite to that of the impurity, and is localized near the impurity. Interactions between electrons smear out the induced charge density to give a large-distance tail that follows approximately, but not exactly, an r^{-2} behavior and with a sign which is the same as that of the impurity.
