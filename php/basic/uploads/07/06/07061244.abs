Title: Supersymmetric sources, integrability and generalized-structure  compactifications
Authors: Paul Koerber and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: In the context of supersymmetric compactifications of type II supergravity to four dimensions, we show that orientifold sources can be compatible with a generalized SU(3) x SU(3)-structure that is neither strictly SU(3) nor static SU(2). We illustrate this with explicit examples, obtained by suitably T-dualizing known solutions on the six-torus. In addition we prove the following integrability statements, valid under certain mild assumptions: (a) for general type II supergravity backgrounds with orientifold and/or D-brane generalized-calibrated sources, the source-corrected Einstein and dilaton equations of motion follow automatically from the supersymmetry equations once the likewise source-corrected form equations of motion and Bianchi identities are imposed; (b) in the special case of supersymmetric compactifications to four-dimensional Minkowski space, the equations of motion of all fields, including the NSNS three-form, follow automatically once the supersymmetry and the Bianchi identities of the forms are imposed. Both (a) and (b) are equally valid whether the sources are smeared or localized. As a byproduct we obtain the calibration form for a space-filling NS5-brane.
