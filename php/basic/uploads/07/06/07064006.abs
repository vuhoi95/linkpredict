Title: Gutzwiller's Trace Formula and Vacuum Pair Production
Authors: Dennis D. Dietrich and Gerald V. Dunne
Abstract: We propose a new application of the Gutzwiller trace formula formalism, to give a compact expression for the semiclassical vacuum pair production rate in quantum electrodynamics, for general inhomogeneous electromagnetic background fields.
