Title: Generalized Space-time Noncommutative Inflation
Authors: Wei Xue and Bin Chen and Yi Wang
Abstract: We study the noncommutative inflation with a time-dependent noncommutativity between space and time. From the numerical analysis of power law inflation, there are clues that the CMB spectrum indicates a nonconstant noncommutative inflation. Then we extend our treatment to the inflation models with more general noncommutativity and find that the scalar perturbation power spectrum depends sensitively on the time varying of the spacetime noncommutativity. This stringy effect may be probed in the future cosmological observations.
