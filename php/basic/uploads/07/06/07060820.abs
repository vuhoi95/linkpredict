Title: On the Poisson-Lie T-plurality of boundary conditions
Authors: Cecilia Albertsson and Ladislav Hlavaty and Libor Snobl
Abstract: Conditions for the gluing matrix defining consistent boundary conditions of two-dimensional nonlinear sigma-models are analyzed and reformulated. Transformation properties of the right-invariant fields under Poisson-Lie T-plurality are used to derive a formula for the transformation of the boundary conditions. Examples of transformation of D-branes in two and three dimensions are presented. We investigate obstacles arising in this procedure and propose possible solutions.
