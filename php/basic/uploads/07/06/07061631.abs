Title: Action Principle and Algebraic Approach to Gauge Transformations in  Gauge Theories
Authors: Edouard B. Manoukian and Suppiya Siranan
Abstract: The action principle is used to derive, by an entirely algebraic approach, gauge transformations of the full vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude (generating functional) from the Coulomb gauge to arbitrary covariant gauges and in turn to the celebrated Fock-Schwinger (FS) gauge for the abelian (QED) gauge theory without recourse to path integrals or to commutation rules and without making use of delta functionals. The interest in the FS gauge, in particular, is that it leads to Faddeev-Popov ghosts-free non-abelian gauge theories. This method is expected to be applicable to non-abelian gauge theories including supersymmetric ones.
