Title: Properties of noncommutative axionic electrodynamics
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Iv√°n Schmidt
Abstract: Using the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism, we compute the static quantum potential for noncommutative axionic electrodynamics, and find a radically different result than the corresponding commutative case. We explicitly show that the static potential profile is analogous to that encountered in both non-Abelian axionic electrodynamics and in Yang-Mills theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale symmetry.
