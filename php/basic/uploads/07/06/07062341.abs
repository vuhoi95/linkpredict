Title: Tri-Bimaximal Neutrino Mixing and the Family Symmetry Z_7 x Z_3
Authors: Christoph Luhn and Salah Nasri and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: The Non-Abelian finite group PSL_2(7) is the only simple subgroup of SU(3) with a complex three-dimensional irreducible representation. It has two maximal subgroups, S_4 which, along with its own A_4 subgroup, has been successfully applied in numerous models of flavor, as well as the 21 element Frobenius group Z_7 x Z_3, which has gained much less attention. We show that it can also be used to generate tri-bimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector, while allowing for quark and charged lepton hierarchies.
