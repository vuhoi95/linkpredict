Title: Perturbative study of the transfer matrix on the string worldsheet in  AdS(5)xS(5)
Authors: Andrei Mikhailov and Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Quantum non-local charges are central to the quantum integrability of a sigma-model. In this paper we study the quantum consistency and UV finiteness of non-local charges of string theory in AdS(5)xS(5). We use the pure spinor formalism. We develop the near-flat space expansion of the transfer matrix and calculate the one-loop divergences. We find that the logarithmic divergences cancel at the level of one loop. This gives strong support to the quantum integrability of the full string theory. We develop a calculational setup for the renormalization group analysis of Wilson line type of operators on the string worldsheet.
