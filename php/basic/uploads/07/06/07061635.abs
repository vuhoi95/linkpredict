Title: D-brane States and Disk Amplitudes in OSp Invariant Closed String Field  Theory
Authors: Yutaka Baba and Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: We construct solitonic states in the OSp invariant string field theory, which are BRST invariant in the leading order of regularization parameter $\epsilon$. We calculate the disk amplitudes using these solitonic states and show that they describe D-branes and ghost D-branes.
