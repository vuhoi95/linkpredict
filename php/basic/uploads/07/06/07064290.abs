Title: Heterotic Kahler/non-Kahler Transitions
Authors: Melanie Becker and Li-Sheng Tseng and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: We show how two topologically distinct spaces - the Kahler K3 x T^2 and the non-Kahler T^2 bundle over K3 - can be smoothly connected in heterotic string theory. The transition occurs when the base K3 is deformed to the T^4/Z_2 orbifold limit. The orbifold theory can be mapped via duality to M-theory on K3 x K3 where the transition corresponds to an exchange of the two K3's.
