Authors: Spyros D. Avramis and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Konstadinos Siampos
Abstract: We extend our earlier work, regarding the perturbative stability of string configurations used for computing the interaction potential of heavy quarks within the gauge/gravity correspondence, to cover a more general class of gravity duals. We provide results, mostly based on analytic methods and corroborated by numerical calculations, which apply to strings in a general class of backgrounds that encompass boosted, spinning and marginally-deformed D3-brane backgrounds. For the case of spinning branes we demonstrate in a few examples that perturbative stability of strings requires strong conditions complementing those following by thermodynamic stability of the dual field theories. For marginally-deformed backgrounds, we find that even in the conformal case stability may require an upper value for the imaginary part of the deformation parameter, whereas in regions of the Coulomb branch where there exists linear confinement we find that there exist stable string configurations for certain ranges of values of this parameter. We finally discuss the case of open strings with fixed endpoints propagating in Rindler space, which turns out to have an exact classical-mechanical analog.
