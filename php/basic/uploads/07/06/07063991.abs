Title: A Quiver of Many Runaways
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Cyril Closset
Abstract: We study the quantum corrections to the moduli space of the quiver gauge theory corresponding to regular and fractional D3-branes at the dP_1 singularity. We find that besides the known runaway behavior at the lowest step of the duality cascade, there is a runaway direction along a mesonic branch at every higher step of the cascade. Moreover, the algebra of the chiral operators which obtain the large expectation values is such that we reproduce Altmann's first order deformation of the dP_1 cone.
