Title: Cascade of Gregory-Laflamme Transitions and U(1) Breakdown in Super  Yang-Mills
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Tatsuma Nishioka
Abstract: In this paper we consider black p-branes on square torus. We find an indication of a cascade of Gregory-Laflamme transitions between black p-brane and (p-1)-brane. Through AdS/CFT correspondence, these transitions are related to the breakdown of the U(1) symmetry in super Yang-Mills on torus. We argue a relationship between the cascade and recent Monte-Carlo data.
