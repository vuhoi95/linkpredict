Title: Level-rank duality of untwisted and twisted D-branes of the so(N)_K WZW  model
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Benjamin H. Ripman
Abstract: We analyze the level-rank duality of untwisted and epsilon-twisted D-branes of the so(N)_K WZW model. Untwisted D-branes of so(N)_K are characterized by integrable tensor and spinor representations of so(N)_K. Level-rank duality maps untwisted so(N)_K D-branes corresponding to (equivalence classes of) tensor representations onto those of so(K)_N. The epsilon-twisted D-branes of so(2n)_2k are characterized by (a subset of) integrable tensor and spinor representations of so(2n-1)_2k+1. Level-rank duality maps spinor epsilon-twisted so(2n)_2k D-branes onto those of so(2k)_2n. For both untwisted and epsilon-twisted D-branes, we prove that the spectrum of an open string ending on these D-branes is isomorphic to the spectrum of an open string ending on the level-rank-dual D-branes.
