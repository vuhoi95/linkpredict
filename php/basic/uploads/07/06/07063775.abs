Title: How particles emerge from decaying classical fields in heavy ion  collisions: towards a kinetic description of the Glasma
Authors: F. Gelis and S. Jeon and R. Venugopalan
Abstract: We develop the formalism discussed previously in hep-ph/0601209 and hep-ph/0605246 to construct a kinetic theory that provides insight into the earliest ``Glasma'' stage of a high energy heavy ion collision. Particles produced from the decay of classical fields in the Glasma obey a Boltzmann equation whose novel features include an inhomogeneous source term and new contributions to the collision term. We discuss the power counting associated with the different terms in the Boltzmann equation and outline the transition from the field dominated regime to the particle dominated regime in high energy heavy ion collisions.
