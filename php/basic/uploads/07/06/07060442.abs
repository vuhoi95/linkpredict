Title: Spiky Strings, Giant Magnons and beta-deformations
Authors: N. P. Bobev and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We study rigid string solutions rotating on the S^3 subspace of the beta-deformed AdS_5xS^5 background found by Lunin and Maldacena. For particular values of the parameters of the solutions we find the known giant magnon and single spike strings. We present a single spike string solution on the deformed S^3 and find how the deformation affects the dispersion relation. The possible relation of this string solution to spin chains and the connection of the solutions on the undeformed S^3 to the sine-Gordon model are briefly discussed.
