Title: Chromo-electric Yang-Mills gauge fields
Authors: Vinod Chandra and Ravindra Kumar
Abstract: We obtain static gauge field configurations for SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge theory in the absence of chromo-magnetic field. We also present a systematic way to obtain such configurations for SU(3) and SU(4) YM gauge theories by realizing their Lie algebras in terms of SU(2). Generalization of our method to SU(N) gauge theory with N>2 is straight forward. The gauge fields thus obtained are complex. We investigated the issue of uniform as well as real chromo-electric field with these configurations. Furthermore, we investigated the possible class of vacuum solutions for the gauge fields and found that they are gauge inequivalent to the usual vacuum configuration $A^a_{\mu}=0$.
