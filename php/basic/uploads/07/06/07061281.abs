Abstract: We compute the Coleman Weinberg effective potential for the Higgs field in RS Gauge-Higgs unification scenarios based on a bulk SO(5) x U(1)_X gauge symmetry, with gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk and a custodial symmetry protecting the generation of large corrections to the T parameter and the coupling of the Z to the bottom quark. We demonstrate that electroweak symmetry breaking may be realized, with proper generation of the top and bottom quark masses for the same region of bulk mass parameters that lead to good agreement with precision electroweak data in the presence of a light Higgs. We compute the Higgs mass and demonstrate that for the range of parameters for which the Higgs boson has Standard Model-like properties, the Higgs mass is naturally in a range that varies between values close to the LEP experimental limit and about 160 GeV. This mass range may be probed at the Tevatron and at the LHC. We analyze the KK spectrum and briefly discuss the phenomenology of the light resonances arising in our model.
