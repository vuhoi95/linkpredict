Title: Dirac Equation Studies in the Tunnelling Energy Zone
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Pietro Rotelli
Abstract: We investigate the tunnelling zone V0 < E < V0+m for a one-dimensional potential within the Dirac equation. We find the appearance of superluminal transit times akin to the Hartman effect.
