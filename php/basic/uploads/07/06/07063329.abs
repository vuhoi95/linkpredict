Title: Dirac Cat States in Relativistic Landau Levels
Authors: A. Bermudez and M. A. Martin-Delgado and E. Solano
Abstract: We show that a relativistic version of Schrodinger cat states, here called Dirac cat states, can be built in relativistic Landau levels when an external magnetic field couples to a relativistic spin 1/2 charged particle. Under suitable initial conditions, the associated Dirac equation produces unitarily Dirac cat states involving the orbital quanta of the particle in a well defined mesoscopic regime. We demonstrate that the proposed Dirac cat states have a purely relativistic origin and cease to exist in the non-relativistic limit. In this manner, we expect to open relativistic quantum mechanics to the rich structures of quantum optics and quantum information.
