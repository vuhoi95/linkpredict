Title: Quantum and semiclassical phase functions for the quantization of  symmetric oscillators
Authors: A. Matzkin and M. Lombardi
Abstract: We investigate symmetric oscillators, and in particular their quantization, by employing semiclassical and quantum phase functions introduced in the context of Liouville-Green transformations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. For anharmonic oscillators, first order semiclassical quantization is seldom accurate and the higher order expansions eventually break down given the asymptotic nature of the series. A quantum phase that allows in principle to retrieve the exact quantum mechanical quantization condition and wavefunctions is given along with an iterative scheme to compute it. The arbitrariness surrounding quantum phase functions is lifted by supplementing the phase with boundary conditions involving high order semiclassical expansions. This allows to extend the definition of oscillation numbers, that determine the quantization of the harmonic oscillator, to the anharmonic case. Several illustrations involving homogeneous as well as coupling constant dependant anharmonic oscillators are given.
