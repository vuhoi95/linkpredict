Title: Holographic spectral functions and diffusion constants for fundamental  matter
Authors: Robert C. Myers and Andrei O. Starinets and Rowan M. Thomson
Abstract: The holographic dual of large-Nc super-Yang-Mills coupled to a small number of flavours of fundamental matter, Nf << Nc, is described by Nf probe D7-branes in the gravitational background of Nc black D3-branes. This system undergoes a first order phase transition characterised by the `melting' of the mesons. We study the high temperature phase in which the D7-branes extend through the black hole horizon. In this phase, we compute the spectral function for vector, scalar and pseudoscalar modes on the D7-brane probe. We also compute the diffusion constant for the flavour currents.
