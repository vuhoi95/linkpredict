Title: Meta-stable A_n quiver gauge theories
Authors: A. Amariti and L. Girardello and A. Mariotti
Abstract: We study metastable dynamical breaking of supersymmetry in A_n quiver gauge theories. We present a general analysis and criteria for the perturbative existence of metastable vacua in quivers of any length. Different mechanisms of gauge mediation can be realized.
