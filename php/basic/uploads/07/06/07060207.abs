Title: No-ghost theorem for the fourth-order derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck  oscillator model
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Philip D. Mannheim
Abstract: Contrary to common belief, it is shown that theories whose field equations are higher than second order in derivatives need not be stricken with ghosts. In particular, the prototypical fourth-order derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator model is shown to be free of states of negative energy or negative norm. When correctly formulated (as a $\cP\cT$ symmetric theory), the theory determines its own Hilbert space and associated positive-definite inner product. In this Hilbert space the model is found to be a fully acceptable quantum-mechanical theory that exhibits unitary time evolution.
