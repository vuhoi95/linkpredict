Title: Overspinning a nearly extreme charged black hole via a quantum tunneling  process
Authors: George E. A. Matsas and Andr√© R. R. da Silva
Abstract: We examine a nearly extreme macroscopic Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in the context of semi-classical gravity. The absorption rate associated with the quantum tunneling process of scalar particles whereby this black hole can acquire enough angular momentum to violate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is shown to be nonzero.
