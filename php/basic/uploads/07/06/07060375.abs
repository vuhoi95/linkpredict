Title: A 2D model of Causal Set Quantum Gravity: The emergence of the continuum
Authors: Graham Brightwell and Joe Henson and Sumati Surya
Abstract: Non-perturbative theories of quantum gravity inevitably include configurations that fail to resemble physically reasonable spacetimes at large scales. Often, these configurations are entropically dominant and pose an obstacle to obtaining the desired classical limit. We examine this "entropy problem" in a model of causal set quantum gravity corresponding to a discretisation of 2D spacetimes. Using results from the theory of partial orders we show that, in the large volume or continuum limit, its partition function is dominated by causal sets which approximate to a region of 2D Minkowski space. This model of causal set quantum gravity thus overcomes the entropy problem and predicts the emergence of a physically reasonable geometry.
