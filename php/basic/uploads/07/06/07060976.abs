Title: One-loop N=8 Supergravity Amplitudes from MHV Diagrams
Authors: Adele Nasti and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We discuss the calculation of one-loop amplitudes in N=8 supergravity using MHV diagrams. In contrast to MHV amplitudes of gluons in Yang-Mills, tree-level MHV amplitudes of gravitons are not holomorphic in the spinor variables. In order to extend these amplitudes off shell, and use them as vertices to build loops, we introduce certain shifts for the spinor variables associated to the loop momenta. Using this off-shell prescription, we rederive the four-point MHV amplitude of gravitons at one loop, in complete agreement with known results. We also discuss the extension to the case of one-loop MHV amplitudes with an arbitrary number of gravitons.
