Title: Notes on a SQCD-like plasma dual and holographic renormalization
Authors: A. L. Cotrone and J. M. Pons and P. Talavera
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and the jet quenching parameter of a black hole solution dual to a SQCD-like plasma which includes the backreaction of fundamental flavors. The free energy is calculated in several ways, including some recently proposed holographic renormalization prescriptions. The validity of the latter is confirmed by the consistency with the other methods. The resulting thermodynamic properties are similar to the Little String Theory ones: the temperature is fixed at the Hagedorn value and the free energy is vanishing. Finally, an accurate analysis of the relevant string configurations shows that the jet quenching parameter is zero in this model, in agreement with previous findings.
