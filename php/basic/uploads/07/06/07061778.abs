Title: KLT relations from the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: The Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations derived from string theory tell us that perturbative gravity amplitudes are the "square" of the corresponding amplitudes in gauge theory. Starting from the light-cone Lagrangian for pure gravity we make these relations manifest off-shell, for three- and four-graviton vertices, at the level of the action.
