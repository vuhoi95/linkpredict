Title: Tomographic Representation of Minisuperspace Quantum Cosmology and  Noether Symmetries
Authors: S. Capozziello and V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and C. Stornaiolo
Abstract: The probability representation, in which cosmological quantum states are described by a standard positive probability distribution, is constructed for minisuperspace models selected by Noether symmetries. In such a case, the tomographic probability distribution provides the classical evolution for the models and can be considered an approach to select "observable" universes. Some specific examples, derived from Extended Theories of Gravity, are worked out. We discuss also how to connect tomograms, symmetries and cosmological parameters.
