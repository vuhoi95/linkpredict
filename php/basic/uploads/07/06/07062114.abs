Title: Rigid Limit in N=2 Supergravity and Weak-Gravity Conjecture
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We analyze the coupled N=2 supergravity and Yang-Mills system using holomorphy, near the rigid limit where the former decouples from the latter. We find that there appears generically a new mass scale around g M_{pl} where g is the gauge coupling constant and M_{pl} is the Planck scale. This is in accord with the weak-gravity conjecture proposed recently. We also study the scale dependence of the gauge theory prepotential from its embedding into supergravity.
