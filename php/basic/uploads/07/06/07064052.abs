Title: Renormalisability of the matter determinants in noncommutative gauge  theory in the enveloping-algebra formalism
Authors: C. P. Martin and C. Tamarit
Abstract: We consider noncommutative gauge theory defined by means of Seiberg-Witten maps for an arbitrary semisimple gauge group. We compute the one-loop UV divergent matter contributions to the gauge field effective action to all orders in the noncommutative parameters $\theta$. We do this for Dirac fermions and complex scalars carrying arbitrary representations of the gauge group. We use path-integral methods in the framework of dimensional regularisation and consider arbitrary invertible Seiberg-Witten maps that are linear in the matter fields. Surprisingly, it turns out that the UV divergent parts of the matter contributions are proportional to the noncommutative Yang-Mills action where traces are taken over the representation of the matter fields; this result supports the need to include such traces in the classical action of the gauge sector of the noncommutative theory.
