Title: Nonrelativistic conformal field theories
Authors: Yusuke Nishida and Dam T. Son
Abstract: We study representations of the Schr\"odinger algebra in terms of operators in nonrelativistic conformal field theories. We prove a correspondence between primary operators and eigenstates of few-body systems in a harmonic potential. Using the correspondence we compute analytically the energy of fermions at unitarity in a harmonic potential near two and four spatial dimensions. We also compute the energy of anyons in a harmonic potential near the bosonic and fermionic limits.
