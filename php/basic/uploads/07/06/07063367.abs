Abstract: We introduce some multiple integrals that are expected to have the same singularities as the singularities of the $ n$-particle contributions $\chi^{(n)}$ to the susceptibility of the square lattice Ising model. We find the Fuchsian linear differential equation satisfied by these multiple integrals for $ n=1, 2, 3, 4$ and only modulo some primes for $ n=5$ and $ 6$, thus providing a large set of (possible) new singularities of the $\chi^{(n)}$. We discuss the singularity structure for these multiple integrals by solving the Landau conditions. We find that the singularities of the associated ODEs identify (up to $n= 6$) with the leading pinch Landau singularities. The second remarkable obtained feature is that the singularities of the ODEs associated with the multiple integrals reduce to the singularities of the ODEs associated with a {\em finite number of one dimensional integrals}. Among the singularities found, we underline the fact that the quadratic polynomial condition $ 1+3 w +4 w^2 = 0$, that occurs in the linear differential equation of $ \chi^{(3)}$, actually corresponds to a remarkable property of selected elliptic curves, namely the occurrence of complex multiplication. The interpretation of complex multiplication for elliptic curves as complex fixed points of the selected generators of the renormalization group, namely isogenies of elliptic curves, is sketched. Most of the other singularities occurring in our multiple integrals are not related to complex multiplication situations, suggesting an interpretation in terms of (motivic) mathematical structures beyond the theory of elliptic curves.
