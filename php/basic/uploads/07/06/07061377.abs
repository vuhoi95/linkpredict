Title: Bosonic String and String Field Theory: a solution using  Ultradistributions of Exponential Type
Authors: C. G. Bollini and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In this paper we show that Ultradistributions of Exponential Type (UET) are appropriate for the description in a consistent way string and string field theories. A new Lagrangian for the closed string is obtained and shown to be equivalent to Nambu-Goto's Lagrangian. We also show that the string field is a linear superposition of UET of compact support CUET). We evaluate the propagator for the string field, and calculate the convolution of two of them.
