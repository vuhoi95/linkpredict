Title: Comments on the Holomorphic Anomaly in Open Topological String Theory
Authors: Paul L. H. Cook and Hirosi Ooguri and Jie Yang
Abstract: We show that a general solution to the extended holomorphic anomaly equations for the open topological string on D-branes in a Calabi-Yau manifold, recently written down by Walcher in arXiv:0705.4098, is obtained from the general solution to the holomorphic anomaly equations for the closed topological string on the same manifold, by shifting the closed string moduli by amounts proportional to the 't Hooft coupling.
