Title: Phase transitions in higher derivative gravity and gauge theory:  R-charged black holes
Authors: Tanay K. Dey and Sudipta Mukherji and Subir Mukhopadhyay and Swarnendu Sarkar
Abstract: This is a continuation of our earlier work where we constructed a phenomenologically motivated effective action of the boundary gauge theory at finite temperature and finite gauge coupling on $S^3 \times S^1$. In this paper, we argue that this effective action qualitatively reproduces the gauge theory representing various bulk phases of R-charged black hole with Gauss-Bonnet correction. We analyze the system both in canonical and grand canonical ensemble.
