Title: The 't Hooft loop in the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in  Coulomb gauge
Authors: H. Reinhardt and D. Epple
Abstract: The spatial 't Hooft loop, which is a disorder parameter dual to the temporal Wilson loop, is calculated using the nonperturbative Yang-Mills vacuum wave functional determined previously by a variational solution of the Yang-Mills Schroedinger equation in Coulomb gauge. It is shown, that this wave functional yields indeed a perimeter law for large spatial 't Hooft loops signaling confinement.
