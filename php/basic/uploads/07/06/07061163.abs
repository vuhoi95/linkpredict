Title: AdS/CFT Correspondence as a Consequence of Scale Invariance
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Takao Suyama
Abstract: We study an anisotropic scale transformation in the worldsheet description of D3-branes in Type IIB theory, and show that the transformation is really a symmetry in a region near D3-branes. AdS/CFT correspondence follows from this symmetry. We will explicitly show that Wilson loops in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and minimal surfaces in AdS_5 are related by the symmetry. The functional form of a supersymmetric Wilson loop operator is naturally derived from our worldsheet point of view.
