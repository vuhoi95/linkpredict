Title: Exact factorization of correlation functions in 2-D critical percolation
Authors: Jacob J. H. Simmons and Peter Kleban and Robert M. Ziff
Abstract: By use of conformal field theory, we discover several exact factorizations of higher-order density correlation functions in critical two-dimensional percolation. Our formulas are valid in the upper half-plane, or any conformally equivalent region. We find excellent agreement of our results with high-precision computer simulations. There are indications that our formulas hold more generally.
