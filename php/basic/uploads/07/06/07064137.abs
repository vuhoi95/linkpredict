Title: Propagation Constraints and Classical Solutions in K-essence Like  Theories
Authors: Ratindranath Akhoury and Christopher S. Gauthier
Abstract: We consider two examples of solutions of the equations of motion of scalar field theories with higher derivatives. These are the cosmology of the rolling tachyon and static spherically symmetric solutions of the scalar field in flat space. By requiring that the field equations always be hyperbolic and that the speed of propagation of the small fluctuations are not superluminal, we find constraints on the form of the allowed interactions in the first case and on the choice of boundary conditions in the latter. For the rolling tachyon we find a general class of models which have the property that at large times the tachyon matter behaves essentially like a non-relativistic gas of dust. For the spherically symmetric solutions we show how causality influences the choice of boundary conditions and those which are finite at the origin are shown to have negative energy density there.
