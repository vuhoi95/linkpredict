Title: Viscosity Information from Relativistic Nuclear Collisions: How Perfect  is the Fluid Observed at RHIC?
Authors: Paul Romatschke and Ulrike Romatschke
Abstract: Relativistic viscous hydrodynamic fits to RHIC data on the centrality dependence of multiplicity, transverse and elliptic flow for sqrt{s}=200 GeV Au+Au collisions are presented. For Glauber-type initial conditions, while data on integrated v_2 is consistent with a ratio of viscosity over entropy density up to eta/s=0.16, data on minimum bias v_2 seems to favor a much smaller viscosity over entropy ratio, below the bound from the AdS/CFT conjecture. Some caveats on this result are discussed.
