Title: Marginal deformation for the photon in superstring field theory
Authors: Ehud Fuchs and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: We find solutions of supersymmetric string field theory that correspond to the photon marginal deformation in the boundary conformal field theory. We revisit the bosonic string marginal deformation and generate a real solution for it. We find a map between the solutions of bosonic and supersymmetric string field theories and suggest a universal solution to superstring field theory.
