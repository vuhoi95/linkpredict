Title: The black hole in the throat - thermodynamics of strongly coupled  cascading gauge theories
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Alex Buchel and Patrick Kerner
Abstract: We numerically construct black hole solutions corresponding to the deconfined, chirally symmetric phase of strongly coupled cascading gauge theories at various temperatures. We compute the free energy as a function of the temperature, and we show that it becomes positive below some critical temperature, indicating the possibility of a first order phase transition at which the theory deconfines and restores the chiral symmetry.
