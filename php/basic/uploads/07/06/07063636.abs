Title: alpha'-Corrections to Heterotic Superstring Effective Action Revisited
Authors: W. A. Chemissany and Mees de Roo and Sudhakar Panda
Abstract: In this letter we establish that the supersymmetric R^2 effective action for the heterotic string, obtained from the supersymmetrisation of the Lorentz Chern-Simons term, is to order $\alpha'$ equivalent modulo field redefinitions to heterotic string effective actions computed by different methods.
