Title: Comments on Solutions for Nonsingular Currents in Open String Field  Theories
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Yoji Michishita
Abstract: We investigate analytic solutions to Witten's bosonic string field theory and Berkovits' WZW-type superstring field theory. We construct solutions with parameters out of simpler ones, using a commutative monoid that includes the family of wedge states. Our solutions are generalizations of solutions for marginal deformations by nonsingular currents, and can also reproduce Schnabl's tachyon vacuum solution in bosonic string field theory. This implies that such known solutions are generated from simple solutions which are based on the identity state. We also discuss gauge transformations and induced field redefinitions for our solutions in both bosonic and super string field theory.
