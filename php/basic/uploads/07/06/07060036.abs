Title: A twisted FZZ-like dual for the two-dimensional black hole
Authors: Gaston Giribet and Matias Leoni
Abstract: We review and study the duality between string theory formulated on a curved exact background (the two dimensional black hole) and string theory in flat space with a tachyon-like potential. We generalize previous results in this subject by discussing a twisted version of the Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov conjecture. This duality is shown to hold at the level of N-point correlation functions on the sphere topology, and connects tree-level string amplitudes in the Euclidean version of the 2D black hole (x time) to correlation functions in a non-linear sigma-model in flat space but in presence of a tachyon wall potential and a linear dilaton. The dual CFT corresponds to the perturbed 2D quantum gravity coupled to c<1 matter (x time), where the operator that describes the tachyon-like potential can be seen as a n=2 momentum mode perturbation, while the usual sine-Liouville operator would correspond to the vortex sector n =1. We show how the sine-Liouville interaction term arises through a twisting of the marginal deformation introduced here, and discuss such 'twisting' as a non-trivial realization of the symmetries of the theory. After briefly reviewing the computation of correlation functions in sine-Liouville CFT, we give a precise prescription for computing correlation functions in the twisted model. To show the new version of the correspondence we make use of a formula recently proven by S. Ribault and J. Teschner, which connects the correlation functions in the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory to correlation functions in the Liouville theory. Conversely, the duality discussed here can be thought of as a free field realization of such remarkable formula.
