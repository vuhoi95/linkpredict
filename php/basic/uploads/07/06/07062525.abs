Title: Deconfinement phase transition in holographic QCD with matter
Authors: Youngman Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and Siyoung Nam and Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: In the framework of a holographic QCD approach we study an influence of matters on the deconfinement temperature, $T_c$. We first consider quark flavor number ($N_f$) dependence of $T_c$. We observe that $T_c$ decreases with $N_f$, which is consistent with a lattice QCD result. We also delve into how the quark number density $\rho_q$ affects the value of $T_c$. We find that $T_c$ drops with increasing $\rho_q$. In both cases, we confirm that the contributions from quarks are suppressed by $1/N_c$, as it should be, compared to the ones from a gravitational action (pure Yang-Mills).
