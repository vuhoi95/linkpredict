Title: N = 4 Superfiel Phase Space Coordinates and Hamiltonian Quantization
Authors: F. Assaoui and T. Lhallabi
Abstract: The N = 4 superfield phase space coordinates are given in the harmonic superspace. The expressions of the N = 4 classical equations of motion are determined in terms of the spinorial and harmonic supercharges. Furthermore, the N = 4 supersymmetric actions are obtained by means of the fermionic and harmonic functionals. On the other hand, the Hamiltonian quantization is studied by performing the N = 4 supersymmetric action in harmonic subspace in terms of analytic N = 4 superfield phase space coordinates.
