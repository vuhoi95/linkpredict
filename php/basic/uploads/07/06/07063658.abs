Title: Field theory on $Îº$--Minkowski space revisited: Noether charges and  breaking of Lorentz symmetry
Authors: L. Freidel and J. Kowalski-Glikman and S. Nowak
Abstract: This paper is devoted to detailed investigations of free scalar field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space. After reviewing necessary mathematical tools we discuss in depth the Lagrangian and solutions of field equations. We analyze the spacetime symmetries of the model and construct the conserved charges associated with translational and Lorentz symmetry. We show that the version of the theory usually studied breaks Lorentz invariance in a subtle way: There is an additional trans-Planckian mode present, and an associated conserved charge (the number of such modes) is not a Lorentz scalar.
