Title: N=1* model superpotential revisited (IR behaviour of N=4 limit)
Authors: S. Arnone and G. Di Segni and M. Siccardi and K. Yoshida
Abstract: The one-loop contribution to the superpotential, in particular the Veneziano-Yankielowicz potential in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills model is discussed from an elementary field theory method and the matrix model point of view. Both approaches are based on the Renormalization Group variation of the superconformal N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills model.
