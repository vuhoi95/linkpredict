Abstract: We construct interpolating solutions describing single-center static extremal non-supersymmetric black holes in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories with cubic prepotentials. To this end, we derive and solve first-order flow equations for rotating electrically charged extremal black holes in a Taub-NUT geometry in five dimensions. We then use the connection between five- and four-dimensional extremal black holes to obtain four-dimensional flow equations and we give the corresponding solutions.
