Authors: Jivan Singh and P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Quaternion analysis of time dependent Maxwell's equations in presence of electric and magnetic charges has been developed in unique, simple and consistent manner. It has been shown that this theory is extended consistently to time-harmonic Maxwell's equation for dyons.
