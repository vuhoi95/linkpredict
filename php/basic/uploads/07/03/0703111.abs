Title: A potential for Generalized Kahler Geometry
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Rikard von Unge and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We show that, locally, all geometric objects of Generalized Kahler Geometry can be derived from a function K, the "generalized Kahler potential''. The metric g and two-form B are determined as nonlinear functions of second derivatives of K. These nonlinearities are shown to arise via a quotient construction from an auxiliary local product (ALP) space.
