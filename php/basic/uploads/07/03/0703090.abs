Title: Master field treatment of metric perturbations sourced by the trailing  string
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Silviu S. Pufu
Abstract: We present decoupled, separable forms of the linearized Einstein equations sourced by a string trailing behind an external quark moving through a thermal state of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. We solve these equations in the approximations of large and small wave-numbers.
