Abstract: We consider the entanglement of closed bosonic strings intersecting the event horizon of a Rindler spacetime and, by using some simplified (rather semiclassical) arguments and some elements of the string field theory, we show the existence of a critical temperature beyond which closed strings \emph{cannot be in thermal equilibrium}. The order of magnitude of this critical value coincides with the Hagedorn temperature, which suggests an interpretation consistent with the fact of having a partition function which is bad defined for temperatures higher than it. Possible implications of the present approach on the microscopical structure of stretched horizons are also pointed out.
