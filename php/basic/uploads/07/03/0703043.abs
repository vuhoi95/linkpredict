Title: 6D thick branes from interacting scalar fields
Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev and Vladimir Folomeev and Douglas Singleton and Sergio Aguilar-Rudametkin
Abstract: A thick brane in six dimensions is constructed using two scalar fields. The field equations for 6D gravity plus the scalar fields are solved numerically. This thick brane solution shares some features with a previously studied analytic solutions, but has the advantage that the energy-momentum tensor which forms the thick brane comes from the scalar fields rather than being put in by hand. Additionally the scalar fields which form the brane also provide a universal, non-gravitational trapping mechanism for test fields of various spins.
