Title: Form Factors and Wave Functions of Vector Mesons in Holographic QCD
Authors: Hovhannes R. Grigoryan and Anatoly V. Radyushkin
Abstract: Within the framework of a holographic dual model of QCD, we develop a formalism for calculating form factors of vector mesons. We show that the holographic bound states can be described not only in terms of eigenfunctions of the equation of motion, but also in terms of conjugate wave functions that are close analogues of quantum-mechanical bound state wave functions. We derive a generalized VMD representation for form factors, and find a very specific VMD pattern, in which form factors are essentially given by contributions due to the first two bound states in the Q^2-channel. We calculate electric radius of the rho-meson, finding the value <r_rho^2>_C = 0.53 fm^2.
