Title: Field Quantization in 5D Space-Time with Z$_2$-parity and  Position/Momentum Propagator
Authors: S. Ichinose and A. Murayama
Abstract: Field quantization in 5D flat and warped space-times with Z$_2$-parity is comparatively examined. We carefully and closely derive 5D position/momentum(P/M) propagators. Their characteristic behaviours depend on the 4D (real world) momentum in relation to the boundary parameter ($l$) and the bulk curvature ($\om$). They also depend on whether the 4D momentum is space-like or time-like. Their behaviours are graphically presented and the Z$_2$ symmetry, the "brane" formation and the singularities are examined. It is shown that the use of absolute functions is important for properly treating the singular behaviour. The extra coordinate appears as a {\it directed} one like the temperature. The $\delta(0)$ problem, which is an important consistency check of the bulk-boundary system, is solved {\it without} the use of KK-expansion. The relation between P/M propagator (a closed expression which takes into account {\it all} KK-modes) and the KK-expansion-series propagator is clarified. In this process of comparison, two views on the extra space naturally come up: orbifold picture and interval (boundary) picture. Sturm-Liouville expansion (a generalized Fourier expansion) is essential there. Both 5D flat and warped quantum systems are formulated by the Dirac's bra and ket vector formalism, which shows the warped model can be regarded as a {\it deformation} of the flat one with the {\it deformation parameter} $\om$. We examine the meaning of the position-dependent cut-off proposed by Randall-Schwartz.
