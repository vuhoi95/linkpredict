Title: A New Method for Finding Vacua in String Phenomenology
Authors: James Gray and Yang-Hui He and Anton Ilderton and Andre Lukas
Abstract: One of the central problems of string-phenomenology is to find stable vacua in the four dimensional effective theories which result from compactification. We present an algorithmic method to find all of the vacua of any given string-phenomenological system in a huge class. In particular, this paper reviews and then extends hep-th/0606122 to include various non-perturbative effects. These include gaugino condensation and instantonic contributions to the superpotential.
