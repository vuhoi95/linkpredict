Title: Noncommutative QED corrections to process $e^+e^-\toμ^+μ^-γ$ at  linear collider energies
Authors: Yongming Fu and Zheng-Mao Sheng
Abstract: The cross section for process $e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ in the framework of noncommutative quantum electrodynamics(NC QED) is studied. It is shown that the NC correction of scattering sections is not monotonous enhancement with total energy of colliding electrons, but there is an optimal collision energy to get the greatest NC correction. Moreover, there is a linear relation between NC QED scale energy and the optimal collision energy. The experimental methods to improve the precision of determining NC effects are discussed, because this process is an ${\cal O}(\alpha^3) $ NC QED process, high precision tests are necessary.
