Title: An Inflationary Scenario in Intersecting Brane Models
Authors: Bhaskar Dutta and Jason Kumar and Louis Leblond
Abstract: We propose a new scenario for D-term inflation which appears quite straightforwardly in the open string sector of intersecting brane models. We take the inflaton to be a chiral field in a bifundamental representation of the hidden sector and we argue that a sufficiently flat potential can be brane engineered. This type of model generically predicts a near gaussian red spectrum with negligible tensor modes. We note that this model can very naturally generate a baryon asymmetry at the end of inflation via the recently proposed hidden sector baryogenesis mechanism. We also discuss the possibility that Majorana masses for the neutrinos can be simultaneously generated by the tachyon condensation which ends inflation. Our proposed scenario is viable for both high and low scale supersymmetry breaking.
