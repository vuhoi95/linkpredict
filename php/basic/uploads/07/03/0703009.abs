Title: Construction of Noncommutative Instantons in 4k Dimensions
Authors: Johannes Broedel and Tatiana A. Ivanova and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We consider generalized self-duality equations for U(2r) Yang-Mills theory on R^{4k} with quaternionic structure and self-dual Moyal deformation. We employ the extended ADHM method in 4k dimensions to construct new noncommutative generalizations of the 't Hooft as well as of the BPST instantons. It is shown that in the commutative limit the BPST-type configurations coincide with the standard instantons on HP^n written in local coordinates.
