Title: The ODE/IM Correspondence
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Clare Dunning and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: This article reviews a recently-discovered link between integrable quantum field theories and certain ordinary differential equations in the complex domain. Along the way, aspects of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics are discussed, and some elementary features of the six-vertex model and the Bethe ansatz are explained.
