Title: Constructing the AdS/CFT dressing factor
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We prove the universality of the Hernandez-Lopez phase by deriving it from first principles. We find a very simple integral representation for the phase and discuss its possible origin from a nested Bethe ansatz structure. Hopefully, the same kind of derivation could be used to constrain higher orders of the full quantum dressing factor.
