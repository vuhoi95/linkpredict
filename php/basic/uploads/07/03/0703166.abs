Title: A Classical Solution in Six-dimensional Gauge Theory with Higher  Derivative Coupling
Authors: Hironobu Kihara and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We show that the spin connection of the standard metric on a six-dimensional sphere gives an exact solution to the generalized self-dual equations suggested by Tchrakian some years ago. We work on an SO(6) gauge theory with a higher-derivative coupling term. The model consists of vector fields only. The pseudo-energy is bound from below by a topological charge which is proportional to the winding number of spatial S^5 around the internal space SO(6). The fifth homotopy group of SO(6) is, indeed, Z. The coupling constant of higher derivative term is quadratic in the radius of the underlying space S^6.
