Title: Quaternionic Formulation of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Seema Rawat and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Quaternionic formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics has been developed consistently in terms of Hamiltonians, superpartner Hamiltonians, and supercharges for free particle and interacting field in one and three dimensions. Supercharges, superpartner Hamiltonians and energy eigenvalues are discussed and it has been shown that the results are consistent with the results of quantum mechanics.
