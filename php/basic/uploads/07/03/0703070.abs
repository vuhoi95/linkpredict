Title: Reheating, Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry: a Triple Coincidence in  Inflationary Models
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Peter Mészáros
Abstract: A scenario in which primeval black holes (PBHs) form at the end of an extended inflationary period is capable of producing, via Hawking radiation, the observed entropy, as well as the observed dark matter density in the form of Planck mass relics. The observed net baryon asymmetry is produced by sphaleron processes in the domain wall surrounding the PBHs as they evaporate around the electroweak transition epoch. The conditions required to satisfy these three observables determines the PBH formation epoch, which can be associated with the end of inflation, at $t\sim 10^{-32}\s$.
