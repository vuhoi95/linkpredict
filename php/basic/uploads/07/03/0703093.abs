Title: Numerical simulations of gravitational collapse in Einstein-aether  theory
Authors: David Garfinkle and Christopher Eling and Ted Jacobson
Abstract: We study gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric scalar field in Einstein-aether theory (general relativity coupled to a dynamical unit timelike vector field). The initial value formulation is developed, and numerical simulations are performed. The collapse produces regular, stationary black holes, as long as the aether coupling constants are not too large. For larger couplings a finite area singularity occurs. These results are shown to be consistent with the stationary solutions found previously.
