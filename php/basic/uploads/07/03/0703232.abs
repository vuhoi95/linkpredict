Title: Gravitating Monopole-Antimonopole Systems at Large Scalar Coupling
Authors: Jutta Kunz and Ulrike Neemann and Yasha Shnir
Abstract: We discuss static axially symmetric solutions of SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory for large scalar coupling. These regular asymptotically flat solutions represent monopole-antimonopole chain and vortex ring solutions, as well as new configurations, present only for larger values of the scalar coupling. When gravity is coupled to the Yang-Mills-Higgs system, branches of gravitating solutions emerge from the flat-space solutions, and extend up to critical values of the gravitational coupling constant. For small scalar coupling only two branches of gravitating solutions exist, where the second branch connects to a generalized Bartnik-McKinnon solution. For large scalar coupling, however, a plethora of gravitating branches can be present and indicate the emergence of new flat-space branches.
