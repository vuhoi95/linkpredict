Title: On Attractor Mechanism and Entropy Function for Non-extremal Black  Holes/Branes
Authors: Mohammad R. Garousi and Ahmad Ghodsi
Abstract: We examine in details the entropy function formalism for non-extremal D3, M2, and M5-branes that their throat approximation is given by Schwarzschild black hole in AdS_{p+2} \times S^{D-(p+2)}. We show that even though there is no attractor mechanism in the non-extremal black holes/branes, the entropy function formalism does work and the entropy is given by the entropy function at its saddle point.
