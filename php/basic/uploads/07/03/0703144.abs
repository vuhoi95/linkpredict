Title: BPS Limit of Multi- D- and DF-strings in Boundary String Field Theory
Authors: Gyungchoon Go and Akira Ishida and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: A BPS limit is systematically derived for straight multi- D- and DF-strings from the D3D3bar system in the context of boundary superstring field theory. The BPS limit is obtained in the limit of thin D(F)-strings, where the Bogomolnyi equation supports singular static multi-D(F)-string solutions. For the BPS multi-string configurations with arbitrary separations, BPS sum rule is fulfilled under a Gaussian type tachyon potential and reproduces exactly the descent relation. For the DF-strings ((p,q)-strings), the distribution of fundamental string charge density coincides with its energy density and the Hamiltonian density takes the BPS formula of square-root form.
