Title: Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking from Simple Quivers
Authors: Yaron E. Antebi and Tomer Volansky
Abstract: We construct a simple local model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking. The model is a one generation SU(5) that arises from a IIB Z_N orientifold. It does not admit a runaway direction and is argued to stabilize the blowup mode related to the corresponding U(1) factor. The theory demonstrates the existence of a new class of "blowup" fractional branes. We further discuss a compact realization of the quiver on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold which enables one to add fluxes and stabilize the complex structure moduli.
