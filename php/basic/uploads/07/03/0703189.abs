Title: Quantum Effects in Softly Broken Gauge Theories in Curved Space-Times
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and G. de Berredo-Peixoto and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: The soft breaking of gauge or other symmetries is the typical Quantum Field Theory phenomenon. In many cases one can apply the St$\ddot{\rm u}$ckelberg procedure, which means introducing some additional field or fields and restore the gauge symmetry. The original softly broken theory corresponds to a particular choice of the gauge fixing condition. In this paper we use this scheme for performing quantum calculations for some softly broken gauge theories in an arbitrary curved space-time. The following examples are treated in details: Proca field, massive QED and massive torsion coupled to fermion. Furthermore we present a qualitative discussions of the discontinuity of quantum effects in the massive spin-2 field theory, paying special attention to the similarity and differences with the massless limit in the spin-1 case.
