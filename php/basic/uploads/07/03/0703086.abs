Title: Naturalised Supersymmetric Grand Unification
Authors: Steven A. Abel and Joerg Jaeckel and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We construct a simple model of an SU(5) GUT with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking from a metastable vacuum of a hidden sector. All mass parameters and hierarchies of our model are generated dynamically from retrofitting. This includes the mu-parameter and the GUT scale. However, as typical for SU(5) GUTs, proton longevity remains a problem.
