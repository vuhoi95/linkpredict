Title: Kinetics of the long-range spherical model
Authors: Florian Baumann and Sreedhar B. Dutta and Malte Henkel
Abstract: The kinetic spherical model with long-range interactions is studied after a quench to $T < T_c$ or to $T = T_c$. For the two-time response and correlation functions of the order-parameter as well as for composite fields such as the energy density, the ageing exponents and the corresponding scaling functions are derived. The results are compared to the predictions which follow from local scale-invariance.
