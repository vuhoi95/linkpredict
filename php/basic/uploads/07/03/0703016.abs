Title: Band theory in the context of the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation
Authors: A. Bouda and A. Mohamed Meziane
Abstract: In the one-dimensional periodic potential case, we formulate the condition of Bloch periodicity for the reduced action by using the relation between the wave function and the reduced action established in the context of the equivalence postulate of quantum mechanics. Then, without appealing to the wave function properties, we reproduce the well-known dispersion relations which predict the band structure for the energy spectrum in the Kr\"onig-Penney model.
