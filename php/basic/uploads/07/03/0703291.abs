Title: Classification of Dimension 5 Lorentz Violating Interactions in the  Standard Model
Authors: Pavel A. Bolokhov and Maxim Pospelov
Abstract: We give a complete classification of mass dimension five Lorentz-non-invariant interactions composed from the Standard Model fields, using the effective field theory approach. We identify different classes of Lorentz violating operators, some of which are protected against transmutation to lower dimensions even at the loop level. Within each class of operators we determine a typical experimental sensitivity to the size of Lorentz violation.
