Title: Non-uniform Black Strings with Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter Foliation
Authors: Liu Zhao and Kai Niu and Bing-Shu Xia and Yi-Ling Dou and Jie Ren
Abstract: We present some exact non-uniform black string solutions of 5-dimensional pure Einstein gravity as well as Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory at arbitrary dilaton coupling. The solutions share the common property that their 4-dimensional slices are Schwarzchild-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes. The pure gravity solution is also generalized to spacetimes of dimensions higher than 5 to get non-uniform black branes.
