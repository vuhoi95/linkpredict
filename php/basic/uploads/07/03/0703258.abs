Title: Non-Linear Algebra and Bogolubov's Recursion
Authors: A. Morozov and M. Serbyn
Abstract: Numerous examples are given of application of Bogolubov's forest formula to iterative solutions of various non-linear equations: one and the same formula describes everything, from ordinary quadratic equation to renormalization in quantum field theory.
