Title: Lorentz Conserving Noncommutative Standard Model
Authors: M. M. Ettefaghi and M. Haghighat
Abstract: We consider Lorentz conserving noncommutative field theory to construct the Lorentz conserving noncommutative standard model based on the gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. We obtain the enveloping algebra-valued of Higgs field up to the second order of the noncommutativity parameter $\th_{\mu\nu}$. We derive the action at the leading order and find new vertices which are absent in the ordinary Standard Model as well as the minimal noncommutative standard model. We briefly study the phenomenological aspects of the model.
