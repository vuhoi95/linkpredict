Title: A Realistic World from Intersecting D6-Branes
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and Tianjun Li and V. E. Mayes and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We briefly describe a three-family intersecting D6-brane model in Type IIA theory on the T^6/(Z_2 x Z_2) orientifold with a realistic phenomenology. In this model, the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry close to the string scale, and the gauge coupling unification can be achieved. We calculate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms, and the corresponding low energy supersymmetric particle spectrum, which may be tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The observed dark matter density may also be generated. Finally, we can explain the SM quark masses and CKM mixings, and the tau lepton mass. The neutrino masses and mixings may be generated via the seesaw mechanism as well.
