Title: The Strongly-Interacting Light Higgs
Authors: G. F. Giudice and C. Grojean and A. Pomarol and R. Rattazzi
Abstract: We develop a simple description of models where electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by a light composite Higgs, which emerges from a strongly-interacting sector as a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Two parameters broadly characterize these models: m_rho, the mass scale of the new resonances and g_rho, their coupling. An effective low-energy Lagrangian approach proves to be useful for LHC and ILC phenomenology below the scale m_rho. We identify two classes of operators: those that are genuinely sensitive to the new strong force and those that are sensitive to the spectrum of the resonances only. Phenomenological prospects for the LHC and the ILC include the study of high-energy longitudinal vector boson scattering, strong double-Higgs production and anomalous Higgs couplings. We finally discuss the possibility that the top quark could also be a composite object of the strong sector.
