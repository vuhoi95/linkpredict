Title: Causality and the speed of sound
Authors: George Ellis and Roy Maartens and Malcolm MacCallum
Abstract: A usual causal requirement on a viable theory of matter is that the speed of sound be at most the speed of light. In view of various recent papers querying this limit, the question is revisited here. We point to various issues confronting theories that violate the usual constraint.
