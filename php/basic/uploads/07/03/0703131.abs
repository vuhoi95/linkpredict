Title: Uniqueness of de Sitter space
Authors: Gregory J. Galloway and Didier A. Solis
Abstract: All inextendible null geodesics in four dimensional de Sitter space dS^4 are complete and globally achronal. This achronality is related to the fact that all observer horizons in dS^4 are eternal, i.e. extend from future infinity scri^+ all the way back to past infinity scri^-. We show that the property of having a null line (inextendible achronal null geodesic) that extends from scri^- to scri^+ characterizes dS^4 among all globally hyperbolic and asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant. This result is then further extended to allow for a class of matter models that includes perfect fluids.
