Title: Integrable Cosmological Models From Higher Dimensional Einstein  Equations
Authors: Masakazu Sano and Hisao Suzuki
Abstract: We consider the cosmological models for the higher dimensional spacetime which includes the curvatures of our space as well as the curvatures of the internal space. We find that the condition for the integrability of the cosmological equations is that the total space-time dimensions are D=10 or D=11 which is exactly the conditions for superstrings or M-theory. We obtain analytic solutions with generic initial conditions in the four dimensional Einstein frame and study the accelerating universe when both our space and the internal space have negative curvatures.
