Title: Higher loop renormalization of a supersymmetric field theory
Authors: Marc Bellon and Gustavo S. Lozano and Fidel A. Schaposnik
Abstract: Using Dyson--Schwinger equations within an approach developed by Broadhurst and Kreimer and the renormalization group, we show how high loop order of the renormalization group coefficients can be efficiently computed in a supersymmetric model.
