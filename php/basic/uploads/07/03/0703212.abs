Title: Perturbative and nonperturbative correspondences between compact and  non-compact sigma-models
Authors: Max Niedermaier and Erhard Seiler and Peter Weisz
Abstract: Compact (ferro- and antiferromagnetic) sigma-models and noncompact (hyperbolic) sigma-models are compared in a lattice formulation in dimensions $d \geq 2$. While the ferro- and antiferromagnetic models are essentially equivalent, the qualitative difference to the noncompact models is highlighted. The perturbative and the large $N$ expansions are studied in both types of models and are argued to be asymptotic expansions on a finite lattice. An exact correspondence between the expansion coefficients of the compact and the noncompact models is established, for both expansions, valid to all orders on a finite lattice. The perturbative one involves flipping the sign of the coupling and remains valid in the termwise infinite volume limit. The large $N$ correspondence concerns the functional dependence on the free propagator and holds directly only in finite volume.
