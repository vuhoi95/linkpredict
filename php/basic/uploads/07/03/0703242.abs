Title: Fermionic Contributions to the Free Energy of Noncommutative Quantum  Electrodynamics at High Temperature
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel and C. Muramoto
Abstract: We consider the fermionic contributions to the free energy of noncommutative QED at finite temperature $T$. This analysis extends the main results of our previous investigation where we have considered the pure bosonic sector of the theory. For large values of $\theta T^2$ ($\theta$ is the magnitude of the noncommutative parameters) the fermionic contributions decrease the value of the critical temperature, above which there occurs a thermodynamic instability.
