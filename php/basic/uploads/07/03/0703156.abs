Title: Gravitational waves during inflation in presence of a decaying  cosmological parameter from a 5D vacuum theory of gravity
Authors: Silvina Paola Gomez Martinez and Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We study gravitational waves generated during the inflationary epoch in presence of a decaying cosmological parameter on a 5D geometrical background which is Riemann flat. Two examples are considered, one with a constant cosmological parameter and the second with a decreasing one.
