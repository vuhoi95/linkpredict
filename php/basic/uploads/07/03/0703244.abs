Title: Giant Magnon in NS5-brane Background
Authors: J. Kluson and Rashmi R. Nayak and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study the giant magnon solutions in the near horizon geometry of the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) 5-brane background. In conformal gauge, we find magnon dispersion relation in the large angular momentum (J) limit. We further show that the giant magnon poses uniform distribution of the angular momentum along the string world-sheet as in case of AdS_5\times S^5 spacetime.
