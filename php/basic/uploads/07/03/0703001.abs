Title: Worldsheet correlators in AdS(3)/CFT(2)
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: The AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence is checked beyond the supergravity approximation by comparing correlation functions. To this end we calculate 2- and 3-point functions on the sphere of certain chiral primary operators for strings on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4. These results are then compared with the corresponding amplitudes in the dual 2-dimensional conformal field theory. In the limit of small string coupling, where the sphere diagrams dominate the string perturbation series, beautiful agreement is found.
