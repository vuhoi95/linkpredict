Title: Confining string and its widening in HP1 embedding approach
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and F. V. Gubarev
Abstract: Structure of confining string in terms of the topological charge density and the action density is studied in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on the lattice using HP1 sigma-model embedding approach. We find that the confining flux tube noticeably suppresses both the topological charge and the action densities. Beyond the string formation length the string cross section in terms of these quantities is well described by a Gaussian profile. In both cases the squared string width is found to be a logarithmic function of the string length confirming the Luscher widening of the chromoelectric string. Characteristic string scales in terms of the topological and action densities are estimated as well.
