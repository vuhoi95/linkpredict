Title: Black-Hole Attractors in N=1 Supergravity
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio Ferrara and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: We study the attractor mechanism for N=1 supergravity coupled to vector and chiral multiplets and compute the attractor equations of these theories. These equations may have solutions depending on the choice of the holomorphic symmetric matrix f_{\Lambda\Sigma} which appears in the kinetic lagrangian of the vector sector. Models with non trivial electric-magnetic duality group which have or have not attractor behavior are exhibited. For a particular class of models, based on an N=1 reduction of homogeneous special geometries, the attractor equations are related to the theory of pure spinors.
