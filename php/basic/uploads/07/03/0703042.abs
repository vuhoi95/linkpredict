Title: Relativistic BCS-BEC Crossover at Zero Temperature
Authors: Lianyi He and Pengfei Zhuang
Abstract: We investigate the BCS-BEC crossover at zero temperature in the frame of a relativistic model. The universality of the BCS-BEC crossover for non-relativistic systems breaks down in relativistic case and the crossover can be induced by changing the density. When the effective scattering length is much less than the fermion Compton wavelength, we recover the non-relativistic result if the gas is initially in non-relativistic state. At ultra-strong coupling where the scattering length is of the order of the Compton wavelength, a new BEC state appears. In this state the condensed bosons become nearly massless and anti-fermions are excited. The behavior of the Goldstone mode and the mixing between the amplitude and phase modes are significantly different in different condensed regions.
