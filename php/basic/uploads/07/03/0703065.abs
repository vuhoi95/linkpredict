Abstract: Improving the beginning steps of a previous work, we settle the dual embedding method (DEM) as an alternative and efficient method for obtaining dual equivalent actions also in D=3. We show that we can obtain dual equivalent actions which were previously obtained in the literature using the gauging iterative Noether dualization method (NDM). We believe that, with the arbitrariness property of the zero mode, the DEM is more profound since it can reveal a whole family of dual equivalent actions. After a review of our previous work, we obtain the dual equivalent theory of the self-dual model minimally coupled to U(1) charged bosonic matter. The result confirms the one obtained previously which is important since it has the same structure that appears in the Abelian Higgs model with an anomalous magnetic interaction.
