Title: Resistively shunted Josephson junctions: QFT predictions versus MC  results
Authors: Sergei L. Lukyanov and Philipp Werner
Abstract: During the last fourteen years several exact results were obtained for the so-called boundary sine-Gordon model. In the case of a conformal bulk this 2D boundary quantum field theory describes the universal scaling behavior of the Caldeira-Leggett model of resistively shunted Josephson junctions. In this work, we use a recently developed Monte Carlo technique to test some of the analytical predictions.
