Title: D3-brane Vacua in Stabilized Compactifications
Authors: Oliver DeWolfe and Liam McAllister and Gary Shiu and Bret Underwood
Abstract: D3-branes feel no force in no-scale flux compactifications of type IIB string theory, but the nonperturbative effects required to stabilize the Kahler moduli break the no-scale structure and generate a potential for D3-brane motion, confining the branes to certain loci. D3-branes away from these loci break supersymmetry spontaneously, by an F-term. We present the general conditions for supersymmetric D3-brane vacua in models with a single Kahler modulus, then explicitly calculate these vacua for D3-branes moving on the tip of the warped deformed conifold. We find both continuous moduli spaces and isolated vacua. In addition, we show that anti-D3-branes and D3-branes are localized to the same regions by the nonperturbative potential, avoiding a potential obstacle to brane inflation. We apply these results to determine whether angular motion of a brane in a throat could play an important role in inflation, and find that any inflation along the angular directions is short-lived because the field space is very small.
