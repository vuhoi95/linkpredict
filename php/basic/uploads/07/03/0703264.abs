Title: Spontaneous Lorentz Breaking and Massive Gravity
Authors: Z. Berezhiani and D. Comelli and F. Nesti and L. Pilo
Abstract: We study a theory where the presence of an extra spin-two field coupled to gravity gives rise to a phase with spontaneously broken Lorentz symmetry. In this phase gravity is massive, and the Weak Equivalence Principle is respected. The newtonian potentials are in general modified, but we identify an non-perturbative symmetry that protects them. The gravitational waves sector has a rich phenomenology: sources emit a combination of massless and massive gravitons that propagate with distinct velocities and also oscillate. Since their velocities differ from the speed of light, the time of flight difference between gravitons and photons from a common source could be measured.
