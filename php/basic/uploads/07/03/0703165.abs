Title: Novel Topological Invariant in the U(1) Gauge Field Theory
Authors: Yi-Shi Duan and Xin-Hui Zhang and Li Zhao
Abstract: Based on the decomposition of U(1) gauge potential theory and the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, the three-dimensional knot invariant and a four-dimensional new topological invariant are discussed in the U(1) gauge field.
