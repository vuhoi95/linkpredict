Title: Color superconductivity in the static Einstein Universe
Authors: D. Ebert and A. V. Tyukov and V. Ch. Zhukovsky
Abstract: We study the behavior of quark and diquark condensates in dense quark matter under the influence of a gravitational field adopting as a simple model the static $D-$dimensional Einstein Universe. Calculations are performed in the framework of the extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and quark density on the basis of the thermodynamic potential and the gap equations. Quark and diquark condensates as functions of the chemical potential and temperature at different values of the curvature have been studied. Phase portraits of the system have been constructed.
