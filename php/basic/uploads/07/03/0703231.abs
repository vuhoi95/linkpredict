Title: Sasakian Geometry, Holonomy, and Supersymmetry
Authors: Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki
Abstract: In this expository article we discuss the relations between Sasakian geometry, reduced holonomy and supersymmetry. It is well known that the Riemannian manifolds other than the round spheres that admit real Killing spinors are precisely Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, 7-manifolds with a nearly parallel G2 structure, and nearly Kaehler 6-manifolds. We then discuss the relations between the latter two and Sasaki-Einstein geometry.
