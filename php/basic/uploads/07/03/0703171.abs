Title: Can strings live in four dimensions?
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Nikolaos E. Mavromatos
Abstract: Using a novel, non-perturbative, time-dependent string configuration derived in [1], we present here an argument which selects new critical dimensions for the target space time of a bosonic sigma model, with D=4 the lowest non trivial value. This argument is based on the properties of the partition function after a target space Wick rotation.
