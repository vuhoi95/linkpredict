Title: Geometry and topology of bubble solutions from gauge theory
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Diego H. Correa and Guillermo A. Silva
Abstract: We study how geometrical and topological aspects of certain 1/2 BPS type IIB supergravity solutions are captured by the N=4 Super Yang-Mills gauge theory in the AdS/CFT context. The type IIB solutions are completely characterized by arbitrary droplets in a plane and we consider, in particular, concentric droplets. We probe the dual 1/2 BPS operators of the gauge theory with single traces and extract their one-loop anomalous dimensions. The action of the one-loop dilatation operator can be reformulated as the Hamiltonian of a bosonic lattice. The operators defining the Hamiltonian encode the topology of the droplet. The axial symmetry of the droplets turns out to be essential for obtaining the spectrum of the Hamiltonians. In appropriate BMN limits, the near-BPS spectrum reproduces the spectrum of near-BPS string excitations propagating along each individual edge of the droplet of the dual geometric background. We also study semiclassical regimes for the Hamiltonians. We show that for droplets having disconnected constituents, the Hamiltonian admits different complimentary semiclassical descriptions, each one replicating the semiclassical description for closed strings extending in each of the constituents.
