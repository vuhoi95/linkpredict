Title: Local scale-invariance in disordered systems
Authors: Malte Henkel and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: Dynamical scaling and ageing in disordered systems far from equilibrium is reviewed. Particular attention is devoted to the question to what extent a recently introduced generalization of dynamical scaling to local scale-invariance can describe data for either non-glassy systems quenched to below $T_c$ or else for spin glasses at criticality. The dependence of the scaling behaviour on the distribution of the random couplings is discussed. It is shown that finite-time corrections to scaling can become quite sizable in these systems. Numerically determined ageing quantities are confronted with available experimental results.
