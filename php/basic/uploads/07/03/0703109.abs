Title: Generalized Electromagnetic fields in Chiral Medium
Authors: P. S. Bisht and Jivan Singh and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: The time dependent Dirac-Maxwell's Equations in presence of electric and magnetic sources are written in chiral media and the solutions for the classical problem are obtained in unique simple and consistent manner. The quaternion reformulation of generalized electromagnetic fields in chiral media has also been developed in compact, simple and consistent manner.
