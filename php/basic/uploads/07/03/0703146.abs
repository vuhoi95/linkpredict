Title: Colliding with a Crunching Bubble
Authors: Ben Freivogel and Gary T. Horowitz and Stephen Shenker
Abstract: In the context of eternal inflation we discuss the fate of Lambda = 0 bubbles when they collide with Lambda < 0 crunching bubbles. When the Lambda = 0 bubble is supersymmetric, it is not completely destroyed by collisions. If the domain wall separating the bubbles has higher tension than the BPS bound, it is expelled from the Lambda = 0 bubble and does not alter its long time behavior. If the domain wall saturates the BPS bound, then it stays inside the Lambda = 0 bubble and removes a finite fraction of future infinity. In this case, the crunch singularity is hidden behind the horizon of a stable hyperbolic black hole.
