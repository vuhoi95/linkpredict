Abstract: A D4-D0 black hole can be deconstructed into a bound state of D0 branes with a D6-anti-D6 pair containing worldvolume fluxes. The exact spacetime solution is known and resembles a D0 accretion disk surrounding a D6-anti-D6 core. We find a scaling limit in which the disk and core drop inside an AdS_2 throat. Crossing this AdS_2 throat and the D0 accretion disk into the core, we find a second scaling region describing the D6-anti-D6 pair. It is shown that the M-theory lift of this region is AdS_3 x S^2. Surprisingly, time translations in the far asymptotic region reduce to global, rather than Poincare, time translations in this core AdS_3. We further find that the quantum mechanical ground state degeneracy reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area law.
