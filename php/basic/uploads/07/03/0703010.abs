Title: Gauge Field Strength Tensor from the Overlap Dirac Operator
Authors: K. F. Liu and A. Alexandru and I. Horv√°th
Abstract: We derive the classical continuum limit of the operator tr$_s \sigma_{\mu\nu} D^{ov}(x,x)$ with $D^{ov}$ being the overlap Dirac operator and show that it corresponds to the gauge field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}(x)$.
