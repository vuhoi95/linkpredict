Title: 5D Black Holes and Strings with Higher Derivatives
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Joshua L. Davis and Per Kraus and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We find asymptotically flat black hole and string solutions to 5D supergravity in the presence of higher derivative terms. In some cases, including the fundamental heterotic string solution, the higher derivative terms smooth out naked singularities into regular geometries carrying zero entropy. We also compute corrections to the entropy of 5D Calabi-Yau black holes, and discuss the relation to previous results.
