Title: Observables and Correlation Functions in OSp Invariant String Field  Theory
Authors: Yutaka Baba and Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: We define BRST invariant observables in the OSp invariant closed string field theory for bosonic strings. We evaluate correlation functions of these observables and show that the S-matrix elements derived from them coincide with those of the light-cone gauge string field theory.
