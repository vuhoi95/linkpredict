Title: On the Superstring Realization of the Yang Monopole
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Pablo Diaz and Antonio Segui
Abstract: Based on the result of string/string duality, we construct the six dimensional Yang monopole in terms of Type IIA wrapped D-branes. In particular, we show that all the information of such a magnetic solution can be encoded in the K3 surface compactification in the presence of D2 and D4-branes wrapping its non trivial cycles. We give a geometrical and physical interpretations for the {+1,-1} Yang monopole charges. Lifting to eleven dimensions, we relate this Type IIA configuration with the heterotic M-theory one, given in hep-th/0607193. The nature of the black Yang monopole is also discussed.
