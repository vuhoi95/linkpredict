Title: Black string and velocity frame dragging
Authors: Jungjai Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim
Abstract: We investigate velocity frame dragging with the boosted Schwarzschild black string solution and the boosted Kaluza-Klein bubble solution, in which a translational symmetry along the boosted $z$-coordinate is implemented. The velocity frame dragging effect can be nullified by the motion of an observer using the boost symmetry along the $z-$coordinate if it is not compact. However, in spacetime with the compact $z-$coordinate, we show that the effect cannot be removed since the compactification breaks the global Lorentz boost symmetry. As a result, the comoving velocity is dependent on $r$ and the momentum parameter along the $z-$coordinate becomes an observer independent characteristic quantity of the black string and bubble solutions. The dragging induces a spherical ergo-region around the black string.
