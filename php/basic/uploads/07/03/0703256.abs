Title: Vanishing Scalar Invariant Spacetimes in Supergravity
Authors: A. A. Coley and A. Fuster and S. Hervik and N. Pelavas
Abstract: We show that the higher-dimensional vanishing scalar invariant (VSI) spacetimes with fluxes and dilaton are solutions of type IIB supergravity, and we argue that they are exact solutions in string theory. We also discuss the supersymmetry properties of VSI spacetimes.
