Abstract: We study the large N saddle points of weakly coupled N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on S^1 x S^3 that are described by a commuting matrix model for the seven scalar fields {A_0, \Phi_J}. We show that at temperatures below the Hagedorn/`deconfinement' transition the joint eigenvalue distribution is S^1 x S^5. At high temperatures T >> 1/R_{S^3}, the eigenvalues form an ellipsoid with topology S^6. We show how the deconfinement transition realises the topology change S^1 x S^5 --> S^6. Furthermore, we find compelling evidence that when the temperature is increased to T = 1/(\sqrt\lambda R_{S^3}) the saddle with S^6 topology changes continuously to one with S^5 topology in a new second order quantum phase transition occurring in these saddles.
