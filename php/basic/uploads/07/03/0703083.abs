Authors: Jivan Singh and P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Quaternion analysis of time dependent Maxwell's equations in presence of electric and magnetic charges has been developed and the solutions for the classical problem of moving charges (electric and magnetic) are obtained in unique, simple and consistent manner.
