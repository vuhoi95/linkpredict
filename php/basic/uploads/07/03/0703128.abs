Title: Lie algebraic Noncommutative Gravity
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: We exploit the Seiberg -- Witten map technique to formulate the theory of gravity defined on a Lie algebraic noncommutative space time. Detailed expressions of the Seiberg -- Witten maps for the gauge parameters, gauge potentials and the field strengths have been worked out. Our results demonstrate that notwithstanding the introduction of more general noncommutative structure there is no first order correction, exactly as happens for a canonical (i.e. constant) noncommutativity.
