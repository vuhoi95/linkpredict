Title: Combining infrared and low-temperature asymptotes in Yang-Mills theories
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We demonstrate that power-like non-perturbative behavior of gluon and ghost propagators in infrared limit of Yang-Mills theories can provide at finite temperatures T a negative T^4-contribution to the pressure and energy density. Existence of mass gap implies then new relations between infrared critical exponents of gluon and ghost propagators.
