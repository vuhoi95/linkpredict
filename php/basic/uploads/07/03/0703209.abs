Title: Monte Carlo approach to nonperturbative strings -- demonstration in  noncritical string theory
Authors: Naoyuki Kawahara and Jun Nishimura and Atsushi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We show how Monte Carlo approach can be used to study the double scaling limit in matrix models. As an example, we study a solvable hermitian one-matrix model with the double-well potential, which has been identified recently as a dual description of noncritical string theory with worldsheet supersymmetry. This identification utilizes the nonperturbatively stable vacuum unlike its bosonic counterparts, and therefore it provides a complete constructive formulation of string theory. Our data with the matrix size ranging from 8 to 512 show a clear scaling behavior, which enables us to extract the double scaling limit accurately. The ``specific heat'' obtained in this way agrees nicely with the known result obtained by solving the Painleve-II equation with appropriate boundary conditions.
