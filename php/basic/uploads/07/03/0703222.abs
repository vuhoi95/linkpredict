Title: On the second reference state and complete eigenstates of the open XXZ  chain
Authors: Wen-Li Yang and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: The second reference state of the open XXZ spin chain with non-diagonal boundary terms is studied. The associated Bethe states exactly yield the second set of eigenvalues proposed recently by functional Bethe Ansatz. In the quasi-classical limit, two sets of Bethe states give the complete eigenstates of the associated Gaudin model.
