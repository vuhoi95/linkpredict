Title: Exact chiral ring of AdS(3)/CFT(2)
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Ari Pakman
Abstract: We carry out an exact worldsheet computation of tree level three-point correlators of chiral operators in string theory on AdS(3) x S^3 x T^4 with NS-NS flux. We present a simple representation for the string chiral operators in the coordinate basis of the dual boundary CFT. Striking cancelations occur between the three-point functions of the H3+ and the SU(2) WZW models which result in a simple factorized form for the final correlators. We show, by fixing a single free parameter in the H3+ WZW model, that the fusion rules and the structure constants of the N=2 chiral ring in the bulk are in precise agreement with earlier computations in the boundary CFT of the symmetric product of T^4 at the orbifold point in the large N limit.
