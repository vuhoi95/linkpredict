Title: Fate of Kaluza-Klein Black Holes: Evaporation or Excision?
Authors: Keiju Murata and Jiro Soda and Sugumi Kanno
Abstract: We study evaporation process of black strings which are typical examples of Kaluza-Klein black holes. Taking into account the backreaction of the Hawking radiation, we deduce the evolution equation for the radion field. By solving the evolution equation, we find that the shape of the internal space is necked by the Hawking radiation and the amount of the deformation becomes large as the evaporation proceeds. Based on this analysis, we speculate that the Kaluza-Klein black holes would be excised from the Kaluza-Klein spacetime before the onset of the Gregory-Laflamme instability and therefore before the evaporation.
