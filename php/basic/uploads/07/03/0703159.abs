Title: BEC-BCS Crossover in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model of QCD
Authors: Gaofeng Sun and Lianyi He and Pengfei Zhuang
Abstract: The BEC-BCS crossover in QCD at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials is investigated in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The diquark condensation in two color QCD and the pion condensation in real QCD would undergo a BEC-BCS crossover when the corresponding chemical potential increases. We determined the crossover chemical potential as well as the BEC and BCS regions. The crossover is not triggered by increasing the strength of attractive interaction among quarks but driven by changing the charge density. The chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and density plays an important role in the BEC-BCS crossover. For real QCD, strong couplings in diquark and vector meson channels can induce a diquark BEC-BCS crossover in color superconductor, and in the BEC region the chromomagnetic instability is fully cured and the ground state is a uniform phase.
