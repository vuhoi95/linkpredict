Abstract: We propose a novel and simple method to compute the partition function of statistical mechanics of local and semi-local BPS vortices in the Abelian-Higgs model and its non-Abelian extension on a torus. We use a D-brane realization of the vortices and T-duality relation to domain walls. We there use a special limit where domain walls reduce to gas of hard (soft) one-dimensional rods for Abelian (non-Abelian) cases. In the simpler cases of the Abelian-Higgs model on a torus, our results agree with exact results which are geometrically derived by an explicit integration over the moduli space of vortices. The equation of state for U(N) gauge theory deviates from van der Waals one, and the second virial coefficient is proportional to 1/sqrt{N}, implying that non-Abelian vortices are "softer" than Abelian vortices. Vortices on a sphere are also briefly discussed.
