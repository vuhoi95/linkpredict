Title: Thermodynamics of Black Holes in Two (and Higher) Dimensions
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Robert McNees
Abstract: A comprehensive treatment of black hole thermodynamics in two-dimensional dilaton gravity is presented. We derive an improved action for these theories and construct the Euclidean path integral. An essentially unique boundary counterterm renders the improved action finite on-shell, and its variational properties guarantee that the path integral has a well-defined semi-classical limit. We give a detailed discussion of the canonical ensemble described by the Euclidean partition function, and examine various issues related to stability. Numerous examples are provided, including black hole backgrounds that appear in two dimensional solutions of string theory. We show that the Exact String Black Hole is one of the rare cases that admits a consistent thermodynamics without the need for an external thermal reservoir. Our approach can also be applied to certain higher-dimensional black holes, such as Schwarzschild-AdS, Reissner-Nordstrom, and BTZ.
