Title: Non-relativistic String and D-branes on AdS_5 x S^5 from Semiclassical  Approximation
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We show that non-relativistic actions of string and D-branes on AdS_5 x S^5 can be reproduced as a semiclassical approximation of the string and D-brane actions around static 1/2 BPS configurations. This is contrastive to the Penrose limit. For example, the pp-wave string can be recaptured as a semiclassical approximation around a 1/2 BPS particle rotating at the velocity of light. We argue that small deformation of a straight Wilson line would give a composite operator in the gauge-theory side that corresponds to a semiclassical state of the non-relativistic string, according to the semiclassical interpretation.
