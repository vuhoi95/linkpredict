Title: Superconductors with Topological Order and their Realization in  Josephson Junction Arrays
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and P. Sodano and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We will describe a new superconductivity mechanism, proposed by the authors in [1], which is based on a topologically ordered ground state rather than on the usual Landau mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Contrary to anyon superconductivity it works in any dimension and it preserves P-and T-invariance. In particular we will discuss the low-energy effective field theory, what would be the Landau-Ginzburg formulation for conventional superconductors.
