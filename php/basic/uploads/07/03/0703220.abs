Title: On Bubbles of Nothing in AdS/CFT
Authors: Jianyang He and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We discuss non-perturbative instabilities, mediated by bubbles of nothing, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. By exploring the phase diagram of such decays we give an interpretation of the process in terms of an effective potential in a quantum mechanics of a single variable, a winding mode condensate. The decay corresponds to a conventional first order transition, the true vacuum being a non-geometrical "nothing" state.
