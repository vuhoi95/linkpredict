Title: Gravitational instability of static spherically symmetric  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes in five and six dimensions
Authors: Martin Beroiz and Gustavo Dotti and Reinaldo J. Gleiser
Abstract: Five and six dimensional static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically Euclidean black holes, are unstable under gravitational perturbations if their mass is lower than a critical value set by the string tension. The instability is due to the Gauss-Bonnet correction to Einstein's equations, and was found in a previous work on linear stability of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes with constant curvature horizons in arbitrary dimensions. We study the unstable cases and calculate the values of the critical masses. The results are relevant to the issue of black hole production in high energy collisions.
