Title: Reissner-Nordstrom Expansion
Authors: Emil M. Prodanov and Rossen I. Ivanov and V. G. Gueorguiev
Abstract: We propose a classical mechanism for the cosmic expansion during the radiation-dominated era. This mechanism assumes that the Universe is a two-component gas. The first component is a gas of ultra-relativistic "normal" particles described by an equation of state of an ideal quantum gas of massless particles. The second component consist of "unusual" charged particles (namely, either with ultra-high charge or with ultra-high mass) that provide the important mechanism of expansion due to their interaction with the "normal" component of the gas. This interaction is described by the Reissner--Nordstr\"om metric purely geometrically -- the ``unusual'' particles are modeled as zero-dimensional naked singularities inside spheres of gravitational repulsion. The radius of a repulsive sphere is inversely proportional to the energy of an incoming particle or the temperature. The expansion mechanism is based on the inflating of the "unusual" particles (of charge $Q$) with the drop of the temperature -- this drives apart all neutral particles and particles of specific charge $q/m$ such that ${sign}(Q) q/m \ge - 1$. The Reissner--Nordstr\"om expansion naturally ends at recombination. We discuss the range of model parameters within which the proposed expansion mechanism is consistent with the restrictions regarding quantum effects.
