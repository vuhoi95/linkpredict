Title: Kramers-Kronig relations for plasma-like permittivities and the Casimir  force
Authors: G. L. Klimchitskaya and U. Mohideen and V. M. Mostepanenko
Abstract: The Kramers-Kronig relations are derived for the permittivity of the usual plasma model which neglects dissipation and of a generalized model which takes into account the interband transitions. The generalized plasma model is shown to be consistent with all precision experiments on the measurement of the Casimir force.
