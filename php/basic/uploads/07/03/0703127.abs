Title: Apparent horizon formation in the head-on collision of gyratons
Authors: Hirotaka Yoshino and Andrei Zelnikov and Valeri P. Frolov
Abstract: The gyraton model describes a gravitational field of an object moving with the velocity of light which has finite energy and spin distributed during some finite time interval $L$. A gyraton may be considered as a classical toy model for a quantum wave packet of high-energy particles with spin. In this paper we study a head-on collision of two gyratons and black hole formation in this process. The goal of this study is to understand the role of the gravitational spin-spin interaction in the process of mini-black-hole formation in particle collisions. To simplify the problem we consider several gyraton models with special profiles of the energy and spin density distribution. For these models we study the apparent horizon (AH) formation on the future edge of a spacetime region before interaction. We demonstrate that the AH forms only if the energy duration and the spin are smaller than some critical values, while the length of the spin distribution should be at least of the order of the system gravitational radius. We also study gravitational spin-spin interaction in the head-on collision of two gyratons under the assumption that the values of gyraton spins are small. We demonstrate that the metric in the interaction region for such gyratons depends on the relative helicities of incoming gyratons, and the collision of gyratons with oppositely directed spins allows the AH formation in a larger parameter region than in the collision of the gyratons with the same direction of spins. Some applications of the obtained results to the mini-black-hole production at the Large Hadron Collider in TeV gravity scenarios are briefly discussed.
