Title: Renormalised four-point coupling constant in the three-dimensional O(N)  model with N=0
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We simulate self-avoiding walks on a cubic lattice and determine the second virial coefficient for walks of different lengths. This allows us to determine the critical value of the renormalized four-point coupling constant in the three-dimensional N-vector universality class for N=0. We obtain g* = 1.4005(5), where g is normalized so that the three-dimensional field-theoretical beta-function behaves as \beta(g) = - g + g^2 for small g. As a byproduct, we also obtain precise estimates of the interpenetration ratio Psi*, Psi* = 0.24685(11), and of the exponent \nu, \nu = 0.5876(2).
