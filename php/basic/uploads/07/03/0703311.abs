Title: Six-Photon Amplitudes
Authors: T. Binoth and T. Gehrmann and G. Heinrich and P. Mastrolia
Abstract: We present analytical results for all six-photon helicity amplitudes. For the computation of this loop induced process two recently developed methods, based on form factor decomposition and on multiple cuts, have been used. We obtain compact results, demonstrating the applicability of both methods to one-loop amplitudes relevant to precision collider phenomenology.
