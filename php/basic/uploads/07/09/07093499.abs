Title: Noncommutative Field Theory from Quantum Mechanical Space-Space  Noncommutativity
Authors: Marcos Rosenbaum and J. David Vergara and L. Roman Juarez
Abstract: We investigate the incorporation of space noncommutativity into field theory by extending to the spectral continuum the minisuperspace action of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator propagator with an enlarged Heisenberg algebra. In addition to the usual $\star$-product deformation of the algebra of field functions, we show that the parameter of noncommutativity can occur in noncommutative field theory even in the case of free fields without self-interacting potentials.
