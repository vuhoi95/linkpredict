Title: Bright branes for strongly coupled plasmas
Authors: David Mateos and Leonardo Patino
Abstract: We use holographic techniques to study photon production in a class of finite temperature, strongly coupled, large-Nc SU(Nc) quark-gluon plasmas with Nf << Nc quark flavours. Our results are valid to leading order in the electromagnetic coupling constant but non-perturbatively in the SU(Nc) interactions. The spectral function of electromagnetic currents and other related observables exhibit an interesting structure as a function of the photon frequency and the quark mass. We discuss possible implications for heavy ion collision experiments.
