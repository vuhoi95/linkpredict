Title: Four-point functions of different-weight operators in the AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: Le√≥n Berdichevsky and Pieter Naaijkens
Abstract: We calculate four-point correlation functions of two weight-2 and two weight-3 1/2-BPS operators in \mathcal{N}=4 SYM in the large N limit in supergravity approximation. By the AdS/CFT conjecture, these operators are dual to AdS supergravity scalar fields s_2 and s_3 with mass m^2 = -4 and m^2 = -3 respectively. This is the first non-trivial four-point function of mixed-weight operators of lowest conformal dimensions. We show that the supergravity-induced four-point function splits into a "free" and a "quantum" part, where the quantum contribution obeys non-trivial constraints coming from the insertion procedure in the gauge theory, in particular, it depends on only one function of the conformal cross-ratios.
