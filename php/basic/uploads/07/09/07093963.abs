Title: Two-Point Functions of Coulomb Gauge Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Peter Watson and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: The functional approach to Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory is considered within the standard, second order, formalism. The Dyson-Schwinger equations and Slavnov-Taylor identities concerning the two-point functions are derived explicitly and one-loop perturbative results are presented.
