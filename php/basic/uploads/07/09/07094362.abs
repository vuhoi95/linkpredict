Title: Functional treatment of quantum scattering via the dynamical principle
Authors: Edouard Berg Manoukian and Seckson Sukkhasena
Abstract: A careful functional treatment of quantum scattering is given using Schwinger's dynamical principle which involves a functional differentiation operation applied to a generating functional written in closed form. For long range interactions, such as for the Coulomb one, it is shown that this expression may be used to obtain explicitly the asymptotic "free" modified Green function near the energy shell.
