Title: Action Principle and Modification of the Faddeev-Popov Factor in Gauge  Theories
Authors: Kanchana Limboonsong and Edouard B. Manoukian
Abstract: The quantum action (dynamical) principle is exploited to investigate the nature and origin of the Faddeev-Popov (FP) factor in gauge theories without recourse to path integrals. Gauge invariant as well as gauge non-invariant interactions are considered to show that the FP factor needs to be modified in more general cases and expressions for these modifications are derived. In particular we show that a gauge invariant theory does not necessarily imply the familiar FP factor for proper quantization.
