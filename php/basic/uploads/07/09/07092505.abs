Title: Dark Energy-Dark Matter Interaction from the Abell Cluster A586 and  violation of the Equivalence Principle
Authors: Morgan Le Delliou and O. Bertolami and F. Gil Pedro
Abstract: We find that the Abell Cluster A586 exhibits evidence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy and argue that this interaction suggests evidence of violation of the Equivalence Principle. This violation is found in the context of two different models of dark energy-dark matter interaction.
