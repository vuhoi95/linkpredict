Title: Berry Phase Effects in the dynamics of Dirac Electrons in Doubly Special  Relativity Framework
Authors: Pierre Gosselin and Alain Berard and Herve Mohrbach and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: We consider the Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) generalization of Dirac equation in an external potential in the Magueijo-Smolin base. The particles obey a modified energy-momentum dispersion relation. The semiclassical diagonalization of the Dirac Hamiltonian reveals the intrinsic Berry phase effects in the particle dynamics.
