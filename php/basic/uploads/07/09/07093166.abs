Title: N=2 Quiver Gauge Model and Partial Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Hiroshi Itoyama and Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: We construct an action of N=2 affine $A_n$ quiver gauge model having non-canonical kinetic terms and equipped with electric and magnetic FI terms. N=2 supersymmetry is shown to be broken to N=1 spontaneously and N=1 multiplets realized on the vacua are given. We also mention the models with different gauge groups. It is argued that the affine $A_1$ quiver gauge model provides a dynamical realization to approach the Klebanov-Witten N=1 fixed point.
