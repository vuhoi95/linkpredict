Title: Glueball Decay in Holographic QCD
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Chung-I Tan and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: Using holographic QCD based on D4-branes and D8-anti-D8-branes, we have computed couplings of glueballs to light mesons. We describe glueball decay by explicitly calculating its decay widths and branching ratios. Interestingly, while glueballs remain less well understood both theoretically and experimentally, our results are found to be consistent with the experimental data for the scalar glueball candidate f_0(1500). More generally, holographic QCD predicts that decay of any glueball to 4 $\pi_0$ is surpressed, and that mixing of the lightest glueball with $q\bar{q}$ mesons is small.
