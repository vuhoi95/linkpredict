Title: Confining solutions of $(n+1)$-dimensional Yang-Mills equations for flat  and curved space-time with $n \le 3$
Authors: J. A. Sanchez-Monroy and C. J. Quimbay
Abstract: We obtain exact static solutions of the $(n+1)$-dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills equations for both flat and curved space-time cases with $n \le 3$. We find that the solutions obtained are confining functions for $n = 1, 2, 3$. We apply the $(3+1)$ curved space-time solution to the anti-de Sitter and Schwarzschild metrics.
