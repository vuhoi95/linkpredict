Title: Entropy of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Black Hole due to arbitrary spin  fields in different Coordinates
Authors: Chikun Ding and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: By using the Newman-Penrose formalism and the improved thin-layer ``brick wall'' approach, the statistical-mechanical entropies of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole arising from quantum massless arbitrary spin fields are studied in the Painlev\'e and Lemaitre coordinates. Although the metrics in both the Painlev\'e and the Lemaitre coordinates do not obviously possess the singularities as that in the Schwarzschild-like coordinate, we find that, for arbitrary spin fields, the entropies in the Painlev\'e and Lemaitre coordinates are exactly equivalent to that in the Schwarzschild-like coordinate.
