Title: Supersymmetric SU(5) GUT with Stabilized Moduli
Authors: Ignatios Antoniadis and Alok Kumar and Binata Panda
Abstract: We construct a minimal example of a supersymmetric grand unified model in a toroidal compactification of type I string theory with magnetized D9-branes. All geometric moduli are stabilized in terms of the background internal magnetic fluxes which are of "oblique" type (mutually non-commuting). The gauge symmetry is just SU(5) and the gauge non-singlet chiral spectrum contains only three families of quarks and leptons transforming in the $10+{\bar 5}$ representations.
