Abstract: In a 4D chiral Thirring model we analyse the possibility that radiative corrections may produce spontaneous breaking of Lorentz and CPT symmetry. By studying the effective potential, we verified that the chiral current $\bar\psi\gamma^{\mu} \gamma_5 \psi$ may assume a nonzero vacuum expectation value which triggers the Lorentz and CPT violations. Furthermore, by making fluctuations on the minimum of the potential we dynamically induce a bumblebee like model containing a Chern-Simons term.
