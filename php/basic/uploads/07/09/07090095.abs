Title: 8D-spectral triple on 4D-Moyal space and the vacuum of noncommutative  gauge theory
Authors: Harald Grosse and Raimar Wulkenhaar
Abstract: Observing that the Hamiltonian of the renormalisable scalar field theory on 4-dimensional Moyal space A is the square of a Dirac operator D of spectral dimension 8, we complete (A,D) to a compact 8-dimensional spectral triple. We add another Connes-Lott copy and compute the spectral action of the corresponding U(1)-Yang-Mills-Higgs model. We find that in the Higgs potential the square \phi^2 of the Higgs field is shifted to \phi * \phi + const X_\mu * X^\mu, where X_\mu is the covariant coordinate. The classical field equations of our model imply that the vacuum is no longer given by a constant Higgs field, but both the Higgs and gauge fields receive non-constant vacuum expectation values.
