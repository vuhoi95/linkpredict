Authors: Claire R. Gilson and Masashi Hamanaka and Jonathan J. C. Nimmo
Abstract: We present Backlund transformations for the noncommutative anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation where the gauge group is G=GL(2) and use it to generate a series of exact solutions from a simple seed solution. The solutions generated by this approach are represented in terms of quasideterminants and belong to a noncommutative version of the Atiyah-Ward ansatz. In commutative limit, our results coincide with those by Corrigan, Fairlie, Yates and Goddard.
