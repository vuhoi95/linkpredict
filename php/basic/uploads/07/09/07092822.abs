Title: Soliton Stability in a Generalized Sine-Gordon Potential
Authors: Ruben Cordero and Roberto D. Mota
Abstract: We study stability of a generalized sine-Gordon model with two coupled scalar fields in two dimensions. Topological soliton solutions are found from the first-order equations that solve the equations of motion. The perturbation equations can be cast in terms of a Schrodinger-like operators for fluctuations and their spectra are calculated.
