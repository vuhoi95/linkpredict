Title: Superconformal spaces and implications for superstrings
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We clarify some properties of projective superspace by using a manifestly superconformal notation. In particular, we analyze the N=2 scalar multiplet in detail, including its action, and the propagator and its super-Schwinger parameters. The internal symmetry is taken to be noncompact (after Wick rotation), allowing boundary conditions that preserve it off shell. Generalization to N=4 suggests the coset superspace PSU(2,2|4)/OSp(4|4) for the AdS/CFT superstring.
