Title: A Description of Rotating Multicharged Black Holes in terms of Branes  and Antibranes
Authors: Samrat Bhowmick and S. Kalyana Rama
Abstract: We describe rotating multicharge black holes as stacks of intersecting branes and antibranes together with massless gases on them. Assuming the energies of the gases to be equal, we find that their angular momentum parameters, corresponding to black hole rotations, are also equal. The entropy S of this model is given by S = X S_{sg} where S_{sg} is the supergravity entropy. One can obtain X = 1 under an assumption which violates conservation of energy. We show that X = 1 can also be obtained if one assumes that there is only one single gas, which is some sort of superposition of the gases mentioned above, and that the brane tensions are reduced by a factor of four. In this interpretation, energy is conserved and the unusual assumption that energies, not temperatures, of the gases are equal becomes superfluous.
