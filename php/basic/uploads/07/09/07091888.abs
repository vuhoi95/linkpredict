Title: Localization of fermionic fields on braneworlds with bulk tachyon matter
Authors: Xin-Hui Zhang and Yu-Xiao Liu and Yi-Shi Duan
Abstract: Recently, Pal and Skar in [arXiv:hep-th/0701266] proposed a mechanism to arise the warped braneworld models from bulk tachyon matter, which are endowed with a thin brane and a thick brane. In this framework, we investigate localization of fermionic fields on these branes. As in the 1/2 spin case, the field can be localized on both the thin and thick branes with inclusion of scalar background. In the 3/2 spin extension, the general supergravity action coupled to chiral supermultiplets is considered to produce the localization on both the branes as a result.
