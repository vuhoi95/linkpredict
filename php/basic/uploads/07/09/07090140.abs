Title: Perturbation Theory of Coulomb Gauge Yang-Mills Theory Within the First  Order Formalism
Authors: Peter Watson and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: Perturbative Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory within the first order formalism is considered. Using a differential equation technique and dimensional regularization, analytic results for both the ultraviolet divergent and finite parts of the two-point functions at one-loop order are derived. It is shown how the non-ultraviolet divergent parts of the results are finite at spacelike momenta with kinematical singularities on the light-cone and subsequent branch cuts extending into the timelike region.
