Title: The abelian cosets of the Heisenberg group
Authors: Giuseppe D'Appollonio and Thomas Quella
Abstract: In this paper we study the abelian cosets of the H(4) WZW model. They coincide or are related to several interesting three-dimensional backgrounds such as the Melvin model, the conical point-particle space-times and the null orbifold. We perform a detailed CFT analysis of all the models and compute the coset characters as well as some typical three-point couplings of coset primaries.
