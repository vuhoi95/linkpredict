Title: Quarks in an External Electric Field in Finite Temperature Large N Gauge  Theory
Authors: Tameem Albash and Veselin Filev and Clifford V. Johnson and Arnab Kundu
Abstract: We use a ten dimensional dual string background to aspects of the physics large N four dimensional SU(N) gauge theory, where its fundamental quarks are charged under a background electric field. The theory is N=2 supersymmetric for vanishing temperature and electric field. At zero temperature, we observe that the electric field induces a phase transition associated with the dissociation of the mesons into their constituent quarks. This is an analogue of an insulator-metal transition, since the system goes from being an insulator with zero current (in the applied field) to a conductor with free charge carriers (the quarks). At finite temperature this phenomenon persists, with the dissociation transition become subsumed into the more familiar meson melting transition. Here, the dissociation phenomenon reduces the critical melting temperature.
