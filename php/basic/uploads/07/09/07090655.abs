Title: Colored Spin Systems, BKP Evolution and finite N_c effects
Authors: P. L. Iafelice and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: Even within the framework of the leading logarithmic approximation the eigenvalues of the BKP kernel for states of more than three reggeized gluons are unknown in general, contrary to the planar limit case where the problem becomes integrable. We consider a 4-gluon kernel for a finite number of colors and define some simple toy models for the configuration space dynamics, which are directly solvable with group theoretical methods. Then we study the dependence of the spectrum of these models with respect to the number of colors and make comparisons with the large limit case.
