Title: Bulk dominated fermion emission on a Schwarzschild background
Authors: H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Jason Doukas and Wade Naylor
Abstract: Using the WKBJ approximation, and the Unruh method, we obtain semi-analytic expressions for the absorption probability (in all energy regimes) for Dirac fermions on a higher dimensional Schwarzschild background. We present an analytic expression relating the absorption probability to the absorption cross-section, and then use these results to plot the emission rates to third order in the WKBJ approximation. The set-up we use is sufficiently general such that it could also easily be applied to any spherically symmetric background in $d$-dimensions. Our results lead to the interesting conclusion that for $d>5$ bulk fermion emission dominates brane localised emission. This is an example contrary to the conjecture that black holes radiate mainly on the brane.
