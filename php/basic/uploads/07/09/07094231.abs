Title: On the anatomy of multi-spin magnon and single spike string solutions
Authors: H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We study rigid string solutions rotating in $AdS_5\times S^5$ background. For particular values of the parameters of the solutions we find multispin solutions corresponding to giant magnons and single spike strings. We present an analysis of the dispersion relations in the case of three spin solutions distributed only in $S^5$ and the case of one spin in $AdS_5$ and two spins in $S^5$. The possible relation of these string solutions to gauge theory operators and spin chains are briefly discussed.
