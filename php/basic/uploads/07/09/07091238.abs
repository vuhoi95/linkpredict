Title: Corrections to the fine structure constant in higher dimensional global  monopole spacetime
Authors: Geusa de A. Marques and V. B. Bezerra
Abstract: In this paper we use the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in order to obtain the corrections to the fine structure constant in (D+1)-dimensional global monopole spacetime. The result is particularized to D-dimensional spacetime. We also discuss the particular case D=3 corresponding to the (3+1)-dimensional global monopole spacetime.
