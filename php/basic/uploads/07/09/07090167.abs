Title: Covariant anomaly and Hawking radiation from the modified black hole in  the rainbow gravity theory
Authors: Jun-Jin Peng and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: Recently, Banerjee and Kulkarni (R. Banerjee, S. Kulkarni, arXiv:0707.2449 [hep-th]) suggested that it is conceptually clean and economical to use only the covariant anomaly to derive Hawking radiation from a black hole. Based upon this simplified formalism, we apply the covariant anomaly cancellation method to investigate Hawking radiation from a modified Schwarzschild black hole in the theory of rainbow gravity. Hawking temperature of the gravity's rainbow black hole is derived from the energy-momentum flux by requiring it to cancel the covariant gravitational anomaly at the horizon. We stress that this temperature is exactly the same as that calculated by the method of cancelling the consistent anomaly.
