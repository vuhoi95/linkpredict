Title: The spectrum of closed loops of fundamental flux in D=2+1 SU(N) gauge  theories
Authors: Andreas Athenodorou and Barak Bringoltz and Michael Teper
Abstract: We study the closed-string spectrum of SU(N) gauge theories in the fundamental representation in 2+1 dimensions. We calculate the energies of the lowest lying ~ 30 states using a large variety of operators characterised by the quantum numbers of parity and longitudinal momentum. We find that our results for the ground state are very well approximated by the Nambu-Goto (NG) predictions even for short strings. For the excited states, we observe significant deviations from the NG predictions only for very short strings and they decrease rapidly with increasing string length. Finally, we see that Nambu-Goto provides a much better description of our results than the effective string theoretical predictions. We discuss the continuum and large-N limits.
