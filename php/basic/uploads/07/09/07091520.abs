Authors: Li Zhao and Yu-Xiao Liu and Yi-Shi Duan
Abstract: We solve the fermionic zero modes in gravity and gauge backgrounds on a brane involving a warped geometry, and study the localization of spin 1/2 fermionic field on the brane world. The result is that there exist massless spin 1/2 fermions which can be localized on the bulk with the exponentially decreasing warp factor if including U(1) gauge background. Two special cases of gauge backgrounds on the extra dimensional manifold are discussed.
