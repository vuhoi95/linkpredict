Title: Flux, Gaugino Condensation and Anti-Branes in Heterotic M-theory
Authors: James Gray and Andr√© Lukas and Burt Ovrut
Abstract: We present the potential energy due to flux and gaugino condensation in heterotic M-theory compactifications with anti-branes in the vacuum. For reasons which we explain in detail, the contributions to the potential due to flux are not modified from those in supersymmetric contexts. The discussion of gaugino condensation is, however, changed by the presence of anti-branes. We show how a careful microscopic analysis of the system allows us to use standard results in supersymmetric gauge theory in describing such effects - despite the explicit supersymmetry breaking which is present. Not surprisingly, the significant effect of anti-branes on the threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic functions greatly alters the potential energy terms arising from gaugino condensation.
