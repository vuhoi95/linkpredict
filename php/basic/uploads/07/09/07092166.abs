Title: Supercritical N = 2 string theory
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Ian Swanson
Abstract: The N=2 string is examined in dimensions above the critical dimension (D=4) in a linear dilaton background. We demonstrate that string states in this background propagate in a single physical time dimension, as opposed to two such dimensions present when the dilaton gradient vanishes in D=4. We also find exact solutions describing dynamical dimensional reduction and transitions from N=2 string theory to bosonic string theory via closed-string tachyon condensation.
