Title: Dynamics of the topological structures in inhomogeneous media
Authors: L. A. Ferreira and B. Piette and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We present a general review of the dynamics of topological solitons in 1 and 2 dimensions and then discuss some recent work on the scattering of various solitonic objects (such as kinks and breathers etc) on potential obstructions.
