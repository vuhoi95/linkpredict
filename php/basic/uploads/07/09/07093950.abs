Title: Vacuum configurations for renormalizable non-commutative scalar models
Authors: A. de Goursac and A. Tanasa and J-C. Wallet
Abstract: In this paper we find non-trivial vacuum states for the renormalizable non-commutative $\phi^4$ model. An associated linear sigma model is then considered. We further investigate the corresponding spontaneous symmetry breaking.
