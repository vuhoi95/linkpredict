Abstract: The properties of Lorentz transformations in de Sitter relativity are studied. It is shown that, in addition to leaving invariant the velocity of light, they also leave invariant the length-scale related to the curvature of the de Sitter spacetime. The basic conclusion is that it is possible to have an invariant length parameter without breaking the Lorentz symmetry. This result may have important implications for the study of quantum kinematics, and in particular for quantum gravity.
