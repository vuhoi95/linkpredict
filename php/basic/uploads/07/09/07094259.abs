Title: Unravelling Strings at the LHC
Authors: Gordon L. Kane and Piyush Kumar and Jing Shao
Abstract: We construct LHC signature footprints for four semi-realistic string/$M$ theory vacua with an MSSM visible sector. We find that they all give rise to limited regions in LHC signature space, and are qualitatively different from each other for understandable reasons. We also propose a technique in which correlations of LHC signatures can be effectively used to distinguish among these string theory vacua. We expect the technique to be useful for more general string vacua. We argue that further systematic analysis with this approach will allow LHC data to disfavor or exclude major ``corners'' of string/$M$ theory and favor others. The technique can be used with limited integrated luminosity and improved.
