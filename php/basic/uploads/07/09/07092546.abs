Title: Generalized Fubini instantons
Authors: A. A. Yurova and A. V. Yurov
Abstract: We show that $(1+2)$ nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with negative coupling admits an exact solution which appears to be the linear superposition of the plane wave and the nonsingular rational soliton. We show that the same approach allows to construct the solution of similar properties for the Euclidean $\phi^4$ model with broken symmetry. Interestingly, this regular solution will be of instanton type only in the $D\le 5$ Euclidean space.
