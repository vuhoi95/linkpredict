Title: Singular manifolds, topology change and the dynamics of compactification
Authors: Neil A. Butcher and Paul M. Saffin
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the geometric transitions associated to compactified spacetimes. By including the dynamics of gravity we are able to follow the evolution of collapsing cycles as they attempt to undergo a topology changing transition. Rather than achieving this singular geometry we find that one of two scenarios occur, depending on the initial conditions. Either a horizon forms, shielding a curvature singularity, or the cycle re-expands after an initial contraction phase. For the case where a horizon forms we identify the final state with a known analytic black-hole solution. We also show use our results to demonstate a novel compactification mechanism, owing to the asymptotic structure of this black-hole solution.
