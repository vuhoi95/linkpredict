Title: Bremsstrahlung Effects around Evaporating Black Holes
Authors: Don N. Page and B. J. Carr and Jane H. MacGibbon
Abstract: We discuss a variety of bremsstrahlung processes associated with charged particles emitted by evaporating black holes. We show that such particles produce a negligible number of bremsstrahlung photons from their scattering off each other, though at low frequencies inner bremsstrahlung photons dominate over the direct Hawking emission of photons. This analysis and the further analysis of the accompanying paper invalidate Heckler's claim that sufficiently hot evaporating black holes form QED photospheres.
