Title: Revisiting Quaternionic Dual Electrodynamics
Authors: P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Dual electrodynamics and corresponding Maxwell's equations (in the presence of monopole only) are revisited from dual symmetry and accordingly the quaternionic reformulation of field equations and equation of motion is developed in simple, compact and consistent manner.
