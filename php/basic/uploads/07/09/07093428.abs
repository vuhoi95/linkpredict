Title: Bulk antisymmetric tensor fields in a Randall-Sundrum model
Authors: Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya and Somasri Sen and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We consider bulk antisymmetric tensor fields of various ranks in a Randall-Sundrum scenario. We show that, rank-2 onwards, the zero-modes of the projections of these fields on the (3+1) dimensional visible brane become increasingly weaker as the rank of the tensor increases. All such tensor fields of rank 4 or more are absent from the dynamics in four dimensions. This leaves only the zero-mode graviton to have coupling $\sim 1/M_P$ with matter, thus explaining why the large-scale behaviour of the universe is governed by gravity only. We have also computed the masses of the heavier modes upto rank-3, and shown that they are relatively less likely to have detectable accelerator signals.
