Title: New Dual Conformally Invariant Off-Shell Integrals
Authors: Dung Nguyen and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: Evidence has recently emerged for a hidden symmetry of scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory called dual conformal symmetry. At weak coupling the presence of this symmetry has been observed through five loops, while at strong coupling the symmetry has been shown to have a natural interpretation in terms of a T-dualized AdS_5. In this paper we study dual conformally invariant off-shell four-point Feynman diagrams. We classify all such diagrams through four loops and evaluate 10 new off-shell integrals in terms of Mellin-Barnes representations, also finding explicit expressions for their infrared singularities.
