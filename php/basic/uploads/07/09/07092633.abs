Abstract: We address the construction of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on tangent bundles of arbitrary Hermitian symmetric spaces starting from projective superspace. Using a systematic way of solving the (infinite number of) auxiliary field equations along with the requirement of supersymmetry, we are able to derive a closed form for the Lagrangian on the tangent bundle and to dualize it to give the hyperkahler potential on the cotangent bundle. As an application, the case of the exceptional symmetric space E_6/SO(10) \times U(1) is explicitly worked out for the first time.
