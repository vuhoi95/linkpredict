Title: Non-perturbative renormalization-group approach to zero-temperature Bose  systems
Authors: N. Dupuis and K. Sengupta
Abstract: We use a non-perturbative renormalization-group technique to study interacting bosons at zero temperature. Our approach reveals the instability of the Bogoliubov fixed point when $d\leq 3$ and yields the exact infrared behavior in all dimensions $d>1$ within a rather simple theoretical framework. It also enables to compute the low-energy properties in terms of the parameters of a microscopic model. In one-dimension and for not too strong interactions, it yields a good picture of the Luttinger-liquid behavior of the superfluid phase.
