Title: Factorized domain wall partition functions in trigonometric vertex  models
Authors: O. Foda and M. Wheeler and M. Zuparic
Abstract: We obtain factorized domain wall partition functions for two sets of trigonometric vertex models: 1. The N-state Deguchi-Akutsu models, for N = {2, 3, 4} (and conjecture the result for all N >= 5), and 2. The sl(r+1|s+1) Perk-Schultz models, for {r, s = \N}, where (given the symmetries of these models) the result is independent of {r, s}.
