Title: Moduli Evolution in the Presence of Matter Fields and Flux  Compactification
Authors: Carsten van de Bruck and Ki-Young Choi and Lisa M. H. Hall
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of moduli fields in the KKLT scenario coupled to a Polonyi field, which plays the role of a hidden matter sector field. It was previously shown that such matter fields can uplift AdS vacua to Minkowski or de Sitter vacua. Additionally, we take a background fluid into account (which can be either matter or radiation), which aids moduli stabilisation. Our analysis shows that the presence of the matter field further aids stabilisation, due to a new scaling regime. We study the system both analytically and numerically.
