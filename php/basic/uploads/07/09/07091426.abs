Title: Non-supersymmetric Tachyon-free Type-II and Type-I Closed Strings from  RCFT
Authors: B. Gato-Rivera and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: We consider non-supersymmetric four-dimensional closed string theories constructed out of tensor products of N=2 minimal models. Generically such theories have closed string tachyons, but these may be removed either by choosing a non-trivial partition function or a suitable Klein bottle projection. We find large numbers of examples of both types.
