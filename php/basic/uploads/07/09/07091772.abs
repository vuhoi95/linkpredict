Title: Isospin Matter in AdS/QCD
Authors: Kyung-il Kim and Youngman Kim and Su Houng Lee
Abstract: We study strange and isospin asymmetric matter in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model. We first consider isospin matter, which has served as a good testing ground for nonperturbative QCD. We calculate the isospin chemical potential dependence of hadronic observables such as the masses and the decay constants of the pseudo-scalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons. We discuss a possibility of the charged pion condensation in the matter within the bottom-up AdS/QCD model. Then, we study the properties of the hadronic observables in strange matter. We calculate the deconfinement temperature in strange and isospin asymmetric matter. One of the interesting results of our study is that the critical temperature at a fixed baryon number density increases when the strangeness chemical potential is introduced. This suggests that if matter undergoes a first-order transition to strange matter, the critical temperature shows a sudden jump at the transition point.
