Title: M-Theory Brane Deformations
Authors: David S. Berman and Laura C. Tadrowski
Abstract: Using the techniques developed by Lunin and Maldacena we calaculate the supergravity solutions of membranes and fivebranes in the presence of a background C field. All the distinct possible C-field configurations are explored. Decoupling limits for these branes are then described that preserve the deformation leading to families of M-theory brane deformation duals. The decoupled geometry is then explored using probe brane techniques and brane thermodynamics.
