Title: Quantum Gravity Corrections to the One Loop Scalar Self-Mass during  Inflation
Authors: E. O. Kahya and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We compute the one loop corrections from quantum gravity to the self-mass-squared of a massless, minimally coupled scalar on a locally de Sitter background. The calculation was done using dimensional regularization and renormalized by subtracting fourth order BPHZ counterterms. Our result should determine whether quantum gravitational loop corrections can significantly alter the dynamics of a scalar inflaton.
