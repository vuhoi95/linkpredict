Title: Microcausality in Curved Space-Time
Authors: Sergei Dubovsky and Alberto Nicolis and Enrico Trincherini and Giovanni Villadoro
Abstract: It is well known that in Lorentz invariant quantum field theories in flat space the commutator of space-like separated local operators vanishes (microcausality). We provide two different arguments showing that this is a consequence of the causal structure of the classical theory, rather than of Lorentz invariance. In particular, microcausality holds in arbitrary curved space-times, where Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken by the background metric. As illustrated by an explicit calculation on a cylinder this property is rather non trivial at the level of Feynman diagrams.
