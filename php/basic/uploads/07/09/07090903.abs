Title: The TQ equation of the 8 vertex model for complex elliptic roots of  unity
Authors: Klaus Fabricius and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: We extend our studies of the TQ equation introduced by Baxter in his 1972 solution of the 8 vertex model with parameter $\eta$ given by $2L\eta=2m_1K+im_2K'$ from $m_2=0$ to the more general case of complex $\eta.$ We find that there are several different cases depending on the parity of $m_1$ and $m_2$.
