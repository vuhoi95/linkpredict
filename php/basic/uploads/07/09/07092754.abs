Title: Slowly Rotating Dilaton Black hole In Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Tanwi Ghosh and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: Rotating dilaton black hole solution for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime are obtained in the small angular momentum limit with an appropriate combination of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials. The angular momentum, magnetic dipole moment and the gyromagnetic ratio of such a black hole are determined for arbitrary values of the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling parameter.
