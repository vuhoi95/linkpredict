Title: Microscopic formulation of the S-matrix in AdS/CFT
Authors: Kazuhiro Sakai and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: We develop the derivation we proposed in hep-th/0703177 of the dressing phase of the S-matrix in the AdS/CFT correspondence in the framework of the underlying bare integrable model. We elaborate the configuration of the Bethe roots describing the physical vacuum, which consists of a long Bethe string stretched along the imaginary axis and stacks distributed along the real axis. We determine the distribution of all Bethe roots in the thermodynamic limit. We then directly compute the scattering phase of the fundamental excitations over the physical vacuum and reproduce the BHL/BES dressing phase.
