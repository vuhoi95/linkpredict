Title: Absence of logarithmic scaling in the ageing behaviour of the 4D  spherical model
Authors: Maximilian Ebbinghaus and Helene Grandclaude and Malte Henkel
Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of the kinetic spherical model, quenched to T<=T_c, with a non-conserved order-parameter is studied at its upper critical dimension d=d*=4. In the scaling limit where both the waiting time s and the observation time t are large and the ratio y=t/s>1 is fixed, the scaling functions of the two-time autocorrelation and autoresponse functions do not contain any logarithmic correction factors and the typical size of correlated domains scales for large times as L(t) ~ t^0.5 .
