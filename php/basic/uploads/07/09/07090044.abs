Title: Can the anomaly cancellation method derive a correct Hawking temperature  of a Schwarzschild black hole in the isotropic coordinates ?
Authors: Jun-Jin Peng and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to an incorrect statement on the viability of the Robinson-Wilczek method when applied to the case when the metric determinant vanishes at the horizon. This paper has been replaced by arXiv:0803.1338 [hep-th].
