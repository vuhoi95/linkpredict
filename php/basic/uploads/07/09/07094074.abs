Title: Comment on "Hawking Radiation and Covariant Anomalies"
Authors: Shuang-Qing Wu and Zhan-Yue Zhao
Abstract: We comment on the consistence of the epsilon anti-symmetric tensor adopted in [R. Banerjee and S. Kulkarni, arXiv:0707.2449] when it is generalized in the general case where $\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$. It is pointed out that the correct non-minimal consistent gauge and gravitational anomalies should by multiplied a factor $\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$. We also sketch the generalization of their work to the $\sqrt{-g} \neq 1$ case.
