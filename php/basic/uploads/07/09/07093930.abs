Title: On supersymmetric $D6$-$\bar D 6$ systems with magnetic fields
Authors: Walter H. Baron and Adrian R. Lugo
Abstract: We study systems of $D6$ and $\bar D 6$ branes with non zero world-volume magnetic fields in the weak coupling limit. We find two configurations for which the conditions for absence of tachyons in the spectra coincide exactly with those found in the low energy effective theory approach, for the systems to preserve 1/8 of the supersymmetries of the Type $IIA$ string theory vacuum. These conditions give rise to a four-parameter family of solutions in each case. We present further evidence of the stability of these systems by computing the lowest order interaction amplitude, verifying the no force condition as well as the supersymmetric character of the spectrum.
