Title: Power-law Behavior of High Energy String Scatterings in Compact Spaces
Authors: Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We calculate high energy massive scattering amplitudes of closed bosonic string compactified on the torus. We obtain infinite linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes. For some kinematic regimes, we discover that some linear relations break down and, simultaneously, the amplitudes enhance to power-law behavior due to the space-time T-duality symmetry in the compact direction. This result is consistent with the coexistence of the linear relations and the softer exponential fall-off behavior of high energy string scattering amplitudes as we pointed out prevously. It is also reminiscent of hard (power-law) string scatterings in warped spacetime proposed by Polchinski and Strassler.
