Title: Anthropics and Myopics: Conditional Probabilities and the Cosmological  Constant
Authors: Irit Maor and Lawrence Krauss and Glenn Starkman
Abstract: We re-examine claims that anthropic arguments provide an explanation for the observed smallness of the cosmological constant, and argue that correlations between the cosmological constant value and the existence of life can be demonstrated only under restrictive assumptions. Causal effects are more subtle to uncover.
