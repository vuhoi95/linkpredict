Title: Generalized Misner-Sharp quasi-local mass in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet  gravity
Authors: Hideki Maeda and Masato Nozawa
Abstract: We investigate properties of a quasi-local mass in a higher-dimensional spacetime having symmetries corresponding to the isomertries of an $(n-2)$-dimensional maximally symmetric space in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant. We assume that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant is non-negative. The quasi-local mass was recently defined by one of the authors as a counterpart of the Misner-Sharp quasi-local mass in general relativity. The quasi-local mass is found to be a quasi-local conserved charge associated with a locally conserved current constructed from the generalized Kodama vector and exhibits the unified first law corresponding to the energy-balance law. In the asymptotically flat case, it converges to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass at spacelike infinity, while it does to the Deser-Tekin and Padilla mass at infinity in the case of asymptotically AdS. Under the dominant energy condition, we show the monotonicity of the quasi-local mass for any $k$, while the positivity on an untrapped hypersurface with a regular center is shown for $k=1$ and for $k=0$ with an additional condition, where $k=\pm1,0$ is the constant sectional curvature of each spatial section of equipotential surfaces. Under a special relation between coupling constants, positivity of the quasi-local mass is shown for any $k$ without assumptions above. We also classify all the vacuum solutions by utilizing the generalized Kodama vector. Lastly, several conjectures on further generalization of the quasi-local mass in Lovelock gravity are proposed.
