Title: Simple Finite Non-Abelian Flavor Groups
Authors: Christoph Luhn and Salah Nasri and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: The recently measured unexpected neutrino mixing patterns have caused a resurgence of interest in the study of finite flavor groups with two- and three-dimensional irreducible representations. This paper details the mathematics of the two finite simple groups with such representations, the Icosahedral group A_5, a subgroup of SO(3), and PSL_2(7), a subgroup of SU(3).
