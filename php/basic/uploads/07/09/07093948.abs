Title: Rho meson condensation at finite isospin chemical potential in a  holographic model for QCD
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Kasper Peeters and Jacob Sonnenschein and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We analyze the effect of an isospin chemical potential \mu_I in the Sakai-Sugimoto model, which is the string dual of a confining gauge theory related to large N_c QCD, at temperatures below the chiral symmetry restoration temperature. For small chemical potentials we show that the results agree with expectations from the low-energy chiral Lagrangian, and the charged pion condenses. When the chemical potential reaches a critical value \mu_I = \mu_{crit} ~ 1.7 m_{\rho}, the lowest vector meson (the "rho meson") becomes massless, and it condenses (in addition to the pion condensate) for \mu_I > \mu_{crit}. This spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry, as well as a residual U(1) flavor symmetry. We numerically construct the resulting new ground state for \mu_I > \mu_{crit}.
