Title: General Operator Solutions and BRST Quantization of Superstrings in the  pp-Wave with Torsion
Authors: Yoichi Chizaki and Shigeaki Yahikozawa
Abstract: We completely accomplish the canonically covariant quantization of Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) superstrings in the pp-wave background with a non-zero flux of the NS-NS antisymmetric two-form field. Here this flux is equivalent to a nonvanishing torsion. In this quantization, general operator solutions, which satisfy the entire equation of motion and all the canonical (anti)commutation relations, play an important role. The whole of covariant string coordinates and fermions can be composed of free modes. Moreover, employing covariant free-mode representations, we calculate the anomaly in the super-Virasoro algebra and determine the number of dimensions of spacetime and the ordering constant from the nilpotency condition of the BRST charge in the pp-wave background with the flux.
