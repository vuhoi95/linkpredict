Title: The ambiguity-free four-dimensional Lorentz-breaking Chern-Simons action
Authors: F. A. Brito and J. R. Nascimento and E. Passos and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: The four dimensional Lorentz-breaking finite and determined Chern-Simons like action is generated as a one loop perturbative correction via an appropriate Lorentz-breaking coupling of the gauge field with the spinor field. Unlike the known schemes of calculations, within this scheme this term is found to be regularization independent.
