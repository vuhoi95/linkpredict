Title: Spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in a supersymmetric Chern-Simons  model
Authors: A. C. Lehum and A. F. Ferrari and M. Gomes and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: This works presents a perturbative analysis of the supersymmetric Chern-Simons model in three spacetime dimensions coupled to a Higgs field, using the superfield formalism. We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the U(1) gauge symmetry and evaluate the first quantum corrections to the effective action in the broken phase. We show that the infinite renormalization of the gap equation is enough to ensure the renormalizability of the model at the first loop level.
