Title: Space-time filling branes in non critical (super) string theories
Authors: Adri√°n R. Lugo and Mauricio B. Sturla
Abstract: We consider solutions of (super) gravities associated to non-critical (super) string theories in arbitrary space-time dimension D=p+3, that describe generically non extremal black p-branes charged under NSNS or RR gauge fields, embedded in some non critical vacuum. In the case of vacuum (uncharged) backgrounds, we solve completely the problem obtaining all the possible solutions, that consist of the (p+1)-dimensional Minkowski space times a linear dilaton times a S^1, and a three parameter family of solutions that include (p+1)-dimensional Minkowski space times the cigar, and its T-dual (p+1)-dimensional Minkowski space times the trumpet. For NSNS charged solutions, we also solve in closed form the problem, obtaining several families of solutions, that include in particular the fundamental non-critical string solution embedded in the cigar vacuum, recently found in hep-th/0604202, a solution that we interpret as a fundamental non-critical string embedded in the linear dilaton vacuum, and a two-parameter family of regular curvature solutions asymptotic to AdS_{1,2}\times S^1. In the case of RR charged Dp-branes solutions, an ansatz allows us to find a non conformal, constant curvature, asymptotically AdS_{1,p+1} space, T-dual to AdS_{1,p+2}, together with a two-parameter family of solutions that includes the non conformal, AdS black hole like solution associated with the earlier space. The solutions obtained by T-duality are Einstein spaces consisting of a two-parameter family of conformal, constant dilaton solutions, that include, in particular, the AdS black hole of hep-th/0403254. We speculate about the possible applications of some of them in the framework of the gauge-gravity correspondence.
