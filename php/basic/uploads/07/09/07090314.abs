Title: The Electric Dipole Moment of the Nucleons in Holographic QCD
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Hyun-Chul Kim and Sanjay Siwach and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We introduce the strong CP-violation in the framework of AdS/QCD model and calculate the electric dipole moments of nucleons as well as the CP-violating pion-nucleon coupling. Our holographic estimate of the electric dipole moments gives for the neutron d_n=1.08 X 10^{-16} theta (e cm), which is comparable with previous estimates. We also predict that the electric dipole moment of the proton should be precisely the minus of the neutron electric dipole moment, thus leading to a new sum rule on the electric dipole moments of baryons.
