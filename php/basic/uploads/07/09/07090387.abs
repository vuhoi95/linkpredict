Title: A Multitrace Matrix Model from Fuzzy Scalar Field Theory
Authors: Denjoe O'Connor and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We present the analytical approach to scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere which has been developed in arXiv:0706.2493 [hep-th]. This approach is based on considering a perturbative expansion of the kinetic term in the partition function. After truncating this expansion at second order, one arrives at a multitrace matrix model, which allows for an application of the saddle-point method. The results are in agreement with the numerical findings in the literature.
