Title: N=1 4D Supermembrane from 11D
Authors: M. P. Garcia del Moral and J. M. Pena and A. Restuccia
Abstract: The action of the 11D supermembrane with nontrivial central charges compactified on a 7D toroidal manifold is obtained. It describes a supermembrane evolving in a 4d Minkowski space-time. The action is invariant under additional symmetries in comparison to the supermembrane on a Minkowski target space. The hamiltonian in the LCG is invariant under conformal transformations on the Riemann surface base manifold. The spectrum of the regularized hamiltonian is discrete with finite multiplicity. Its resolvent is compact. Susy is spontaneously broken, due to the topological central charge condition, to four supersymmetries in 4D, the vacuum belongs to an N=1 supermultiplet. When assuming the target-space to be an isotropic 7-tori, the potential does not contain any flat direction, it is stable on the moduli space of parameters.
