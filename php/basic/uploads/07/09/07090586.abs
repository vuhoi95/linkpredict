Title: Embedding Brans-Dicke gravity into electroweak theory
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: We argue that a version of the four dimensional Brans-Dicke theory can be embedded in the standard flat spacetime electroweak theory. The embedding involves a change of variables that separates the isospin from the hypercharge in the electroweak theory.
