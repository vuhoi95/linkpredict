Title: Nonperturbative Instability of AdS_5 x S^5/Z_k
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Jacopo Orgera and Joe Polchinski
Abstract: We study the AdS/CFT correspondence with boundary conditions AdS_5 x S^5/Z_k, where the Z_k acts freely but breaks all supersymmetry. While there are closed string tachyons at small 't Hooft coupling, there are no tachyons at large coupling. Nevertheless, we show that there is a nonperturbative instability directly analogous to the decay of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum. We discuss the implications of this instability for the strongly coupled dual field theory, and compare with earlier studies of this theory at weak coupling.
