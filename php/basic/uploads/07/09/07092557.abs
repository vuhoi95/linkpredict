Title: Non-relativistic limit in the 2+1 Dirac Oscillator: A Ramsey  Interferometry Effect
Authors: A. Bermudez and M. A. Martin-Delgado and A. Luis
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic limit of a paradigmatic model in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, the two-dimensional Dirac oscillator. Remarkably, we find a novel kind of Zitterbewegung which persists in this non-relativistic regime, and leads to an observable deformation of the particle orbit. This effect can be interpreted in terms of a Ramsey Interferometric phenomenon, allowing an insightful connection between Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Optics. Furthermore, subsequent corrections to the non-relativistic limit, which account for the usual spin-orbit Zitterbewegung, can be neatly understood in terms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
