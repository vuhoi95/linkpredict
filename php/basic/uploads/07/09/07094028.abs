Title: D-branes and Normal Functions
Authors: David R. Morrison and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: We explain the B-model origin of extended Picard-Fuchs equations satisfied by the D-brane superpotential on compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. Via the Abel-Jacobi map, the domainwall tension is identified with a Poincare normal function--a transversal holomorphic section of the Griffiths intermediate Jacobian. Within this formalism, we derive the extended Picard-Fuchs equation associated with the mirror of the real quintic.
