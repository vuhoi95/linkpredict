Title: The closed string spectrum of SU(N) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Andreas Athenodorou and Barak Bringoltz and Michael Teper
Abstract: We use lattice techniques to study the closed-string spectrum of SU(N) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions. We calculate the energies of the lowest lying ~30 states for strings with lengths between l ~ 0.45 fm and l ~ 3 fm, and compare to different theoretical predictions. We obtain unambiguous evidence that the closed-strings are in the universality class of the Nambu-Goto free bosonic string. Moreover, we clearly see that our data can be described by a covariant string theory with a small/moderate correction down to very short distance scales, and possibly on all distance scales at large-N.
