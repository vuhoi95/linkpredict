Title: Exotic Non-relativistic String
Authors: Roberto Casalbuoni and Joaquim Gomis and Giorgio Longhi
Abstract: We construct a classical non-relativistic string model in 3+1 dimensions. The model contains a spurion tensor field that is responsible for the non-commutative structure of the model. Under double dimensional reduction the model reduces to the exotic non-relativistic particle in 2+1 dimensions.
