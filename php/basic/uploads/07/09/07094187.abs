Title: A Semiclassical String Description of Wilson Loop with Local Operators
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss a semiclassical string description to circular Wilson loops without/with local operator insertions. By considering a semiclassical approximation of type IIB string theory on AdS_5 X S^5 around the corresponding classical solutions, quadratic actions with respect to fluctuations are computed. Then the dual corresponding operators describing the fluctuations are discussed from the point of view of a small deformation of the Wilson loops. The result gives new evidence for AdS/CFT correspondence.
