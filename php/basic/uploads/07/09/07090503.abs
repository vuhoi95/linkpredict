Abstract: We consider an infrared Lorentz violation in connection with recent results of PVLAS experiment. Our analysis is based in a relation that can be established, under certain conditions, between an axial-like-particle theory and electrodynamics with an infrared scale. In the PVLAS case, the conditions imply two dispersion relations such that the infrared scale $|\vec \theta|$, the inverse axion-photon coupling constant $M^{-1}$ and the external magnetic field ${\vec B}$ can be connected through the formula $|{\vec \theta}|= {|\vec B|}/M$. Our analysis, which only requires a non-dynamical (auxiliar) axial-like field leads to $|{\vec\theta}| \leq 5.4 \times 10^{-7}$ meV and $M^{-1} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ GeV $^{-1}$.
