Title: The Contribution of the Cosmological Constant to the Relativistic  Bending of Light Revisited
Authors: Wolfgang Rindler and Mustapha Ishak
Abstract: We study the effect of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ on the bending of light by a concentrated spherically symmetric mass. Contrarily to previous claims, we show that when the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry is taken into account, $\Lambda$ does indeed contribute to the bending.
