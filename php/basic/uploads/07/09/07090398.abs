Abstract: Using a quaternionic formulation of the moduli space $\boldsymbol{M}({\small IIA/K3}) $ of 10D type IIA superstring on a generic K3 complex surface with volume $\boldsymbol{V}_{0}$, we study extremal $\mathcal{N}=2$ black attractors in 6D space-time and their uplifting to 7D. For the 6D theory, we exhibit the role played by 6D $\mathcal{N}=1$ hypermultiplets and the $Z^{m}$ central charges isotriplet of the 6D $\mathcal{N}=2$ superalgebra. We construct explicitly the special hyperKahler geometry of $% \boldsymbol{M}({\small IIA/K3}) $ and show that the $SO(4) \times SO(20) $ invariant hyperKahler potential is given by $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_{0}+\mathrm{Tr}[ \ln (1-% \boldsymbol{V}_{0}^{-1}\boldsymbol{S}) ] $ with Kahler leading term $\mathcal{H}_{0}=\mathrm{Tr}[ \ln \boldsymbol{V}_{0}] $ plus an extra term which can be expanded as a power series in $\boldsymbol{V}%_{0}^{-1}$ and the traceless and symmetric 3$\times $3 matrix $\boldsymbol{S} $. We also derive the holomorphic matrix prepotential $\mathcal{G}$ and the flux potential $\mathcal{G}_{BH}$ of the 6D black objects induced by the topology of the RR field strengths $\mathcal{F}_{2}=d\mathcal{A}_{1}$ and $% \mathcal{F}_{4}=d\mathcal{A}_{3}$ on the K3 surface and show that $\mathcal{G% }_{BH}$ reads as $Q_{0}+\sum_{m=1}^{3}q^{m}Z^{m}$. Moreover, we reveal that $% Z^{m}=\sum_{I=1}^{20}Q_{I}(\int_{C_{2}^{I}}J^{m}) $ where the isotriplet $J^{m}$ is the hyperKahler 2- form on the K3 surface. It is found as well that the uplifting to seven dimensions is quite similar to 4D/5D correspondence for back hole potential considered in arXiv 0707.0964 [hep-th].
