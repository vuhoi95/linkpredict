Title: The 't Hooft-Polyakov Monopole in the Presence of a 't Hooft Operator
Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis and Brian Durcan
Abstract: We present explicit BPS field configurations representing one nonabelian monopole with one minimal weight 't Hooft operator insertion. We explore the SO(3) and SU(2) gauge groups. In the case of SU(2) gauge group the minimal 't Hooft operator can be completely screened by the monopole. If the gauge group is SO(3), however, such screening is impossible. In the latter case we observe a different effect of the gauge symmetry enhancement in the vicinity of the 't Hooft operator.
