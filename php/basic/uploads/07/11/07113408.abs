Title: New connection formulae for some q-orthogonal polynomials in q-Askey  scheme
Authors: Abdelkader Yanallah and Mohammed Brahim Zahaf
Abstract: New nonlinear connection formulae of the q-orthogonal polynomials, such continuous q-Laguerre, continuous big q-Hermite, q-Meixner-Pollaczek and q-Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of their respective classical analogues are obtained using a special realization of the q-exponential function as infinite multiplicative series of ordinary exponential function.
