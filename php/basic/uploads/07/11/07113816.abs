Title: Standard supersymmetry from a Planck-scale statistical theory
Authors: Roland E. Allen and Zorawar Wadiasingh and Seiichirou Yokoo
Abstract: We outline three new ideas in a program to obtain standard physics, including standard supersymmetry, from a Planck-scale statistical theory: (1) The initial spin 1/2 bosonic fields are transformed to spin 0 fields together with their auxiliary fields. (2) Time is defined by the progression of 3-geometries, just as originally proposed by DeWitt. (3) The initial (D-1)-dimensional "path integral" is converted from Euclidean to Lorentzian form by transformation of the fields in the integrand.
