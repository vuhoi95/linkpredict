Title: Spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in non-commutative  lambda phi^4 theory in two dimensions
Authors: Paolo Castorina and Dario Zappal√†
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of of translational invariance in non-commutative self-interacting scalar field theory in two dimensions is investigated by effective action techniques. The analysis confirms the existence of the stripe phase, already observed in lattice simulations, due to the non-local nature of the non-commutative dynamics.
