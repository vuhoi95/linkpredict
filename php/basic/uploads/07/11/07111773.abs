Authors: L. R. Ribeiro and E. Passos and C. Furtado and J. R. Nascimento
Abstract: In the present contribution we investigate the Landau analog energy quantization for neutral particles, that possesses a nonzero permanent magnetic and electric dipole moments, in the presence of an homogeneous electric and magnetic external fields in the context of the noncommutative quantum mechanics. Also, we analyze the Landau--Aharonov--Casher and Landau--He--McKellar--Wilkens quantization due to noncommutative quantum dynamics of magnetic and electric dipoles in the presence of an external electric and magnetic fields and the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions are obtained. Furthermore, we have analyzed Landau quantization analogs in the noncommutative phase space, and we obtain also the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions in this context.
