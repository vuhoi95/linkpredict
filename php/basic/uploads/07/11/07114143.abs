Title: Exponentially localized solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation
Authors: M. V. Perel and I. V. Fialkovsky
Abstract: Exponentially localized solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for two and three space variables are presented. The solutions depend on four free parameters. For some relations between the parameters, the solutions describe wave packets filled with oscillations whose amplitudes decrease in the Gaussian way with distance from a point running with group velocity along a straight line. The solutions are constructed using exact complex solutions of the eikonal equation and may be regarded as ray solutions with amplitudes involving one term. It is also shown that the multidimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation can be reduced to an ordinary differential equation with respect to the complex eikonal.
