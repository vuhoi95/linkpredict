Title: New counterterms induced by trans-Planckian physics in semiclassical  gravity
Authors: Diana LÃ³pez Nacir and Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We consider free and self-interacting quantum scalar fields satisfying modified dispersion relations in the framework of Einstein-Aether theory. Using adiabatic regularization, we study the renormalization of the equation for the mean value of the field in the self-interacting case, and the renormalization of the semiclassical Einstein-Aether equations for free fields. In both cases we consider Bianchi type I background spacetimes. Contrary to what happens for {\it free} fields in {\it flat} Robertson-Walker spacetimes, the self-interaction and/or the anisotropy produce non-purely geometric terms in the adiabatic expansion, i.e terms that involve both the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and the aether field $u_{\mu}$. We argue that, in a general spacetime, the renormalization of the theory would involve new counterterms constructed with $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $u_{\mu}$, generating a fine-tuning problem for the Einstein-Aether theory.
