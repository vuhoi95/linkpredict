Title: Open Inflationary Universes in Gauss-Bonnet Brane Cosmology
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: In this article, we study a type of one-field approach for open inflationary universe scenario in the context of braneworld models with a Gauss-Bonnet correction term. For a one-bubble universe model, we determine and characterize the existence of the Coleman-De Lucia instanton together with the period of inflation after tunneling has occurred. Our results are compared those analogous obtained when the usual Einstein Theory of Gravitation is used.
