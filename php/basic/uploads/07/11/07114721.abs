Title: New Lump-like Structures in Scalar-field Models
Authors: A. T. Avelar and D. Bazeia and L. Losano and R. Menezes
Abstract: In this work we investigate lump-like solutions in models described by a single real scalar field. We start considering non-topological solutions with the usual lump-like form, and then we study other models, where the bell-shape profile may have varying amplitude and width, or develop a flat plateau at its top, or even induce a lump on top of another lump. We suggest possible applications where these exotic solutions might be used in several distinct branches of physics.
