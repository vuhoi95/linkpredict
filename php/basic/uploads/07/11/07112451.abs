Title: D-branes at Singularities and String Phenomenology
Authors: Dmitry Malyshev and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: In these notes we give an introduction to some of the concepts involved in constructing SM-like gauge theories in systems of branes at singularities of CY manifolds. These notes are an expanded version of lectures given by Herman Verlinde at the Cargese 2006 Summer School.
