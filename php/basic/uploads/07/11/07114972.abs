Title: Existence of Asymptotic Expansions in Noncommutative Quantum Field  Theories
Authors: C. A. Linhares and A. P. C. Malbouisson and I. Roditi
Abstract: Starting from the complete Mellin representation of Feynman amplitudes for noncommutative vulcanized scalar quantum field theory, introduced in a previous publication, we generalize to this theory the study of asymptotic behaviours under scaling of arbitrary subsets of external invariants of any Feynman amplitude. This is accomplished for both convergent and renormalized amplitudes.
