Title: Anisotropic Higgs oscillator
Authors: Armen Nersessian and Vahagn Yeghikyan
Abstract: We present the higher-dimensional generalization of anisotropic (pseudo)spherical oscillator suggested recently in [arXiv:0710.5001], and the related spherical and pseudosperical generalizations (MICZ-)Kepler like systems with Stark term and $\cos\theta$ potential. We write down the potentials and hidden symmetry generators of these systems, in terms of ambient Euclidean space.
