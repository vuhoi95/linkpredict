Title: Thermodynamics of a black hole based on a generalized uncertainty  principle
Authors: Wontae Kim and Edwin J. Son and Myungseok Yoon
Abstract: We study thermodynamic quantities and the stability of a black hole in a cavity using the Euclidean action formalism by Gibbons and Hawking based on the generalized uncertainty relation which is extended in a symmetric way with respect to the space and momentum without loss of generality. Two parameters in the uncertainty relation affect the thermodynamical quantities such as energy, entropy, and the heat capacity. In particular, it can be shown that the small black hole is unstable and it may decay either into a minimal black hole or a large black hole. We discuss a constraint for a large black hole comparable to the size of the cavity in connection with the critical mass.
