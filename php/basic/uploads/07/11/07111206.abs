Abstract: We have recently demonstrated that Casimir energy due to parallel plates, including its divergent parts, falls like conventional mass in a weak gravitational field. The divergent parts were suitably interpreted as renormalizing the bare masses of the plates. Here we corroborate our result regarding the inertial nature of Casimir energy by calculating the centripetal force on a Casimir apparatus rotating with constant angular speed. We show that the centripetal force is independent of the orientation of the Casimir apparatus in a frame whose origin is at the center of inertia of the apparatus.
