Abstract: New actions in D=2 and D=3 are proposed that are dual equivalent to known theories displaying well defined chirality and helicity, respectively, along with a new interpolating action that maps continuously through the original dualities. The new chiral action in D=2 is a second-order theory displaying the chiral constraint dynamically while in D=3 the helicity constraint is imposed a la Siegel. The resulting theories introduce new versions of the Hull noton to take care of the symmetry aspects of the original models. The new interpolating formulation is then re-examined as a condensed phase for the discussion of duality under the light of the dual mechanisms -- Julia-Toulouse and Higgs -- establishing new interpolating actions in the dilute phase, according to these mechanisms.
