Title: On Geometro-thermodynamics of Dilaton Black Holes
Authors: Jan E. Aman and Narit Pidokrajt and John Ward
Abstract: In this talk we present the latest results from our ongoing project on geometro-thermodynamics (also known as information geometry of thermodynamics or Ruppeiner geometry) of dilaton BHs in 4D in both Einstein and string frames and a dyonic dilaton BH and at the end we report very briefly results from this approach to the 2D dilaton BHs.
