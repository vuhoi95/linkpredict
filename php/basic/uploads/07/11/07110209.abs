Title: Hierarchies from D-brane instantons in globally defined Calabi-Yau  Orientifolds
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We construct the first globally consistent semi-realistic Type I string vacua on an elliptically fibered manifold where the zero modes of the Euclidean D1-instanton sector allow for the generation of non-perturbative Majorana masses of an intermediate scale. In another class of global models, a D1-brane instanton can generate a Polonyi-type superpotential breaking supersymmetry at an exponentially suppressed scale.
