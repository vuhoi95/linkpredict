Title: Generalizations of Nonlinear and Supersymmetric Classical  Electrodynamics
Authors: Steven Duplij and Gerald A. Goldin and Vladimir M. Shtelen
Abstract: We first write down a very general description of nonlinear classical electrodynamics, making use of generalized constitutive equations and constitutive tensors. Our approach includes non-Lagrangian as well as Lagrangian theories, allows for electromagnetic fields in the widest possible variety of media (anisotropic, piroelectric, chiral and ferromagnetic), and accommodates the incorporation of nonlocal effects. We formulate electric-magnetic duality in terms of the constitutive tensors. We then propose a supersymmetric version of the general constitutive equations, in a superfield approach.
