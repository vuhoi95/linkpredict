Title: Darboux transformation of boundary conditions of regular Dirac  Sturm--Liouville problem
Authors: Ekaterina Pozdeeva and Alexander Tarasov
Abstract: It is shown that boundary conditions of the Darboux transformed Dirac Sturm--Liouville problem are always zero-valued independently on boundary conditions of initial problem.
