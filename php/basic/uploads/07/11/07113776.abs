Title: Superconformal invariance from N=2 supersymmetry Ward identities
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Guillaume Bossard
Abstract: We algebraically prove the cancellation of the beta function at all order of perturbation theory of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with a vanishing one-loop beta function. The proof generalises that recently given for the N=4 case. It uses the consistent Slavnov-Taylor identities of the shadow dependent formulation. We also demonstrate the cancellation at all orders of the anomalous dimensions of vector and hypermultiplet one half BPS operators.
