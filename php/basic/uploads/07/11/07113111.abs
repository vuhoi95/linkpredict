Title: Quantum Secret Sharing with Multi-level Mutually (Un-)Biased Bases
Authors: I-Ching Yu and Feng-Li Lin and Ching-Yu Huang
Abstract: We construct general schemes for multi-partite quantum secret sharing using multi-level systems, and find that the consistent conditions for valid measurements can be summarized in two simple algebraic conditions. The scheme using the very high dimensional mutually unbiased bases can in principle achieve perfect security against intercept-resend attack; and for the scheme using mutually biased bases, it reaches the optimal but non-perfect security at 4-level system. We also address the security issue against the general attacks in the context of our multi-level schemes. Especially, we propose new protocol to enhance both the efficiency and the security against the entanglement-assisted participant's attack by incorporating quantum-key-distribution and measurement-basis-encrypted schemes so that its security is as robust as quantum-key-distribution.
