Title: Toward the AdS/CFT Gravity Dual for High Energy Collisions: II. The  Stress Tensor on the Boundary
Authors: Shu Lin and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: In this second paper of the series we calculate the stress tensor of excited matter, created by ``debris'' of high energy collisions at the boundary. We found that massive objects (``stones'') falling into the AdS center produce gravitational disturbance which however has $zero$ stress tensor at the boundary. The falling open strings, connected to receeding charges, do produce a nonzero stress tensor which we found analytically from time-dependent linearized Einstein equations in the bulk. It corresponds to exploding non-equilibrium matter: we discuss its behavior in some detail, including its internal energy density in a comoving frame and the ``freezeout surfaces''. We then discuss what happens for the ensemble of strings.
