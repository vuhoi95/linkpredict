Title: Towards a Worldsheet Derivation of the Maldacena Conjecture
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: A U(2,2|4)-invariant A-model constructed from fermionic superfields has recently been proposed as a sigma model for the superstring on AdS_5xS^5. After explaining the relation of this A-model with the pure spinor formalism, the A-model action is expressed as a gauged linear sigma model. In the zero radius limit, the Coulomb branch of this sigma model is interpreted as D-brane holes which are related to gauge-invariant N=4 d=4 super-Yang-Mills operators. As in the worldsheet derivation of open-closed duality for Chern-Simons theory, this construction may lead to a worldsheet derivation of the Maldacena conjecture. Intriguing connections to the twistorial formulation of N=4 Yang-Mills are also noted.
