Title: Charge Oscillations in Superconducting Nanodevices Coupled to External  Environments
Authors: Robert Alicki and Fabio Benatti and Roberto Floreanini
Abstract: Charge oscillations in certain nanodevices, more specifically the so-called Superconducting Cooper Pair Boxes (SCB), are usually interpreted as an effect of macroscopic quantum coherence; an alternative explanation is however possible in terms of the Gross-Pitaewski equation for the classical order parameter. These two explanations are based on different quantum states assigned to the SCB, occupation number states in the first case, coherent-like states in the second one. We show that, when the SCB is weakly coupled to an external source of noise and dissipation, occupation number states are much more unstable than coherent ones.
