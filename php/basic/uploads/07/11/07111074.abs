Title: Charged Rotating Black Holes on DGP Brane
Authors: Daeho Lee and Ee Chang-Young and Myungseok Yoon
Abstract: We consider charged rotating black holes localized on a three-brane in the DGP model. Assuming a $Z_2$-symmetry across the brane and with a stationary and axisymmetric metric ansatz on the brane, a particular solution is obtained in the Kerr-Schild form. This solution belongs to the accelerated branch of the DGP model and has the characteristic of the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter type solution in general relativity. Using a modified version of Boyer-Lindquist coordinates we examine the structures of the horizon and ergosphere.
