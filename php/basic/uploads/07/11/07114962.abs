Abstract: We review recent results on near-horizon static black hole solutions and entropy in R^2-corrected N=2 SUGRA in D=5, focusing on actions connected to heterotic string compactified on K3\times S^1. Comparison with \alpha'-perturbative results, results obtained by using simple Gauss-Bonnet R^2-correction, OSV conjecture and microscopic stringy description (for small black holes) shows that situation in D=5 is, in a sense, even more interesting then in D=4.
