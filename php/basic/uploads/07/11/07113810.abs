Title: On a stabilized warped brane world without Planck brane
Authors: Mikhail N. Smolyakov and Igor P. Volobuev
Abstract: We discuss a stabilized brane world model with two branes, admitting the solution to the hierarchy problem due to the warped extra dimension and possessing a remarkable feature: the strength of gravitational interaction is of the same order on both branes, contrary to the case of the Randall-Sundrum model with a hierarchical difference of gravitational strength on the branes. The solution also admits the existence of two branes with an equal strength of gravitational interaction, which is of interest for treating the matter on the "mirror" brane as dark matter.
