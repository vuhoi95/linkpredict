Title: A note on the Near Flat Limit for strings in the Maldacena-Nunez  background
Authors: M. Kreuzer and C. Mayrhofer and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Recently Maldacena and Swanson suggested a new limit of string theory on the $AdS_5\times S^5$ background, the so called near flat space limit. The resulting reduced theory interpolates between the pp-wave limit and giant magnon type string solutions. It was shown that the reduced model possess many features of the original theory. On the other hand, theories with less supersymmetry are of great importance for the string/gauge theory correspondence. In this paper we study the near flat limit reduction of string theory on the Maldacena-Nunez background, which is dual to $\N=1$ Yang-Mills theory. The reduced model interpolates between the pp-wave limit and a certain magnon type subsector of the theory. The similarity of the structures of the reduced model obtained here and that by Maldacena and Swanson indicates the possibility of existence of integrable subsectors of strings on the Maldacena-Nunez background.
