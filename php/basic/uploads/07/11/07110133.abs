Title: Free Fermions and Thermal AdS/CFT
Authors: Suvankar Dutta and Rajesh Gopakumar
Abstract: The dynamics of finite temperature U(N) gauge theories on $S^3$ can be described, at weak coupling, by an effective unitary matrix model. Here we present an exact solution to these models, for any value of $N$, in terms of a sum over representations. Taking the large $N$ limit of this solution provides a new perspective on the deconfinement transition which is supposed to be dual to the Hawking-Page transition. The large $N$ phase transition manifests itself here in a manner similar to the Douglas-Kazakov phase transition in 2d Yang-Mills theory. We carry out a complete analysis of the saddle representation in the simplest case involving only the order parameter ${\rm Tr}U$. We find that the saddle points corresponding to thermal $AdS$, the small black hole and the large black hole can all be described in terms of free fermions. They all admit a simple phase space description {\it a la} the BPS geometries of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena.
