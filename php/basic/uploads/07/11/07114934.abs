Title: Moduli stabilization with Fayet-Iliopoulos uplift
Authors: E. Dudas and Y. Mambrini and S. Pokorski and A. Romagnoni
Abstract: In the recent years, phenomenological models of moduli stabilization were proposed, where the dynamics of the stabilization is essentially supersymmetric, whereas an O'Rafearthaigh supersymmetry breaking sector is responsible for the "uplift" of the cosmological constant to zero. We investigate the case where the uplift is provided by a Fayet-Iliopoulos sector. We find that in this case the modulus contribution to supersymmetry breaking is larger than in the previous models. A first consequence of this class of constructions is for gauginos, which are heavier compared to previous models. In some of our explicit examples, due to a non-standard gauge-mediation type negative contribution to scalars masses, the whole superpartner spectrum can be efficiently compressed at low-energy. This provides an original phenomenology testable at the LHC, in particular sleptons are generically heavier than the squarks.
