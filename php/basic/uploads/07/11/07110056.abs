Title: Lorentz Invariance Violation and Symmetry in Randers--Finsler Spaces
Authors: Zhe Chang and Xin Li
Abstract: Lorentz Invariance violation is a common feature of new physics beyond the standard model. We show that the symmetry of Randers spaces deduces a modified dispersion relation with characteristics of Lorentz Invariance violation. The counterparts of the Lorentz transformation in the Einstein's Special Relativity are presented explicitly. The coordinate transformations are unitary and form a group. Generators and algebra satisfied by them are different from usual Lorentz ones. The Randersian line element as well as speed of light is invariant under the transformations. In particular, there is another invariant speed which may be related with Planck scale and the mass of moving particle. Thus, the Randers spaces is a suitable framework to discuss the Lorentz Invariance violation.
