Title: Euclidean lattice simulation for the dynamical supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Issaku Kanamori and Fumihiko Sugino and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: The global supersymmetry is spontaneously broken if and only if the ground-state energy is strictly positive. We propose to use this fact to observe the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in euclidean lattice simulations. For lattice formulations that possess a manifest fermionic symmetry, there exists a natural choice of a hamiltonian operator that is consistent with a topological property of the Witten index. We confirm validity of our idea in models of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We then examine a possibility of a dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ super Yang-Mills theory with the gauge group $\SU(2)$, for which the Witten index is unknown. Differently from a recent conjectural claim, our numerical result tempts us to conclude that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken in this system.
