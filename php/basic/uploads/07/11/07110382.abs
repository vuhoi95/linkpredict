Abstract: We introduce and discuss the method of Linear Delta Expansion for the calculation of effective potentials in superspace, by adopting the improved version of the super-Feynman rules. Calculations are carried out up to two-loops and an expression for the optimized K\"{a}hler potential is worked out.
