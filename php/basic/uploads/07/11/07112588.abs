Title: Noncommutative Riemann Surfaces
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Martin Bordemann and Laurent Hofer and Jens Hoppe and Hidehiko Shimada
Abstract: We introduce C-Algebras of compact Riemann surfaces $\Sigma$ as non-commutative analogues of the Poisson algebra of smooth functions on $\Sigma$. Representations of these algebras give rise to sequences of matrix-algebras for which matrix-commutators converge to Poisson-brackets as $N\to\infty$. For a particular class of surfaces, nicely interpolating between spheres and tori, we completely characterize (even for the intermediate singular surface) all finite dimensional representations of the corresponding C-algebras.
