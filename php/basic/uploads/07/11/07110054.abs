Title: S-duality in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: A solution to the infinite coupling problem for N=2 conformal supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions is presented. The infinitely-coupled theories are argued to be interacting superconformal field theories (SCFTs) with weakly gauged flavor groups. Consistency checks of this proposal are found by examining some low-rank examples. As part of these checks, we show how to compute new exact quantities in these SCFTs: the central charges of their flavor current algebras. Also, the isolated rank 1 E_6 and E_7 SCFTs are found as limits of Lagrangian field theories.
