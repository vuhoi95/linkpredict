Title: Periods and Feynman integrals
Authors: Christian Bogner and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We consider multi-loop integrals in dimensional regularisation and the corresponding Laurent series. We study the integral in the Euclidean region and where all ratios of invariants and masses have rational values. We prove that in this case all coefficients of the Laurent series are periods.
