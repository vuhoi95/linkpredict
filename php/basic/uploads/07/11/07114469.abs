Title: Cyclic Universe with Quintom matter in Loop Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Hua-Hui Xiong and Taotao Qiu and Yi-Fu Cai and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we study the possibility of model building of cyclic universe with Quintom matter in the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. After a general demonstration, we provide two examples, one with double-fluid and another double-scalar field, to show how such a scenario is obtained. Analytical and numerical calculations are both presented in the paper.
