Title: Noncommutative Superspace and Super Heisenberg Group
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Hoil Kim and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: In this paper, we consider noncommutative superspace in relation with super Heisenberg group. We construct a matrix representation of super Heisenberg group and apply this to the two-dimensional deformed N=(2,2) superspace that appeared in string theory. We also construct a toy model for non-centrally extended `super Heisenberg group'.
