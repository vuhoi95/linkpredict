Title: Operator Product Expansion of Wilson surfaces from M5-branes
Authors: Bin Chen and Chang-Yong Liu and Jun-Bao Wu
Abstract: The operator product expansion (OPE) of the Wilson surface operators in six-dimensional (2, 0) superconformal field theory is studied from AdS/CFT correspondence in this paper. We compute the OPE coefficients of the chiral primary operators using the M5-brane description for spherical Wilson surface operators in higher dimensional representations. We use the non-chiral M5-brane action in our calculation. We also discuss their membrane limit, and compare our results with the ones obtained from membrane description.
