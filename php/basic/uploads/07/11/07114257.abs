Title: Correlation of energy density in deconfining SU(2) Yang-Mills  thermodynamics
Authors: Jochen Keller and Ralf Hofmann and Francesco Giacosa
Abstract: We compute the two-point correlation of the energy density for the massless mode in deconfining SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics and point towards a possible application for the physics of cold, dilute, and stable clouds of atomic hydrogen within the Milky Way.
