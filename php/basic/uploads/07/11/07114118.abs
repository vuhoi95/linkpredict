Title: Holographic entanglement entropy for disconnected regions
Authors: Veronika E. Hubeny and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We present a simple derivation of the entanglement entropy for a region made up of a union of disjoint intervals in 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories using holographic techniques. This generalizes the results for 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories derived previously by exploiting the uniformization map. We further comment on the generalization of our result to higher dimensional field theories.
