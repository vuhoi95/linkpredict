Title: The QCD spin chain S matrix
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Rafael I. Nepomechie and Junji Suzuki
Abstract: Beisert et al. have identified an integrable SU(2,2) quantum spin chain which gives the one-loop anomalous dimensions of certain operators in large N QCD. We derive a set of nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) for this model, and compute the scattering matrix of the various (in particular, magnon) excitations.
