Abstract: A new technique for constructing the relativistic wave equation for the two-body system composed of the spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles is proposed. The method is based on the extension of the SL(2,C) group to the Sp(4,C) one. The obtained equation includes the interaction potentials, having both the Lorentz-vector and Lorentz-tensor structure, exactly describes the relativistic kinematics and possesses the correct one-particle limits. The comparison with results of other approaches to this problem is discussed.
