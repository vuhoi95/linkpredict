Title: The one-loop renormalization of the gauge sector in the Î¸-expanded  noncommutative standard model
Authors: V. Radovanovic and M. Buric and J. Trampetic
Abstract: In this paper we construct a version of the standard model gauge sector on noncommutative space-time which is one-loop renormalizable to first order in the expansion in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$.
