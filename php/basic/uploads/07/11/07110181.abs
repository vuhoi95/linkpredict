Title: Einstein-Weyl from Kaluza-Klein
Authors: D. Grumiller and R. Jackiw
Abstract: We discuss the Kaluza-Klein reduction of spaces with (anti-)self-dual Weyl tensor and point out the emergence of the Einstein-Weyl equations for the reduction from four to three dimensions. As a byproduct we get a simple expression for the gravitational instanton density in terms of the Kaluza-Klein functions.
