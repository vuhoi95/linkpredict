Title: Neutrino spin rotation in dense matter and electromagnetic field
Authors: E. V. Arbuzova and A. E. Lobanov and E. M. Murchikova
Abstract: Exact solutions of the Dirac--Pauli equation for massive neutrino with anomalous magnetic moment interacting with dense matter and strong electromagnetic field are found. The complete system of neutrino wavefunctions, which show spin rotation properties are obtained and their possible applications are discussed.
