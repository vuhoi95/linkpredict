Title: Hypercharged Anomaly Mediation
Authors: Radovan Dermisek and Herman Verlinde and Lian-Tao Wang
Abstract: We show that, in string models with the MSSM residing on D-branes, the bino mass can be generated in a geometrically separated hidden sector. Hypercharge mediation thus naturally teams up with anomaly mediation. The mixed scenario predicts a distinctive yet viable superpartner spectrum, provided that the ratio \alpha between the bino and gravitino mass lies in the range 0.05 < |\alpha| < 0.25, and m_{3/2} > 35 TeV. We summarize some of the phenomenological features of this scenario.
