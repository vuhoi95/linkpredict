Title: Complete Six-Gluon Disk Amplitude in Superstring Theory
Authors: Stephan Stieberger and Tomasz R. Taylor
Abstract: We evaluate all next-to-maximal helicity violating (NMHV) six-gluon amplitudes in type I open superstring theory in four dimensions, at the disk level, to all orders in alpha'. Although the computation utilizes supersymmetric Ward identities, the result holds for all compactifications, even for those that break supersymmetry and is completely model-independent. Together with the maximally helicity violating (MHV) amplitudes presented in the previous work, our results provide the complete six-gluon disk amplitude.
