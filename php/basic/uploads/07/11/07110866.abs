Title: Gauge Thresholds and Kaehler Metrics for Rigid Intersecting D-brane  Models
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Maximilian Schmidt-Sommerfeld
Abstract: The gauge threshold corrections for globally consistent Z2 x Z2' orientifolds with rigid intersecting D6-branes are computed. The one-loop corrections to the holomorphic gauge kinetic function are extracted and the Kaehler metrics for the charged chiral multiplets are determined up to two constants.
