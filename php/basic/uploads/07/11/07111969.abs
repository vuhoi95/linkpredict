Title: Interacting Q-balls
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We study non-topological solitons, so called Q-balls, which carry a non-vanishing Noether charge and arise as lump solutions of self-interacting complex scalar field models. Explicit examples of new axially symmetric non-spinning Q-ball solutions that have not been studied so far are constructed numerically. These solutions can be interpreted as angular excitations of the fundamental $Q$-balls and are related to the spherical harmonics. Correspondingly, they have higher energy and their energy densities possess two local maxima on the positive z-axis. We also study two Q-balls interacting via a potential term in (3+1) dimensions and construct examples of stationary, solitonic-like objects in (3+1)-dimensional flat space-time that consist of two interacting global scalar fields. We concentrate on configurations composed of one spinning and one non-spinning Q-ball and study the parameter-dependence of the energy and charges of the configuration. In addition, we present numerical evidence that for fixed values of the coupling constants two different types of 2-Q-ball solutions exist: solutions with defined parity, but also solutions which are asymmetric with respect to reflexion through the x-y-plane.
