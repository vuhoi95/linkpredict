Title: Dissociation by acceleration
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: We show that mesons, described using rotating relativistic strings in a holographic setup, undergo dissociation when their acceleration 'a' exceeds a value which scales with the angular momentum 'J' as a_max ~ \sqrt{T_s/J}, where 'T_s' is the string tension.
