Title: Conformal blocks related to the R-R states in the \hat c =1 SCFT
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski and Paulina Suchanek
Abstract: We derive an explicit form of a family of four-point Neveu-Schwarz blocks with $\hat c =1,$ external weights $\Delta_i = 1/8$ and arbitrary intermediate weight. The derivation is based on a set of identities obeyed in the free superscalar theory by correlation functions of fields satisfying Ramond condition with respect to the bosonic (dimension 1) and the fermionic (dimension 1/2) currents.
