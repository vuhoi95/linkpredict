Title: Phase transition in the fine structure constant
Authors: L. Anchordoqui and V. Barger and H. Goldberg and D. Marfatia
Abstract: Within the context of mass-varying neutrinos, we construct a cosmological model that has a phase transition in the electromagnetic fine structure constant \alpha at a redshift of 0.5. The model accommodates hints of a time variable \alpha in quasar spectra and the nonobservance of such an effect at very low redshifts. It is consistent with limits from the recombination and primordial nucleosynthesis eras and is free of instabilities.
