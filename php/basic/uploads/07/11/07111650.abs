Title: On the possible induced charge on a graphitic nanocone at finite  temperature
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and N. D. Vlasii
Abstract: Electronic excitations in a graphitic monolayer (graphene) in the long-wavelength approximation are characterized by the linear dispersion law, representing a unique example of the really two-dimensional "ultrarelativistic" fermionic system which in the presence of topological defects possesses rather unusual properties. A disclination that rolls up a graphitic sheet into a nanocone is described by a pointlike pseudomagnetic vortex at the apex of the cone, and the flux of the vortex is related to the deficit angle of the conical surface. A general theory of planar relativistic fermionic systems in the singular vortex background is employed, and we derive the analytical expression for the charge which is induced at finite temperature on some graphitic nanocones.
