Title: Two-dimensional Gauge Theories and Quantum Integrable Systems
Authors: Anton A. Gerasimov and Samson L. Shatashvili
Abstract: In this paper the relation between 2d topological gauge theories and Bethe Ansatz equations is reviewed. In addition we present some new results and clarifications. We hope the relations discussed here are particular examples of more general relations between quantum topological fields theories in dimensions $d\leq 4$ and quantum integrable systems.
