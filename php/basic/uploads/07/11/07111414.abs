Abstract: We discuss the on-shell N=1 Supersymmetric coupling of brane chiral multiplets in the context of N=2, D=5 Supergravity compactified on $S_1/Z_2$ orbifolds. Assuming a constant superpotential on the hidden brane we study the transmission of the supersymmetry breaking to the visible brane. We find that to lowest order in the five dimensional Newton's constant $k_5^2$ and gravitino mass $m_{3/2}^2$ the spinor field of the radion multiplet is responsible of inducing positive one-loop squared masses $m_{\phi}^2 \sim {m_{3/2}^2} / (M_{Planck}^2 R^2)$ to the scalar fields which are localized on the visible brane with $R$ the length scale of the fifth dimension. Considering a cubic superpotential on the visible brane we also find that non-vanishing soft trilinear scalar couplings $A$ are induced given by $A=3m_{\phi}^2/m_{3/2}$.
