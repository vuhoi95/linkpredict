Title: Bubbling Calabi-Yau geometry from matrix models
Authors: Nick Halmagyi and Takuya Okuda
Abstract: We study bubbling geometry in topological string theory. Specifically, we analyse Chern-Simons theory on both the 3-sphere and lens spaces in the presence of a Wilson loop insertion of an arbitrary representation. For each of these three manifolds we formulate a multi-matrix model whose partition function is the vev of the Wilson loop and compute the spectral curve. This spectral curve is the reduction to two dimensions of the mirror to a Calabi-Yau threefold which is the gravitational dual of the Wilson loop insertion. For lens spaces the dual geometries are new. We comment on a similar matrix model which appears in the context of Wilson loops in AdS/CFT.
