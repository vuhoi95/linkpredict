Title: Mesons in Gauge/Gravity Duals - A Review
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Nick Evans and Ingo Kirsch and Ed Threlfall
Abstract: We review recent progress in studying mesons within gauge/gravity duality, in the context of adding flavour degrees of freedom to generalizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our main focus is on the `top-down approach' of considering models constructed within string theory. We explain the string-theoretical constructions in detail, aiming at non-specialists. These give rise to a new way of describing strongly coupled confining large N gauge gauge theories similar to large N QCD. In particular, we consider gravity dual descriptions of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and compare with lattice results. A further topic covered is the behaviour of flavour bound states in finite temperature field theories dual to a gravity background involving a black hole. We also describe the `bottom up' phenomenological approach to mesons within AdS/QCD. -- Some previously unpublished results are also included.
