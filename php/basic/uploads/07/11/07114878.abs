Title: New Supergravity Backgrounds Dual to N=1 SQCD-like Theories with  N_f=2N_c
Authors: Elena Caceres and Raphael Flauger and Matthias Ihl and Timm Wrase
Abstract: We present new supergravity backgrounds generated by N_c D5-branes, wrapping the S^2 of the resolved conifold, in the presence of N_f = 2 N_c smeared flavor D5-branes. The smearing allows us to take their backreaction on the geometry into account. We discuss the consistency, stability, and supersymmetry of these types of setups. We find near horizon geometries that we expect to be supergravity duals of SQCD-like theories with N_f= 2N_c. From these backgrounds we numerically extract rectangular Wilson loops and beta functions of the dual field theory for the regime where our approximations are valid.
