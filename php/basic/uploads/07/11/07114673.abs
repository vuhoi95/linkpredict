Abstract: The radiation from a charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a cylindrical hole in homogeneous dielectric medium is investigated. Prompted by availability of materials with large dielectric permittivity $\epsilon $ and small absorption, we discuss the features of this type of radiation for media with $\epsilon \gg 1$. It is shown that there are high peaks in the angular distribution of radiation intensity at well-defined harmonics. The conditions are specified for the cavity-to-helix radii ratio, $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$, under which the angle-integrated radiation intensity on some harmonics exceeds that in the empty space. Though the amplification of radiation intensity increases with increasing $\epsilon $, the corresponding "resonant" values of $\rho _{1}/\rho_{0}$ ratio are practically independent of the dielectric permittivity of surrounding medium. It is shown that an analogous amplification of radiation takes place essentially for the same values of $\rho_{1}/\rho_{0}$ also for the radiation in a cylindrical waveguide with conducting walls. An explanation of this phenomenon is given.
