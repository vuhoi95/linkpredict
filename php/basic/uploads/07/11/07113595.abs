Title: Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity with Boundary
Authors: Luzi Bergamin and Rene Meyer
Abstract: Using the recently found first order formulation of two-dimensional dilaton gravity with boundary, we perform a Hamiltonian analysis and subsequent path integral quantization. The importance of the boundary terms to obtain the correct quantum result are outlined and the quantum triviality of the theory is shown to hold with this modification as well. We compare with recent classical results and comment on further applications.
