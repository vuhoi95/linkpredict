Title: Slowly Rotating Charged Gauss-Bonnet Black holes in AdS Spaces
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Rong-Gen Cai
Abstract: Rotating charged Gauss-Bonnet black hole solutions in higher dimensional ($d >4$), asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime are obtained in the small angular momentum limit. The angular momentum, magnetic dipole moment, and the gyromagnetic ratio of the black holes are calculated and it turns out that the Gauss-Bonnet term does not affect to the gyromagnetic ratio.
