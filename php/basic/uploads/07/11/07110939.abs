Authors: M. Blasone and A. Capolupo and S. Capozziello and G. Vitiello
Abstract: We shortly summarize the quantum field theory formalism for the neutrino mixing and report on recent results showing that the vacuum condensate induced by neutrino mixing can be interpreted as a dark energy component of the Universe.
