Title: The Yang-Mills Vacuum in Coulomb Gauge in D=2+1 Dimensions
Authors: C. Feuchter and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: The variational approach to the Hamilton formulation of Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge developed by the present authors previously is applied to Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions and is confronted with the existing lattice data. We show that the resulting Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) yield consistent solutions in 2+1 dimensions only for infrared divergent ghost form factor and gluon energy. The obtained numerical solutions of the DSE reproduce the analytic infrared results and are in satisfactory agreement with the existing lattice date in the whole momentum range.
