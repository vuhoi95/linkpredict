Title: Sequestering CP Violation and GIM-Violation with Warped Extra Dimensions
Authors: Clifford Cheung and A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Lisa Randall
Abstract: We propose a model of spontaneous CP violation to address the strong CP problem in warped extra dimensions that relies on sequestering flavor and CP violation. We assume that brane-localized Higgs Yukawa interactions respect a U(3) flavor symmetry that is broken only by bulk fermion mass and Yukawa terms. All CP violation arises from the vev of a CP-odd scalar field localized in the bulk. To suppress radiative corrections to theta-bar, the doublet quarks in this model are localized on the IR brane. We calculate constraints from flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs), precision electroweak measurements, CKM unitarity, and the electric dipole moments in this model and predict theta-bar to be at least about 10^-12.
