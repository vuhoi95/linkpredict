Abstract: We present the near light cone Hamiltonian $H$ in lattice QCD depending on the parameter $\eta$, which gives the distance to the light cone. Since the vacuum has zero momentum we can derive an effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ from $H$ which is only quadratic in the momenta and therefore solvable by standard methods. An approximate ground state wave functional is determined variationally in the limit $\eta \to 0$.
