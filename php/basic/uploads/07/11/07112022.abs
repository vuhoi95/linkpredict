Title: On the Critical Exponents for the Î›-Transition in Liquid Helium
Authors: A. A. Pogorelov and I. M. Suslov
Abstract: The use of a new method for summing divergent series makes it possible to significantly increase the accuracy of determining the critical exponents from the field theoretical renormalization group. The exponent value \nu=0.6700\pm 0.0006 for the \lambda-transition in liquid helium is in good agreement with the experiment, but contradicts the last theoretical results based on using high-temperature series, the Monte Carlo method, and their synthesis.
