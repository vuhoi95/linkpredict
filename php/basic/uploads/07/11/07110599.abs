Title: Regularization of the Singular Inverse Square Potential in Quantum  Mechanics with a Minimal length
Authors: Djamil Bouaziz and Michel Bawin
Abstract: We study the problem of the attractive inverse square potential in quantum mechanics with a generalized uncertainty relation. Using the momentum representation, we show that this potential is regular in this framework. We solve analytically the s-wave bound states equation in terms of Heun's functions. We discuss in detail the bound states spectrum for a specific form of the generalized uncertainty relation. The minimal length may be interpreted as characterizing the dimension of the system.
