Title: Strings on conifolds from strong coupling dynamics: quantitative results
Authors: David E. Berenstein and Sean A. Hartnoll
Abstract: Three quantitative features of string theory on AdS_5 x X_5, for any (quasi)regular Sasaki-Einstein X_5, are recovered exactly from an expansion of field theory at strong coupling around configurations in the moduli space of vacua. These configurations can be thought of as a generalized matrix model of (local) commuting matrices. First, we reproduce the spectrum of scalar Kaluza-Klein modes on X_5. Secondly, we recover the precise spectrum of BMN string states, including a nontrivial dependence on the volume of X_5. Finally, we show how the radial direction in global AdS_5 emerges universally in these theories by exhibiting states dual to AdS giant gravitons.
