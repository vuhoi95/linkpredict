Title: Two elliptic height models with factorized domain wall partition  functions
Authors: O. Foda and M. Wheeler and M. Zuparic
Abstract: We obtain factorized domain wall partition functions in two elliptic height models: 1. A Felderhof-type model, which is new, and 2. A Perk-Schultz-type gl(1|1) model of Deguchi and Martin.
