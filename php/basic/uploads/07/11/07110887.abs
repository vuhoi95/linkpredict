Title: The absence of the 4$Ïˆ$ divergence in noncommutative chiral models
Authors: M. Buric and D. Latas and V. Radovanovic and J. Trampetic
Abstract: In this paper we show that in the noncommutative chiral gauge theories the 4-fermion vertices are finite. The $4\psi$-vertices appear in linear order in quantization of the $\theta$-expanded noncommutative gauge theories; in all previously considered models, based on Dirac fermions, the $4\psi$-vertices were divergent and nonrenormalizable.
