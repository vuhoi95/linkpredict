Authors: A. Oskin and S. Pakuliak and A. Silantyev
Abstract: We continue investigation of the universal weight function for the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$ started in arXiv:math/0610517 and arXiv:0711.2819. We obtain two recurrence relations for the universal weight function applying the method of projections developed in arXiv:math/0610398. On the level of the evaluation representation of $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$ we reproduce both recurrence relations for the off-shell Bethe vectors calculated in arXiv:math/0702277 using combinatorial methods.
