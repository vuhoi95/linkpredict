Title: Covariant particle statistics and intertwiners of the kappa-deformed  Poincare algebra
Authors: C. A. S. Young and R. Zegers
Abstract: To speak about identical particles - bosons or fermions - in quantum field theories with kappa-deformed Poincare symmetry, one must have a kappa-covariant notion of particle exchange. This means constructing intertwiners of the relevant representations of kappa-Poincare. We show, in the simple case of spinless particles, that intertwiners exist, and, supported by a perturbative calculation to third order in 1/kappa, make a conjecture about the existence and uniqueness of a certain preferred intertwiner defining particle exchange in kappa-deformed theories.
