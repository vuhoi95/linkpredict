Title: Is the Equivalence Principle violated by Generalized Uncertainty  Principles and Holography in a brane-world?
Authors: Fabio Scardigli and Roberto Casadio
Abstract: It has been recently debated whether a class of generalized uncertainty principles that include gravitational sources of error are compatible with the holographic principle in models with extra spatial dimensions. We had in fact shown elsewhere that the holographic scaling is lost when more than four space-time dimensions are present. However, we shall show here that the validity of the holographic counting can be maintained also in models with extra spatial dimensions, but at the intriguing price that the equivalence principle for a point-like source be violated and the inertial mass differ from the gravitational mass in a specific non-trivial way.
