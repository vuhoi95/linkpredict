Title: Sine-Gordon-like action for the Superstring in AdS(5) x S(5)
Authors: Andrei Mikhailov and Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We propose an action for a sine-Gordon-like theory, which reproduces the classical equations of motion of the Green-Schwarz-Metsaev-Tseytlin superstring on AdS(5) x S(5). The action is relativistically invariant. It is a mass-deformed gauged WZW model for SO(4,1) x SO(5) / SO(4) x SO(4) interacting with fermions.
