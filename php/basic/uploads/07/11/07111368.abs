Title: Bohr's complementarity relation and the violation of the CP symmetry in  high energy physics
Authors: Beatrix C. Hiesmayr and Marcus Huber
Abstract: We test Bohr's complementary relation, which captures the most counterintuitive difference of a classical and a quantum world, for single and bipartite neutral kaons. They present a system that is naturally interfering, oscillating and decaying. Moreover, kaons break the CP symmetry (C...charge conjugation, P...parity). In detail we discuss the effect of the CP violation on Bohr's relation, i.e. the effect on the "particle-like" information and the "wave-like" information. Further we show that the quantity that complements the single partite information for bipartite kaons is indeed concurrence, a measure of entanglement, strengthening our concept of entanglement. We find that the defined entanglement measure is independent of CP violation while it has been shown that nonlocality is sensitive to CP violation.
