Abstract: So far, the infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost propagator based on the Gribov-Zwanziger approach predicted a positivity violating gluon propagator vanishing at zero momentum, and an infrared enhanced ghost propagator. However, recent data based on huge lattices have revealed a positivity violating gluon propagator which turns out to attain a finite nonvanishing value very close to zero momentum. At the same time the ghost propagator does not seem to be infrared enhanced anymore. We point out that these new features can be accounted for by yet unexploited dynamical effects within the Gribov-Zwanziger approach, leading to an infrared behavior in qualitatively good agreement with the new data.
