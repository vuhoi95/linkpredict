Abstract: An S-brane solution with two non-composite electric branes and a set of l scalar fields is considered. The intersection rule for branes corresponds to the Lie algebra A_2. The solution contains five factor spaces with the fifth one interpreted as ``our'' 3-dimensional space. It is shown that there exists a time interval where accelerating expansion of ``our'' 3-dimensional space is compatible with small enough value of effective gravitational ``constant'' variation.
