Title: On scale symmetry breaking and confinement in D=3 models
Authors: Patricio Gaete and José A. Helaÿel-Neto
Abstract: Within the framework of the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables formalism, we study the connection between scale symmetry breaking and confinement in three-dimensional gluodynamics. We explicitly show that the static potential profile contains a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static charges. Also, we establish a new type of equivalence among different three-dimensional effective theories.
