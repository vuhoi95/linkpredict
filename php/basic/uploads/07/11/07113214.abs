Title: A Higher Form (of) Mediation
Authors: Herman Verlinde and Lian-Tao Wang and Martijn Wijnholt and Itay Yavin
Abstract: We exhibit a simple and robust mechanism for mediation of supersymmetry breaking between geometrically separated D-branes in type II string theory. The mediation proceeds via RR p-forms that couple via linear Chern-Simons terms to the abelian vector bosons on the branes. From a 4-d low energy perspective, the mechanism reduces to U(1) mediation.
