Title: Moduli Stabilisation versus Chirality for MSSM like Type IIB  Orientifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Sebastian Moster and Erik Plauschinn
Abstract: We investigate the general question of implementing a chiral MSSM like D-brane sector in Type IIB orientifold models with complete moduli stabilisation via F-terms induced by fluxes and space-time instantons, respectively gaugino condensates. The prototype examples are the KKLT and the so-called large volume compactifications. We show that the ansatz of first stabilising all moduli via F-terms and then introducing the Standard Model module is misleading, as a chiral sector notoriously influences the structure of non-perturbative effects and induces a D-term potential. Focusing for concreteness on the large volume scenario, we work out the geometry of the swiss-cheese type Calabi-Yau manifold P_[1,3,3,3,5][15]_(3,75) and analyse whether controllable and phenomenologically acceptable Kaehler moduli stabilisation can occur by the combination of F- and D-terms.
