Title: How to fix a broken symmetry: Quantum dynamics of symmetry restoration  in a ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Bogdan Damski and Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of a quantum phase transition in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate when it is driven from the magnetized broken-symmetry phase to the unmagnetized ``symmetric'' polar phase. We determine where the condensate goes out of equilibrium as it approaches the critical point, and compute the condensate magnetization at the critical point. This is done within a quantum Kibble-Zurek scheme traditionally employed in the context of symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions. Then we study the influence of the nonequilibrium dynamics near a critical point on the condensate magnetization. In particular, when the quench stops at the critical point, nonlinear oscillations of magnetization occur. They are characterized by a period and an amplitude that are inversely proportional. If we keep driving the condensate far away from the critical point through the unmagnetized ``symmetric'' polar phase, the amplitude of magnetization oscillations slowly decreases reaching a non-zero asymptotic value. That process is described by the equation that can be mapped onto the classical mechanical problem of a particle moving under the influence of harmonic and ``anti-friction'' forces whose interplay leads to surprisingly simple fixed-amplitude oscillations. We obtain several scaling results relating the condensate magnetization to the quench rate, and verify numerically all analytical predictions.
