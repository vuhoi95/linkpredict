Title: Non-linear integral equations in {\cal {N}}=4 SYM
Authors: Diego Bombardelli and Davide Fioravanti and Marco Rossi
Abstract: We survey and discuss the applications of the non-linear integral equation in the framework of the Bethe Ansatz type equations which are conjectured to give the eigenvalues of the dilatation operator in ${\cal {N}}=4$ SYM. Moreover, an original idea (different from that of \cite {FMQR}) to derive a non-linear integral equation is briefly depicted in Section 4.
