Title: Semiclassical Droplet States in Matrix Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Andrea Cappelli and Ivan D. Rodriguez
Abstract: We derive semiclassical ground state solutions that correspond to the quantum Hall states earlier found in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons matrix theory. They realize the Jain composite-fermion construction and their density is piecewise constant as that of phenomenological wave functions. These results support the matrix theory as a possible effective theory of the fractional Hall effect. A crucial role is played by the constraint limiting the degeneracy of matrix states: we find its explicit gauge invariant form and clarify its physical interpretation.
