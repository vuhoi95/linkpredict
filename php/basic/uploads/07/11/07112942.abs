Title: Boundary effects of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations on charged  particles
Authors: Tai-Hung Wu and Jen-Tsung Hsiang and Da-Shin Lee
Abstract: The effects of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations with the boundary on charged particles is investigated. They may be observed via an electron interference experiment near the conducting plate, where boundary effects of vacuum fluctuations are found significant on coherence reduction of the electrons. The dynamics of the charge under the influence of quantized electromagnetic fields with a conducting plate is also studied. The corresponding stochastic equation of motion is derived in the semiclassical approximation, and the behavior of the charge's velocity fluctuations is discussed.
