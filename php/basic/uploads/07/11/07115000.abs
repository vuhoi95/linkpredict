Abstract: We consider the Euclidean $D$-dimensional $-\lambda |\phi |^4+\eta |\phi |^6$ ($\lambda ,\eta >0 $) model with $d$ ($d\leq D$) compactified dimensions. Introducing temperature by means of the Ginzburg--Landau prescription in the mass term of the Hamiltonian, this model can be interpreted as describing a first-order phase transition for a system in a region of the $D$-dimensional space, limited by $d$ pairs of parallel planes, orthogonal to the coordinates axis $x_1, x_2, ..., x_d$. The planes in each pair are separated by distances $L_1, L_2, ..., L_d$. We obtain an expression for the transition temperature as a function of the size of the system, $% T_c(\{L_i\})$, $i=1, 2, ..., d$. For D=3 we particularize this formula, taking $L_1=L_2=... =L_d=L$ for the physically interesting cases $d=1$ (a film), $d=2$ (an infinitely long wire having a square cross-section), and for $d=3$ (a cube). For completeness, the corresponding formulas for second-order transitions are also presented. Comparison with experimental data for superconducting films and wires shows qualitative agreement with our theoretical expressions
