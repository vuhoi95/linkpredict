Title: Boundary state of superstring in open string channel
Authors: Yosuke Imamura and Hiroshi Isono and Yutaka Matsuo
Abstract: We derive boundary state of superstring in the open string channel. It describes the superconformal field theory of open string emission and absorption by D-brane. We define the boundary state by conformal mappings from upper half plane with operators inserted at two points corresponding to the corners of semi-infinite strip. We obtain explicit oscillator forms analytically for the fermion and superconformal ghost sectors. For the fermion sector we compare this with numerical result obtained by using naive boundary condition.
