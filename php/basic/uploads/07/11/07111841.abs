Title: Lightlike Braneworlds
Authors: Eduardo Guendelman and Alexander Kaganovich and Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: We propose a new class of p-brane models describing intrinsically lightlike branes in any world-volume dimensions. Properties of the dynamics of these lightlike p-branes in various gravitational backgrounds of interest in the context of braneworlds are briefly described. Codimenion two (and more) lightlike braneworlds perform in their ground states non-trivial motions in the extra dimensions in sharp contrast to standard (Nambu-Goto) braneworlds.
