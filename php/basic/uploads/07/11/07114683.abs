Title: Functional integral with $φ^4$ term in the action beyond standard  perturbative methods II
Authors: Juraj Boháčik and Peter Prešnajder
Abstract: To avoid problems with infinite measure, the functional integral for harmonic oscillator can be calculated by time - slicing method with continuum limit procedure proposed Gelfand and Yaglom. In previous article we proved by nonperturbative calculation the generalized Gelfand-Yaglom equation for anharmonic oscillator with positive or negative mass term. In this article we prove by step-by-step the calculation of the correction function to the Gelfand-Yaglom equation for an-harmonic oscillator.
