Title: From Dirac spinor fields to ELKO
Authors: Roldao da Rocha and Julio M. Hoff da Silva
Abstract: Dual-helicity eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator (ELKO spinor fields) belong, together with Majorana spinor fields, to a wider class of spinor fields, the so-called flagpole spinor fields, corresponding to the class (5), according to Lounesto spinor field classification based on the relations and values taken by their associated bilinear covariants. There exists only six such disjoint classes: the first three corresponding to Dirac spinor fields, and the other three respectively corresponding to flagpole, flag-dipole and Weyl spinor fields. This paper is devoted to investigate and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions to map Dirac spinor fields to ELKO, in order to naturally extend the Standard Model to spinor fields possessing mass dimension one. As ELKO is a prime candidate to describe dark matter, an adequate and necessary formalism is introduced and developed here, to better understand the algebraic, geometric and physical properties of ELKO spinor fields, and their underlying relationship to Dirac spinor fields.
