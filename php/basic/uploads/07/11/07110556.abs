Title: Observer dependent D-brane for strings propagating in pp-wave time  dependent background
Authors: Dafni Z. Marchioro and Daniel L. Nedel
Abstract: We study type IIB superstring in the pp-wave time-dependent background, which has a singularity at $t=0$. We show that this background can provide a toy model to study some ideas related to the stretched horizon paradigm and the complementary principle of black holes. To this end, we construct a unitary Bogoliubov generator which relates the asymptotically flat string Hilbert space, defined at $t =\pm \infty$, to the finite time Hilbert space. For asymptotically flat observers, the closed string vacuum close to the singularity appears as a boundary state which is in fact a D-brane described in the closed string channel. However, observers who go with the string towards to the singularity see the original vacuum.
