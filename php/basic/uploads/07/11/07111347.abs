Title: A universal Dirac operator and noncommutative spin bundles over fuzzy  complex projective spaces
Authors: Brian P. Dolan and Idrish Huet and Sean Murray and Denjoe O'Connor
Abstract: We present a universal Dirac operator for noncommutative spin and spin^c bundles over fuzzy complex projective spaces. We give an explicit construction of these bundles, which are described in terms of finite dimensional matrices, calculate the spectrum and explicitly exhibit the Dirac eigenspinors. To our knowledge the spin^c spectrum for CP^n with n>=3 is new.
