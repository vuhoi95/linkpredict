Abstract: Within the context of the twisted Poincar\'e algebra, there exists no noncommutative analogue of the Minkowski space interpreted as the homogeneous space of the Poincar\'e group quotiented by the Lorentz group. The usual definition of commutative classical fields as sections of associated vector bundles on the homogeneous space does not generalise to the noncommutative setting, and the twisted Poincar\'e algebra does not act on noncommutative fields in a canonical way. We make a tentative proposal for the definition of noncommutative classical fields of any spin over the Moyal space, which has the desired representation theoretical properties. We also suggest a way to search for noncommutative Minkowski spaces suitable for studying noncommutative field theory with deformed Poincar\'e symmetries.
