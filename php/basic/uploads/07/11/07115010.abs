Title: Massless Sine-Gordon and Massive Thirring Models: proof of the Coleman's  equivalence
Authors: G. Benfatto and P. Falco and V. Mastropietro
Abstract: We prove the Coleman's conjecture on the equivalence between the massless Sine-Gordon model with finite volume interaction and the Thirring model with a finite volume mass term.
