Title: On the recent paper on quark confinement by Tomboulis
Authors: K. R. Ito and E. Seiler
Abstract: We point out missing links in the recent paper by Tomboulis in which he claims a rigorous proof of quark confinement in 4D lattice gauge theory. We also discuss if it is possible to correct his proof.
