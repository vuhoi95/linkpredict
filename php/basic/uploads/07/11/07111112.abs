Title: Superconducting and Spinning Non-Abelian Flux Tubes
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Y. Verbin
Abstract: We find new non-Abelian flux tube solutions in a model of $N_f$ scalar fields in the fundamental representation of SU(N)xU(1) with $N \leq N_f$ (the ``extended non-Abelian Higgs model''), and study their main properties. Among the solutions there are spinning strings as well as superconducting ones. The solutions exist only in a non trivial domain of the parameter space defined by the ratio between the SU(N) and U(1) coupling constants, the scalar self-interaction coupling constants, the magnetic fluxes (Abelian as well as non-Abelian) and the ``twist parameter'' which is a non-trivial relative phase of the Higgs fields.
