Title: Trace Formulae of Characteristic Polynomial and Cayley-Hamilton's  Theorem, and Applications to Chiral Perturbation Theory and General  Relativity
Authors: Hong-Hao Zhang and Wen-Bin Yan and Xue-Song Li
Abstract: By using combinatorics, we give a new proof for the recurrence relations of the characteristic polynomial coefficients, and then we obtain an explicit expression for the generic term of the coefficient sequence, which yields the trace formulae of the Cayley-Hamilton's theorem with all coefficients explicitly given, and which implies a byproduct, a complete expression for the determinant of any finite-dimensional matrix in terms of the traces of its successive powers. And we discuss some of their applications to chiral perturbation theory and general relativity.
