Abstract: The theory of exact and of approximate solutions for non-autonomous linear differential equations forms a wide field with strong ties to physics and applied problems. This paper is meant as a stepping stone for an exploration of this long-established theme, through the tinted glasses of a (Hopf and Rota-Baxter) algebraic point of view. By reviewing, reformulating and strengthening known results, we give evidence for the claim that the use of Hopf algebra allows for a refined analysis of differential equations. We revisit the renowned Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff-Dynkin formula by the modern approach involving Lie idempotents. Approximate solutions to differential equations involve, on the one hand, series of iterated integrals solving the corresponding integral equations; on the other hand, exponential solutions. Equating those solutions yields identities among products of iterated Riemann integrals. Now, the Riemann integral satisfies the integration-by-parts rule with the Leibniz rule for derivations as its partner; and skewderivations generalize derivations. Thus we seek an algebraic theory of integration, with the Rota-Baxter relation replacing the classical rule. The methods to deal with noncommutativity are especially highlighted. We find new identities, allowing for an extensive embedding of Dyson-Chen series of time- or path-ordered products (of generalized integration operators); of the corresponding Magnus expansion; and of their relations, into the unified algebraic setting of Rota-Baxter maps and their inverse skewderivations. This picture clarifies the approximate solutions to generalized integral equations corresponding to non-autonomous linear (skew)differential equations.
