Title: Excitons in QED3 and spin response in a phase-fluctuating d-wave  superconductor
Authors: Babak H. Seradjeh and Igor F. Herbut
Abstract: We study the particle-hole exciton mode in the QED3 theory of a phase-fluctuating d-wave superconductor in ladder approximation. We derive a Schroedinger-like equation for the exciton bound state and determine the conditions for its existence. We find the dispersion of this mode below the particle-hole continuum and compare our results with the resonance observed in neutron scattering measurements in cuprates.
