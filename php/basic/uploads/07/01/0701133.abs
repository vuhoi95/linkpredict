Title: Pp-wave Matrix Models from Point-like Gravitons
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: The BFSS Matrix model can be regarded as a theory of coincident M-theory gravitons. In this spirit, we summarize how using the action for coincident gravitons proposed in hep-th/0207199 it is possible to go beyond the linear order approximation of Kabat and Taylor, and to provide a satisfactory microscopical description of giant gravitons in $AdS_m\times S^n$ backgrounds. We then show that in the M-theory maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background, the action for coincident gravitons, besides reproducing the BMN Matrix model, predicts a new quadrupolar coupling to the M-theory 6-form potential, which supports the so far elusive fuzzy 5-sphere giant graviton solution. Finally, we discuss similar Matrix models that can be derived in Type II string theories using dualities.
