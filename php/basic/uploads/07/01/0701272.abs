Title: Higher-spin Currents and Thermal Flux from Hawking Radiation
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Takeshi Morita and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: Quantum fields near black hole horizons can be described in terms of an infinite set of d=2 conformal fields. In this paper, by investigating transformation properties of general higher-spin currents under a conformal transformation, we reproduce the thermal distribution of Hawking radiation in both cases of bosons and fermions. As a byproduct, we obtain a generalization of the Schwarzian derivative for higher-spin currents.
