Title: Chiral Gauge Theory for Graphene
Authors: R. Jackiw and S. -Y. Pi
Abstract: We construct a chiral gauge theory to describe fractionalization of fermions in graphene. Thereby we extend a recently proposed model, which relies on vortex formation. Our chiral gauge fields provide dynamics for the vortices and also couple to the fermions.
