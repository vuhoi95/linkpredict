Title: Black holes as boundaries in 2D dilaton supergravity
Authors: L. Bergamin and D. Grumiller
Abstract: We discuss 2D dilaton supergravity in the presence of boundaries. Generic ones lead to results different from black hole horizon boundaries. In particular, the respective numbers of physical degrees of freedom differ, thus generalizing the bosonic results of hep-th/0512230.
