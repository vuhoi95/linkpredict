Title: Black Holes, Black Rings and their Microstates
Authors: Iosif Bena and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: In this review article we describe some of the recent progress towards the construction and analysis of three-charge configurations in string theory and supergravity. We begin by describing the Born-Infeld construction of three-charge supertubes with two dipole charges, and then discuss the general method of constructing three-charge solutions in five dimensions. We explain in detail the use of these methods to construct black rings, black holes, as well as smooth microstate geometries with black hole and black ring charges, but with no horizon. We present arguments that many of these microstate geometries are dual to boundary states that belong to the same sector of the D1-D5-P CFT as the typical states. We end with an extended discussion of the implications of this work for the physics of black holes in string theory.
