Title: Bosonisation and Parastatistics: An Example and an Alternative Approach
Authors: K. Kanakoglou and C. Daskaloyannis
Abstract: Definitions of the parastatistics algebras and known results on their Lie (super)algebraic structure are reviewed. The notion of super-Hopf algebra is discussed. The bosonisation technique for switching a Hopf algebra in a braided category ${}_{H}\mathcal{M}$ ($H$: a quasitriangular Hopf algebra) into an ordinary Hopf algebra is presented and it is applied in the case of the parabosonic algebra. A bosonisation-like construction is also introduced for the same algebra and the differences are discussed.
