Title: Symplectic geometry and Noether charges for Hopf algebra space-time  symmetries
Authors: Michele Arzano and Antonino Marciano
Abstract: There has been a certain interest in some recent works in the derivation of Noether charges for Hopf-algebra space-time symmetries. Such analyses relied rather heavily on delicate manipulations of the fields of non-commuting coordinates whose charges were under study. Here we derive the same charges in a "coordinate-independent" symplectic-geometry type of approach and find results that are consistent with the ones of hep-th/0607221.
