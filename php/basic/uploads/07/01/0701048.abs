Title: Hawking radiation from (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black holes
Authors: Qing-Quan Jiang and Shuang-Qing Wu and Xu Cai
Abstract: Motivated by the Robinson-Wilczek's recent viewpoint that Hawking radiation can be treated as a compensating energy momentum tensor flux required to cancel gravitational anomaly at the horizon of a Schwarzschild-type black hole, we investigate Hawking radiation from the rotating $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ black hole and the charged $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ black hole, via cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies at the horizon. To restore gauge invariance and general coordinate covariance at the quantum level, one must introduce the corresponding gauge current and energy momentum tensor fluxes to cancel gauge and gravitational anomalies at the horizon. The results show that the values of these compensating fluxes are exactly equal to those of $(1+1)$-dimensional blackbody radiation at the Hawking temperature.
