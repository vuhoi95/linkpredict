Title: Giant Gravitons - with Strings Attached (I)
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Jelena Smolic and Milena Smolic
Abstract: In this article, the free field theory limit of operators dual to giant gravitons with open strings attached are studied. We introduce a graphical notation, which employs Young diagrams, for these operators. The computation of two point correlation functions is reduced to the application of three simple rules, written as graphical operations performed on the Young diagram labels of the operators. Using this technology, we have studied gravitational radiation by giant gravitons and bound states of giant gravitons, transitions between excited giant graviton states and joining of open strings attached to the giant.
