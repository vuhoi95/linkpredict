Title: An Exact Cosmological Solution of the Coupled Einstein-Majorana  Fermion-Scalar Field Equations
Authors: A. B. Balantekin and T. Dereli
Abstract: We couple a neutral scalar field and a Majorana fermion field to Einstein gravity represented by the Robertson-Walker metric and find a class of exact cosmological solutions.
