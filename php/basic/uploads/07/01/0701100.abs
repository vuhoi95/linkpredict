Title: Exact discretness and mass gap of N=1 symplectic Yang-Mills from  M-theory
Authors: L. Boulton and M. P. Garcia del Moral and A. Restuccia
Abstract: In this note we summarize some of the results found recently in hep-th/0609054. We show the pure discretness of the non-perturbative quantum spectrum of a symplectic Yang-Mills theory defined on a Riemann surface of positive genus, living in a target space that, in particular, can be 4D. This theory corresponds to the membrane with central charges. The presence of the central charge induces a confinement in the phase at zero temperature. When the energy rises, the center of the group breaks and the theory enters in a quark-plasma phase after a topological transition, corresponding to the N=4 wrapped supermembrane.
