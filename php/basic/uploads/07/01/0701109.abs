Title: Calibrations on spaces with GxG-structure
Authors: Florian Gmeiner and Frederik Witt
Abstract: In these notes we give an introduction to the concept of spaces with GxG-structure and their structured submanifolds. These objects generalise the classical notion of a calibrated submanifold. Therefore, they are interesting from a string theory viewpoint as they are relevant to describe D-branes in string compactifications on backgrounds with fluxes.
