Title: XXX Spin Chain: from Bethe Solution to Open Problems
Authors: Vladimir E. Korepin and Ovidiu I. Patu
Abstract: We present some open problems in the field of exactly solvable models. Two of the problems are related to the correlation functions of the XXX spin chain and the XXZ spin chain, one to the entropy of subsystems and one to the six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions.
