Title: Space-time noncommutativity with a bifermionic parameter
Authors: D. M. Gitman and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We consider a Moyal plane and propose to make the noncommutativity parameter \Theta^{\mu\nu} bifermionic, i.e., composed of two fermionic (Grassmann odd) parameters. The Moyal product then contains a finite number of derivatives, which allows to avoid difficulties of the standard approach. As an example, we construct a two-dimensional noncommutative field theory model based on the Moyal product with a bifermionic parameter and show that it has a locally conserved energy-momentum tensor. The model has no problems with the canonical quantization and appears to be renormalizable.
