Title: Parametric representation of "critical" noncommutative QFT models
Authors: Vincent Rivasseau and Adrian Tanasa
Abstract: We extend the parametric representation of renormalizable non commutative quantum field theories to a class of theories which we call "critical", because their power counting is definitely more difficult to obtain. This class of theories is important since it includes gauge theories, which should be relevant for the quantum Hall effect.
