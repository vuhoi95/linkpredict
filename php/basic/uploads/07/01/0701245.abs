Title: High-$T_c$ superconductivity by phase cloning
Authors: Nevena Ilieva and Walter Thirring
Abstract: We consider a BCS-type model in the spin formalism and argue that the structure of the interaction provides a mechanism for control over directions of the spin $\vect S$ other than $S_z$, which is being controlled via the conventional chemical potential. We also find the conditions for the appearance of a high-$T_c$ superconducting phase.
