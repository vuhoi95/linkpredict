Title: Quasi-hermitian Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space
Authors: Thomas Curtright and Andrzej Veitia
Abstract: We investigate quasi-hermitian quantum mechanics in phase space using standard deformation quantization methods: Groenewold star products and Wigner transforms. We focus on imaginary Liouville theory as a representative example where exact results are easily obtained. We emphasize spatially periodic solutions, compute various distribution functions and phase-space metrics, and explore the relationships between them.
