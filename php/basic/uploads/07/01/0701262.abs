Title: Hamilton-Jacobi Approach for First Order Actions and Theories with  Higher Derivatives
Authors: M. C. Bertin and B. M. Pimentel and P. J. Pompeia
Abstract: In this work we analyze systems described by Lagrangians with higher order derivatives in the context of the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism for first order actions. Two different approaches are studied here: the first one is analogous to the description of theories with higher derivatives in the hamiltonian formalism according to [Sov. Phys. Journ. 26 (1983) 730; the second treats the case where degenerate coordinate are present, in an analogy to reference [Nucl. Phys. B 630 (2002) 509]. Several examples are analyzed where a comparison between both approaches is made.
