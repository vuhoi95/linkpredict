Title: Brane-induced Skyrmions: Baryons in Holographic QCD
Authors: Kanabu Nawa and Hideo Suganuma and Toru Kojo
Abstract: We study baryons in holographic QCD with $D4/D8/\bar{D8}$ multi $D$ brane system. In holographic QCD, the baryon appears as a topologically non-trivial chiral soliton in a four-dimensional effective theory of mesons, which is called `Brane-induced Skyrmion'. We derive and calculate the Euler-Lagrange equation for the hedgehog configuration with chiral profile $F(r)$ and $\rho$-meson profile $\tilde G(r)$, and obtain the soliton solution of the holographic QCD.
