Title: Colour, copies and confinement
Authors: Anton Ilderton and Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: In this paper we construct a wide class of Gribov copies in Coulomb gauge SU(2) gauge theory. Infinitesimal copies are studied in some detail and their non-perturbative nature is made manifest. As an application it is shown that the copies prevent a non-perturbative definition of colour charge.
