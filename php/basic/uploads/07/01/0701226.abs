Title: Boundary Conditions in Stepwise Sine-Gordon Equation and Multi-Soliton  Solutions
Authors: N. Riazi and A. Sheykhi
Abstract: We study the stepwise sine-Gordon equation, in which the system parameter is different for positive and negative values of the scalar field. By applying appropriate boundary conditions, we derive relations between the soliton velocities before and after collisions. We investigate the possibility of formation of heavy soliton pairs from light ones and vise versa. The concept of soliton gun is introduced for the first time; a light pair is produced moving with high velocity, after the annihilation of a bound, heavy pair. We also apply boundary conditions to static, periodic and quasi-periodic solutions.
