Title: Dimensional Reduction, Seiberg--Witten Map and Supersymmetry
Authors: E. Ulas Saka and Kayhan Ulker
Abstract: It is argued that dimensional reduction of Seiberg-Witten map for a gauge field induces Seiberg-Witten maps for the other noncommutative fields of a gauge invariant theory. We demonstrate this observation by dimensionally reducing the noncommutative N=1 SYM theory in 6 dimensions to obtain noncommutative N=2 SYM in 4 dimensions. We explicitly derive Seiberg-Witten maps of the component fields in 6 and 4 dimensions. Moreover, we give a general method to define the deformed supersymmetry transformations that leaves the actions invariant after performing the Seiberg-Witten maps.
