Abstract: The decomposition of $Spin^{c}(4)$ gauge potential in terms of the Dirac 4% -spinor is investigated, where an important characterizing equation $\Delta A_{\mu}=-\lambda A_{\mu}$ has been discovered. Here $\lambda $ is the vacuum expectation value of the spinor field, $\lambda =\Vert \Phi \Vert ^{2}$, and $A_{\mu}$ the twisting U(1) potential. It is found that when $\lambda $ takes constant values, the characterizing equation becomes an eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian operator. It provides a revenue to determine the modulus of the spinor field by using the Laplacian spectral theory. The above study could be useful in determining the spinor field and twisting potential in the Seiberg-Witten equations. Moreover, topological characteristic numbers of instantons in the self-dual sub-space are also discussed.
