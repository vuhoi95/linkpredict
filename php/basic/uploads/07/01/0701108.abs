Title: Three dimensional Janus and time-dependent black holes
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Michael Gutperle and Shinji Hirano
Abstract: We show that the three dimensional Janus geometry can be embedded into the type IIB supergravity and discuss its dual CFT description. We also find exact solutions of time dependent black holes with a nontrivial dilaton field in three and higher dimensions as an application of the Janus construction.
