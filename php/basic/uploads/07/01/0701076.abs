Title: Fock space methods and large N
Authors: M. Bonini and G. M. Cicuta and E. Onofri
Abstract: Ideas and techniques (asymptotic decoupling of single-trace subspace, asymptotic operator algebras, duality and role of supersymmetry) relevant in current Fock space investigations of quantum field theories have very simple roles in a class of toy models.
