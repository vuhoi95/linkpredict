Title: The geometrical form for the string space-time action
Authors: D. S. Popović and B. Sazdović
Abstract: In the present article, we derive the space-time action of the bosonic string in terms of geometrical quantities. First, we study the space-time geometry felt by probe bosonic string moving in antisymmetric and dilaton background fields. We show that the presence of the antisymmetric field leads to the space-time torsion, and the presence of the dilaton field leads to the space-time nonmetricity. Using these results we obtain the integration measure for space-time with stringy nonmetricity, requiring its preservation under parallel transport. We derive the Lagrangian depending on stringy curvature, torsion and nonmetricity.
