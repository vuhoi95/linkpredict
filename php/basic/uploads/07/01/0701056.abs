Title: Big-Rip, Sudden Future, and other exotic singularities in the universe
Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Adam Balcerzak
Abstract: We discuss exotic singularities in the evolution of the universe motivated by the progress of observations in cosmology. Among them there are: Big-Rip (BR), Sudden Future Singularities (SFS), Generalized Sudden Future Singularities (GSFS), Finite Density Singularities (FD), type III, and type IV singularities. We relate some of these singularities with higher-order characteristics of expansion such as jerk and snap. We also discuss the behaviour of pointlike objects and classical strings on the approach to these singularities.
