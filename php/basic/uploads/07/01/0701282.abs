Title: Orientifolding in N=2 Superspace
Authors: Daniel Robles-Llana and Martin Rocek and Frank Saueressig and Ulrich Theis and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We discuss orientifold projections on superspace effective actions for hypermultiplets. We present a simple and new mechanism that allows one to find the Kahler potential and complex structure for the N=1 theory directly in terms of the parent N=2 theory. As an application, we demonstrate our method for Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications of type IIB superstrings.
