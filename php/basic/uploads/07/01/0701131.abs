Title: Quaternion Dirac Equation and Supersymmetry
Authors: Seema Rawat and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Quaternion Dirac equation has been analyzed and its supersymetrization has been discussed consistently. It has been shown that the quaternion Dirac equation automatically describes the spin structure with its spin up and spin down components of two component quaternion Dirac spinors associated with positive and negative energies. It has also been shown that the supersymmetrization of quaternion Dirac equation works well for different cases associated with zero mass, non zero mass, scalar potential and generalized electromagnetic potentials. Accordingly we have discussed the splitting of supersymmetrized Dirac equation in terms of electric and magnetic fields.
