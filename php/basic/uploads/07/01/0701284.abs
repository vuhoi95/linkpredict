Title: Quantization of the Riemann Zeta-Function and Cosmology
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: Quantization of the Riemann zeta-function is proposed. We treat the Riemann zeta-function as a symbol of a pseudodifferential operator and study the corresponding classical and quantum field theories. This approach is motivated by the theory of p-adic strings and by recent works on stringy cosmological models. We show that the Lagrangian for the zeta-function field is equivalent to the sum of the Klein-Gordon Lagrangians with masses defined by the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. Quantization of the mathematics of Fermat-Wiles and the Langlands program is indicated. The Beilinson conjectures on the values of L-functions of motives are interpreted as dealing with the cosmological constant problem. Possible cosmological applications of the zeta-function field theory are discussed.
