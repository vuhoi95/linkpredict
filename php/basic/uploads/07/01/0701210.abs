Title: Domain wall cosmology and multiple accelerations
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Wonwoo Lee and Siyoung Nam and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We classify the cosmological behaviors of the domain wall under junctions between two spacetimes in terms of various parameters: cosmological constants of bulk spacetime, a tension of a domain wall, and mass parameters of the black hole-type metric. Especially, we consider the false-true vacuum type junctions and the domain wall connecting between an inner AdS space and an outer AdS Reissner-Nordstr${\rm \ddot{o}}$m black hole. We find that there exist a solution to the junction equations with an inflation at earlier times and an accelerating expansion at later times.
