Title: GHZ States, Almost-Complex Structure and Yang--Baxter Equation (I)
Authors: Yong Zhang and Mo-Lin Ge
Abstract: Recent study suggests that there are natural connections between quantum information theory and the Yang--Baxter equation. In this paper, in terms of the generalized almost-complex structure and with the help of its algebra, we define the generalized Bell matrix to yield all the GHZ states from the product base, prove it to form a unitary braid representation and present a new type of solution of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation. We also study Yang-Baxterization, Hamiltonian, projectors, diagonalization, noncommutative geometry, quantum algebra and FRT dual algebra associated with this generalized Bell matrix.
