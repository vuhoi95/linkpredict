Title: Rota-Baxter algebras and new combinatorial identities
Authors: Kurusch Ebrahimi-Fard and Jose M. Gracia-Bondia and Frederic Patras
Abstract: The word problem for an arbitrary associative Rota-Baxter algebra is solved. This leads to a noncommutative generalization of the classical Spitzer identities. Links to other combinatorial aspects, particularly of interest in physics, are indicated.
