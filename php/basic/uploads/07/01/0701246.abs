Title: Adding D7-branes to the Polchinski-Strassler gravity background
Authors: Riccardo Apreda and Johanna Erdmenger and Dieter Lust and Christoph Sieg
Abstract: We motivate and summarize our analysis of hep-th/0610276 in which we consider D7-brane probe embeddings in the Polchinski-Strassler background with N=2 supersymmetry. The corresponding dual gauge theory is given by the N=2* theory with fundamental matter.
