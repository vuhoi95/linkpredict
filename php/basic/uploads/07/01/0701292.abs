Title: The twisted open string partition function and Yukawa couplings
Authors: Rodolfo Russo and Stefano Sciuto
Abstract: We use the operator formalism to derive the bosonic contribution to the twisted open string partition function in toroidal compactifications. This amplitude describes, for instance, the planar interaction between g+1 magnetized or intersecting D-branes. We write the result both in the closed and in the open string channel in terms of Prym differentials on the appropriate Riemann surface. Then we focus on the g=2 case for a 2-torus. By factorizing the twisted partition function in the open string channel we obtain an explicit expression for the 3-twist field correlator, which is the main ingredient in the computation of Yukawa couplings in D-brane phenomenological models. This provides an alternative method for computing these couplings that does not rely on the stress-energy tensor technique.
