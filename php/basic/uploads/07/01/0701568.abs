Title: Introduction to the Gopakumar-Vafa Large N Duality
Authors: Dave Auckly and Sergiy Koshkin
Abstract: Gopakumar-Vafa large N duality is a correspondence between Chern-Simons invariants of a link in a 3-manifold and relative Gromov-Witten invariants of a 6-dimensional symplectic manifold relative to a Lagrangian submanifold. We address the correspondence between the Chern-Simons free energy of S^3 with no link and the Gromov-Witten invariant of the resolved conifold in great detail. This case avoids mathematical difficulties in formulating a definition of relative Gromov-Witten invariants, but includes all of the important ideas. There is a vast amount of background material related to this duality. We make a point of collecting all of the background material required to check this duality in the case of the 3-sphere, and we have tried to present the material in a way complementary to the existing literature. This paper contains a large section on Gromov-Witten theory and a large section on quantum invariants of 3-manifolds. It also includes some physical motivation, but for the most part it avoids physical terminology.
