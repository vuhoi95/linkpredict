Title: One-loop Beta Functions for the Orientable Non-commutative Gross-Neveu  Model
Authors: Ahmed Lakhoua and Fabien Vignes-Tourneret and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: We compute at the one-loop order the beta-functions for a renormalisable non-commutative analog of the Gross Neveu model defined on the Moyal plane. The calculation is performed within the so called x-space formalism. We find that this non-commutative field theory exhibits asymptotic freedom for any number of colors. The beta-function for the non-commutative counterpart of the Thirring model is found to be non vanishing.
