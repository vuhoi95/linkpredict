Title: Degenerate vacua from unification of second law of thermodynamics with  other laws
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: Using our recent attempt to formulate second law of thermodynamics in a general way into a language with a probability density function, we derive degenerate vacua. Under the assumption that many coupling constants are effectively ``dynamical'' in the sense that they are or can be counted as initial state conditions, we argue in our model behind the second law that these coupling constants will adjust to make several vacua all having their separate effective cosmological constants or, what is the same, energy densities, being almost the \underline{same} value, essentially zero. Such degeneracy of vacuum energy densities is what one of us works on a lot under the name "The multiple point principle" (MPP).
