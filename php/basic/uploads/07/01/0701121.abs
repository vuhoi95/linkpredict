Title: On meta-stable SQCD with adjoint matter and gauge mediation
Authors: A. Amariti and L. Girardello and A. Mariotti
Abstract: We briefly review our analysis of a model with non supersymmetric vacua in N=1 gauge theories with adjoint matter and no R-symmetry. We show here that this model without any modification fits into a direct gauge mediation scenario and leads to massive gauginos.
