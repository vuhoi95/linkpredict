Title: Transverse Invariant Higher Spin Fields
Authors: E. D. Skvortsov and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: It is shown that a symmetric massless bosonic higher-spin field can be described by a traceless tensor field with reduced (transverse) gauge invariance. The Hamiltonian analysis of the transverse gauge invariant higher-spin models is used to control a number of degrees of freedom.
