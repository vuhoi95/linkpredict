Title: Generating mass and topological terms to the antisymmetric tensor matter  field by Higgs mechanism
Authors: L. Gonzaga Filho and M. S. Cunha and C. A. S. Almeida and R. R. Landim
Abstract: The interaction between the complex antisymmetric tensor matter field and a scalar field is constructed. We analyze the Higgs mechanism and show the generation of mass and topological terms by spontaneous symmetry breaking.
