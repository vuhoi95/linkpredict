Title: Metastable SUSY breaking within the Standard Model
Authors: Steven A. Abel and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric version of the Standard Model which contains a long-lived metastable vacuum. In this vacuum supersymmetry is broken and the electroweak symmetry is Higgsed, and we identify it with the physical ground state of the Standard Model. In our approach the metastable supersymmetry breaking (MSB) occurs directly in the SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y sector of the Standard Model; it does not require a separate MSB sector and in this way it departs from the usual lore. There is a direct link between the electroweak symmetry breaking and the supersymmetry breaking in our model, both effects are induced by the same Higgs fields. In order to generate sufficiently large gluino masses we have to have strong coupling in the Higgs sector, h >> 1. Our model results in an extremely compact low-energy effective theory at the electroweak scale with Higgs fields being very heavy, M_{Higgs} >> M_W and frozen at their vacuum expectation values.
