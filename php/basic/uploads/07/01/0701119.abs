Title: BPS Solutions in AdS/CFT
Authors: E. Gava and G. Milanesi and K. S. Narain and M. O'Loughlin
Abstract: We study a class of exact supersymmetric solutions of type IIB Supergravity. They have an SO(4) x SU(2) x U(1) isometry and preserve generically 4 of the 32 supersymmetries of the theory. Asymptotically AdS_5 x S^5 solutions in this class are dual to 1/8 BPS chiral operators which preserve the same symmetries in the N=4 SYM theory. We analyse the solutions to these equations in a large radius asymptotic expansion: they carry charges with respect to two U(1) KK gauge fields and their mass saturates the expected BPS bound. We also show how the same formalism is suitable for the description of the AdS_5 x Y^{p,q} geometries and a class of their excitations.
