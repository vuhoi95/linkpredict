Title: On the supergravity formulation of mirror symmetry in generalized  Calabi-Yau manifolds
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. Trigiante
Abstract: We derive the complete supergravity description of the N=2 scalar potential which realizes a generic flux-compactification on a Calabi-Yau manifold (generalized geometry). The effective potential V_{eff}=V_{(\partial_Z V=0)}$, obtained by integrating out the massive axionic fields of the special quaternionic manifold, is manifestly mirror symmetric, i.e. invariant with respect to {\rm Sp}(2 h_2+2)\times {\rm Sp}(2 h_1+2) and their exchange, being h_1, h_2 the complex dimensions of the underlying special geometries. {\Scr V}_{eff} has a manifestly N=1 form in terms of a mirror symmetric superpotential $W$ proposed, some time ago, by Berglund and Mayr.
