Title: GL(2,R) dualities in generalised Z(2) gauge theories and Ising models
Authors: N. Yokomizo and P. Teotonio-Sobrinho
Abstract: We study a class of duality transformations in generalised Z(2) gauge theories and Ising models on two- and three-dimensional compact lattices. The theories are interpreted algebraically in terms of the structure constants of a bidimensional vector space H with algebra and coalgebra structures, and it is shown that for any change of basis in H there is a related symmetry between such models. The classical Kramers and Wannier dualities are described as special cases of these transformations. We derive explicit expressions for the relation between partition functions on general finite triangulations for these cases, extending results known for square and cubic lattices in the thermodynamical limit. A class of symmetry transformations in which the gauge coupling changes continuously is also studied in two dimensions.
