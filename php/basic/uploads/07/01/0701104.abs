Title: Thermal production of gravitinos
Authors: Vyacheslav S. Rychkov and Alessandro Strumia
Abstract: We reconsider thermal production of gravitinos in the early universe, adding to previously considered 2 -> 2 gauge scatterings: a) production via 1 -> 2 decays, allowed by thermal masses; b) the effect of the top Yukawa coupling; c) a proper treatment of the reheating process. Our final result behaves physically (larger couplings give a larger rate) and is twice larger than previous results, implying e.g. a twice stronger constraint on the reheating temperature. Accessory results about (supersymmetric) theories at finite temperature and gravitino couplings might have some interest.
