Title: Entropy function for rotating extremal black holes in very special  geometry
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Johannes M. Oberreuter and Jan Perz
Abstract: We use the relation between extremal black hole solutions in five- and in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories with cubic prepotentials to define the entropy function for extremal black holes with one angular momentum in five dimensions. We construct two types of solutions to the associated attractor equations.
