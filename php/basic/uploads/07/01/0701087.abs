Title: Factorization of Seiberg-Witten Curves with Fundamental Matter
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Niels A. Obers and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of the factorization of Seiberg-Witten curves for N=2 theory with fundamental flavors. We first rederive the exact results for the case of complete factorization, and subsequently derive new results for the case with breaking of gauge symmetry U(Nc) to U(N1)xU(N2). We also show that integrality of periods is necessary and sufficient for factorization in the case of general gauge symmetry breaking. Finally, we briefly comment on the relevance of these results for the structure of N=1 vacua.
