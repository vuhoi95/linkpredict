Title: Obtaining the equation of motion for a fermionic particle in a  generalized Lorentz-violating system framework
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: Using a generalized procedure for obtaining the dispersion relation and the equation of motion for a propagating fermionic particle, we examine previous claims for a preferred axis at $n_{\mu}$($\equiv(1,0,0,1)$), $n^{2}=0$ embedded in the framework of very special relativity (VSR). We show that, in a relatively high energy scale, the corresponding equation of motion is reduced to a conserving lepton number chiral equation previously predicted in the literature. Otherwise, in a relatively low energy scale, the equation is reduced to the usual Dirac equation for a free propagating fermionic particle. It is accomplished by the suggestive analysis of some special cases where a nonlinear modification of the action of the Lorentz group is generated by the addition of a modified conformal transformation which, meanwhile, preserves the structure of the ordinary Lorentz algebra in a very peculiar way. Some feasible experiments, for which Lorentz violating effects here pointed out may be detectable, are suggested.
