Title: PT-Symmetric, Quasi-Exactly Solvable matrix Hamiltonians
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Ancilla Nininahazwe and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: Matrix quasi exactly solvable operators are considered and new conditions are determined to test whether a matrix differential operator possesses one or several finite dimensional invariant vector spaces. New examples of $2\times 2$-matrix quasi exactly solvable operators are constructed with the emphasis set on PT-symmetric Hamiltonians.
