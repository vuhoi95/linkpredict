Title: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect and spontaneous excitation of an accelerated  atom interacting with a quantum scalar field
Authors: Zhiying Zhu and Hongwei Yu
Abstract: We investigate, from the point of view of a coaccelerated frame, the spontaneous excitation of a uniformly accelerated two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a thermal state at a finite temperature $T$ and show that the same spontaneous excitation rate for the uniformly accelerated atom in the Minkowski vacuum obtained in the inertial frame can only be recovered in the coaccelerated frame assuming a thermal bath at the Fulling-Davies-Unruh temperature $T_{FDU}=a/2\pi$ for what appears to be the Minkowski vacuum to the inertial observer. Our discussion provides another example of a physical process different from those examined before in the literature to better understand the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect.
