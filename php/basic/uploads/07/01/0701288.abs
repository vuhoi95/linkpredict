Authors: S. Creek and O. Efthimiou and P. Kanti and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We study the evaporation of (4+n)-dimensional rotating black holes into scalar degrees of freedom on the brane. We calculate the corresponding absorption probabilities and cross-sections obtaining analytic solutions in the low-energy regime, and compare the derived analytic expressions to numerical results, with very good agreement. We then consider the high-energy regime, construct an analytic high-energy solution to the scalar-field equation by employing a new method, and calculate the absorption probability and cross-section for this energy regime, finding again a very good agreement with the exact numerical results. We also determine the high-energy asymptotic value of the total cross-section, and compare it to the analytic results derived from the application of the geometrical optics limit.
