Title: Topology Change From Quantum Instability of Gauge Theory on Fuzzy CP^2
Authors: Djamel Dou and Badis Ydri
Abstract: Many gauge theory models on fuzzy complex projective spaces will contain a strong instability in the quantum field theory leading to topology change. This can be thought of as due to the interaction between spacetime via its noncommutativity and the fields (matrices) and it is related to the perturbative UV-IR mixing. We work out in detail the example of fuzzy CP^2 and discuss at the level of the phase diagram the quantum transitions between the 3 spaces (spacetimes) CP^2, S^2 and the 0-dimensional space consisting of a single point {0}.
