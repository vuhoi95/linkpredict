Title: Evaporating (2+1)-dimensional black strings
Authors: Keiju Murata and Jiro Soda and Sugumi Kanno
Abstract: We investigate (2+1)-dimensional black strings in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime. The system is classically stable as long as the horizon size is much larger than the size of the compact space. Semiclassically, however, the horizon size shrinks gradually due to the energy loss through the Hawking radiation. Eventually, the system will enter into the regime of the Gregory-Laflamme instability and get destabilized. Subsequently, the spherically symmetric black hole is formed and evaporated in the usual manner. This standard picture may be altered by the dynamics of the internal space which induced by the Hawking radiation. We argue that the black string is excised from the Kaluza-Klein spacetime before the onset of the Gregory-Laflamme instability and therefore before the evaporation.
