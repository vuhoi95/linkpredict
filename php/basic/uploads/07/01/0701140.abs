Title: New Energy Definition for Higher Curvature Gravities
Authors: S. Deser and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We propose a novel but natural definition of conserved quantities for gravity models quadratic and higher in curvature. Based on the spatial asymptotics of curvature rather than of metric, it avoids the GR energy machinery's more egregious problems--such as zero energy "theorems" and failure in flat backgrounds -- in this fourth-derivative realm. In D>4, the present expression indeed correctly discriminates between second derivative Gauss-Bonnet and generic, fourth derivative, actions.
