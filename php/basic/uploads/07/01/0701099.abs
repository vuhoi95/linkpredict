Title: Dynamics of First Order Transitions with Gravity Duals
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Matthew M. Roberts
Abstract: A first order phase transition usually proceeds by nucleating bubbles of the new phase which then rapidly expand. In confining gauge theories with a gravity dual, the deconfined phase is often described by a black hole. If one starts in this phase and lowers the temperature, the usual description of how the phase transition proceeds violates the area theorem. We study the dynamics of this phase transition using the insights from the dual gravitational description, and resolve this apparent contradiction.
