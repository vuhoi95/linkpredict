Title: The Flavor Group Delta(3n^2)
Authors: Christoph Luhn and Salah Nasri and Pierre Ramond
Abstract: The large neutrino mixing angles have generated interest in finite subgroups of SU(3), as clues towards understanding the flavor structure of the Standard Model. In this work, we study the mathematical structure of the simplest non-Abelian subgroup, Delta(3n^2). Using simple mathematical techniques, we derive its conjugacy classes, character table, build its irreducible representations, their Kronecker products, and its invariants.
