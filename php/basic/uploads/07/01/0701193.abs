Title: Split fermion quasi-normal modes
Authors: H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Jason Doukas and Wade Naylor
Abstract: In this paper we use the conformal properties of the spinor field to show how we can obtain the fermion quasi-normal modes for a higher dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. These modes are of interest in so called split fermion models, where quarks and leptons are required to exist on different branes in order to keep the proton stable. As has been previously shown, for brane localized fields, the larger the number of dimensions the faster the black hole damping rate. Moreover, we also present the analytic forms of the quasi-normal frequencies in both the large angular momentum and the large mode number limits.
