Title: Refining the classification of the irreps of the 1D N-Extended  Supersymmetry
Authors: Zhanna Kuznetsova and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: The linear finite irreducible representations of the algebra of the 1D $N$-Extended Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics are discussed in terms of their "connectivity" (a symbol encoding information on the graphs associated to the irreps). The classification of the irreducible representations with the same fields content and different connectivity is presented up to $N\leq 8$.
