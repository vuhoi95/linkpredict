Title: The quantum Hall effect in graphene samples and the relativistic Dirac  effective action
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and Paola Giacconi and E. M. Santangelo and Roberto Soldati
Abstract: We study the Euclidean effective action per unit area and the charge density for a Dirac field in a two--dimensional spatial region, in the presence of a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the 2D--plane, at finite temperature and density. In the limit of zero temperature we reproduce, after performing an adequate Lorentz boost, the Hall conductivity measured for different kinds of graphene samples, depending upon the phase choice in the fermionic determinant.
