Title: A Note on the String Dual of N=1 SQCD-like Theories
Authors: Roberto Casero and Angel Paredes
Abstract: In this note we describe how N=1 SQCD-like theories with a large number of flavors can be given a dual description in terms of a string background containing a large number of additional D5-branes. The dual geometries account for the backreaction of the additional branes: they depend on the ratio between the number of flavors and colors of the gauge theory. This note is based on hep-th/0602027. We present here also a new set of solutions, which are not included in the original paper.
