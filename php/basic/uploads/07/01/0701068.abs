Title: Towards a CPT Invariant Quantum Field Theory on Elliptic de Sitter Space
Authors: Zhe. Chang and Xin. Li
Abstract: Consequences of Schr\"{o}dinger's antipodal identification on quantum field theory in de Sitter space are investigated. The elliptic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ identification provides observers with complete information. We show that a suitable confinement on dimension of the elliptic de Sitter space guarantees the existence of globally defined spinors and orientable $dS/\mathbb{Z}_2$ manifold. In Beltrami coordinates, we give exact solutions of scalar and spinor fields. The CPT invariance of quantum field theory on the elliptic de Sitter space is presented explicitly.
