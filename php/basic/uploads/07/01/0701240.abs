Title: Reduced sigma-model on AdS_5 x S^5: one-loop scattering amplitudes
Authors: Thomas Klose and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: We compute one-loop S-matrix in the reduced sigma-model which describes AdS_5 x S^5 string theory in the near-flat-space limit. The result agrees with the corresponding limit of the S-matrix in the full sigma-model, which demonstrates the consistency of the reduction at the quantum level.
