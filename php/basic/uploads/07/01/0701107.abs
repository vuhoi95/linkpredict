Title: Tunnelling From GÃ¶del Black Holes
Authors: Ryan Kerner and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We consider the spacetime structure of Kerr-G\"odel black holes, analyzing their parameter space Kerr-G\"odel in detail. We apply the tunnelling method to compute their temperature and compare the results to previous calculations obtained via other methods. We claim that it is not possible to have the CTC horizon in between the two black hole horizons and include a discussion of issues that occur when the radius of the CTC horizon is smaller than the radius of both black hole horizons.
