Title: Baryons from instantons in holographic QCD
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Tadakatsu Sakai and Shigeki Sugimoto and Shinichiro Yamato
Abstract: We consider aspects of dynamical baryons in a holographic dual of QCD that is proposed on the basis of a D4/D8-brane configuration. We construct a soliton solution carrying a unit baryon number and show that it is given by an instanton solution of four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with fixed size. The Chern-Simons term on the flavor D8-branes plays a crucial role of protecting the instanton from collapsing to zero size. By quantizing the collective coordinates of the soliton, we work out the baryon spectra. Negative-parity baryons as well as baryons with higher spins and isospins can be obtained in a simple manner.
