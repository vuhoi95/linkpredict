Abstract: We show in this paper that the dynamics of a non-relativistic particle with spin, coupled to an external electromagnetic field and to a background that breaks Lorentz symmetry, is naturally endowed with an N=1-supersymmetry. This result is achieved in a superspace approach where the particle coordinates and the spin degrees of freedom are components of the same supermultiplet.
