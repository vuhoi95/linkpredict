Title: Noncommutativity in interpolating string: A study of gauge symmetries in  noncommutative framework
Authors: Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Arindam Ghosh Hazra and Anirban Saha
Abstract: A new Lagrangian description that interpolates between the Nambu--Goto and Polyakov version of interacting strings is given. Certain essential modifications in the Poission bracket structure of this interpolating theory generates noncommutativity among the string coordinates for both free and interacting strings. The noncommutativity is shown to be a direct consequence of the nontrivial boundary conditions. A thorough analysis of the gauge symmetry is presented taking into account the new modified constraint algebra, which follows from the noncommutative structures and finally a smooth correspondence between gauge symmetry and reparametrisation is established.
