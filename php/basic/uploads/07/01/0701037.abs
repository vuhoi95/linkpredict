Title: On asymptotic stability of the Skyrmion
Authors: Piotr Bizo≈Ñ and Tadeusz Chmaj and Andrzej Rostworowski
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of spherically symmetric solutions in the Skyrme model. We show that the relaxation to the degree-one soliton (called the Skyrmion) has a universal form of a superposition of two effects: exponentially damped oscillations (the quasinormal ringing) and a power law decay (the tail). The quasinormal ringing, which dominates the dynamics for intermediate times, is a linear resonance effect. In contrast, the polynomial tail, which becomes uncovered at late times, is shown to be a \emph{nonlinear} phenomenon.
