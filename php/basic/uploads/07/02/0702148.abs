Title: Quantization of four-dimensional Abelian gravity
Authors: Bogusław Broda and Piotr Bronowski and Marcin Ostrowski and Michał Szanecki
Abstract: An abelian version of standard general relativity in the Cartan-Palatini gauge-like formulation in four dimensions has been introduced. Traditional canonical analysis utilizing similarities to the akin Husain-Kuchar SU(2) version of gravity has been performed. The model has been next quantized in the canonical path-integral Faddeev-Popov formalism yielding abelian BF theory.
