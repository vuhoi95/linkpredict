Title: Conformally flat FRW metrics
Authors: Masao Iihoshi and Sergei V. Ketov and Atsushi Morishita
Abstract: We find a new family of non-separable coordinate transformations bringing the FRW metrics into the manifestly conformally flat form. Our results are simple and complete, while our derivation is quite explicit. We also calculate all the FRW curvatures, including the Weyl tensor.
