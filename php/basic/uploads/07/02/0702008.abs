Title: Nonlinear Electrodynamics and black holes
Authors: Nora Breton and Ricardo Garcia-Salcedo
Abstract: It is addressed the issue of black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic field, focussing mainly in the Born-Infeld case. The main features of these systems are described, for instance, geodesics, energy conditions, thermodynamics and isolated horizon aspects. Also are revised some black hole solutions of alternative nonlinear electrodynamics and its inconveniences.
