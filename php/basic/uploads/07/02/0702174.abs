Title: Quantization of Wilson loops in Wess-Zumino-Witten models
Authors: Anton Alekseev and Samuel Monnier
Abstract: We describe a non-perturbative quantization of classical Wilson loops in the WZW model. The quantized Wilson loop is an operator acting on the Hilbert space of closed strings and commuting either with the full Kac-Moody chiral algebra or with one of its subalgebras. We prove that under open/closed string duality, it is dual to a boundary perturbation of the open string theory. As an application, we show that such operators are useful tools for identifying fixed points of the boundary renormalization group flow.
