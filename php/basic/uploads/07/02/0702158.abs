Title: On the Various Types of D-Branes in the Boundary H3+ Model
Authors: Hendrik Adorf and Michael Flohr
Abstract: We comment on the D-brane solutions for the boundary H3+ model that have been proposed so far and point out that many more types of D-branes should be considered possible. We start a systematic derivation of the 1/2- and b^{-2}/2-shift equations corresponding to each type. These equations serve as consistency conditions and we discuss their possible solutions. On this basis, we show for the known AdS_2^(d) branes, that only strings transforming in finite dimensional SL(2) representations can couple to them. Moreover, we also demonstrate that strings in the infinite dimensional continuous SL(2) representations do not couple consistently to the known AdS_2 branes. For some other types, we show that no consistent solutions seem to exist at all.
