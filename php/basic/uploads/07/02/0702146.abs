Title: The Gaugino Code
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Hans Peter Nilles
Abstract: Gauginos might play a crucial role in the search for supersymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Mass predictions for gauginos are rather robust and often related to the values of the gauge couplings. We analyse the ratios of gaugino masses in the LHC energy range for various schemes of supersymmetry breakdown and mediation. Three distinct mass patterns emerge.
