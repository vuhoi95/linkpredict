Title: Supersymmetry breaking in a warped slice with Majorana-type masses
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Yutaka Sakamura
Abstract: We study the five-dimensional (5D) supergravity compactified on an orbifold S^1/Z_2, where the U(1)_R symmetry is gauged by the graviphoton with Z_2-even coupling. In contrast to the case of gauging with Z_2-odd coupling, this class of models has Majorana-type masses and allows the Scherk-Schwarz (SS) twist even in the warped spacetime. Starting from the off-shell formulation, we show that the supersymmetry is always broken in an orbifold slice of AdS_5, irrespective of the value of the SS twist parameter. We analyze the spectra of gaugino and gravitino in such background, and find the SS twist can provide sizable effects on them in the small warping region.
