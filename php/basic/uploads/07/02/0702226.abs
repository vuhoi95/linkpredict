Title: The 5-D Choptuik critical exponent and holography
Authors: Jason Bland and Gabor Kunstatter
Abstract: Recently, a holographic argument was used to relate the saturation exponent, $\gamma_{BFKL}$, of four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory in the Regge limit to the Choptuik critical scaling exponent, $\gamma_{5d}$, in 5-dimensional black hole formation via scalar field collapse \cite{alvarez-gaume}. Remarkably, the numerical value of the former agreed quite well with previous calculations of the latter. We present new results of an improved calculation of $\gamma_{5d}$ with substantially decreased numerical error. Our current result is $\gamma_{5d} = 0.4131 \pm 0.0001$, which is close to, but not in strict agreement with, the value of $\gamma_{BFKL}=0.409552$ quoted in \cite{alvarez-gaume}.
