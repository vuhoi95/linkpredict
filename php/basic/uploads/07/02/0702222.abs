Title: BRST Symmetric Gaugeon Formalism for Higgs Model
Authors: Hikaru Miura and Ryusuke Endo
Abstract: We reinvestigate Yokoyama's gaugeon formalism for the spontaneously broken Abelian gauge theory. Within the framework of the covariant linear gauges, we give a general gauge-fixing Lagrangian which includes the gauge field, the Goldstone mode, the multiplier B-field and Yokoyama's gaugeon fields (as well as Faddeev-Popov ghosts). As special choices of the values of the gauge-fixing parameters, our theory includes the usual covariant gauges and R$_\xi$-like gauges. Although some of the gauge-fixing parameters can be shifted by the q-number gauge transformation, the $\xi$ parameter cannot be shifted in any of the R$_\xi$-like gauges.
