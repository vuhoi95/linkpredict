Title: Stationary vacuum hyper-cylindrical solution in 4+1 dimensions
Authors: Jungjai Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim
Abstract: We find a 4+1 dimensional stationary vacuum hyper-cylindrical solution solution which is spherically symmetric in $3-$dimensions and invariant under the translation along the fifth coordinate. The solution is characterized by three parameters, mass, tension, and conserved momentum along the fifth coordinate. The metric is locally equivalent to the known static solution. We briefly discuss its physical properties.
