Title: Renormalization group flows for the second $Z_{N}$ parafermionic field  theory for N odd
Authors: Vladimir S. Dotsenko and Benoit Estienne
Abstract: Using the renormalization group approach, the Coulomb gas and the coset techniques, the effect of slightly relevant perturbations is studied for the second parafermionic field theory with the symmetry $Z_{N}$, for N odd. New fixed points are found and classified.
