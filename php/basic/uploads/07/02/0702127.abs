Title: Euclidean solutions of Yang-Mills theory coupled to a massive dilaton
Authors: Y. Brihaye and G. Lavrelashvili
Abstract: The Euclidean version of Yang-Mills theory coupled to a massive dilaton is investigated. Our analytical and numerical results imply existence of infinite number of branches of globally regular, spherically symmetric, dyonic type solutions for any values of dilaton mass $m$. Solutions on different branches are labelled by the number of nodes of gauge field amplitude $W$. They have finite reduced action and provide new saddle points in the Euclidean path integral.
