Title: Higher dimensional rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory with  negative cosmological constant
Authors: Jutta Kunz and Francisco Navarro-Lerida and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of charged, rotating black holes with equal-magnitude angular momenta in an odd number of dimensions $D\geq 5$. These solutions posses a regular horizon of spherical topology and approach asymptotically the Anti-de Sitter spacetime background. We analyze their global charges, their gyromagnetic ratio and their horizon properties.
