Title: Flow Equations for Non-BPS Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Anna Ceresole and Gianguido Dall'Agata
Abstract: We exploit some common features of black hole and domain wall solutions of (super)gravity theories coupled to scalar fields and construct a class of stable extremal black holes that are non-BPS, but still can be described by first-order differential equations. These are driven by a "superpotential'', which replaces the central charge Z in the usual black hole potential. We provide a general procedure for finding this class and deriving the associated "superpotential''. We also identify some other cases which do not belong to this class, but show a similar behaviour.
