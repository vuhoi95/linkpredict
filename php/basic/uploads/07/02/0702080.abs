Title: Comment on Shadow and Non-Shadow Extensions of the Standard Model
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: The models in the two papers hep-ph/0608068 and hep-ph/0701254 by Chang et al. with the so-called shadow gauge and scalar fields are nothing but convenient tailored versions of our model in hep-th/0403039. The same remarks applies to the work in hep-th/0612165 by Meissner and Nicolai.
