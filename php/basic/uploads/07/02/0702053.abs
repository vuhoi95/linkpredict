Title: Rotating nonuniform black string solutions
Authors: Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We explore via linearized perturbation theory the Gregory-Laflamme instability of rotating black strings with equal magnitude angular momenta. Our results indicate that the Gregory-Laflamme instability persists up to extremality for all even dimensions between six and fourteen. We construct rotating nonuniform black strings with two equal magnitude angular momenta in six dimensions. We see a first indication for the occurrence of a topology changing transition, associated with such rotating nonuniform black strings. Charged nonuniform black string configurations in heterotic string theory are also constructed by employing a solution generation technique.
