Abstract: We construct the three-loop four-point amplitude of N=8 supergravity using the unitarity method. The amplitude is ultraviolet finite in four dimensions. Novel cancellations, not predicted by traditional superspace power-counting arguments, render its degree of divergence in D dimensions to be no worse than that of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory -- a finite theory in four dimensions. Similar cancellations can be identified at all loop orders in certain unitarity cuts, suggesting that N=8 supergravity may be a perturbatively finite theory of quantum gravity.
