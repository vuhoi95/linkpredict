Title: Field Theory in 2T-physics with N=1 Supersymmetry
Authors: Itzhak Bars and Yueh-Cheng Kuo
Abstract: We construct N=1 supersymmetric field theory in 4+2 dimensions compatible with the theoretical framework of 2T physics and its gauge symmetries. The fields are arranged into 4+2 dimensional chiral and vector supermultiplets, and their interactions are uniquely fixed by SUSY and 2T-physics gauge symmetries. In a particular gauge the 4+2 theory reduces to ordinary supersymmetric field theory in 3+1 dimensions without any Kaluza-Klein remnants, but with some additional constraints in 3+1 dimensions of interesting phenomenological relevance. This construction is another significant step in the development of 2T-physics as a structure that stands above 1T-physics.
