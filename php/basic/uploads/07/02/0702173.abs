Title: Worldsheet Instantons and a Null String Limit of Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Gerald A. Goldin and Nick E. Mavromatos and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: For a superstring theory in four spacetime dimensions, we propose a modification of the Born-Infeld action that possesses a well-defined tensionless limit. We interpret this as describing the effective target space dynamics of null strings on a D3-brane. We argue that such a modification can be induced by nonperturbative contributions from instantons in the worldsheet sigma-model describing string propagation on the brane.
