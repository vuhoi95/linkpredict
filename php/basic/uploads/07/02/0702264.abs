Title: Entanglement of thermal scalar fields in a compact space space
Authors: Jae-Weon Lee and Jaewan Kim and Taeseung Choi
Abstract: Using the thermal Green's function approach we propose a general method to investigate entanglement of the vacuum state or thermal ground states in an arbitrary dimensional space-time. As an application we show quantum separability of the massive thermal scalar field vacuum in the 1+1 dimensional cylindrical space-time. Separability is demonstrated using the positive partial transpose criterion for effective two-mode Gaussian states of collective operators. In this case, for all mass and temperature values entanglement is absent between the collective operators.
