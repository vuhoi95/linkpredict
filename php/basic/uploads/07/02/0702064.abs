Title: Non-linear vector perturbations in a contracting universe
Authors: Filipe C. Mena and David J. Mulryne and Reza Tavakol
Abstract: A number of scalar field models proposed as alternatives to the standard inflationary scenario involve contracting phases which precede the universe's present phase of expansion. An important question concerning such models is whether there are effects which could potentially distinguish them from purely expanding cosmologies. Vector perturbations have recently been considered in this context. At first order such perturbations are not supported by a scalar field. In this paper, therefore, we consider second order vector perturbations. We show that such perturbations are generated by first order scalar mode-mode couplings, and give an explicit expression for them. We compare the magnitude of vector perturbations produced in collapsing models with the corresponding amplitudes produced during inflation, using a number of suitable power-law solutions to model the inflationary and collapsing scenarios. We conclude that the ratios of the magnitudes of these perturbations depend on the details of the collapsing scenario as well as on how the hot big bang is recovered, but for certain cases could be large, growing with the duration of the collapse.
