Title: The Matrix Reloaded - on the Dark Energy Seesaw
Authors: Kari Enqvist and Steen Hannestad and Martin S. Sloth
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for dark energy, based on an extended seesaw for scalar fields, which does not require any new physics at energies below the TeV scale. A very light quintessence mass is usually considered to be technically unnatural, unless it is protected by some symmetry broken at the new very light scale. We propose that one can use an extended seesaw mechanism to construct technically natural models for very light fields, protected by SUSY softly broken above a TeV.
