Title: BPS preons in M-theory and supergravity
Authors: I. A. Bandos and J. A. de Azcarraga
Abstract: After introducing the notion of BPS preons as the basic constituents of M-theory, we discuss the recent negative results in the search for solutions of the D=10 and D=11 supergravity equations preserving 31/32 supersymmetries i.e., of preonic solutions. The absence of these supergravity preonic solutions may point out to a pure quantum nature of BPS preons, manifesting itself in the need of incorporating quantum (stringy/M-theoretic) corrections to the supergravity equations.
