Title: Lorentz violation and the speed of gravitational waves in brane-worlds
Authors: F. Ahmadi and S. Jalalzadeh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: Lorentz violation in a brane-world scenario is presented and used to obtain a relationship between the speed of gravitational waves in the bulk and that on the brane. Lorentz violating effects would manifest themselves in gravitational waves travelling with a greater speed in the bulk than on the brane and this effect is independent of the signature of the extra dimension.
