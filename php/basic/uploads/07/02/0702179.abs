Title: Acceleration-Extended Galilean Symmetries with Central Charges and their  Dynamical Realizations
Authors: J. Lukierski and P. C. Stichel and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We add to Galilean symmetries the transformations describing constant accelerations. The corresponding extended Galilean algebra allows, in any dimension $D=d+1$, the introduction of one central charge $c$ while in $D=2+1$ we can have three such charges: c, \theta and \theta'. We present nonrelativistic classical mechanics models, with higher order time derivatives and show that they give dynamical realizations of our algebras. The presence of central charge $c$ requires the acceleration square Lagrangian term. We show that the general Lagrangian with three central charges can be reinterpreted as describing an exotic planar particle coupled to a dynamical electric and a constant magnetic field.
