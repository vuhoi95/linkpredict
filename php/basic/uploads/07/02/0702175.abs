Title: Non-adiabatic quantum effects from a Standard Model time-dependent Higgs  vev
Authors: R. Casadio and P. L. Iafelice and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: We consider the time-dependence of the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) given by the dynamics of the Standard Model and study the non-adiabatic production of both bosons and fermions, which is intrinsically non-perturbative. In the Hartree approximation, we analyse the general expressions that describe the dissipative dynamics due to the back-reaction of the produced particles. In particular, we solve numerically some relevant cases for the Standard Model phenomenology in the regime of relatively small oscillations of the Higgs vev.
