Authors: Youngman Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider gluon condensation (GC) at finite temperature using AdS/CFT. We first show that in the presence of regular horizon, the GC is forbidden in high temperature. Then we consider gravity back-reaction to dilaton coupling and show that the back-reaction develops an singularity, and non-vanishing value of gluon condensation is allowed. We also study thermodynamic quantities and the trace anomaly in the presence of the GC. We discuss how to define a temperature in the presence of the singularity which forbids Hawking temperature. Finally we describe the thermodynamics of the gluon condensation including the effect of the Hawking-Page transition.
