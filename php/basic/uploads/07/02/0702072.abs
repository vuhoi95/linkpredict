Title: 5D Attractors with Higher Derivatives
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Joshua L. Davis and Per Kraus and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We analyze higher derivative corrections to attractor geometries in five dimensions. We find corrected AdS_3xS^2 geometries by solving the equations of motion coming from a recently constructed four-derivative supergravity action in five dimensions. The result allows us to explicitly verify a previous anomaly based derivation of the AdS_3 central charges of this theory. Also, by dimensional reduction we compare our results with those of the 4D higher derivative attractor, and find complete agreement.
