Title: Multidimensional integrable systems and deformations of Lie algebra  homomorphisms
Authors: Maciej Dunajski and James D. E. Grant and Ian A. B. Strachan
Abstract: We use deformations of Lie algebra homomorphisms to construct deformations of dispersionless integrable systems arising as symmetry reductions of anti--self--dual Yang--Mills equations with a gauge group Diff$(S^1)$.
