Title: Flux corrections to anomaly cancellation in M-theory on a manifold with  boundary
Authors: Sergio Lukic and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: We show how the coupling of gravitinos and gauginos to fluxes modifies anomaly cancellation in M-theory on a manifold with boundary. Anomaly cancellation continues to hold, after a shift of the definition of the gauge currents by a local gauge invariant expression in the curvatures and E8 fieldstrengths. We compute the first nontrivial correction of this kind. Warning: Ian Moss has called into question several of the numerical coefficients in the extended Dirac operators in this paper. We have not confirmed this but the reader is warned not to trust the precise coefficients in the formulae for the Dirac operators and heat kernel expansions. We believe these possible errors do not change our qualitative conclusions. One of us intends to return to the issue and recheck the formulae. We thank Ian Moss for pointing out these problems.
