Title: Stabilization of internal space in noncommutative multidimensional  cosmology
Authors: N. Khosravi and S. Jalalzadeh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We study the cosmological aspects of a noncommutative, multidimensional universe where the matter source is assumed to be a scalar field which does not commute with the internal scale factor. We show that such noncommutativity results in the internal dimensions being stabilized
