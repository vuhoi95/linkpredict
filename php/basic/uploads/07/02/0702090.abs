Title: A Monte-Carlo study of the AdS/CFT correspondence: an exploration of  quantum gravity effects
Authors: David Berenstein and Randel Cotta
Abstract: In this paper we study the AdS/CFT correspondence for N=4 SYM with gauge group U(N), compactified on S^3 in four dimensions using Monte-Carlo techniques. The simulation is based on a particular reduction of degrees of freedom to commuting matrices of constant fields, and in particular, we can write the wave functions of these degrees of freedom exactly. The square of the wave function is equivalent to a probability density for a Boltzman gas of interacting particles in six dimensions. From the simulation we can extract the density particle distribution for each wave function, and this distribution can be interpreted as a special geometric locus in the gravitational dual. Studying the wave functions associated to half-BPS giant gravitons, we are able to show that the matrix model can measure the Planck scale directly. We also show that the output of our simulation seems to match various theoretical expectations in the large N limit and that it captures 1/N effects as statistical fluctuations of the Boltzman gas with the expected scaling. Our results suggest that this is a very promising approach to explore quantum corrections and effects in gravitational physics on AdS spaces.
