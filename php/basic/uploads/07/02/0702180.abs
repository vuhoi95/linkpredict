Title: Hawking Radiation from Squashed Kaluza-Klein Black Holes -- A Window to  Extra Dimensions --
Authors: Hideki Ishihara and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We explore the obsevability of extra dimensions through 5-dimensional squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes residing in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime. With the expectation that the Hawking radiation reflects the 5-dimensional nature of the squashed horizon, we study the Hawking radiation of a scalar field in the squashed black hole background. As a result, we show that the luminosity of Hawking radiation tells us the size of the extra dimension, namely, the squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes open a window to extra dimensions.
