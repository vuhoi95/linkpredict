Title: Quantum SU(3) Skyrme model with noncanonical embedded SO(3) soliton
Authors: D. Jurciukonis and E. Norvaisas
Abstract: The new ansatz which is the SO(3) group soliton was defined for the SU(3) Skyrme model. The model is considered in noncanonical bases $SU(3)\supset SO(3)$ for the state vectors. A complete canonical quantization of the model have been investigated in the collective coordinate formalism for the fundamental SU(3) representation of the unitary field. The independent quantum variables manifold cover all the eight dimensions SU(3) group manifold due to the new ansatz. The explicit expressions of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities are derived for this modified quantum skyrmion.
