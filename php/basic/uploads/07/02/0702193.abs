Title: Lumps in the throat
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Hassan Firouzjahi and Rhiannon Gwyn
Abstract: We study classical lump solutions in a warped throat where brane inflation takes place. Some of the solitonic or lump solutions that we study here are the (p,q) cosmic strings and their junctions, cosmic necklaces and semi-local strings and generic semi-local defects. We show how various wrapping modes of D3-branes may be used to study all these defects in one interpolating set-up. Our construction allows us to study (p,q)-string junctions in curved backgrounds and in the presence of non-trivial RR fluxes. We extend the junction construction to allow for the possibility of cosmic necklaces, and show how these new lump solutions form a consistent picture in the inflationary brane models. We also give a generic construction of semi-local defects in these backgrounds, and argue that our construction encompasses all possible constructions of semi-local defects with any global symmetries. The cosmological implications of these configurations are briefly studied.
