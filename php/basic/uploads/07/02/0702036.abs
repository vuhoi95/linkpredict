Title: Phase-space and Black Hole Entropy of Higher Genus Horizons in Loop  Quantum Gravity
Authors: S. Kloster and J. Brannlund and A. DeBenedictis
Abstract: In the context of loop quantum gravity, we construct the phase-space of isolated horizons with genus greater than 0. Within the loop quantum gravity framework, these horizons are described by genus g surfaces with N punctures and the dimension of the corresponding phase-space is calculated including the genus cycles as degrees of freedom. From this, the black hole entropy can be calculated by counting the microstates which correspond to a black hole of fixed area. We find that the leading term agrees with the A/4 law and that the sub-leading contribution is modified by the genus cycles.
