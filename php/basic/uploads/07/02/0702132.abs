Title: A Covariant Approach to Noncommutative M5-branes
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We briefly review how to discuss noncommutative (NC) M5-branes and intersecting NC M5-branes from kappa-invariance of an open supermembrane action with constant three-form fluxes. The kappa-invariance gives rise to possible Dirichlet brane configurations. We shortly summarize a construction of projection operators for NC M5-branes and some intersecting configurations of NC M5-branes. A strong flux limit of them is also discussed.
