Title: Quantum noncommutative multidimensional cosmology
Authors: N. Khosravi and S. Jalalzadeh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We present exact quantum solutions for a noncommutative, multidimensional cosmological model and show that stabilization of extra dimensions sets in with the introduction of noncommutativity between the scale factors. An interpretation is offered to accommodate the notion of time, rendering comparison with the classical solutions possible.
