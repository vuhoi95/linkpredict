Title: Noncommutative spaces, the quantum of time and the Lorentz symmetry
Authors: Juan M. Romero and J. D. Vergara and J. A. Santiago
Abstract: We introduce three space-times that are discrete in time and compatible with the Lorentz symmetry. We show that these spaces are no commutative, with commutation relations similar to the relations of the Snyder and Yang spaces. Furthermore, using a reparametrized relativistic particle we obtain a realization of the Snyder type spaces and we construct an action for them.
