Title: Gauss-Bonnet brane gravity with a confining potential
Authors: M. Heydari-Fard and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: A brane scenario is envisaged in which the $m$-dimensional bulk is endowed with a Gauss-Bonnet term and localization of matter on the brane is achieved by means of a confining potential. The resulting Friedmann equations on the brane are modified by various extra terms that may be interpreted as the X-matter, providing a possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. The age of the universe in this scenario is studied and shown to be consistent with the present observational data.
