Title: Lectures on Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Kenneth Intriligator and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We review the subject of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. First we consider supersymmetry breaking in a semiclassical theory. We illustrate it with several examples, demonstrating different phenomena, including metastable supersymmetry breaking. Then we give a brief review of the dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories. Finally, we use this dynamics to present various mechanisms for dynamical supersymmetry breaking. These notes are based on lectures given by the authors in 2007, at various schools.
