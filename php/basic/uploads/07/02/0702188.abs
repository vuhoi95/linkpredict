Abstract: We construct $(2n)^2\times (2n)^2$ unitary braid matrices $\hat{R}$ for $n\geq 2$ generalizing the class known for $n=1$. A set of $(2n)\times (2n)$ matrices $(I,J,K,L)$ are defined. $\hat{R}$ is expressed in terms of their tensor products (such as $K\otimes J$), leading to a canonical formulation for all $n$. Complex projectors $P_{\pm}$ provide a basis for our real, unitary $\hat{R}$. Baxterization is obtained. Diagonalizations and block-diagonalizations are presented. The loss of braid property when $\hat{R}$ $(n>1)$ is block-diagonalized in terms of $\hat{R}$ $(n=1)$ is pointed out and explained. For odd dimension $(2n+1)^2\times (2n+1)^2$, a previously constructed braid matrix is complexified to obtain unitarity. $\hat{R}\mathrm{LL}$- and $\hat{R}\mathrm{TT}$-algebras, chain Hamiltonians, potentials for factorizable $S$-matrices, complex non-commutative spaces are all studied briefly in the context of our unitary braid matrices. Turaev construction of link invariants is formulated for our case. We conclude with comments concerning entanglements.
