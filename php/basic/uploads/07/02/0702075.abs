Title: The cosmological constant as an eigenvalue of f(R)-gravity Hamiltonian  constraint
Authors: S. Capozziello and R. Garattini
Abstract: In the framework of ADM formalism, it is possible to find out eigenvalues of the WDW equation with the meaning of vacuum states, i.e. cosmological constants, for f(R) theories of gravity, where f(R) is a generic analytic function of the Ricci curvature scalar R. The explicit calculation is performed for a Schwarzschild metric where one-loop energy is derived by the zeta function regularization method and a renormalized running Lambda constant is obtained.
