Title: Current induced transition of anisotropic quantum Hall states
Authors: Kazumi Tsuda and Nobuki Maeda and Kenzo Ishikawa
Abstract: We compare the energies of the striped Hall state and the anisotropic charge density wave (ACDW) state at half-filled third and higher Landau levels in the system with injected currents. With no injected current, the ACDW state has a lower energy. We find that the striped Hall state becomes the lower energy state when the injected current exceeds a critical value. The critical value is estimated as about 0.04-0.05 nA.
