Title: Retrofitted Gravity Mediation without the Gravitino-overproduction  Problem
Authors: Motoi Endo and Fuminobu Takahashi and T. T. Yanagida
Abstract: We propose a retrofitted gravity mediation model which alleviates the gravitino overproduction from decays of an inflaton and a supersymmetry breaking field. In the model, we introduce an approximate U(1) symmetry under which the supersymmetry breaking field is charged, although it is broken by a mass term of messenger fields to generate gaugino masses of order the weak scale. In a low-scale inflation model, we find regions in which the gravitino overproduction problem is avoided.
