Abstract: We study the relation between exactly marginal deformations in a large class of N=1 superconformal quiver gauge theories described by brane tilings and the degrees of freedom in the corresponding 5-brane systems. We show, with the help of NSVZ exact beta functions, that there are generically d-1 complex exactly marginal deformations of a gauge theory, where d is the perimeter of the corresponding n it, and the other two, the diagonal gauge coupling and a beta-like deformation, as background supergravity fields.toric diagram. We identify d-3 complex marginal deformations as deformations of the brane system and the Wilson lines on it, and the other two, the diagonal gauge coupling and a beta-like deformation, as background supergravity fields.
