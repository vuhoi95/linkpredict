Title: Logarithmic intertwining operators and W(2,2p-1)-algebras
Authors: Drazen Adamovic and Antun Milas
Abstract: For every $p \geq 2$, we obtained an explicit construction of a family of $\mathcal{W}(2,2p-1)$-modules, which decompose as direct sum of simple Virasoro algebra modules. Furthermore, we classified all irreducible self-dual $\mathcal{W}(2,2p-1)$-modules, we described their internal structure, and computed their graded dimensions. In addition, we constructed certain hidden logarithmic intertwining operators among two ordinary and one logarithmic $\mathcal{W}(2,2p-1)$-modules. This work, in particular, gives a mathematically precise formulation and interpretation of what physicists have been referring to as "logarithmic conformal field theory" of central charge $c_{p,1}=1-\frac{6(p-1)^2}{p}, p \geq 2$. Our explicit construction can be easily applied for computations of correlation functions. Techniques from this paper can be used to study the triplet vertex operator algebra $\mathcal{W}(2,(2p-1)^3)$ and other logarithmic models.
