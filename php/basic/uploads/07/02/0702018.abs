Title: Generalized couplings between an Abelian $p$-form and a (3,1) mixed  symmetry tensor field
Authors: C. C. Ciobirca and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: The consistent interactions between a single, free, massless tensor gauge field with the mixed symmetry $(3,1)$ and an Abelian $p$-form are investigated in the framework of the BRST formalism combined with cohomological techniques. Under the assumptions on smoothness, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincar\'{e} invariance of the deformations, supplemented by the requirement that the interacting Lagrangian is at most second-order derivative, it is proved that for every value $p\geq 1$ of the form degree there are consistent couplings between the Abelian form and the massless $(3,1)$ gauge field.
