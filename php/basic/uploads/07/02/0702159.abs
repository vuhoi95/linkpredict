Title: Deformed Special Relativity and Deformed Symmetries in a Canonical  Framework
Authors: Subir Ghosh and Probir Pal
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the nature of kinematical and dynamical laws in $\kappa $-Minkowski spacetime from a new perspective: the canonical phase space approach. We discuss a particular form of $\kappa$-Minkowski phase space algebra that yields the $\kappa$-extended finite Lorentz transformations derived in \cite{kim}. This is a particular form of a Deformed Special Relativity model that admits a modified energy-momentum dispersion law as well as noncommutative $\kappa$-Minkowski phase space. We show that this system can be completely mapped to a set of phase space variables that obey canonical (and {\it{not}} $\kappa$-Minkowski) phase space algebra and Special Relativity Lorentz transformation (and {\it{not}} $\kappa$-extended Lorentz transformation). The complete set of deformed symmetry generators are constructed that obeys an unmodified closed algebra but induce deformations in the symmetry transformations of the physical $\kappa$-Minkowski phase space variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness and simplicity of this approach through a number of phenomenological applications both in classical and quantum mechanics. We also construct a Lagrangian for the $\kappa$-particle.
