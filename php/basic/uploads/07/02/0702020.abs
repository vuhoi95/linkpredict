Title: Proof of ultra-violet finiteness for a planar non-supersymmetric  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth and Stefano Kovacs and Hidehiko Shimada
Abstract: This paper focuses on a three-parameter deformation of N=4 Yang-Mills that breaks all the supersymmetry in the theory. We show that the resulting non-supersymmetric gauge theory is scale invariant, in the planar approximation, by proving that its Green functions are ultra-violet finite to all orders in light-cone perturbation theory.
