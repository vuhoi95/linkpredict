Title: On the Possibility of Quantum Gravity Effects at Astrophysical Scales
Authors: M. Reuter and H. Weyer
Abstract: The nonperturbative renormalization group flow of Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is reviewed. It is argued that at large distances there could be strong renormalization effects, including a scale dependence of Newton's constant, which mimic the presence of dark matter at galactic and cosmological scales.
