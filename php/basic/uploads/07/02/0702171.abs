Title: A self-tuning mechanism in (3+p)d gravity-scalar theory
Authors: Eun Kyung Park and Pyung Seong Kwon
Abstract: We present a new type of self-tuning mechanism for ($3+p$)d brane world models in the framework of gravity-scalar theory. This new type of self-tuning mechanism exhibits a remarkable feature. In the limit $g_s \to 0$, $g_s$ being the string coupling, the geometry of bulk spacetime remains virtually unchanged by an introduction of the Standard Model(SM)-brane, and consequently it is virtually unaffected by quantum fluctuations of SM fields with support on the SM-brane. Such a feature can be obtained by introducing Neveu-Schwarz(NS)-brane as a background brane on which our SM-brane is to be set. Indeed, field equations naturally suggest the existence of the background NS-brane. Among the given such models, of the most interest is the case with $\Lambda=0$, where $\Lambda$ represents the bulk cosmological constant. This model contains a pair of coincident branes (of the SM- and the NS-branes), one of which is a codimension-2 brane placed at the origin of 2d transverse space ($\equiv \Sigma_2$), another a codimension-1 brane placed at the edge of $\Sigma_2$. These two branes are (anti) T-duals of each other, and one of them may be identified as our SM-brane plus the background NS-brane. In the presence of the background NS-brane (and in the absence of $\Lambda$), the 2d transverse space $\Sigma_2$ becomes an orbifold $R_2 /Z_n$ with an appropriate deficit angle. But this is only possible if the ($3+p$)d Planck scale $M_{3+p}$ and the string scale $M_s$($\equiv 1/\sqrt{\alpha^{\prime}}$) are of the same order, which accords with the hierarchy assumption \cite{1,2,3} that the electroweak scale $m_{EW}$ is the only short distance scale existing in nature.
