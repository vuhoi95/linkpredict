Title: From random Regge triangulations to open strings
Authors: Mauro Carfora and Claudio Dappiaggi and Valeria L. Gili
Abstract: We show how Boundary Conformal Field Theory deformation techniques allow for a complete characterisation of the coupling between the discrete geometry inherited uniformizing a random Regge triangulations and open string theory.
