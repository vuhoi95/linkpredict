Title: Free Yang-Mills vs. Toric Sasaki-Einstein
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: It has been known that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole in AdS_5 * S^5 agrees with the free N=4 super Yang-Mills entropy up to the famous factor 4/3. This factor can be interpreted as the ratio of the entropy of the free Yang-Mills to the entropy of the strongly coupled Yang-Mills. In this paper we compute this factor for infinitely many N=1 SCFTs which are dual to toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. We observed that this ratio always takes values within a narrow range around 4/3. We also present explicit values of volumes and central charges for new classes of toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds.
