Title: Intersecting Noncommutative M5-branes from Covariant Open Supermembrane
Authors: Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study intersecting noncommutative (NC) M5-branes from \kappa-invariance of an open supermembrane action with constant three-form fluxes. The $\kappa$-invariance gives rise to possible D-brane configurations for which projection operators can be determined. We construct projection operators for two types of 1/4 BPS intersecting NC M5-branes. The one is an intersection of two NC M5-branes: NC M5\bot NC M5 (3). The other is that of a NC M5-brane and a commutative (C) M5-brane: NC M5\bot C M5 (1). A NC M5-brane can be viewed as a bound state of M5 and M2, and the configurations M2\bot M5 (1) and M2\bot M2 (0) are realized on the intersecting M5-branes. Taking a commutative limit the allowed intersecting M5-branes are surely reproduced: M5\bot M5 (3) and M5\bot M5 (1).
