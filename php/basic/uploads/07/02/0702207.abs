Title: Rotating Black Holes on Kaluza-Klein Bubbles
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Hideo Iguchi and Takashi Mishima
Abstract: Using the solitonic solution generating techniques, we generate a new exact solution which describes a pair of rotating black holes on a Kaluza-Klein bubble as a vacuum solution in the five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. We also investigate the properties of this solution. Two black holes with topology S^3 are rotating along the same direction and the bubble plays a role in holding two black holes. In static case, it coincides with the solution found by Elvang and Horowitz.
