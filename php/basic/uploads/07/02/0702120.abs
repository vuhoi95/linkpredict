Title: Toric AdS4/CFT3 duals and M-theory Crystals
Authors: Sangmin Lee and Sungjay Lee and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We study the recently proposed crystal model for three dimensional superconformal field theories arising from M2-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau four-fold singularities. We explain the algorithms mapping a toric Calabi-Yau to a crystal and vice versa, and show how the spectrum of BPS meson states fits into the crystal model.
