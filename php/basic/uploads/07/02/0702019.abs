Title: Attractor Horizon Geometries of Extremal Black Holes
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani
Abstract: We report on recent advances in the study of critical points of the ``black hole effective potential'' V_{BH} (usually named \textit{attractors}) of N=2, d=4 supergravity coupled to n_{V} Abelian vector multiplets, in an asymptotically flat extremal black hole background described by 2n_{V}+2 dyonic charges and (complex) scalar fields which are coordinates of an n_{V}-dimensional Special Kahler manifold.
