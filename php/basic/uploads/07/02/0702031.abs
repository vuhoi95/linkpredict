Title: Multiple Lambda cosmology: dark fluid with time-dependent equation of  state as classical analog of cosmological landscape
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss FRW universe with time-dependent EoS dark fluid which leads to multiple de Sitter space. This model (as well as its scalar-tensor version) may be considered as some classical analog of cosmological landscape. The universe expansion history may look as transitions between different deSitter eras what suggests the interesting solution for cosmological constant problem. For specific time-dependent EoS dark fluid the possibility of transitions between universe regions with positive and negative cosmological constant is also established.
