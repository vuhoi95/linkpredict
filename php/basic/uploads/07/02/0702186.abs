Title: Form factors of integrable Heisenberg (higher) spin chains
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and J. M. Maillet
Abstract: We present determinant formulae for the form factors of spin operators of general integrable XXX Heisenberg spin chains for arbitrary (finite dimensional) spin representations. The results apply to any "mixed" spin chains, such as alternating spin chains, or to spin chains with magnetic impurities.
