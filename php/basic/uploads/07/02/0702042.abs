Title: On the parameters of the Kerr-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter space-time
Authors: J. B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky
Abstract: Different forms of the metric for the Kerr-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter space-time are being widely used in its extension to higher dimensions. The purpose of this note is to relate the parameters that are being used to the physical parameters (mass, rotation, NUT and cosmological constant) in the basic four dimensional situation.
