Authors: Kui Xiao and Wenbiao Liu and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: Considering anomalies of quantum field in the (1+1)-dimensional Achucarro-Ortiz black hole background, the stress tensor near and out of the horizon is calculated, meanwhile, the relationship between anomalies and Hawking radiation of the black hole is discussed.
