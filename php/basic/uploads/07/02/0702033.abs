Title: Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and Super-Lichnerowicz Algebras
Authors: K. Hallowell and A. Waldron
Abstract: We present supersymmetric, curved space, quantum mechanical models based on deformations of a parabolic subalgebra of osp(2p+2|Q). The dynamics are governed by a spinning particle action whose internal coordinates are Lorentz vectors labeled by the fundamental representation of osp(2p|Q). The states of the theory are tensors or spinor-tensors on the curved background while conserved charges correspond to the various differential geometry operators acting on these. The Hamiltonian generalizes Lichnerowicz's wave/Laplace operator. It is central, and the models are supersymmetric whenever the background is a symmetric space, although there is an osp(2p|Q) superalgebra for any curved background. The lowest purely bosonic example (2p,Q)=(2,0) corresponds to a deformed Jacobi group and describes Lichnerowicz's original algebra of constant curvature, differential geometric operators acting on symmetric tensors. The case (2p,Q)=(0,1) is simply the {\cal N}=1 superparticle whose supercharge amounts to the Dirac operator acting on spinors. The (2p,Q)=(0,2) model is the {\cal N}=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics corresponding to differential forms. (This latter pair of models are supersymmetric on any Riemannian background.) When Q is odd, the models apply to spinor-tensors. The (2p,Q)=(2,1) model is distinguished by admitting a central Lichnerowicz-Dirac operator when the background is constant curvature. The new supersymmetric models are novel in that the Hamiltonian is not just a square of super charges, but rather a sum of commutators of supercharges and commutators of bosonic charges. These models and superalgebras are a very useful tool for any study involving high rank tensors and spinors on manifolds.
