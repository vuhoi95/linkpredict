Title: Aspects of Puff Field Theory
Authors: Ori J. Ganor and Akikazu Hashimoto and Sharon Jue and Bom Soo Kim and Anthony Ndirango
Abstract: We describe some features of the recently constructed "Puff Field Theory," and present arguments in favor of it being a field theory decoupled from gravity. We construct its supergravity dual and calculate the entropy of this theory in the limit of large 't Hooft coupling. We also determine the leading irrelevant operator that governs its deviation from N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
