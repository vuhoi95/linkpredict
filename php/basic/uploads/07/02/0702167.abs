Title: Baryon currents in QCD with compact dimensions
Authors: Biagio Lucini and Agostino Patella and Claudio Pica
Abstract: On a compact space with non-trivial cycles, for sufficiently small values of the radii of the compact dimensions, SU(N) gauge theories coupled with fermions in the fundamental representation spontaneously break charge conjugation, time reversal and parity. We show at one loop in perturbation theory that physical signature for this phenomenon is a non-zero baryonic current wrapping around the compact directions. The persistence of this current beyond the perturbative regime is checked by lattice simulations.
