Title: Dynamics of colliding branes and black brane production
Authors: Yu-ichi Takamizu and Hideaki Kudoh and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We study the dynamics of colliding domain walls including self-gravity. The initial data is set up by applying a BPS domain wall in five-dimensional supergravity, and we evolve the system determining the final outcome of collisions. After a collision, a spacelike curvature singularity covered by a horizon is formed in the bulk, resulting in a black brane with trapped domain walls. This is a generic consequence of collisions, except for non-relativistic weak field cases, in which the walls pass through one another or multiple bounces take place without singularity formation. These results show that incorporating the self-gravity drastically changes a naive picture of colliding branes.
