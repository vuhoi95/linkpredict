Title: Entanglement Entropy: Helicity versus Spin
Authors: Song He and Shuxin Shao and Hongbao Zhang
Abstract: For a massive spin 1/2 field, we present the reduced spin and helicity density matrix, respectively, for the same pure one particle state. Their relation has also been developed. Furthermore, we calculate and compare the corresponding entanglement entropy for spin and helicity within the same inertial reference frame. Due to the distinct dependence on momentum degree of freedom between spin and helicity states, the resultant helicity entropy is different from that of spin in general. In particular, we find that both helicity entanglement for a spin eigenstate and spin entanglement for a right handed or left handed helicity state do not vanish and their Von Neumann entropy has no dependence on the specific form of momentum distribution as long as it is isotropic.
