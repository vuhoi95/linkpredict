Authors: Sasa Kresic-Juric and Stjepan Meljanac and Marko Stojic
Abstract: We study a Lie algebra type $\kappa$-deformed space with undeformed rotation algebra and commutative vector-like Dirac derivatives in a covariant way. Space deformation depends on an arbitrary vector. Infinitely many covariant realizations in terms of commuting coordinates of undeformed space and their derivatives are constructed. The corresponding coproducts and star products are found and related in a new way. All covariant realizations are physically equivalent. Specially, a few simple realizations are found and discussed. The scalar fields, invariants and the notion of invariant integration is discussed in the natural realization.
