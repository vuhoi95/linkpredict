Title: Quantum Gravitational Bremsstrahlung, Massless versus Massive Gravity
Authors: Julian B. Berchtold and Gunter Scharf
Abstract: The massive spin-2 quantum gauge theory previously developed is applied to calculate gravitational bremsstrahlung. It is shown that this theory is unique and free from defects. In particular, there is no strong coupling if the graviton mass becomes small. The cross sections go over smoothly into the ones of the massless theory in the limit of vanishing graviton mass. The massless cross sections are calculated for the full tensor theory.
