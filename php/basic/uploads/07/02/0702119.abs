Abstract: The Comment by Amore {\it et al.} [gr-qc/0611029] contains a valid criticism of the numerical precision of the results reported in a recent paper of ours [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 73}, 044022 (2006)], as well as fresh ideas on how to characterize a quantum cosmological singularity. However, we argue that, contrary to what is suggested in the Comment, the quantum cosmological models we studied show hardly any sign of singular behavior.
