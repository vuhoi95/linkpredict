Title: Positive-definite states of a Klein-Gordon type particle
Authors: A. A. Semenov and C. V. Usenko and B. I. Lev
Abstract: A possible way for the consistent probability interpretation of the Klein-Gordon equation is proposed. It is assumed that some states of a scalar charged particle cannot be physically realized. The rest of quantum states are proven to have positive-definite probability distributions.
