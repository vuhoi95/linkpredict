Title: Classification of toric Fano 5-folds
Authors: Maximilian Kreuzer and Benjamin Nill
Abstract: We obtain 866 isomorphism classes of five-dimensional nonsingular toric Fano varieties using a computer program and the database of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes. The algorithm is based on the existence of facets of Fano polytopes having small integral distance from any vertex.
