Title: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations via the Renormalization Group
Authors: Sabino Matarrese and Massimo Pietroni
Abstract: A semi-analytic approach to the computation of the non-linear power-spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations is proposed. The method is based on the Renormalization Group technique and can be applied to any underlying cosmological model. Our prediction on the baryonic acoustic oscillations in a LambdaCDM model accurately fits the results of N-body simulations down to zero redshift, where perturbation theory fails.
