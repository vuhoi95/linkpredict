Title: Ultraviolet properties of f(R)-Gravity
Authors: Alessandro Codello and Roberto Percacci and Christoph Rahmede
Abstract: We discuss the existence and properties of a nontrivial fixed point in f(R)-gravity, where f is a polynomial of order up to six. Within this seven-parameter class of theories, the fixed point has three ultraviolet-attractive and four ultraviolet-repulsive directions; this brings further support to the hypothesis that gravity is nonperturbatively renormalizabile.
