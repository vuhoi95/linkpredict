Title: Plasmarings as dual black rings
Authors: Subhaneil Lahiri and Shiraz Minwalla
Abstract: We construct solutions to the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations that describe the long wavelength collective dynamics of the deconfined plasma phase of N=4 Yang Mills theory compactified down to d=3 on a Scherk-Schwarz circle and higher dimensional generalisations. Our solutions are stationary, axially symmetric spinning balls and rings of plasma. These solutions, which are dual to (yet to be constructed) rotating black holes and black rings in Scherk-Schwarz compactified AdS(5) and AdS(6), and have properties that are qualitatively similar to those of black holes and black rings in flat five dimensional supergravity.
