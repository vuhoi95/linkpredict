Title: Near-horizon symmetries of extremal black holes
Authors: Hari K. Kunduri and James Lucietti and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated an attractor mechanism for extremal rotating black holes subject to the assumption of a near-horizon SO(2,1) symmetry. We prove the existence of this symmetry for any extremal black hole with the same number of rotational symmetries as known four and five dimensional solutions (including black rings). The result is valid for a general two-derivative theory of gravity coupled to abelian vectors and uncharged scalars, allowing for a non-trivial scalar potential. We prove that it remains valid in the presence of higher-derivative corrections. We show that SO(2,1)-symmetric near-horizon solutions can be analytically continued to give SU(2)-symmetric black hole solutions. For example, the near-horizon limit of an extremal 5D Myers-Perry black hole is related by analytic continuation to a non-extremal cohomogeneity-1 Myers-Perry solution.
