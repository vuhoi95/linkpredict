Title: Gauge invariances vis-{รก}-vis Diffeomorphisms in second order metric  gravity: A new Hamiltonian approach
Authors: Pradip Mukherjee and Anirban Saha
Abstract: A new analysis of the gauge invariances and their unity with diffeomorphism invariances in second order metric gravity is presented which strictly follows Dirac's constrained Hamiltonian approach.
