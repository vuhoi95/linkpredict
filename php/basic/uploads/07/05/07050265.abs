Title: Hawking Radiation from Non-Extremal D1-D5 Black Hole via Anomalies
Authors: Hyeonjoon Shin and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We take the method of anomaly cancellation for the derivation of Hawking radiation initiated by Robinson and Wilczek, and apply it to the non-extremal five-dimensional D1-D5 black hole in string theory. The fluxes of the electric charge flow and the energy-momentum tensor from the black hole are obtained. They are shown to match exactly with those of the two-dimensional black body radiation at the Hawking temperature.
