Title: Probing extra dimensions with higher dimensional black hole analogues?
Authors: Xian-Hui Ge and Sung-Won Kim
Abstract: We propose that extra dimensions might be detected with higher dimensional analogues of black holes. The usual 4-dimensional acoustic(sonic)black hole metric is extended to arbitrary dimensions. The absorption cross-section of Hawking radiation on the brane and in the bulk are calculated in the semiclassical approximation.
