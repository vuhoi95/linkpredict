Title: Thermal Operator and Dispersion Relation in QED at Finite Temperature  and Chemical Potential
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: Combining the thermal operator representation with the dispersion relation in QED at finite temperature and chemical potential, we determine the complete retarded photon self-energy only from its absorptive part at zero temperature. As an application of this method, we show that, even for the case of a nonzero chemical potential, the temperature dependent part of the one loop retarded photon self-energy vanishes in $(1+1)$ dimensional massless QED.
