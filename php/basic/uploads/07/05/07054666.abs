Title: Trans-Planckian signals from the breaking of local Lorentz invariance
Authors: Hael Collins and R. Holman
Abstract: This article examines how a breakdown of a locally Lorentz invariant, point-like description of nature at tiny space-time intervals would translate into a distinctive set of signals in the primordial power spectrum generated by inflation. We examine the leading irrelevant operators that are consistent with the spatial translations and rotations of a preferred, isotropically expanding, background. A few of the resulting corrections to the primordial power spectrum do not have the usual oscillatory factor, which is sometimes taken to be characteristic of a "trans-Planckian" signal. Perhaps more interestingly, one of these leading irrelevant operators exactly reproduces a correction to the power spectrum that occurs in effective descriptions of the state of the field responsible for inflation.
