Title: A Short Review of Time Dependent Solutions and Space-like Singularities  in String Theory
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Dori Reichmann
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a short review of the status of time dependent backgrounds in String theory, and in particular those that contain space-like singularities. Despite considerable efforts, we do not have yet a full and compelling picture of such backgrounds. We review some of the various attempts to understand these singularities via generalizations of the BKL dynamics, using worldsheet methods and using non-perturbative tools such as the AdS/CFT correspondence and M(atrix) theory. These lecture notes are based on talks given at Cargese 06 and the dead-sea conference 06.
