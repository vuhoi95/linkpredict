Title: Expanding F-Theory
Authors: Matthew Kleban and Michele Redi
Abstract: We construct a general class of new time dependent solutions of non-linear sigma models coupled to gravity. These solutions describe configurations of expanding or contracting codimension two solitons which are not subject to a constraint on the total tension. The two dimensional metric on the space transverse to the defects is determined by the Liouville equation. This space can be compact or non-compact, and of any topology. We show that this construction can be applied naturally in type IIB string theory to find backgrounds describing a number of 7-branes larger than 24.
