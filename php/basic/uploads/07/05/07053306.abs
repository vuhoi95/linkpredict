Title: CPT and Lorentz violation effects in hydrogen-like atoms
Authors: O. G. Kharlanov and V. Ch. Zhukovsky
Abstract: Within the framework of Lorentz-violating extended electrodynamics, the Dirac equation for a bound electron in an external electromagnetic field is considered assuming the interaction with a CPT-odd axial vector background $b_\mu$. The quasi-relativistic Hamiltonian is obtained using a $1/c$-series expansion. Relativistic Dirac eigenstates in a spherically-symmetric potential are found accurate up to the second order in $b_0$. $b_0$-induced CPT-odd corrections to the electromagnetic dipole moment operators of a bound electron are calculated that contribute to the anapole moment of the atomic orbital and may cause a specific asymmetry of the angular distribution of the radiation of a hydrogen atom.
