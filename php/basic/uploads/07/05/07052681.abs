Title: On Z-graded loop Lie algebras, loop groups, and Toda equations
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: Toda equations associated with twisted loop groups are considered. Such equations are specified by Z-gradations of the corresponding twisted loop Lie algebras. The classification of Toda equations related to twisted loop Lie algebras with integrable Z-gradations is discussed.
