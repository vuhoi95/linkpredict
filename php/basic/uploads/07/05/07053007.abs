Title: A Generalization of Slavnov-Extended Non-Commutative Gauge Theories
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Stefan Hohenegger
Abstract: We consider a non-commutative U(1) gauge theory in 4 dimensions with a modified Slavnov term which looks similar to the 3-dimensional BF model. In choosing a space-like axial gauge fixing we find a new vector supersymmetry which is used to show that the model is free of UV/IR mixing problems, just as in the previously discussed model in arXiv:hep-th/0604154. Finally, we present generalizations of our proposed model to higher dimensions.
