Title: Symmetries,Singularities and the De-Emergence of Space
Authors: Thibault Damour and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: Recent work has revealed intriguing connections between a Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type analysis of spacelike singularities in General Relativity and certain infinite dimensional Lie algebras, and in particular the `maximally extended' hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra E10. In this essay we argue that these results may lead to an entirely new understanding of the (quantum) nature of space(-time) at the Planck scale, and hence -- via an effective `de-emergence' of space near a singularity -- to a novel mechanism for achieving background independence in quantum gravity.
