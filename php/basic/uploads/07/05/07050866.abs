Title: Infinite loop superalgebras of the Dirac theory on the Euclidean  Taub-NUT space
Authors: Ion I. Cotaescu and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The Dirac theory in the Euclidean Taub-NUT space gives rise to a large collection of conserved operators associated to genuine or hidden symmetries. They are involved in interesting algebraic structures as dynamical algebras or even infinite-dimensional algebras or superalgebras. One presents here the infinite-dimensional superalgebra specific to the Dirac theory in manifolds carrying the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole. It is shown that there exists an infinite-dimensional superalgebra that can be seen as a twisted loop superalgebra.
