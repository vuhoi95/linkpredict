Title: Quantum Gravity Boundary Terms from Spectral Action of Noncommutative  Space
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Alain Connes
Abstract: We study the boundary terms of the spectral action of the noncommutative space, defined by the spectral triple dictated by the physical spectrum of the standard model, unifying gravity with all other fundamental interactions. We prove that the spectral action predicts uniquely the gravitational boundary term required for consistency of quantum gravity with the correct sign and coefficient. This is a remarkable result given the lack of freedom in the spectral action to tune this term.
