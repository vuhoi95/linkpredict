Authors: Alexander Seel and Tanaya Bhattacharyya and Frank Göhmann and Andreas Klümper
Abstract: By considering the one-particle and two-particle scattering data of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain at T=0 we derive a continuum limit relating the spin chain to the 1D Bose gas. Applying this limit to the quantum transfer matrix approach of the Heisenberg chain we obtain expressions for the correlation functions of the Bose gas at arbitrary temperatures.
