Title: Star Product and Invariant Integration for Lie type Noncommutative  Spacetimes
Authors: Chryssomalis Chryssomalakos and Elias Okon
Abstract: We present a star product for noncommutative spaces of Lie type, including the so called ``canonical'' case by introducing a central generator, which is compatible with translations and admits a simple, manageable definition of an invariant integral. A quasi-cyclicity property for the latter is shown to hold, which reduces to exact cyclicity when the adjoint representation of the underlying Lie algebra is traceless. Several explicit examples illuminate the formalism, dealing with kappa-Minkowski spacetime and the Heisenberg algebra (``canonical'' noncommutative 2-plane).
