Title: Faddeev-Senjanovic Quantization of Supersymmetrical Electrodynamical  System
Authors: Yun-Guo Jiang and Yong-Chang Huang
Abstract: According to the method of path integral quantization for the canonical constrained system in Faddeev-Senjanovic scheme, we quantize the supersymmetrical electrodynamic system in general situation, and obtain the generating functional of Green function. Another first class constraint is obtained by making the linear combination of several primary constraints, the generator of gauge transformation is constructed, gauge transformations of the all different fields are deduced. Utilizing the consistency equation of gauge fixing condition we deduce another gauge fixing condition, and we find that the secondary constraint of the system is an Euler-Lagrange equation that is just electro-charge conversation law. Thus, we do not need to calculate the other secondary constraints step by step, and get no new constraints naturally. So, the Faddeev-Senjanovic path integral quantization of the supersymmetrical electrodynamical system is simplified.
