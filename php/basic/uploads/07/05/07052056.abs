Title: The Zeta-Function of a p-Adic Manifold, Dwork Theory for Physicists
Authors: Philip Candelas and Xenia de la Ossa
Abstract: In this article we review the observation, due originally to Dwork, that the zeta-function of an arithmetic variety, defined originally over the field with p elements, is a superdeterminant. We review this observation in the context of a one parameter family of quintic threefolds, and study the zeta-function as a function of the parameter \phi. Owing to cancellations, the superdeterminant of an infinite matrix reduces to the (ordinary) determinant of a finite matrix, U(\phi), corresponding to the action of the Frobenius map on certain cohomology groups. The parameter-dependence of U(\phi) is given by a relation U(\phi)=E^{-1}(\phi^p)U(0)E(\phi) with E(\phi) a Wronskian matrix formed from the periods of the manifold. The periods are defined by series that converge for $|\phi|_p < 1$. The values of \phi that are of interest are those for which \phi^p = \phi so, for nonzero \phi, we have |\vph|_p=1. We explain how the process of p-adic analytic continuation applies to this case. The matrix U(\phi) breaks up into submatrices of rank 4 and rank 2 and we are able from this perspective to explain some of the observations that have been made previously by numerical calculation.
