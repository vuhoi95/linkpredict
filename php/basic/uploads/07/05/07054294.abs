Title: On space-time noncommutative theories at finite temperature
Authors: A. V. Strelchenko and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We analyze renormalization and the high temperature expansion of the one-loop effective action of the space-time noncommutative \phi^4 theory by using the zeta function regularization in the imaginary time formalism (i.e., on S^1 x R^3). Interestingly enough, there are no mixed (non-planar) contributions to the counterterms as well as to the power-law high temperature asymptotics. We also study the Wick rotation and formulate assumptions under which the real and imaginary time formalisms are equivalent.
