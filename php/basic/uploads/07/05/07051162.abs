Title: Compactification in first order gravity
Authors: Rodrigo Aros and Mauricio Romo and Nelson Zamorano
Abstract: The Kaluza-Klein compactification process is applied in five dimensions to CS gravity, for the anti-de Sitter and Poincar\'e groups, using the first order formalism. In this context some solutions are found and analyzed. Also, the conserved charges associated to the solutions are computed.
