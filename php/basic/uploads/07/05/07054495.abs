Title: Single-brane world with stabilized extra dimension
Authors: Mikhail N. Smolyakov and Igor P. Volobuev
Abstract: We present a model describing a single brane with tension embedded into a five-dimensional space-time with compact extra dimension, which can be easily stabilized. We examine the linearized gravity in the model and obtain an expression for the four-dimensional Planck mass on the brane in terms of the model parameters. It is also shown that the scalar sector of the effective four-dimensional theory contain a tachyonic mode, and we discuss the problem of stability of the model.
