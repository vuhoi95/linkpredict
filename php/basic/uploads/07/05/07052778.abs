Title: The return of the four- and five-dimensional preons
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Jan Gutowski and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: We prove the existence of 3/4-BPS preons in four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravities by explicitly constructing them as smooth quotients of the AdS_4 and AdS_5 maximally supersymmetric backgrounds, respectively. This result illustrates how the spacetime topology resurrects a fraction of supersymmetry previously ruled out by the local analysis of the Killing spinor equations.
