Title: Spinor calculus for q-deformed quantum spaces II
Authors: Alexander Schmidt and Hartmut Wachter
Abstract: This is the second part of an article about q-deformed analogs of spinor calculus. The considerations refer to quantum spaces of physical interest, i.e. q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions as well as q-deformed Minkowski space. The Clifford algebras corresponding to these quantum spaces are treated. Especially, their commutation relations and their Hopf structures are written down. Bases of the four-dimensional Clifford algebras are constructed and their properties are discussed. Matrix representations of the Clifford algebras lead to q-deformed Dirac-matrices for the four-dimensional quantum spaces. Moreover, q-analogs of the four-dimensional spin matrices are presented. A very complete set of trace relations and rearrangement formulae concerning spin and Dirac-matrices is given. Dirac spinors together with their bilinear covariants are defined. Their behavior under q-deformed Lorentz transformation is discussed in detail.
