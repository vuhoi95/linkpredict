Abstract: We report on a precise computation of the topological charge distribution in the SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. It is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo simulations by employing the definition of the topological charge suggested by Neuberger's fermions. We observe significant deviations from a Gaussian distribution. Our results disfavour the theta behaviour of the vacuum energy predicted by instanton models, while they are compatible with the expectation from the large Nc expansion.
