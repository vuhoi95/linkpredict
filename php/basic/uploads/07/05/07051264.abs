Title: The generalized second law of thermodynamics in the accelerating  universe
Authors: Jia Zhou and Bin Wang and Yungui Gong and Elcio Abdalla
Abstract: We show that in the accelerating universe the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds only in the case where the enveloping surface is the apparent horizon, but not in the case of the event horizon. The present analysis relies on the most recent SNe Ia events, being model independent. Our study might suggest that event horizon is not a physical boundary from the point of view of thermodynamics.
