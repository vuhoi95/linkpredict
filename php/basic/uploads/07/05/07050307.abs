Title: Mass and Free energy in Thermodynamics of Squashed Kaluza-Klein Black  Holes
Authors: Yasunari Kurita and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: The Abbott-Deser mass, the Hamiltonian and the Komar mass of the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed horizons take different values. Introducing a new couple of thermodynamic variables for the Komar mass, we show that each mass can be interpreted as a thermodynamic potential with its own natural variables, i.e. all masses are related to each other by the Legendre transformations. It is found that the new variables and the gravitational tension represent the squashing of the outer horizon.
