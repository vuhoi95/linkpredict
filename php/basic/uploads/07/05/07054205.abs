Title: Non-Commutative U(1) Gauge Theory on R**4 with Oscillator Term and BRST  Symmetry
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Harald Grosse and Manfred Schweda
Abstract: Inspired by the renormalizability of the non-commutative Phi^4 model with added oscillator term, we formulate a non-commutative gauge theory, where the oscillator enters as a gauge fixing term in a BRST invariant manner. All propagators turn out to be essentially given by the Mehler kernel and the bilinear part of the action is invariant under the Langmann-Szabo duality. The model is a promising candidate for a renormalizable non-commutative U(1) gauge theory.
