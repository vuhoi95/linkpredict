Title: Aspects of open strings in Rindler Space
Authors: David Berenstein and Hee-Joong Chung
Abstract: We study open string configurations in Rindler space suspended from D-branes at finite distance from the Rindler horizon. This is a toy model for strings in the near horizon region of a black hole and has applications for the study of strings configurations of heavy quarks in the AdS/CFT duals of hot field theories, as well as other applications to the study of open strings ending on giant gravitons. We find that this setup produces very similar results to those that have been found in the AdS black hole setup, but it is much more tractable analytically. We also comment on some quantum applications of our studies to the understanding of the spectrum of strings ending on giant gravitons.
