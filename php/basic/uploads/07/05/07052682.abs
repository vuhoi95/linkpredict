Title: Phase Transition of Electrically Charged Ricci-flat Black Holes
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta
Abstract: We study phase transition between electrically charged Ricci-flat black holes and AdS soliton spacetime of Horowitz and Myers in five dimensions. Boundary topology for both of them is $S^1 \times S^1 \times R^2$. We consider Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and R-charged black holes and find that phase transition of these black holes to AdS soliton spacetime depends on the relative size of two boundary circles. We also perform the stability analysis for these black holes. In order to use the AdS/CFT correspondence, we work in the grand canonical ensemble.
