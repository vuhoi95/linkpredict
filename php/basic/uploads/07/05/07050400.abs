Title: Kinetic k-essence and Quintessence
Authors: Roland de Putter and Eric V. Linder
Abstract: Dark energy models with non-canonical kinetic energy terms, k-essence, can have dynamical and sound speed properties distinct from canonical scalar fields, quintessence. Concentrating on purely kinetic term Lagrangians, which can be technically natural, we investigate limits on the equation of state dynamics and sound speed behaviors and the extent to which these models can be separated from quintessence.
