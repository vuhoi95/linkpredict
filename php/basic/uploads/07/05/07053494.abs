Title: Fluxes of Higher-spin Currents and Hawking Radiations from Charged Black  Holes
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Takeshi Morita and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: This is an extended version of the previous paper (hep-th/0701272). Quantum fields near horizons can be described in terms of an infinite set of two-dimensional conformal fields. We first generalize the method of Christensen and Fulling to charged black holes to derive fluxes of energy and charge. These fluxes can be obtained by employing a conformal field theory technique. We then apply this technique to obtain the fluxes of higher-spin currents and show that the thermal distribution of Hawking radiation from a charged black hole can be completely reproduced by investigating transformation properties of the higher-spin currents under conformal and gauge transformations.
