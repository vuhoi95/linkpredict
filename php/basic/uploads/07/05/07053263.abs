Title: Chiral Anomaly Beyond Lorentz Invariance
Authors: P. Arias and H. Falomir and J. Gamboa and F. Mendez and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: The chiral anomaly in the context of an extended standard model with minimal Lorentz invariance violation is studied. Taking into account bounds from measurements of the speed of light, we argue that the chiral anomaly and its consequences are general results valid even beyond the relativistic symmetry.
