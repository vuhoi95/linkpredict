Title: Coherent states for Hamiltonians generated by supersymmetry
Authors: David J. Fernandez C and Veronique Hussin and Oscar Rosas-Ortiz
Abstract: Coherent states are derived for one-dimensional systems generated by supersymmetry from an initial Hamiltonian with a purely discrete spectrum for which the levels depend analytically on their subindex. It is shown that the algebra of the initial system is inherited by its SUSY partners in the subspace associated to the isospectral part or the spectrum. The technique is applied to the harmonic oscillator, infinite well and trigonometric Poeschl-Teller potentials.
