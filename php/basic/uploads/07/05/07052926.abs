Abstract: The cross-couplings among several Weyl gravitons (described in the free limit by a sum of linearized Weyl actions) in the presence of a scalar field are studied with the help of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. Under the hypotheses of locality, smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, Poincare invariance, (background) Lorentz invariance, and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, together with the supplementary assumption that the internal metric defined by the sum of Weyl lagrangians is positively defined, we prove that there are no consistent cross-interactions among different Weyl gravitons in the presence of a scalar field. The couplings of a single Weyl graviton to a scalar field are also discussed.
