Title: New non-local SUSY KdV conservation laws from a recursive gradient  algorithm
Authors: S. Andrea and A. Restuccia and A. Sotomayor
Abstract: A complete proof of the recursive gradient approach is presented. It gives a construction of all the hierarchy structures of N=1 Super KdV, including the non-local one. A precise definition of the ring of superfields involved in the non-local construction is given. In particular, new non-local conserved quantities of N=1 Super KdV are found.
