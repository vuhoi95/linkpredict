Title: Integrable discrete Schrodinger equations and a characterization of Prym  varieties by a pair of quadrisecants
Authors: Samuel Grushevsky and Igor Krichever
Abstract: We prove that Prym varieties are characterized geometrically by the existence of a symmetric pair of quadrisecant planes of the associated Kummer variety. We also show that Prym varieties are characterized by certain (new) theta-functional equations. For this purpose we construct and study a difference-differential analog of the Novikov-Veselov hierarchy.
