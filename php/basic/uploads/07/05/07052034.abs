Abstract: We develop an stochastic approach to study gravitational waves produced during the inflationary epoch under the presence of a decaying cosmological parameter, on a 5D geometrical background which is Riemann flat. We obtain that the squared tensor metric fluctuations depend strongly on the cosmological parameter $\Lambda (t)$ and we finally illustrate the formalism with an example of a decaying $\Lambda(t)$.
