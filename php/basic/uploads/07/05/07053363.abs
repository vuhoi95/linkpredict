Title: The Holographic Interpretation of Hawking Radiation
Authors: Alessandro Fabbri and Giovanni Paolo Procopio
Abstract: Holography gives us a tool to view the Hawking effect from a new, classical perspective. In the context of Randall-Sundrum braneworld models, we show that the basic features of four-dimensional evaporating solutions are nicely translated into classical five-dimensional language. This includes the dual bulk description of particles tunneling through the horizon.
