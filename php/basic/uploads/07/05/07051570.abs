Title: Interior of Distorted Black Holes
Authors: Valeri P. Frolov and Andrey A. Shoom
Abstract: We study the interior of distorted static axisymmetric black holes. We obtain a general interior solution and study its asymptotics both near the horizon and singularity. As a special example, we apply the obtained results to the case of the so-called `caged' black holes.
