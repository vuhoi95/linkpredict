Title: Gauge Mediation with D-term SUSY Breaking
Authors: Y. Nakayama and Masato Taki and Taizan Watari and T. T. Yanagida
Abstract: We construct a gauge-mediation model with a D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. R-symmetry breaking necessary for generating the SUSY standard-model gaugino masses is given by gaugino condensation of a strongly coupled gauge theory in the hidden sector. The energy scale of the strong dynamics of the hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible embeddings of the model in string theory are also discussed.
