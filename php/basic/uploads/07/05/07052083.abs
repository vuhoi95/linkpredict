Title: Solution Of Wheeler-De Witt Equation, Potential Well And Tunnel Effect
Authors: Yong-Chang Huang and Gang Weng
Abstract: This paper uses the relation of the cosmic scale factor and scalar field to solve Wheeler-DeWitt equation, gives the tunnel effect of the cosmic scale factor a and quantum potential well of scalar field, and makes it fit with the physics of cosmic quantum birth. By solving Wheeler-DeWitt equation we achieve a general probability distribution of the cosmic birth, and give the analysis of cosmic quantum birth.
