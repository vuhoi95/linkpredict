Title: Adding Charges to N=4 Dyons
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Dileep P. Jatkar and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: The spectrum of dyons in a class of N=4 supersymmetric string theories has been found for a specific set of electric and magnetic charge vectors. We extend the analysis to more general charge vectors by considering various charge carrying collective excitations of the original system.
