Title: From bubbles to foam: dilute to dense evolution of hadronic wave  function at high energy
Authors: Alex Kovner and Michael Lublinsky and Urs Wiedemann
Abstract: We derive the evolution of a hadronic light cone wave function with energy at weak coupling. Our derivation is valid both in the high and the low partonic density limit, and thus encompasses both the JIMWLK and the KLWMIJ evolution. The hadronic wave function is shown to evolve by the action of the Bogoliubov-type operator, which diagonalizes on the soft gluon sector the light-cone hamiltonian in the presence of an arbitrary valence charge density. We find explicitly the action of this operator on the soft as well as the valence degrees of freedom of the theory.
