Title: SYM N=4 in light-cone gauge and the "bridge" identities
Authors: A. Bassetto and G. De Pol
Abstract: The light-cone gauge allows to single out a set of ``transverse'' fields (TF), whose Green functions are free from UV divergences in SYM N=4. Green functions with external lines involving the remaining fields do instead exhibit divergences: indeed those fields can be expressed, by solving their equations of motion, as composite operators in terms of ``transverse'' fields. A set of exact identities (bridge identities) automatically realize their insertions in a path-integral formulation.
