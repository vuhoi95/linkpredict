Title: Multi-center MICZ-Kepler systems
Authors: Armen Nersessian and Vadim Ohanyan
Abstract: We present the classical solutions of the two-center MICZ-Kepler and MICZ-Kepler-Stark systems. Then we suggest the model of multi-center MICZ-Kepler system on the curved spaces equipped with $so(3)$-invariant conformal flat metrics.
