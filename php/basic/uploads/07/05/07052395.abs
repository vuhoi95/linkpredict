Title: Faddeev-Jackiw Quantization of the Gauge Invariant Self-dual Fields  Relative to String Theory
Authors: Leng Liao and Yong-Chang Huang
Abstract: We obtain a new symplectic Lagrangian density and deduce Faddeev-Jackiw (FJ) generalized brackets of the gauge invariant self-dual fields interacting with gauge fields. We further give FJ quantization of this system. Furthermore, the FJ method is compared with Dirac method, the results show the two methods are equivalent in the quantization of this system. And by the practical research in this letter, it can be found that the FJ method is really simpler than the Dirac method, namely, the FJ method obviates the need to distinguish primary and secondary constraints and first- and second-class constraints. Therefore, the FJ method is a more economical and effective method of quantization.
