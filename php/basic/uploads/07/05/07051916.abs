Title: Disk Partition Function and Oscillatory Rolling Tachyons
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matti Jarvinen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Jaydeep Majumder
Abstract: An exact cubic open string field theory rolling tachyon solution was recently found by Kiermaier et. al. and Schnabl. This oscillatory solution has been argued to be related by a field redefinition to the simple exponential rolling tachyon deformation of boundary conformal theory. In the latter approach, the disk partition function takes a simple form. Out of curiosity, we compute the disk partition function for an oscillatory tachyon profile, and find that the result is nevertheless almost the same.
