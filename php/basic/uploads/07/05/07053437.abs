Abstract: We extend the complete Mellin (CM) representation of Feynman amplitudes to the non-commutative quantum field theories. This representation is a versatile tool. It provides a quick proof of meromorphy of Feynman amplitudes in parameters such as the dimension of space-time. In particular it paves the road for the dimensional renormalization of these theories. This complete Mellin representation also allows the study of asymptotic behavior under rescaling of arbitrary subsets of external invariants of any Feynman amplitude.
