Title: On the physical meaning of the Unruh effect
Authors: Emil T. Akhmedov and Douglas Singleton
Abstract: We present simple arguments that detectors moving with constant acceleration (even acceleration for a finite time) should detect particles. The effect is seen to be universal. Moreover, detectors undergoing linear acceleration and uniform, circular motion both detect particles for the same physical reason. We show that if one uses a circularly orbiting electron in a constant external magnetic field as the Unruh--DeWitt detector, then the Unruh effect physically coincides with the experimentally verified Sokolov--Ternov effect.
