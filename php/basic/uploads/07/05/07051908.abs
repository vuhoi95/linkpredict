Title: Self-similarity for V-shaped field potentials - further examples
Authors: H. Arod≈∫ and P. Klimas and T. Tyranowski
Abstract: Three new models with V-shaped field potentials $U$ are considered: a complex scalar field $X$ in 1+1 dimensions with $U(X)= |X|$, a real scalar field $\Phi$ in 2+1 dimensions with $U(\Phi) = |\Phi|$, and a real scalar field $\phi$ in 1+1 dimensions with $U{\phi) = \phi \Theta(\phi)$ where $\Theta$ is the step function. Several explicit, self-similar solutions are found. They describe interesting dynamical processes, for example, `freezing' a string in a static configuration.
