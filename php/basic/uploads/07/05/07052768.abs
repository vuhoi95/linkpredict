Title: Euclidean Wormholes in String Theory
Authors: Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jacopo Orgera and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We show that toroidal compactification of type II string theory to six dimensions admits axionic euclidean wormhole solutions. These wormholes can be inserted into $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ backgrounds, which have a well-defined CFT dual. AdS/CFT duality then suggests that the wormhole solutions cannot be interpreted using $\alpha$ parameters as originally suggested by Coleman.
