Title: Geometry of non-supersymmetric three-charge bound states
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Thomas S. Levi and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We study the smooth non-supersymmetric three-charge microstates of Jejjala, Madden, Ross and Titchener [hep-th/0504181] using Kaluza-Klein reductions of the solutions to five and four dimensions. Our aim is to improve our understanding of the relation between these non-supersymmetric solutions and the well-studied supersymmetric cases. We find some surprising qualitative differences. In the five-dimensional description, the solution has orbifold fixed points which break supersymmetry locally, so the geometries cannot be thought of as made up of separate half-BPS centers. In the four-dimensional description, the two singularities in the geometry are connected by a conical singularity, which makes it impossible to treat them independently and assign unambiguous brane charges to these centers.
