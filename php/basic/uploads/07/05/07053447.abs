Title: Dirac equation exact solutions for generalized asymmetrical Hartmann  potentials
Authors: Alvaro de Souza Dutra and M. B. Hott
Abstract: In this work we solve the Dirac equation by constructing the exact bound state solutions for a mixing of vector and scalar generalized Hartmann potentials. This is done provided the vector potential is equal to or minus the scalar potential. The cases of some quasi-exactly solvable and Morse-like potentials are briefly commented.
