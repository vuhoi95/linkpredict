Title: Kappa-Minkowski space-time and the star product realizations
Authors: S. Meljanac and A. Samsarov and M. Stojic and K. S. Gupta
Abstract: We investigate a Lie algebra-type $ \kappa$-deformed Minkowski space-time with undeformed Lorentz algebra and mutually commutative vector-like Dirac derivatives. There are infinitely many realizations of $ \kappa$-Minkowski space. The coproduct and the star product corresponding to each of them are found. Utilizing the properties of the {\em{natural}} realization, we construct a scalar field theory on $ \kappa$-deformed Minkowski space and show that it is equivalent to the scalar, nonlocal, relativistically invariant field theory on the ordinary Minkowski space.
