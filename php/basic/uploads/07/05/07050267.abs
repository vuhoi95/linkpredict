Title: Eternal Inflation is "Expensive"
Authors: L. Mersini-Houghton and L. Parker
Abstract: The discovery of the string theory landscape has recently brought attention to the eternal nature of inflation. In contrast to the common belief that eternal inflation may be a generic feature of most inflationary models, in this note we argue that the suppressed amplitude of perturbations due to adiabatic regularization, together with a fine-tuning constraint on the equation of state of the rare inflating pockets with large fluctuations, render eternal inflation expensive in energy and may make it unlikely to occur. The energy scales of the eternally inflating pockets have to be very close to the transplanckian regime in order to compensate for the suppression of regularized perturbations.
