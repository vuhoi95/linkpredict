Title: Boundary Conformal Field Theory and Ribbon Graphs: a tool for  open/closed string dualities
Authors: Mauro Carfora and Claudio Dappiaggi and Valeria L. Gili
Abstract: We construct and fully characterize a scalar boundary conformal field theory on a triangulated Riemann surface. The results are analyzed from a string theory perspective as tools to deal with open/closed string dualities.
