Title: The maximal D=4 supergravities
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Henning Samtleben and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: All maximal supergravities in four space-time dimensions are presented. The ungauged Lagrangians can be encoded in an E_7(7)\Sp(56,R)/GL(28) matrix associated with the freedom of performing electric/magnetic duality transformations. The gauging is defined in terms of an embedding tensor which encodes the subgroup of E_7(7) that is realized as a local invariance. This embedding tensor may imply the presence of magnetic charges which require corresponding dual gauge fields. The latter can be incorporated by using a recently proposed formulation that involves tensor gauge fields in the adjoint representation of E_7(7). In this formulation the results take a universal form irrespective of the electric/magnetic duality basis. We present the general class of supersymmetric and gauge invariant Lagrangians and discuss a number of applications.
