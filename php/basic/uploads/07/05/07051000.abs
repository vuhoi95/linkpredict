Title: The Measurement of Time
Authors: A. Boyarsky and P Gora
Abstract: We present a definition of time measurement based on high energy photons and the fundamental length scale, and show that, for macroscopic time, it is in accord with the Lorentz transformation of special relativity. To do this we define observer in a different way than in special relativity.
