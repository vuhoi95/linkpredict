Title: Fourier analysis on the affine group, quantization and noncompact Connes  geometries
Authors: Victor Gayral and Jose M. Gracia-Bondia and Joseph C. Varilly
Abstract: We find the Stratonovich-Weyl quantizer for the nonunimodular affine group of the line. A noncommutative product of functions on the half-plane, underlying a noncompact spectral triple in the sense of Connes, is obtained from it. The corresponding Wigner functions reproduce the time-frequency distributions of signal processing. The same construction leads to scalar Fourier transformations on the affine group, simplifying and extending the Fourier transformation proposed by Kirillov.
