Title: Chern-Simons AdS_5 supergravity in a Randall-Sundrum background
Authors: Richard S. Garavuso and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: Chern-Simons AdS supergravity theories are gauge theories for the super-AdS group. These theories possess a fermionic symmetry which differs from standard supersymmetry. In this paper, we study five-dimensional Chern-Simons AdS supergravity in a Randall-Sundrum scenario with two Minkowski 3-branes. After making modifications to the D = 5 Chern-Simons AdS supergravity action and fermionic symmetry transformations, we obtain a Z_2-invariant total action S = \tilde{S}_bulk + S_brane and fermionic transformations \tilde{\delta}_\epsilon. While \tilde{\delta}_\epsilon \tilde{S}_bulk = 0, the fermionic symmetry is broken by S_brane. Our total action reduces to the original Randall-Sundrum model when \tilde{S}_bulk is restricted to its gravitational sector. We solve the Killing spinor equations for a bosonic configuration with vanishing su(N) and u(1) gauge fields.
