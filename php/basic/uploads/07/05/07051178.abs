Title: A global picture of quantum de Sitter space
Authors: Steven B. Giddings and Donald Marolf
Abstract: Perturbative gravity about a de Sitter background motivates a global picture of quantum dynamics in `eternal de Sitter space,' the theory of states which are asymptotically de Sitter to both future and past. Eternal de Sitter physics is described by a finite dimensional Hilbert space in which each state is precisely invariant under the full de Sitter group. This resolves a previously-noted tension between de Sitter symmetry and finite entropy. Observables, implications for Boltzmann brains, and Poincare recurrences are briefly discussed.
