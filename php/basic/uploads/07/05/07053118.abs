Authors: O. Bertolami and F. Gil Pedro and M. Le Delliou
Abstract: We discuss the current bounds on the Equivalence Principle, in particular from structure formation and, reexamine in this context, the recent claim on the evidence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy in the Abell Cluster A586 and the ensued violation of the Equivalence Principle.
