Title: Pseudo-Complex Field Theory
Authors: Peter O. Hess and Walter Greiner
Abstract: A new formulation of field theory is presented, based on a pseudo-complex description. An extended group structure is introduced, implying a minimal scalar length, rendering the theory regularized a la Pauli-Villars. Cross sections are calculated for the scattering of an electron at an external Coulomb field and the Compton scattering. Deviations due to a smallest scalar length are determined. The theory also permits a modification of the minimal coupling scheme, resulting in a generalized dispersion relation. A shift of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin-limit (GZK) of the cosmic ray spectrum is the consequence.
