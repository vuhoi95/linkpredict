Title: N=8 non-BPS Attractors, Fixed Scalars and Magic Supergravities
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Marrani
Abstract: We analyze the Hessian matrix of the black hole potential of N=8, d=4 supergravity, and determine its rank at non-BPS critical points, relating the resulting spectrum to non-BPS solutions (with non-vanishing central charge) of N=2, d=4 magic supergravities and their ``mirror'' duals. We find agreement with the known degeneracy splitting of N=2 non-BPS spectrum of generic special Kahler geometries with cubic holomorphic prepotential. We also relate non-BPS critical points with vanishing central charge in N=2 magic supergravities to a particular reduction of the N=8, 1/8-BPS critical points.
