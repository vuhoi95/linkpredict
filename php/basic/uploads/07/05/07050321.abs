Title: The Four-Loop Dressing Phase of N=4 SYM
Authors: N. Beisert and T. McLoughlin and R. Roiban
Abstract: We compute the dilatation generator in the su(2) sector of planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at four-loops. We use the known world-sheet scattering matrix to constrain the structure of the generator. The remaining few coefficients can be computed directly from Feynman diagrams. This allows us to confirm previous conjectures for the leading contribution to the dressing phase which is proportional to zeta(3).
