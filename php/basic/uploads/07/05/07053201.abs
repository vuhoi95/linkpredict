Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Itai Ryb and Rikard von Unge and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We introduce two new N = (2, 2) vector multiplets that couple naturally to generalized Kahler geometries. We describe their kinetic actions as well as their matter couplings both in N = (2, 2) and N = (1, 1) superspace.
