Title: Interactions of Unparticles with Standard Model Particles
Authors: Shao-Long Chen and Xiao-Gang He
Abstract: We study interactions of unparticles ${\cal {U}}$ of dimension $d_{\cal {U}}$ due to Georgi with Standard Model (SM) fields through effective operators. The unparticles describe the low energy physics of a non-trivial scale invariant sector. Since unparticles come from beyond the SM physics, it is plausible that they transform as a singlet under the SM gauge group. This helps tremendously in limiting possible interactions. We analyze interactions of scalar ${\cal {U}}$, vector ${\cal {U}}$$^\mu$ and spinor ${\cal {U}}$$^s$ unparticles with SM fields and derivatives up to dimension four. Using these operators, we discuss different features of producing unparticles at $e^+ e^-$ collider and other phenomenologies. It is possible to distinguish different unparticles produced at $e^+e^-$ collider by looking at various distributions of production cross sections.
