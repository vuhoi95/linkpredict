Title: Dual Spikes; New Spiky String Solutions
Authors: A. E. Mosaffa and B. Safarzadeh
Abstract: We find a new class of spiky solutions for closed strings in flat, $AdS_3\subset AdS_5$ and $R\times S^2(\subset S^5)$ backgrounds. In the flat case the new solutions turn out to be T-dual configurations of spiky strings found by Kruczenski hep-th/0410226. In the case of solutions living in $AdS$, we make a semi classical analysis by taking the large angular momentum limit. The anomalous dimension for these dual spikes is similar to that for rotating and pulsating circular strings in AdS with angular momentum playing the role of the level number. This replaces the well known logarithmic dependence for spinning strings. For the dual spikes living on sphere we find that no large angular momentum limit exists.
