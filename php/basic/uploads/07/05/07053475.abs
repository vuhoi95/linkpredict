Title: Gauge invariant metric fluctuations in the early universe from STM  theory of gravity: nonperturbative formalism
Authors: Mariano Anabitarte and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We develop a nonperturbative quantum field formalism to describe scalar gauge-invariant metric flucturations in the early universe from a 5D apparent (Ricci flat) vacuum.
