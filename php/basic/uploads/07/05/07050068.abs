Title: Inflation in minimal left-right symmetric model with spontaneous  D-parity breaking
Authors: Jinn-Ouk Gong and Narendra Sahu
Abstract: We present a simplest inflationary scenario in the minimal left-right symmetric model with spontaneous D-parity breaking, which is a well motivated particle physics model for neutrino masses. This leads us to connect the observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background to the sub-eV neutrino masses. The baryon asymmetry via the leptogenesis route is also discussed briefly.
