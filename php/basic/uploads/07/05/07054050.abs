Abstract: The anomaly found by Callan and Harvey is shown to be cancelled in a three-dimensional noncommutative gauge theory coupled to a fermion with a mass function depending on one spatial coordinate (domain wall mass). This evaluation has been done for the fermion in the fundamental and adjoint representations of the gauge group in the limit of small noncommutativity $\theta$ parameter.
