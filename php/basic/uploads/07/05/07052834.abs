Abstract: According to Two-Time Physics, there is more to space-time than can be garnered with the ordinary formulation of physics. Two-Time Physics has shown that the Standard Model of Particles and Forces is successfully reproduced by a two-time field theory in 4 space and 2 time dimensions projected as a holographic image on an emergent spacetime in 3+1 dimensions. Among the successes of this approach is the resolution of the strong CP problem of QCD as an outcome of the restrictions imposed by the higher symmetry structures in 4+2 dimensions. In this paper we launch a program to construct the duals of the Standard Model as other holographic images of the same 4+2 dimensional theory on a variety of emergent spacetimes in 3+1 dimensions. These dual field theories are obtained as a family of gauge choices in the master 4+2 field theory. In the present paper we deal with some of the simpler gauge choices which lead to interacting Klein-Gordon field theories for the conformal scalar with a predicted SO(d,2) symmetry in a variety of interesting curved spacetimes in (d-1)+1 dimensions. More challenging and more interesting gauge choices (including some that relate to mass) which are left to future work are also outlined. Through this approach we discover a new realm of previously unexplored dualities and hidden symmetries that exist both in the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, at the classical and quantum levels. Such phenomena predicted by 2T-physics can in principle be confirmed both by theory and experiment. 1T-physics can be used to analyze the predictions but in most instances gives no clue that the predicted phenomena exist in the first place. This point of view suggests a new paradigm for the construction of a fundamental theory that is likely to impact on the quest for unification.
