Title: Linear Relations and their Breakdown in High Energy Massive String  Scatterings in Compact Spaces
Authors: Jen-Chi Lee and Yi Yang
Abstract: We calculate high energy massive scattering amplitudes of closed bosonic string compactified on the torus. For each fixed mass level with given quantized and winding momenta ((m/R),(1/2)nR), we obtain infinite linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes of different string states. For some kinematic regimes, we discover that linear relations with N_{R}=N_{L} break down and, simultaneously, the amplitudes enhance to power-law behavior instead of the usual expoential fall-off behavior at high energies. It is the space-time T-duality symmetry that plays a role here. This result is consistent with the coexistence of the linear relations and the softer exponential fall-off behavior of high energy string scattering amplitudes as we pointed out prevously. It is also reminiscent of our previous work on the power-law behavior of high energy string/domain-wall scatterings.
