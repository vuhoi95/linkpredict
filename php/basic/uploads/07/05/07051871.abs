Title: Quantization of Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theory
Authors: S. L. Lyakhovich and A. A. Sharapov
Abstract: A covariant path-integral quantization is proposed for the non-Lagrangian gauge theory described by the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau equation. The corresponding partition function is shown to admit a nice path-integral representation in terms of the gauged G/G K\"ahler WZW model. A relationship with the $J$-formulation of the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills theory is explored.
