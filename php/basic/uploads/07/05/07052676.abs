Title: Observe the open universe in the sky?
Authors: Hong-Guang Zhang and Jie Ren and Xin-He Meng
Abstract: We first review the related works on the observable consequence of landscape and the regulation of e-foldings during inflation. We focus on a branch of observable consequence of landscape which predicts an open universe with negative curvature if e-foldings $N>62$. After discussing the observable regulation from the aspect by Kaloper, Kleban and Sorbo, we make an argument that in the non-flat background the observable $N$ is suppressed by a factor $k/\rho_{0}$. We point out that this seems to detect the information where e-foldings $N>62$ possibly. Finally, we discuss our outcomes with the recent work by Arkani-Hamed et al.
