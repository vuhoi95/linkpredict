Title: Spinor calculus for q-deformed quantum spaces I
Authors: Alexander Schmidt and Hartmut Wachter
Abstract: The article is dedicated to q-deformed versions of spinor calculus. As a kind of review, the most relevant properties of the two-dimensional quantum plane are summarized. Additionally, the relationship between the quantum plane and higher-dimensional quantum spaces like the q-deformed Euclidean space in four dimensions or the q-deformed Minkowski space is outlined. These considerations are continued by introducing q-analogs of the Pauli matrices. Their main properties are discussed in detail and numerous relations that could prove useful in physical applications are presented. In this respect, q-deformed versions of the important Fierz identities are written down.
