Title: Black hole analogues in braneworld scenario
Authors: Xian-Hui Ge and Sung-Won Kim
Abstract: We construct analogue black hole solutions in the braneworld scenario. The quantum fluctuations of condensate gravitons propagating around a $4+n$-dimensional gravitational potential are found yielding a metric similar to higher dimensional Schwarzschild black hole line-element. Black hole analogue solutions in Randall-Sundrum and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati brane world models are also constructed. The properties of such black hole analogues are discussed.
