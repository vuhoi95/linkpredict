Title: Holographic approach to a minimal Higgsless model
Authors: R. Casalbuoni and S. De Curtis and D. Dominici and D. Dolce
Abstract: In this work, following an holographic approach, we carry out a low energy effective study of a minimal Higgsless model based on SU(2) bulk symmetry broken by boundary conditions, both in flat and warped metric. The holographic procedure turns out to be an useful computation technique to achieve an effective four dimensional formulation of the model taking into account the corrections coming from the extra dimensional sector. This technique is used to compute both oblique and direct contributions to the electroweak parameters in presence of fermions delocalized along the fifth dimension.
