Title: Dissipative Hofstadter Model at the Magic Points and Critical Boundary  Sine-Gordon Model
Authors: Seungmuk Ji and Ja-Yong Koo and Taejin Lee
Abstract: The dissipative Hofstadter model describes quantum particles moving in two dimensions subject to a uniform magnetic field, a periodic potential and a dissipative force. We discuss the dissipative Hofstadter model in the framework of the boundary state formulation in string theory and construct exact boundary states for the model at the magic points by using the fermion representation. The dissipative Hofstadter model at magic points is shown to be equivalent to the critical boundary sine-Gordon model.
