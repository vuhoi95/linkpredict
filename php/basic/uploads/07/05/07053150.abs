Title: On Hawking radiation from black rings
Authors: Umpei Miyamoto and Keiju Murata
Abstract: We calculate the quantum radiation from the five dimensional charged rotating black rings by demanding the radiation to eliminate the possible anomalies on the horizons. It is shown that the temperature, energy flux and angular-momentum flux exactly coincide with those of the Hawking radiation. The black rings considered in this paper contain the Myers-Perry black hole as a limit and the quantum radiation for this black hole, obtained in the literature, is recovered in the limit. The results support the picture that the Hawking radiation can be regarded as the anomaly eliminator on horizons and suggest its general applicability to the higher-dimensional black holes discovered recently.
