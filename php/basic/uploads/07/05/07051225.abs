Title: Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole with a global  monopole via gravitational anomaly
Authors: Jun-Jin Peng and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: Hawking flux from the Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole is obtained by using Robinson and Wilczek's method. Adopting a dimension reduction technique, the effective quantum field in the (3+1)--dimensional global monopole background can be described by an infinite collection of the (1+1)--dimensional massless fields if neglecting the ingoing modes near the horizon, where the gravitational anomaly can be cancelled by the (1+1)--dimensional black body radiation at the Hawking temperature.
