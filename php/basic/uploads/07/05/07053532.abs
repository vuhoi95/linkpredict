Title: Deformation of Super Yang-Mills Theories in R-R 3-form Background
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Hiroaki Nakajima and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study deformation of N=2 and N=4 super Yang-Mills theories, which are obtained as the low-energy effective theories on the (fractional) D3-branes in the presence of constant Ramond-Ramond 3-form background. We calculate the Lagrangian at the second order in the deformation parameter from open string disk amplitudes. In N=4 case we find that all supersymmetries are broken for generic deformation parameter but part of supersymmetries are unbroken for special case. We also find that classical vacua admit fuzzy sphere configuration. In N=2 case we determine the deformed supersymmetries. We rewrite the deformed Lagrangians in terms of N=1 superspace, where the deformation is interpreted as that of coupling constants.
