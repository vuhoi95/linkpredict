Abstract: Consistent couplings between a massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry of the Riemann tensor and a massless vector field are analyzed in the framework of Lagrangian BRST cohomology. Under the assumptions on smoothness, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with the requirement that the interacting Lagrangian is at most second-order derivative, it is proved that there are no consistent cross-interactions between a single massless tensor field with the mixed symmetry of the Riemann tensor and one massless vector field.
