Title: Cosmology with Twisted Tori
Authors: Josef L. P. Karthauser and P. M. Saffin and Mark Hindmarsh
Abstract: We consider the cosmological role of the scalar fields generated by the compactification of 11-dimensional Einstein gravity on a 7D elliptic twisted torus, which has the attractive features of giving rise to a positive semi-definite potential, and partially fixing the moduli. This compactification is therefore relevant for low energy M-theory, 11D supergravity. We find that slow-roll inflation with the moduli is not possible, but that there is a novel scaling solution in Friedmann cosmologies in which the massive moduli oscillate but maintain a constant energy density relative to the background barotropic fluid.
