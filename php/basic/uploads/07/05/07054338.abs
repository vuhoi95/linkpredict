Title: Vector and Spinor Decomposition of SU(2) Gauge Potential, their  quivalence and Knot Structure in SU(2) Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: Yi-Shi Duan and Ji-Rong Ren and Ran Li
Abstract: In this paper, spinor and vector decomposition of SU(2) gauge potential are presented and their equivalence is constructed using a simply proposal. We also obtain the action of Faddeev nonlinear O(3) sigma model from the SU(2) massive gauge field theory which is proposed according to the gauge invariant principle. At last, the knot structure in SU(2) Chern-Simons filed theory is discussed in terms of the $\phi$--mapping topological current theory. The topological charge of the knot is characterized by the Hopf indices and the Brouwer degrees of $\phi$-mapping.
