Title: Dimensional Duality
Authors: Daniel Green and Albion Lawrence and John McGreevy and David R. Morrison and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We show that string theory on a compact negatively curved manifold, preserving a U(1)^{b_1} winding symmetry, grows at least b_1 new effective dimensions as the space shrinks. The winding currents yield a "D-dual" description of a Riemann surface of genus h in terms of its 2h dimensional Jacobian torus, perturbed by a closed string tachyon arising as a potential energy term in the worldsheet sigma model. D-branes on such negatively curved manifolds also reveal this structure, with a classical moduli space consisting of a b_1-torus. In particular, we present an AdS/CFT system which offers a non-perturbative formulation of such supercritical backgrounds. Finally, we discuss generalizations of this new string duality.
