Title: Twist 3 of the sl(2) sector of N=4 SYM and reciprocity respecting  evolution
Authors: M. Beccaria and Yu. L. Dokshitzer and G. Marchesini
Abstract: We consider the bosonic sl(2) sector of the maximally supersymmetric N=4 SYM model and show that anomalous dimension of the twist-3 single-trace composite operators built of scalar fields, recently calculated up to the four-loop order, can be generated by a compact reciprocity respecting evolution kernel.
