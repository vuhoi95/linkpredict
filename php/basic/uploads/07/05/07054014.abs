Abstract: We consider a thick brane model supported by two interacting scalar fields in 7D and 8D general relativity. Using the special type of a potential energy, we obtain numerically the regular asymptotically flat vacuum solutions. A possibility of obtaining the similar solutions for an arbitrary number of the extra spatial dimensions is estimated.
