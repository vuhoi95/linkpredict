Title: Boosted Black Holes on Kaluza-Klein Bubbles
Authors: Hideo Iguchi and Takashi Mishima and Shinya Tomizawa
Abstract: We construct an exact stationary solution of black hole -- bubble sequence in the five dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory by using solitonic solution generating techniques. The solution describes two boosted black holes with topology S^3 on a Kaluza-Klein bubble and has a linear momentum component in the compactified direction. The ADM mass and the linear momentum depend on the two boosted velocity parameters of black holes. In the effective four dimensional theory, the solution has an electric charge which is proportional to the linear momentum. The solution includes the static solution found by Elvang and Horowitz and a limit of single boosted black string.
