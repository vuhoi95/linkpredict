Title: Debye screening in strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Andreas Karch and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we examine the behavior of correlators of Polyakov loops and other operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at non-zero temperature. The implications for Debye screening in this strongly coupled non-Abelian plasma, and comparisons with available results for thermal QCD, are discussed.
