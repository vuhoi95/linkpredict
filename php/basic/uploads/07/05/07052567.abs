Title: Characterization of all the supersymmetric solutions of gauged N=1,d=5  supergravity
Authors: Jorge Bellorin and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We find a complete characterization of all the supersymmetric solutions of non-Abelian gauged N=1,d=5 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets and hypermultiplets: the generic forms of the metrics as functions of the scalars and vector fields plus the equations that all these must satisfy. These equations are now a complicated non-linear system and there it seems impossible to produce an algorithm to construct systematically all supersymmetric solutions.
