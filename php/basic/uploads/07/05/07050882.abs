Title: Synchrotron Radiation in the Standard Model Extension
Authors: I. E. Frolov and V. Ch. Zhukovsky
Abstract: We obtain a system of exact solutions of the Dirac equation for an electron moving in a constant homogeneous external magnetic field with account of its vacuum magnetic moment and assumed Lorentz invariance violation in the minimal CPT-odd form in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Using these solutions, characteristics of the particle synchrotron radiation are calculated, and possible observable effects caused by the Lorentz non-invariant interaction are described. We demonstrate that the angular distribution of the radiation has specific asymmetry, which can be explained as a consequence of non-conservation of transversal electron polarization in the presence of a background Lorentz non-invariant condensate field.
