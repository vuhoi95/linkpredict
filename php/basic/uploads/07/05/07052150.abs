Title: Thresholds for Intersecting D-branes Revisited
Authors: Nikolas Akerblom and Ralph Blumenhagen and Dieter Lust and Maximilian Schmidt-Sommerfeld
Abstract: Gauge threshold corrections for intersecting D6-brane string models on toroidal orbifold backgrounds are reconsidered. Both by dimensionally regularising the appearing open string one-loop diagrams in tree-channel as well as by zeta-function regularisation of the corresponding loop-channel one-loop diagrams, we arrive at a result which takes into account the infrared divergence from the contribution of the massless states in the running of the gauge coupling constant as well as the contribution of states, which become light in certain regions of the moduli space.
