Title: A note on the topological order of noncommutative Hall fluids
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and D. Gerber
Abstract: We evaluate the ground state degeneracy of noncommutative Chern-Simons models on the two-torus, a quantity that is interpreted as the "topological order" of associated phases of Hall fluids. We define the noncommutative theory via T-duality from an ordinary Chern-Simons model with non-abelian 't Hooft magnetic fluxes. Motivated by this T-duality, we propose a discrete family of noncommutative, non-abelian fluid models, arising as a natural generalization of the standard noncommutative Chern-Simons effective models. We compute the topological order for these universality classes, and comment on their possible microscopic interpretation.
