Title: Deformation Quantization of Relativistic Particles in Electromagnetic  Fields
Authors: Laura Sanchez and Imelda Galaviz and Hugo Garcia-Compean
Abstract: The Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism for Dirac second class constrained systems has been proposed recently as the deformation quantization of Dirac bracket. In this paper, after a brief review of this formalism, it is applied to the case of the relativistic free particle. Within this context, the Stratonovich-Weyl quantizer, Weyl correspondence, Moyal $\star$-product and Wigner function in the constrained phase space are obtained. The recent Hamiltonian treatment for constrained systems, whose constraints depend explicitly on time, are used to perform the deformation quantization of the relativistic free charged particle in an arbitrary electromagnetic background. Finally, the system consisting of a charged particle interacting with a dynamical Maxwell field is quantized in this context.
