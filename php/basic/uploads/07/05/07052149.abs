Title: Entropy Function for Non-extremal D1D5 and D2D6NS5-branes
Authors: Mohammad R. Garousi and Ahmad Ghodsi
Abstract: We apply the entropy function formalism to non-extremal D1D5 and D2D6NS5-branes whose throat approximation is given by the Schwarzschild black hole in AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4 and AdS_3\times S^2\times S^1\times T^4, respectively. We find the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the (alpha')^3R^4 corrections from the value of the entropy function at its saddle point. While the higher derivative terms have no effect on the temperature, they decrease the value of the entropy.
