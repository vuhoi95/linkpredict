Title: Origin of matter out of pure curvature
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Hideki Maeda
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for origin of matter in the universe in the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in higher dimensions. The recently discovered new static black hole solution by the authors \cite{md2006} with the Kaluza-Klein split up of spacetime as a product of the usual ${\ma M}^4$ with a space of negative constant curvature is indeed a pure gravitational creation of a black hole which is also endowed with a Maxwell-like {\it gravitational charge} in four-dimensional vacuum spacetime. Further it could be envisioned as being formed from anti-de Sitter spacetime by collapse of radially inflowing charged null dust. It thus establishes the remarkable reciprocity between matter and gravity - as matter produces gravity (curvature), gravity too produces matter.
