Title: d=4+1 gravitating nonabelian solutions with bi-azimuthal symmetry
Authors: Eugen Radu and Ya. Shnir and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We construct static, asymptotically flat solutions of SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in 4+1 dimensions, subject to bi-azimuthal symmetry. Both particle-like and black hole solutions are considered for two different sets of boundary conditions in the Yang--Mills sector, corresponding to multisolitons and soliton-antisoliton pairs. For gravitating multi-soliton solutions, we find that their mass per unit charge is lower than the mass of the corresponding unit charge, spherically symmetric soliton.
