Title: E(11) and the Embedding Tensor
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and I. De Baetselier and T. Nutma
Abstract: We show how, using different decompositions of E(11), one can calculate the representations under the duality group of the so--called "de-form" potentials. Evidence is presented that these potentials are in one-to-one correspondence to the embedding tensors that classify the gaugings of all maximal gauged supergravities. We supply the computer program underlying our calculations.
