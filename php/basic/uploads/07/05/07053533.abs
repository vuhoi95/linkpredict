Title: Holographic Construction of Technicolor Theory
Authors: Takayuki Hirayama and Koichi Yoshioka
Abstract: We construct a dual description of technicolor theory based on the D4/D8 brane configuration. A strongly-coupled technicolor theory is identified as the effective theory on D-branes, and from the gauge/gravity correspondence, we explore the weakly-coupled holographic description of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. It is found from the D-brane probe action that the masses of W and Z bosons are given by the decay constant of technipion, and the technimesons become hierarchically heavy. Moreover, the couplings of heavier modes to standard model fermions are rather suppressed. The oblique correction parameters are also evaluated and found to be small except for the S parameter, which can be reduced by modifying the model. The fermion fields are introduced at the intersections of D-branes and their masses are generated via massive gauge bosons from open strings stretching between D-branes.
