Title: Supersymmetric Black Rings on Eguchi-Hanson Space
Authors: Shinya Tomizawa and Hideki Ishihara and Masashi Kimura and Ken Matsuno
Abstract: We construct new supersymmetric black ring solutions on the Eguchi-Hanson base space as solutions of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. The solutions have the same two angular momentum components and the asymptotic structure on timeslices is asymptotically locally Euclidean. The S^1-direction of the black ring is along the equator on a S^2-bolt on the Eguchi-Hanson space. We also investigate the limit to a black hole, which describes the BMPV black hole with the topology of the lens space L(2;1)=S^3/Z_2.
