Title: The discrete spectrum of the D=11 bosonic M5-brane
Authors: I. Martin and L. Navarro and A. J. Perez and A. Restuccia
Abstract: We prove that the spectrum of the regularized M5-brane in D=11 target space is discrete with eigenvalues extending to infinity. The proof includes the same result for the spectra of regularized bosonic p-branes in general.
