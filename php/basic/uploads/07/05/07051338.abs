Abstract: In this work we investigate the radiatively induced Chern-Simons-like terms in four-dimensions at zero and finite temperature. We use the approach of rationalizing the fermion propagator up to the leading order in the CPT-violating coupling $b_\mu$. In this approach, we have shown that although the coefficient of Chern-Simons term can be found unambiguously in different regularization schemes at zero or finite temperature, it remains undetermined. We observe a correspondence among results obtained at finite and zero temperature.
