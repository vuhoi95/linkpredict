Title: Fuzzy Torus via q-Parafermion
Authors: N. Aizawa and R. Chakrabarti
Abstract: We note that the recently introduced fuzzy torus can be regarded as a q-deformed parafermion. Based on this picture, classification of the Hermitian representations of the fuzzy torus is carried out. The result involves Fock-type representations and new finite dimensional representations for q being a root of unity as well as already known finite dimensional ones.
