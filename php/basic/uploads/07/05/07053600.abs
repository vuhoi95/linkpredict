Title: Weil-Petersson volume of moduli spaces, Mirzakhani's recursion and  matrix models
Authors: Bertrand Eynard and Nicolas Orantin
Abstract: We show that Mirzakhani's recursions for the volumes of moduli space of Riemann surfaces are a special case of random matrix loop equations, and therefore we confirm again that Kontsevitch's integral is a generating function for those volumes. As an application, we propose a formula for the Weil-Petersson volume Vol(M_{g,0}).
