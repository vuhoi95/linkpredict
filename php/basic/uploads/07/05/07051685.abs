Title: Scalar perturbations in braneworld cosmology
Authors: Antonio Cardoso and Takashi Hiramatsu and Kazuya Koyama and Sanjeev S. Seahra
Abstract: We study the behaviour of scalar perturbations in the radiation-dominated era of Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology by numerically solving the coupled bulk and brane master wave equations. We find that density perturbations with wavelengths less than a critical value (set by the bulk curvature length) are amplified during horizon re-entry. This means that the radiation era matter power spectrum will be at least an order of magnitude larger than the predictions of general relativity (GR) on small scales. Conversely, we explicitly confirm from simulations that the spectrum is identical to GR on large scales. Although this magnification is not relevant for the cosmic microwave background or measurements of large scale structure, it will have some bearing on the formation of primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum models.
