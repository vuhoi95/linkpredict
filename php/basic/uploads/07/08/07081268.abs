Title: Black Hole Attractors in Extended Supergravity
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Marrani
Abstract: We review some aspects of the attractor mechanism for extremal black holes of (not necessarily supersymmetric) theories coupling Einstein gravity to scalars and Maxwell vector fields. Thence, we consider N=2 and N=8, d=4 supergravities, reporting some recent advances on the moduli spaces associated to BPS and non-BPS attractor solutions supported by charge orbits with non-compact stabilizers.
