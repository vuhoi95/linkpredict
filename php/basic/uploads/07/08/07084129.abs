Title: Lattice Supersymmetry: Equivalence between the Link Approach and  Orbifolding
Authors: Poul H. Damgaard and So Matsuura
Abstract: We examine the relation between supersymmetric lattice gauge theories constructed by the link approach and by orbifolding and show that they are equivalent. We discuss the number of preserved supersymmetries.
