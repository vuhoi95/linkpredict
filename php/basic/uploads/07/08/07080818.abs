Title: Dressing the Giant Gluon
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Chrysostomos Kalousios and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We demonstrate the applicability of the dressing method to the problem of constructing new classical solutions for Euclidean worldsheets in anti-de Sitter space. The motivation stems from recent work of Alday and Maldacena, who studied gluon scattering amplitudes at strong coupling using a generalization of a particular worldsheet found by Kruczenski whose edge traces a path composed of light-light segments on the boundary of AdS. We dress this `giant gluon' to find new solutions in AdS_3 and AdS_5 whose edges trace out more complicated, timelike curves on the boundary. These solutions may be used to calculate certain Wilson loops via AdS/CFT.
