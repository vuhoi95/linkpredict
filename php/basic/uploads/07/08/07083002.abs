Title: Twisting all the way: from Classical Mechanics to Quantum Fields
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Fedele Lizzi and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We discuss the effects that a noncommutative geometry induced by a Drinfeld twist has on physical theories. We systematically deform all products and symmetries of the theory. We discuss noncommutative classical mechanics, in particular its deformed Poisson bracket and hence time evolution and symmetries. The twisting is then extended to classical fields, and then to the main interest of this work: quantum fields. This leads to a geometric formulation of quantization on noncommutative spacetime, i.e. we establish a noncommutative correspondence principle from *-Poisson brackets to *-commutators. In particular commutation relations among creation and annihilation operators are deduced.
