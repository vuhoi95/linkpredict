Title: Classical Integrable N=1 and $N= 2$ Super Sinh-Gordon Models with Jump  Defects
Authors: J. F. Gomes and L. H. Ymai and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The structure of integrable field theories in the presence of jump defects is discussed in terms of boundary functions under the Lagrangian formalism. Explicit examples of bosonic and fermionic theories are considered. In particular, the boundary functions for the N=1 and N=2 super sinh-Gordon models are constructed and shown to generate the Backlund transformations for its soliton solutions. As a new and interesting example, a solution with an incoming boson and an outgoing fermion for the N=1 case is presented. The resulting integrable models are shown to be invariant under supersymmetric transformation.
