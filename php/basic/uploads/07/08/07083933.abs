Title: Cusp anomalous dimension in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory  at strong coupling
Authors: B. Basso and G. P. Korchemsky and J. Kotanski
Abstract: We construct an exact analytical solution to the integral equation which is believed to describe logarithmic growth of the anomalous dimensions of high spin operators in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and use it to determine the strong coupling expansion of the cusp anomalous dimension.
