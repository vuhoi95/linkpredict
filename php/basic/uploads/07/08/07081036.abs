Title: Kaehler-Ricci Flow, Morse Theory, and Vacuum Structure Deformation of  N=1 Supersymmetry in Four Dimensions
Authors: Bobby E. Gunara and Freddy P. Zen
Abstract: We address some aspects of four dimensional chiral N=1 supersymmetric theories on which the scalar manifold is described by K\"ahler geometry and can further be viewed as K\"ahler-Ricci soliton generating a one-parameter family of K\"ahler geometries. All couplings and solutions, namely the BPS domain walls and their supersymmetric Lorentz invariant vacua turn out to be evolved with respect to the flow parameter related to the soliton. Two models are discussed, namely N=1 theory on K\"ahler-Einstein manifold and U(n) symmetric K\"ahler-Ricci soliton with positive definite metric. In the first case we find that the evolution of the soliton causes topological change and correspondingly, modifies the Morse index of the nondegenerate vacua realized in the parity transformation of the Hessian matrix of the scalar potential after hitting singularity, which is natural in the global theory and for nondegenerate Minkowskian vacua of the local theory. However, such situation is not trivial in anti de Sitter (AdS) vacua. In an explicit model, we find that this geometric (K\"ahler-Ricci) flow can also change the index of the vacuum before and after singularity. Finally in the second case, since around the origin the metric is diffeomorphic to $ {\mathrm{\lC P}}^{n -1}$, we have to consider it in the asymptotic region. Our analysis shows that no index modification of vacua is present in both global and local theories.
