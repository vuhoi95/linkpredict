Title: Scattering of spin-polarized electron in an Aharonov--Bohm potential
Authors: V. R. Khalilov and Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: The scattering of spin-polarized electrons in an Aharonov--Bohm vector potential is considered. We solve the Pauli equation in 3+1 dimensions taking into account explicitly the interaction between the three-dimensional spin magnetic moment of electron and magnetic field. Expressions for the scattering amplitude and the cross section are obtained for spin-polarized electron scattered off a flux tube of small radius. It is also shown that bound electron states cannot occur in this quantum system. The scattering problem for the model of a flux tube of zero radius in the Born approximation is briefly discussed.
