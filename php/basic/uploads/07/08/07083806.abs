Abstract: In a toroidal orbifold of type IIB string theory we study instanton effects in N=2 super Yang-Mills theories engineered with systems of wrapped magnetized D9 branes and Euclidean D5 branes. We analyze the various open string sectors in this brane system and study the 1-loop amplitudes described by annulus diagrams with mixed boundary conditions, explaining their role in the stringy instanton calculus. We show in particular that the non-holomorphic terms in these annulus amplitudes precisely reconstruct the appropriate Kahler metric factors that are needed to write the instanton correlators in terms of purely holomorphic variables. We also explicitly derive the correct holomorphic structure of the instanton induced low energy effective action in the Coulomb branch.
