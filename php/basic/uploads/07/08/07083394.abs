Title: General marginal deformations in open superstring field theory
Authors: Michael Kiermaier and Yuji Okawa
Abstract: We construct analytic solutions of open superstring field theory for any exactly marginal deformation in any boundary superconformal field theory when properly renormalized operator products of the marginal operator are given. Our construction is an extension of the general framework for marginal deformations developed in arXiv:0707.4472 for open bosonic string field theory, and the solutions are based on integrated vertex operators which are closely related to finite deformations in boundary superconformal field theory.
