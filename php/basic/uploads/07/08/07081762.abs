Title: The Classical r-matrix of AdS/CFT and its Lie Bialgebra Structure
Authors: N. Beisert and F. Spill
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the algebraic structure of AdS/CFT in the strong-coupling limit. We propose an expression for the classical r-matrix with (deformed) u(2|2) symmetry, which leads to a quasi-triangular Lie bialgebra as the underlying symmetry algebra. On the fundamental representation our r-matrix coincides with the classical limit of the quantum R-matrix.
