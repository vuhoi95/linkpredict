Title: Some Implications of Perturbative Approach to AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: H. Kawai and T. Suyama
Abstract: We show some implications of the approach to AdS/CFT correspondence based on Type IIB string in the flat space-time with D3-branes proposed in our previous paper. We discuss a correspondence for high energy scattering amplitudes of N=4 super-Yang-Mills proposed recently. We also discuss AdS/CFT correspondence at finite temperature. Our approach provides clear understanding of these issues.
