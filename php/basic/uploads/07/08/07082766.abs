Title: Operator ordering in Two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetry with curved  manifold
Authors: Nobuyuki Motoyui and Mitsuru Yamada
Abstract: We investigate an operator ordering problem in two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric model which consists of n real superfields. There arises an operator ordering problem when the target space is curved. We have to fix the ordering in quantum operator properly to obtain the correct supersymmetry algebra. We demonstrate that the super-Poincar\'{e} algebra fixes the correct operator ordering. We obtain a supercurrent with correct operator ordering and a central extension of supersymmetry algebra.
