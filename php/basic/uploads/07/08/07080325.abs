Title: On the multi-spin magnon and spike solutions from membranes
Authors: P. Bozhilov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: Recently important classes of solitonic string solutions were obtained - giant magnons and single spikes. In previous study we showed the existence of giant magnon-like membrane solutions and studied their properties. In this paper we investigate classical rotating membranes representing analog of a specific class of string spiky solutions. Using the reduction to the Neumann-Rosochatius integrable system we find analog of the string single spike solutions. In contrast to the magnon-like solutions, this case is characterized with finite difference of energy and ``winding number'' and finite spins as well.
