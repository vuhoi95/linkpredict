Title: Principle of Minimal Energy in Relativistic Schroedinger Theory
Authors: M. Mattes and M. Sorg
Abstract: The Hamilton-Lagrange action principle for Relativistic Schr\"odinger Theory (RST) is converted to a variational principle (with constraints) for the stationary bound states. The groundstate energy is the minimally possible value of the corresponding energy functional and the relativistic energy eigenvalue equations do appear as the corresponding variational equations. The matter part of these eigenvalue equations is a relativistic generalization of the well-known Ritz principle in non-relativistic quantum mechanics which however disregards the dynamical character of the particle interactions. If the latter are included in the proposed principle of minimal energy for the bound states, one obtains a closed dynamical system for both matter and gauge fields. The new variational principle enables the development of variational techniques for solving approximately the energy eigenvalue equations. As a demonstration, the positronium groundstate is treated in great detail. Here a simple exponential trial function is sufficient in order to reproduce the (exact) result of conventional quantum mechanics where the relativistic and spin effects are neglected.
