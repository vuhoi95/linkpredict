Title: Charged Black Holes on DGP Brane
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Daeho Lee
Abstract: We consider charged black holes localized on a three-brane in the DGP model. With a spherically symmetric metric ansatz on the brane and assuming a Z_2-symmetry across the brane, we find two types of solutions which correspond to the so-called regular and accelerated branches in the DGP model. When the charge of the black hole vanishes, our solutions agree with the Schwarzschild solutions obtained by Gabadadze and Iglesias.
