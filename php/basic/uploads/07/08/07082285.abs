Title: Mapping an Island in the Landscape
Authors: Florian Gmeiner and Gabriele Honecker
Abstract: We provide a complete classification and statistical analysis of all type IIA orientifold compactifications with intersecting D6-branes on the orbifold T^6/Z'_6. The total number of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric models is found to be O(10^23). After a statistical analysis of the gauge sector properties of all possible solutions, we study three subsets of configurations which contain the chiral matter sector of the standard model, a Pati-Salam or SU(5) GUT model, respectively. We find O(10^15) compactifications with an MSSM and O(10^11) models with a Pati-Salam sector. Along the way we derive an explicit algebraic formulation for the computation of the non-chiral matter spectrum for all Z_N orbifolds.
