Title: Leptogenesis from Pseudo-Scalar Driven Inflation
Authors: W. Fischler and S. Paban
Abstract: We examine recent claims for a considerable amount of leptogenesis, in some inflationary scenarios, through the gravitational anomaly in the lepton number current. We find that when the short distances contributions are properly included the amount of lepton number generated is actually much smaller.
