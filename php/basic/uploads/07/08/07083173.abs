Title: Electro-Magnetic Waves within a Model for Charged Solitons
Authors: Dmitry Borisyuk and Manfried Faber and Alexander Kobushkin
Abstract: We analyze the model of topological fermions (MTF), where charged fermions are treated as soliton solutions of the field equations. In the region far from the sources we find plane waves solutions with the properties of electro-magnetic waves.
