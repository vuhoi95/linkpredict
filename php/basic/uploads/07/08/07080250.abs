Title: Holography from loop quantum gravity
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We show that holography arises naturally in the context of spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity. The result is not dependent on detailed assumptions about the dynamics of the theory being considered. It ties strongly the amount of information contained in a region of space to the tight mathematical underpinnings of loop quantum geometry, at least in this particular context.
