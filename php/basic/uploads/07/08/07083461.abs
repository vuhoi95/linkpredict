Title: Quaternion-Octonion Analyticity for Abelian and Non-Abelian Gauge  Theories of Dyons
Authors: P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: Einstein- Schroedinger (ES) non-symmetric theory has been extended to accommodate the Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories of dyons in terms of the quaternion-octonion metric realization. Corresponding covariant derivatives for complex, quaternion and octonion spaces in internal gauge groups are shown to describe the consistent field equations and generalized Dirac equation of dyons. It is also shown that quaternion and octonion representations extend the so-called unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism to the Yang-Mill's fields leading to two SU(2) gauge theories of internal spaces due to the presence of electric and magnetic charges on dyons.
