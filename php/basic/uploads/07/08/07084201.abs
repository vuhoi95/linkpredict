Title: A sticky business: the status of the conjectured viscosity/entropy  density bound
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and Thomas D. Cohen and Paul M. Hohler
Abstract: There have been a number of forms of a conjecture that there is a universal lower bound on the ratio, eta/s, of the shear viscosity, eta, to entropy density, s, with several different domains of validity. We examine the various forms of the conjecture. We argue that a number of variants of the conjecture are not viable due to the existence of theoretically consistent counterexamples. We also note that much of the evidence in favor of a bound does not apply to the variants which have not yet been ruled out.
