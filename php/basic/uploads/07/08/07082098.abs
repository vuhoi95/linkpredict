Title: Where are the degrees of freedom responsible for black hole entropy?
Authors: Saurya Das and S. Shankaranarayanan and Sourav Sur
Abstract: Considering the entanglement between quantum field degrees of freedom inside and outside the horizon as a plausible source of black hole entropy, we address the question: {\it where are the degrees of freedom that give rise to this entropy located?} When the field is in ground state, the black hole area law is obeyed and the degrees of freedom near the horizon contribute most to the entropy. However, for excited state, or a superposition of ground state and excited state, power-law corrections to the area law are obtained, and more significant contributions from the degrees of freedom far from the horizon are shown.
