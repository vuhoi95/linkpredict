Title: Multi-Particle Quasi Exactly Solvable Difference Equations
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: Several explicit examples of multi-particle quasi exactly solvable `discrete' quantum mechanical Hamiltonians are derived by deforming the well-known exactly solvable multi-particle Hamiltonians, the Ruijsenaars-Schneider-van Diejen systems. These are difference analogues of the quasi exactly solvable multi-particle systems, the quantum Inozemtsev systems obtained by deforming the well-known exactly solvable Calogero-Sutherland systems. They have a finite number of exactly calculable eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This paper is a multi-particle extension of the recent paper by one of the authors on deriving quasi exactly solvable difference equations of single degree of freedom.
