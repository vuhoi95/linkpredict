Title: Non-Minimal Inflation on the Warped DGP Brane
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Behnaz Fazlpour
Abstract: We construct an inflation model with inflaton non-minimally coupled to gravity on a warped DGP brane. Using an exponential potential, we calculate scalar power spectrum, spectral index and the running of the spectral index. We show that for a suitable range of non-minimal coupling it is possible to exit the inflationary phase spontaneously and without any mechanism, even in the case that minimal inflation can not exit spontaneously. By a detailed analysis of parameter space, we study the constraints imposed on the non-minimal coupling from recent observational data.
