Title: On the consistency of coset space dimensional reduction
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Pantelis Manousselis and Nikolaos Prezas and George Zoupanos
Abstract: In this letter we consider higher-dimensional Yang-Mills theories and examine their consistent coset space dimensional reduction. Utilizing a suitable ansatz and imposing a simple set of constraints we determine the four-dimensional gauge theory obtained from the reduction of both the higher-dimensional Lagrangian and the corresponding equations of motion. The two reductions yield equivalent results and hence they constitute an example of a consistent truncation.
