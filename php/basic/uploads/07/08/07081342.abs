Title: The Bullough-Dodd model coupled to matter fields
Authors: P. E. G. Assis and L. A. Ferreira
Abstract: The Bullough-Dodd model is an important two dimensional integrable field theory which finds applications in physics and geometry. We consider a conformally invariant extension of it, and study its integrability properties using a zero curvature condition based on the twisted Kac-Moody algebra A_2^{(2)}. The one and two-soliton solutions as well as the breathers are constructed explicitly . We also consider integrable extensions of the Bullough-Dodd model by the introduction of spinor (matter) fields. The resulting theories are conformally invariant and present local internal symmetries. All the one-soliton solutions, for two examples of those models, are constructed using an hybrid of the dressing and Hirota methods. One model is of particular interest because it presents a confinement mechanism for a given conserved charge inside the solitons.
