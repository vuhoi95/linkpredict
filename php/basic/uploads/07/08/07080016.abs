Title: Nearing the Horizon of a Heterotic String
Authors: Joshua M. Lapan and Aaron Simons and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: It is argued that recent developments point to the existence of an AdS_3 x S^2 x T^5 holographic dual for the 2D CFT living on the worldsheet of N coincident heterotic strings in a T^5 compactification, which can in turn be described by an exact worldsheet CFT. A supergravity analysis is shown to imply that the global supergroup is Osp(4^*|4), with 16 supercharges and an affine extension given, surprisingly, by a nonlinear N=8 2D superconformal algebra. Possible supergroups with 16 supercharges are also found to match the expected symmetries for T^n compactification with 0<=n<=7.
