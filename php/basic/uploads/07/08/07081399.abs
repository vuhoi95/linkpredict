Title: Higher-Spin Gauge Fields Interacting with Scalars: The Lagrangian Cubic  Vertex
Authors: A. Fotopoulos and N. Irges and A. C. Petkou and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: We apply a recently presented BRST procedure to construct the Largangian cubic vertex of higher-spin gauge field triplets interacting with massive free scalars. In flat space, the spin-s triplet propagates the series of irreducible spin-s, s-2,..,0/1 modes which couple independently to corresponding conserved currents constructed from the scalars. The simple covariantization of the flat space result is not enough in AdS, as new interaction vertices appear. We present in detail the cases of spin-2 and spin-3 triplets coupled to scalars. Restricting to a single irreducible spin-s mode we uncover previously obtained results. We also present an alternative derivation of the lower spin results based on the idea that higher-spin gauge fields arise from the gauging of higher derivative symmetries of free matter Lagrangians. Our results can be readily applied to holographic studies of higher-spin gauge theories.
