Title: Consistently Solving the Simplicity Constraints for Spinfoam Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Etera R. Livine and Simone Speziale
Abstract: We give an independent derivation of the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli spinfoam model for quantum gravity which recently appeared in [arXiv:0705.2388]. Using the coherent state techniques introduced earlier in [arXiv:0705.0674], we show that the EPR model realizes a consistent imposition of the simplicity constraints implementing general relativity from a topological BF theory.
