Abstract: We devise minimalistic gauged U(1)_X Froggatt-Nielsen models which at low-energy give rise to the recently suggested discrete gauge Z_6 symmetry, proton hexality, thus stabilizing the proton. Assuming three generations of right-handed neutrinos, with the proper choice of X-charges, we obtain viable neutrino masses. Furthermore, we find scenarios such that no X-charged hidden sector superfields are needed, which from a bottom-up perspective allows the calculation of g_string, g_X and G_SM's Kac-Moody levels. The only mass scale apart from M_grav is m_soft.
