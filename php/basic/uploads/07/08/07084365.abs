Title: Nonabelian localization for gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere
Authors: Harold Steinacker and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We apply nonabelian equivariant localization techniques to Yang-Mills theory on the fuzzy sphere to write the partition function entirely as a sum over local contributions from critical points of the action. The contributions of the classical saddle-points are evaluated explicitly, and the partition function of ordinary Yang-Mills theory on the sphere is recovered in the commutative limit.
