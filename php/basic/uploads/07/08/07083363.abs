Title: Quasi-normal modes of a black hole localized on a codimension-two brane  of finite tension
Authors: Usama A. al-Binni and George Siopsis
Abstract: We calculate the quasi-normal modes of black holes localized on a 3-brane of finite tension embedded in six-dimensional flat spacetime. Using the WKB approximation, we obtain the frequencies of various types of perturbation both analytically and numerically for arbitrary brane tension. We thus extend earlier analytical results which were derived for a brane of small tension.
