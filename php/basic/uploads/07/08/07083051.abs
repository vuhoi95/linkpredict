Title: Topological Higher Gauge Theory - from BF to BFCG theory
Authors: F. Girelli and H. Pfeiffer and E. M. Popescu
Abstract: We study generalizations of 3- and 4-dimensional BF-theory in the context of higher gauge theory. First, we construct topological higher gauge theories as discrete state sum models and explain how they are related to the state sums of Yetter, Mackaay, and Porter. Under certain conditions, we can present their corresponding continuum counterparts in terms of classical Lagrangians. We then explain that two of these models are already familiar from the literature: the SigmaPhiEA-model of 3-dimensional gravity coupled to topological matter, and also a 4-dimensional model of BF-theory coupled to topological matter.
