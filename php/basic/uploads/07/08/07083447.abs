Title: Strings in SU(N) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions: beyond the  fundamental representation
Authors: Barak Bringoltz and Michael Teper
Abstract: We calculate energies and tensions of closed k-strings in (2+1)-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories with N=4,5,6,8. When we study the dependence of the ground state energy on the string length, we find that it is well described by a Nambu-Goto (NG) free bosonic string for large lengths. At shorter lengths we see deviations which we fit, and this allows us to control the systematic error involved in extracting the tension. We compare the resulting string tensions with Casimir scaling, which we find to be lower than our data by 1%-4%. Extrapolating our results to N=oo we see that our data fits more naturally to 1/N rather than 1/N^2 corrections. Finally, we see that the full spectrum of the k-string states falls into sectors that belong to particular irreducible representations of SU(N).
