Title: O'KKLT at Finite Temperature
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Vincenzo Calo
Abstract: We study whether finite temperature corrections decompactify the internal space in KKLT compactifications with an uplifting sector given by a system that exhibits metastable dynamical supersymmetry breaking. More precisely, we calculate the one-loop temperature corrections to the effective potential of the volume modulus in the KKLT model coupled to the quantum corrected O'Raifeartaigh model. We prove that for the original KKLT model, namely with one exponent in the non-perturbative superpotential, the finite temperature potential is runaway when at zero temperature there is a dS minimum. On the other hand, for a non-perturbative superpotential of the race-track type with two exponents, we demonstrate that the temperature-dependent part of the effective potential can have local minima at finite field vevs. However, rather unexpectedly, it turns out that these minima do not affect the structure of the full effective potential and so the volume modulus is stabilized at the local minimum of the zero temperature potential for the whole range of validity of the supergravity approximation.
