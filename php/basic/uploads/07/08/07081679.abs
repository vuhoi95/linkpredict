Title: Assisted Inflation from Geometric Tachyon
Authors: Kamal L. Panigrahi and Harvendra Singh
Abstract: We study the effect of rolling of N D3-branes in the vicinity of NS5-branes. We find out that this system coupled with the four dimensional gravity gives the slow roll assisted inflation of the scalar field theory. Once again this expectation is exactly similar to that of N-tachyon assisted inflation on unstable D-branes.
