Title: Functional Renormalization Group Equations, Asymptotic Safety, and  Quantum Einstein Gravity
Authors: Martin Reuter and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a pedagogical introduction to a specific continuum implementation of the Wilsonian renormalization group, the effective average action. Its general properties and, in particular, its functional renormalization group equation are explained in a simple scalar setting. The approach is then applied to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG). The possibility of constructing a fundamental theory of quantum gravity in the framework of Asymptotic Safety is discussed and the supporting evidence is summarized.
