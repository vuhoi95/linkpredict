Abstract: Using the numerical method, we study dynamics of coalescing black holes on the Eguchi-Hanson base space. Effects of a difference in spacetime topology on the black hole dynamics is discussed. We analyze appearance and disappearance process of marginal surfaces. In our calculation, the area of a coverall black hole horizon at the creation time in the coalescing black holes solutions on Eguchi-Hanson space is larger than that in the five-dimensional Kastor-Traschen solutions. This fact suggests that the black hole production on the Eguchi-Hanson space is easier than that on the flat space.
