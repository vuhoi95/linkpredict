Title: Background Field Equations for the Duality Symmetric String
Authors: David S. Berman and Neil B. Copland and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: This paper describes the background field equations for strings in T-duality symmetric formalisms in which the dimension of target space is doubled and the sigma model supplemented with constraints. These are calculated by demanding the vanishing of the beta-functional of the sigma model couplings in the doubled target space. We demonstrate the equivalence with the background field equations of the standard string sigma model.
