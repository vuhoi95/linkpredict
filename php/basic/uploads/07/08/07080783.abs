Title: The HMW effect in Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Jianhua Wang and Kang Li
Abstract: The HMW effect in non-commutative quantum mechanics is studied. By solving the Dirac equations on non-commutative (NC) space and non-commutative phase space, we obtain topological HMW phase on NC space and NC phase space respectively, where the additional terms related to the space-space and momentum-momentum non-commutativity are given explicitly.
