Title: Hierarchy Problem, Dilatonic Fifth Force, and Origin of Mass
Authors: Y. M. Cho and J. H. Kim and S. W. Kim and J. H. Yoon
Abstract: Based on the fact that the scalar curvature of the internal space determines the mass of the dilaton in higher-dimensional unified theories, we show how the dilaton mass can explain the origin of mass and resolve the hierarchy problem. Moreover, we show that cosmology puts a strong constraint on dilaton mass, and requires the scale of the internal space to be larger than $10^{-9} m$.
