Title: Baryogenesis by Quantum Gravity
Authors: Ken-ji Hamada and Azusa Minamizaki and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: A novel mechanism of baryogenesis is proposed on the basis of the phase transition from the conformal invariant space-time to the Einstein space-time in quantum gravity. Strong-coupling gravitational excitations with dynamical mass about 10^17 GeV are generated at the transition. They eventually decay into ordinary matters. As a realization of unparticle physics we show that the low energy effective interactions between the gravitational potential describing the excitation and the non-conserving matter currents by the axial anomalies can explain matter asymmetry out of thermal equilibrium.
