Title: Spinning Dragging Strings
Authors: C. P. Herzog and A. Vuorinen
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the drag force experienced by a heavy quark moving through a maximally supersymmetric SU(N) super Yang-Mills plasma at nonzero temperature and R-charge chemical potential and at large 't Hooft coupling. We resolve a discrepancy in the literature between two earlier studies of such quarks. In addition, we consider small fluctuations of the spinning strings dual to these probe quarks and find no evidence of instabilities. We make some comments about suitable D7-brane boundary conditions for the dual strings.
