Title: Brane World Inflation with Scalar and Tachyon Fields
Authors: B. C. Paul and Dilip Paul
Abstract: We present inflationary models of the early universe in the braneworld scenario considering both scalar field and tachyon field separately. The technique of Chervon and Zhuravlev to obtain inflationary cosmological models without restrictions on a scalar field potential is employed here. We note that like scalar field, the inflationary solution obtained here with tachyon field also does not depend on its potential. However, unlike scalar field, inflation with tachyon is obtained for a restricted domains of the field to begin with. We obtain potentials for which one gets inflation using both scalar field and tachyon field separately. It is found that unlike the scalar field, the tachyonic field inflation sceanario can be realized from t > t_o.
