Title: The Quantum Hydrodynamics of the Sutherland Model
Authors: Michael Stone and Dmitry Gutman
Abstract: We show that the form of the chiral condition found by Abanov et al., in the quantum hydrodyamics of the Sutherland model arises because there are two distinct inner products with respect to which the chiral Hamitonian hermitian, but only one with respect to which the full, non-chiral, Hamiltonian is hermitian.
