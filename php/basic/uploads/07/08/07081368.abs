Title: Closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor and Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetime  uniqueness
Authors: Tsuyoshi Houri and Takeshi Oota and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We study spacetimes with a closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor. It is shown that the D-dimensional Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetime constructed by Chen-Lu-Pope is the only spacetime admitting a rank-2 closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor with a certain symmetry.
