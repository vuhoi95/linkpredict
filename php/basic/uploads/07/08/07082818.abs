Title: Baryon-charge Chemical Potential in AdS/CFT
Authors: Shin Nakamura and Yunseok Seo and Sang-Jin Sin and K. P. Yogendran
Abstract: We present a closed framework of AdS/CFT with finite U(1)B-charge chemical potential. We show how the gauge-invariant identification of the chemical potential with the bulk gauge field emerges from the standard AdS/CFT dictionary. Physical importance and necessity of the Minkowski embeddings within the present framework is also shown numerically in the D3-D7 systems. We point out that the D3-D7 model with only the black-hole embeddings does not have the low-temperature and low-chemical-potential region in the grand-canonical ensemble, hence it is incomplete. A physical interpretation that explains these numerical results is also proposed.
