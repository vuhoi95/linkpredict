Title: Polynomial Structure of the (Open) Topological String Partition Function
Authors: M. Alim and J. D. Laenge
Abstract: In this paper we show that the polynomial structure of the topological string partition function found by Yamaguchi and Yau for the quintic holds for an arbitrary Calabi-Yau manifold with any number of moduli. Furthermore, we generalize these results to the open topological string partition function as discussed recently by Walcher and reproduce his results for the real quintic.
