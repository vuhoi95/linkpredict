Title: Black hole entropy in modified gravity models
Authors: F. Briscese and E. Elizalde
Abstract: An analysis of some modified gravity models, based on the study of pure Schwarzschild and of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes, and involving the use of the Noether charge method, is carried out. Corrections to the classical Einsteinian black hole entropy appear. It is shown explicitly how the condition of positive entropy can be used in order to constrain the viability of modified gravity theories.
