Title: Solutions of Higher Dimensional Gauss-Bonnet FRW Cosmology
Authors: Keith Andrew and Brett Bolen and Chad A. Middleton
Abstract: We examine the effect on cosmological evolution of adding a Gauss-Bonnet term to the standard Einstein-Hilbert action for a (1 + 3)+ d dimensional Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. By assuming that the additional dimensions compactify as a power law as the usual 3 spatial dimensions expand, we solve the resulting dynamical equations and find that the solution may be of either de Sitter or Kasner form depending upon whether the Gauss-Bonnet term or the Einstein term dominates.
