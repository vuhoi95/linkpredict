Title: Wobbles and other kink-breather solutions of the Sine Gordon model
Authors: L. A. Ferreira and Bernard Piette and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study various solutions of the Sine Gordon model in (1+1) dimensions. We use the Hirota method to construct some of them and then show that the wobble, discussed in detail by K\"alberman, is one of such solutions. We concentrate our attention on a kink and its bound states with one or two breathers. We study their stability and some aspects of their scattering properties on potential wells and on fixed boundary conditions.
