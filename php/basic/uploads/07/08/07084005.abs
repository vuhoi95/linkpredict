Title: Metastable Kinks in the Orbifold
Authors: Manuel Toharia and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We consider static configurations of bulk scalar fields in extra dimensional models in which the fifth dimension is an $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. There may exist a finite number of such configurations, with total number depending on the size of the orbifold interval. We perform a detailed Sturm-Liouville stability analysis that demonstrates that all but the lowest-lying configurations - those with no nodes in the interval - are unstable. We also present a powerful general criterion with which to determine which of these nodeless solutions are stable. The detailed analysis underlying the results presented in this letter, and applications to specific models, are presented in a comprehensive companion paper.
