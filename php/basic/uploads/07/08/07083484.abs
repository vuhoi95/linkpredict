Title: (p,q)-string in matrix-regularized membrane and type IIB duality
Authors: Hiroyuki Okagawa and Shozo Uehara and Satoshi Yamada
Abstract: We consider a lightcone wrapped supermembrane compactified on 2-torus in the matrix regularization. We examine the double dimensional reduction technique and deduce the free matrix string of (p,q)-string in type IIB superstring theory explicitly from the matrix-regularized wrapped supermembrane. In addition we obtain the (2+1)-dimensional super Yang-Mills action in curved background. We also examine the duality.
