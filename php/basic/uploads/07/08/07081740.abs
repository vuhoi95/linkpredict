Title: Classical behavior of deformed sine-Gordon models
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. M. C. Malbouisson and R. Menezes
Abstract: In this work we deform the phi^4 model with distinct deformation functions, to propose a diversity of sine-Gordon-like models. We investigate the proposed models and we obtain all the topological solutions they engender. In particular, we introduce non-polynomial potentials which support some exotic two-kink solutions.
