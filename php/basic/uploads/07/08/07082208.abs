Title: Wrapping interactions at strong coupling -- the giant magnon
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Tomasz Lukowski
Abstract: We derive generalized Luscher formulas for finite size corrections in a theory with a general dispersion relation. For the AdS_5xS^5 superstring these formulas encode leading wrapping interaction effects. We apply the generalized mu-term formula to calculate finite size corrections to the dispersion relation of the giant magnon at strong coupling. The result exactly agrees with the classical string computation of Arutyunov, Frolov and Zamaklar. The agreement involved a Borel resummation of all even loop-orders of the BES/BHL dressing factor thus providing a strong consistency check for the choice of the dressing factor.
