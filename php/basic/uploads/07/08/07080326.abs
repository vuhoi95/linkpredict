Abstract: We analyze the phases of the Sakai-Sugimoto model at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential. Baryonic matter is represented either by 4-branes in the 8-branes or by strings stretched from the 8-branes to the horizon. We find the explicit configurations and use them to determine the phase diagram and equation of state of the model. The 4-brane configuration (nuclear matter) is always preferred to the string configuration (quark matter), and the latter is also unstable to density fluctuations. In the deconfined phase the phase diagram has three regions corresponding to the vacuum, quark-gluon plasma, and nuclear matter, with a first-order and a second-order phase transition separating the phases. We find that for a large baryon number density, and at low temperatures, the dominant phase has broken chiral symmetry. This is in qualitative agreement with studies of QCD at high density.
