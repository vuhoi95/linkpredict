Title: Green-Schwarz superstring from type IIB matrix model
Authors: Yoshihisa Kitazawa and Satoshi Nagaoka
Abstract: We construct Green-Schwarz (GS) light-cone closed superstring theory from type IIB matrix model. A GS light-cone string action is derived from two dimensional N=8 U(n) noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) by identifying noncommutative scale with string scale. Supersymmetry transformation for the light-cone gauge action is also derived from supersymmetry transformation for IIB matrix model. By identifying the physical states and interaction vertices, string theory is perturbatively reproduced.
