Title: Universal behaviour of interfaces in 2d and dimensional reduction of  Nambu-Goto strings
Authors: M. Billo and M. Caselle and L. Ferro
Abstract: We propose a simple effective model for the description of interfaces in 2d statistical models, based on the first-order treatment of an action corresponding to the length of the interface. The universal prediction of this model for the interface free energy agrees with the result of an exact calculation in the case of the 2d Ising model. This model appears as a dimensional reduction of the Nambu-Goto stringy description of interfaces in 3d, i.e., of the capillary wave model.
