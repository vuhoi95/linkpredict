Title: On the 2-point function of the O(N) model
Authors: Federico Benitez and Ramon Mendez Galain and Nicolas Wschebor
Abstract: The self-energy of the critical 3-dimensional O(N) model is calculated. The analysis is performed in the context of the Non-Perturbative Renormalization Group, by exploiting an approximation which takes into account contributions of an infinite number of vertices. A very simple calculation yields the 2-point function in the whole range of momenta, from the UV Gaussian regime to the scaling one. Results are in good agreement with best estimates in the literature for any value of N in all momenta regimes. This encourages the use of this simple approximation procedure to calculate correlation functions at finite momenta in other physical situations.
