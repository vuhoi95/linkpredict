Title: On the Entropy of Four-Dimensional Near-Extremal N=2 Black Holes with  R^2-Terms
Authors: Eyal Gruss and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider the entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal N=2 black holes. Without R^2-terms, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula has the structure of the extremal black holes entropy with a shift of the charges depending on the non-extremality parameter and the moduli at infinity. We derive a generalized Wald entropy formula for non-extremal N=2 black holes with R^2-terms. We construct a class of small near-extremal horizon solutions with R^2-terms. In this case the entropy is the same as in the extremal case to order O(mu^2), and does not exhibit the charge shift behavior.
