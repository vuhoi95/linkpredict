Title: Meson masses at large N_c
Authors: Gunnar Bali and Francis Bursa
Abstract: We analyze the meson spectrum in SU(N_c) lattice gauge theory. We use Wilson quarks to measure the pseudoscalar and vector masses in SU(2), SU(3), SU(4) and SU(6), and extrapolate to the large-N_c limit. We find that finite-N_c corrections are small at all values of the quark mass.
