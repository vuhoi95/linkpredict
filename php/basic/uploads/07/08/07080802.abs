Title: From Percolation to Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Pierre Mathieu and David Ridout
Abstract: The smallest deformation of the minimal model M(2,3) that can accommodate Cardy's derivation of the percolation crossing probability is presented. It is shown that this leads to a consistent logarithmic conformal field theory at c=0. A simple recipe for computing the associated fusion rules is given. The differences between this theory and the other recently proposed c=0 logarithmic conformal field theories are underlined. The discussion also emphasises the existence of invariant logarithmic couplings that generalise Gurarie's anomaly number.
