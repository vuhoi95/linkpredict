Title: Super Gelfand-Dickey Algebra And Integrable Models
Authors: A. El Boukili and M. B. Sedra and A. Zemate
Abstract: We present in this work a systematic study of integrable models and supersymmetric extensions of the Gelfand-Dickey algebra of pseudo differential operators. We describe in detail the relation existing between the algebra of super pseudo-differential operators on the ring of superfields $u_{\frac{s}{2}}(z,\theta),s\in Z$ and the higher and lower spin extensions of the conformal algebra.
