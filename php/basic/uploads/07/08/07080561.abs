Title: k-Essence, superluminal propagation, causality and emergent geometry
Authors: Eugeny Babichev and Viatcheslav Mukhanov and Alexander Vikman
Abstract: The k-essence theories admit in general the superluminal propagation of the perturbations on classical backgrounds. We show that in spite of the superluminal propagation the causal paradoxes do not arise in these theories and in this respect they are not less safe than General Relativity.
