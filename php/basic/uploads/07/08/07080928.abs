Title: Dual Bosonic Thermal Green Function and Fermion Correlators of the  Massive Thirring Model at a Finite Temperature
Authors: Leonardo Mondaini and E. C. Marino
Abstract: The Euclidian thermal Green function of the two-dimensional (2D) free massless scalar field in coordinate space is written as the real part of a complex analytic function of a variable that conformally maps the infinite strip $-\infty<x<\infty$ ($0<\tau<\beta$) of the $z=x+i\tau$ ($\tau$: imaginary time) plane into the upper-half-plane. Using this fact and the Cauchy-Riemann conditions, we identify the dual thermal Green function as the imaginary part of that function. Using both the thermal Green function and its dual, we obtain an explicit series expression for the fermionic correlation functions of the massive Thirring model (MTM) at a finite temperature.
