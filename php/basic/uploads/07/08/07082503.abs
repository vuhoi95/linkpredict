Authors: Ilia Gogoladze and Nobuchika Okada and Qaisar Shafi
Abstract: We consider six dimensional gauge models compactified on the orbifold T^2/Z_N (N=2,3,4,6) such that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs doublet arises from the extra-dimensional components of the gauge field. For \Lambda \leq 10^{19} GeV, where \Lambda denotes the compactification scale, we obtain 114.4 GeV \leq m_H \leq 164 GeV for the SM Higgs boson mass. We also consider gauge-Higgs-top and gauge-Higgs-bottom Yukawa unification which respectively yield m_H = 131^{+4}_{-5} GeV and m_H = 150^{+2}_{-2} GeV for a top quark pole mass M_t =170.9^{+1.8}_{-1.8} GeV. As a special case we recover the result m_H \leq 132 GeV previously obtained for five dimensional models.
