Title: Surface charge algebra in gauge theories and thermodynamic integrability
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Geoffrey Compere
Abstract: Surface charges and their algebra in interacting Lagrangian gauge field theories are investigated by using techniques from the variational calculus. In the case of exact solutions and symmetries, the surface charges are interpreted as a Pfaff system. Integrability is governed by Frobenius' theorem and the charges associated with the derived symmetry algebra are shown to vanish. In the asymptotic context, we provide a generalized covariant derivation of the result that the representation of the asymptotic symmetry algebra through charges may be centrally extended. Finally, we make contact with Hamiltonian and with covariant phase space methods.
