Title: Soliton and black hole solutions of su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in  anti-de Sitter space
Authors: J. E. Baxter and Marc Helbling and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We present new soliton and hairy black hole solutions of su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. These solutions are described by N+1 independent parameters, and have N-1 gauge field degrees of freedom. We examine the space of solutions in detail for su(3) and su(4) solitons and black holes. If the magnitude of the cosmological constant is sufficiently large, we find solutions where all the gauge field functions have no zeros. These solutions are of particular interest because we anticipate that at least some of them will be linearly stable.
