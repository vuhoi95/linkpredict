Title: Stringy NJL and Gross-Neveu models at finite density and temperature
Authors: Joshua L. Davis and Michael Gutperle and Per Kraus and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: Nonlocal stringy versions of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio and Gross-Neveu models arise in a certain limit of holographic QCD. We analyze the phase structure at finite density and temperature at strong coupling in terms of probe branes in the gravity dual. Comparison with the phase structure of the local field theory models shows qualitative agreement with some aspects, and disagreement with others. Finally, we explain how to construct the Landau potentials for these models by taking the probe branes off-shell.
