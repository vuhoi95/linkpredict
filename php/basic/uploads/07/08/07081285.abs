Title: A Secret Symmetry of the AdS/CFT S-matrix
Authors: Takuya Matsumoto and Sanefumi Moriyama and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We find a new quantum Yangian symmetry of the AdS/CFT S-matrix, which complements the original su(2|2) symmetry to gl(2|2) and does not have a Lie algebra analog. Our finding is motivated by the Yangian double structure discovered at the classical level.
