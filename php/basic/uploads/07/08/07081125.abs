Title: N=2 supersymmetric unconstrained matrix GNLS hierarchies are consistent
Authors: F. Delduc and O. Lechtenfeld and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: We develop a pseudo-differential approach to the N=2 supersymmetric unconstrained matrix (k|n,m)-Generalized Nonlinear Schroedinger hierarchies and prove consistency of the corresponding Lax-pair representation (nlin.SI/0201026). Furthermore, we establish their equivalence to the integrable hierarchies derived in the super-algebraic approach of the homogeneously-graded loop superalgebra sl(2k+n|2k+m)\otimes C[{lambda},{lambda}^{-1}] (nlin.SI/0206037). We introduce an unconventional definition of N=2 supersymmetric strictly pseudo-differential operators so as to close their algebra among themselves.
