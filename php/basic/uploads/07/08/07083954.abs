Title: Non-commutative phase space and its space-time symmetry
Authors: Kang Li and Sayipjamal Dulat
Abstract: First a description of 2+1 dimensional non-commutative(NC) phase space is presented, where the deformation of the planck constant is given. We find that in this new formulation, generalized Bopp's shift has a symmetric representation and one can easily and straightforwardly define the star product on NC phase space. Then we define non-commutative Lorentz transformations both on NC space and NC phase space. We also discuss the Poincare symmetry. Finally we point out that our NC phase space formulation and the NC Lorentz transformations can be applicable to any even dimensional NC space and NC phase space.
