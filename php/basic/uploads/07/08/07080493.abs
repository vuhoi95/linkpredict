Title: Simple Stringy Dynamical SUSY Breaking
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Shamit Kachru and Eva Silverstein
Abstract: We present simple string models which dynamically break supersymmetry without non-Abelian gauge dynamics. The Fayet model, the Polonyi model, and the O'Raifeartaigh model each arise from D-branes at a specific type of singularity. D-brane instanton effects generate the requisite exponentially small scale of supersymmetry breaking.
