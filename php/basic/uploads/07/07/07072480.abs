Title: Renormalization of Lorentz violating theories
Authors: Damiano Anselmi and Milenko Halat
Abstract: We classify the unitary, renormalizable, Lorentz violating quantum field theories of interacting scalars and fermions, obtained improving the behavior of Feynman diagrams by means of higher space derivatives. Higher time derivatives are not generated by renormalization. Renormalizability is ensured by a "weighted power counting" criterion. The theories contain a dimensionful parameter, yet a set of models are classically invariant under a weighted scale transformation, which is anomalous at the quantum level. Formulas for the weighted trace anomaly are derived. The renormalization-group properties are studied.
