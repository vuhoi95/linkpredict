Title: Nonabelian strings in a dense matter
Authors: A. Gorsky and V. Mikhailov
Abstract: We consider gauge theories with scalar matter with and without supersymmetry at nonzero chemical potential. It is argued that a chemical potential plays a role similar to the FI term. We analyze theory at weak coupling regime at large chemical potential and argue that it supports nonabelian non-BPS strings. Worldsheet theory on the nonabelian string in a dense matter is briefly discussed.
