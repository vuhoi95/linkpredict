Title: Self-dual Vortices in the Abelian Chern-Simons Model with Two Complex  Scalar Fields
Authors: Yi-Shi Duan and Li-Da Zhang and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: Making use of $\phi$-mapping topological current method, we discuss the self-dual vortices in the Abelian Chern-Simons model with two complex scalar fields. For each scalar field, an exact nontrivial equation with a topological term which is missing in many references is derived analytically. The general angular momentum is obtained. The magnetic flux which relates the two scalar fields is calculated. Furthermore, we investigate the vortex evolution processes, and find that because of the present of the vortex molecule, these evolution processes is more complicated than the vortex evolution processes in the corresponding single scalar field model.
