Title: On the gravitational stability of D1-D5-P black holes
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We examine the stability of the nonextremal D1-D5-P black hole solutions. In particular, we look for the appearance of a superradiant instability for the spinning black holes but we find no evidence of such an instability. We compare this situation with that for the smooth soliton geometries, which were recently observed to suffer from an ergoregion instability, and consider the implications for the fuzzball proposal.
