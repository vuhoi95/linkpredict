Title: 4d/5d Correspondence for the Black Hole Potential and its Critical  Points
Authors: A. Ceresole and S. Ferrara and A. Marrani
Abstract: We express the d=4, N=2 black hole effective potential for cubic holomorphic F functions and generic dyonic charges in terms of d=5 real special geometry data. The 4d critical points are computed from the 5d ones, and their relation is elucidated. For symmetric spaces, we identify the BPS and non-BPS classes of attractors and the respective entropies. These are related by simple formulae, interpolating between four and five dimensions, depending on the volume modulus and on the 4d magnetic (or electric) charges, and holding true also for generic field configurations and for non-symmetric cubic geometries.
