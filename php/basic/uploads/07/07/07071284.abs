Title: Magnetic strings in Lattice QCD as Nonabelian Vortices
Authors: A. Gorsky and V. Zakharov
Abstract: Lattice studies indicate existence of magnetic strings in QCD vacuum. We argue that recently found nonabelian strings with rich worldsheet dynamics provide a proper pattern for the strings observed on the lattice. In particular, within this pattern we explain the localization of the monopole-antimonopole pairs on the magnetic string worldsheet and the negative contribution of the magnetic strings into the vacuum energy and gluon condensate. We suggest the D2 brane realization of the magnetic string which explains the temperature dependence of its tension.
