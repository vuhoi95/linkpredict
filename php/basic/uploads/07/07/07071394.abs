Title: Running anti-de Sitter radius from QCD-like strings
Authors: Yu-tin Huang and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We consider renormalization effects for a bosonic QCD-like string, whose partons have $1/p^{2}$ propagators instead of Gaussian. Classically this model resembles (the bosonic part of) the projective light-cone (zero-radius) limit of a string on an AdS${}_5$ background, where Schwinger parameters give rise to the fifth dimension. Quantum effects generate dynamics for this dimension, producing an AdS${}_5$ background with a running radius. The projective light-cone is the high-energy limit: Holography is enforced dynamically.
