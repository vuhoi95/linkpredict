Title: Meta-Stable Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking Near Points of Enhanced  Symmetry
Authors: Rouven Essig and Kuver Sinha and Gonzalo Torroba
Abstract: We show that metastable supersymmetry breaking is generic near certain enhanced symmetry points of gauge theory moduli spaces. Our model consists of two sectors coupled by a singlet and combines dynamical supersymmetry breaking with an O'Raifeartaigh mechanism in terms of confined variables. All relevant mass parameters, including the supersymmetry breaking scale, are generated dynamically. The metastable vacua appear as a result of a balance between non-perturbative and perturbative quantum effects along a pseudo-runaway direction.
