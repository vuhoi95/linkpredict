Title: Signatures of gravitational fixed points at the LHC
Authors: Daniel F. Litim and Tilman Plehn
Abstract: We study quantum-gravitational signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the context of theories with extra spatial dimensions and a low fundamental Planck scale in the TeV range. Implications of a gravitational fixed point at high energies are worked out using Wilson's renormalisation group. We find that relevant cross-sections involving virtual gravitons become finite. Based on gravitational lepton pair production we conclude that the LHC is sensitive to a fundamental Planck scale of up to 6 TeV.
