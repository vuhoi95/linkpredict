Abstract: We consider a six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system compactified in an axisymmetric two-dimensional space with one capped regularized conical brane of codimension one. We study the cosmological evolution which is induced on the regularized brane as it moves in between known static bulk and cap solutions. Looking at the resulting Friedmann equation, we see that the brane cosmology at high energies is dominated by a five-dimensional rho^2 energy density term. At low energies, we obtain a Friedmann equation with a term linear to the energy density with, however, negative coefficient in the small four-brane radius limit (i.e. with negative effective Newton's constant). We discuss ways out of this problem.
