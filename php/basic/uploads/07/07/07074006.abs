Title: Two-loop Gell-Mann-Low function of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,  regularized by higher covariant derivatives
Authors: A. B. Pimenov and K. V. Stepanyantz
Abstract: Two-loop Gell-Mann-Low function is calculated for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, regularized by higher covariant derivatives. The integrals, which define it, are shown to be reduced to total derivatives and can be easily calculated analytically.
