Title: On the Eikonal Approximation in AdS Space
Authors: Richard C. Brower and Matthew J. Strassler and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: We explore the eikonal approximation to graviton exchange in AdS_5 space, as relevant to scattering in gauge theories. We restrict ourselves to the regime where conformal invariance of the dual gauge theory holds, and to large 't Hooft coupling where the computation involves pure gravity. We give a heuristic argument, a direct loop computation, and a shock wave derivation. The scalar propagator in AdS_3 plays a key role, indicating that even at strong coupling, two-dimensional conformal invariance controls high-energy four-dimensional gauge-theory scattering.
