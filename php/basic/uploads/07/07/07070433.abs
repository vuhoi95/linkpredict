Title: Unstable Semiclassical Trajectories in Tunneling
Authors: D. G. Levkov and A. G. Panin and S. M. Sibiryakov
Abstract: Some tunneling phenomena are described, in the semiclassical approximation, by unstable complex trajectories. We develop a systematic procedure to stabilize the trajectories and to calculate the tunneling probability, including both the suppression exponent and prefactor. We find that the instability of tunneling solutions modifies the power-law dependence of the prefactor on h as compared to the case of stable solutions.
