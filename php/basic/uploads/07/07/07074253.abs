Title: Holomorphic Poisson Manifolds and Holomorphic Lie Algebroids
Authors: Camille Laurent-Gengoux and Mathieu Stienon and Ping Xu
Abstract: We study holomorphic Poisson manifolds and holomorphic Lie algebroids from the viewpoint of real Poisson geometry. We give a characterization of holomorphic Poisson structures in terms of the Poisson Nijenhuis structures of Magri-Morosi and describe a double complex which computes the holomorphic Poisson cohomology. A holomorphic Lie algebroid structure on a vector bundle $A\to X$ is shown to be equivalent to a matched pair of complex Lie algebroids $(T^{0,1}X,A^{1,0})$, in the sense of Lu. The holomorphic Lie algebroid cohomology of $A$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of the elliptic Lie algebroid $T^{0,1}X\bowtie A^{1,0}$. In the case when $(X,\pi)$ is a holomorphic Poisson manifold and $A=(T^*X)_\pi$, such an elliptic Lie algebroid coincides with the Dirac structure corresponding to the associated generalized complex structure of the holomorphic Poisson manifold.
