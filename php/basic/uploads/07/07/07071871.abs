Title: Non-perturbative Yukawa Couplings from String Instantons
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Mirjam Cvetic and Dieter Lust and Robert Richter and Timo Weigand
Abstract: Non-perturbative D-brane instantons can generate perturbatively absent though phenomenologically relevant couplings for Type II orientifold compactifications with D-branes. We discuss the generation of the perturbatively vanishing SU(5) GUT Yukawa coupling of type 10 10 5_H. Moreover, for a simple globally consistent intersecting D6-brane model, we discuss the generation of mass terms for matter fields. This can serve as a mechanism for decoupling exotic matter.
