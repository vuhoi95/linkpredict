Title: Quasi-quantum groups from strings
Authors: J. -H. Jureit and T. Krajewski
Abstract: Motivated by string theory on the orbifold ${\cal M}/G$ in presence of a Kalb-Ramond field strength $H$, we define the operators that lift the group action to the twisted sectors. These operators turn out to generate the quasi-quantum group $D_{\omega}[G]$, introduced in the context of conformal field theory by R. Dijkgraaf, V. Pasquier and P. Roche, with $\omega$ a 3-cocycle determined by a series of cohomological equations in a tricomplex combining de Rham, \u{C}ech and group cohomologies. We further illustrate some properties of the quasi-quantum group from a string theoretical point of view.
