Title: Quantum Dynamics of the Taub Universe in a Generalized Uncertainty  Principle framework
Authors: Marco Valerio Battisti and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: The implications of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle on the Taub cosmological model are investigated. The model is studied in the ADM reduction of the dynamics and therefore a time variable is ruled out. Such a variable is quantized in a canonical way and the only physical degree of freedom of the system (related to the Universe anisotropy) is quantized by means of a modified Heisenberg algebra. The analysis is performed at both classical and quantum level. In particular, at quantum level, the motion of wave packets is investigated. The two main results obtained are as follows. i) The classical singularity is probabilistically suppressed. The Universe exhibits a stationary behavior and the probability amplitude is peaked in a determinate region. ii) The GUP wave packets provide the right behavior in the establishment of a quasi-isotropic configuration for the Universe.
