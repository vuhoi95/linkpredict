Title: Collision of high-energy closed strings: Formation of a ring-like  apparent horizon
Authors: Hirotaka Yoshino and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We study collisions of two high-energy closed strings in the framework of $D$-dimensional general relativity. The model of a high-energy closed string is introduced as a {/it pp}-wave generated by a ring-shaped source with the radius $R$. At the instant of the collision, the positions of two strings are assumed to coincide precisely. In this setup, we study the formation of two kinds of apparent horizons (AHs): the AH of topology $S^{D-2}$ (the black hole AH) and the AH of topology $S^1/times S^{D-3}$ (the black ring AH). These two AHs are solved numerically and the conditions for the formation of the two AHs are clarified in terms of the ring radius $R$. Specifically, we demonstrate that the black ring AH forms for sufficiently large $R$. The effects of an impact parameter and the relative orientation of incoming strings in more general cases are briefly discussed.
