Title: Double affine Hecke algebra in logarithmic conformal field theory
Authors: G. Mutafyan and I. Yu. Tipunin
Abstract: We construct the representation of Double Affine Hecke Algebra whose symmetrization gives the center of the quantum group U_q(sl(2)) and by Kazhdan--Lusztig duality the Verlinde algebra of (1,p) models of logarithmic conformal field theory.
