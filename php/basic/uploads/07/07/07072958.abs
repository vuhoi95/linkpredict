Title: Dynamical breaking of U(1)_{R} and supersymmetry in a metastable vacuum

Abstract: We consider the metastable N=1 QCD model of Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih (ISS), deformed by adding a baryon term to the superpotential. This simple deformation causes the spontaneous breaking of the approximate R-symmetry of the metastable vacuum. We then gauge the flavour SU(5)_f and identify it with the parent gauge symmetry of the Standard Model (SM). This implements direct mediation of supersymmetry breaking without the need for an additional messenger sector. A reasonable choice of parameters leads to gaugino masses of the right order. Finally, we speculate that the entire ``ISS x SM'' model should be interpreted as a magnetic dual of an (unknown) asymptotically free theory.
