Title: Reduction of static field equation of Faddeev model
Authors: Minoru Hirayama and Chang-Guang Shi
Abstract: A method to solve the static field equation of the Faddeev model is presented. For an special combination of the concerned field, we adopt a form which is compatible with the field equation and involves two arbitrary complex functions. As a result, the static field equation is reduced to a set of first order partial differential equations.
