Title: Thermodynamic duality between RN black hole and 2D dilaton gravity
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: All thermodynamic quantities of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole can be obtained from the dilaton and its potential of two dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. The dual relations of four thermodynamic laws are also established. Furthermore, the near-horizon thermodynamics of the extremal RN black hole is completely described by the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory which is obtained by perturbing around the AdS$_2$-horizon.
