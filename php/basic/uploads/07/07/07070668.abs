Title: Quantum Scattering of Giant Magnons
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Nick Dorey and Rui F. Lima Matos
Abstract: We perform a first-principles semi-classical computation of the one-loop corrections to the dispersion relation and S-matrix of Giant Magnons in AdS_5 x S^5 string theory. The results agree exactly with expectations based on the strong coupling expansion of the exact Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz equations. In particular we reproduce the Hernandez-Lopez term in the dressing phase.
