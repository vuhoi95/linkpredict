Title: Giant magnon bound states from strongly coupled N=4 SYM
Authors: David Berenstein and Samuel E. Vazquez
Abstract: We calculate in a very simple way the spectrum of giant magnon bound states at strong coupling in N=4 SYM, by utilizing the description of the field theory vacuum in terms of a condensate of eigenvalues of commuting matrices. We further show that these calculations can be understood in terms of the central charge extension that permits the calculation of BPS masses in the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM. This paper shows further evidence that the strong coupling expansion of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions can be done systematically from first principles, without the assumption of integrability.
