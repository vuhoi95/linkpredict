Title: Black Holes in Cascading Theories: Confinement/Deconfinement Transition  and other Thermal Properties
Authors: Manavendra Mahato and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Cesar A. Terrero-Escalante
Abstract: We present numerical evidence for a transition between the Klebanov-Strassler background and a solution describing a black hole in the class of cascading solutions in the chirally restored phase. We also present a number of properties of this solution, including the running of the coupling constant, the viscosity to entropy ratio and the drag force on a quark moving in this background.
