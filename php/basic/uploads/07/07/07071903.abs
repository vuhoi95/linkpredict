Title: Four-Loop Collinear Anomalous Dimension in N = 4 Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Freddy Cachazo and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We report a calculation in N = 4 Yang-Mills of the four-loop term g^4 in the collinear anomalous dimension g(lambda) which governs the universal subleading infrared structure of gluon scattering amplitudes. Using the method of obstructions to extract this quantity from the 1/epsilon singularity in the four-gluon iterative relation at four loops, we find g^4 = -1240.9 with an estimated numerical uncertainty of 0.02%. We also analyze the implication of our result for the strong coupling behavior of g(lambda), finding support for the string theory prediction computed recently by Alday and Maldacena using AdS/CFT.
