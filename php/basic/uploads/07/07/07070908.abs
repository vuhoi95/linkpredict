Title: Reheating and Cosmic String Production
Authors: Chao-Jun Feng and Xian Gao and Miao Li and Wei Song and Yushu Song
Abstract: We compute the string production rate at the end of inflation, using the string spectrum obtained in \lss in a near-de Sitter space. Our result shows that highly excited strings are hardly produced, thus the simple slow-roll inflation alone does not offer a cosmic string production mechanism.
