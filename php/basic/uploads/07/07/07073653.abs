Title: Self-Dual Yang-Mills Multiplet in Three Dimensions Coupled to  Supergravity
Authors: Roy Montalvo and Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We couple a recently-established N=1 globally supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills multiplet in three dimensions to supergravity. This becomes possible due to our previous result on globally supersymmetric formulation based on a compensator multiplet. We further couple the self-dual vector to a supersymmetric sigma-model on the coset SO(8,n) / SO(8) X SO(n) via minimal couplings for an arbitrary gauged subgroup H_0 \subset SO(8) X SO(n). A corresponding superspace formulation is also presented.
