Title: Closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor and geodesic integrability
Authors: Tsuyoshi Houri and Takeshi Oota and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: Assuming the existence of a single rank-2 closed conformal Killing-Yano tensor with a certain symmetry we show that there exist mutually commuting rank-2 Killing tensors and Killing vectors. We also discuss the condition of separation of variables for the geodesic Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
