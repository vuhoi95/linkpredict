Abstract: We show the factorization of the three-particle world-sheet S-matrix of AdS_5 x S^5 superstring theory in the near-flat-space limit at one loop order. This is done by computing various scattering amplitudes from Feynman diagrams in the world-sheet theory. The knowledge of certain highest weight amplitudes allows us to fix all the freedom in the three-particle S-matrix, which we argue to be constrained up to four scalar functions due to the symmetries of the model. We demonstrate that these amplitudes are given by corresponding products of the known two-particle S-matrix elements, from which it follows that the scattering of any three world-sheet excitations factorizes. This provides an explicit and direct check of the quantum integrability of string theory in near-flat AdS_5 x S^5 as it renders evidence for the existence of higher conserved charges. By computing further amplitudes we also obtain an indirect confirmation of the supersymmetries of the near-flat-space model.
