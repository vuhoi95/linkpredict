Title: Metastable Vacua and Complex Deformations
Authors: Radu Tatar and Ben Wetenhall
Abstract: We use the non-normalizable complex deformations to describe the stringy realizations of the metastable vacua in N = 1, SU(N_c) SUSY theories with N_f > N_c massive fundamental flavors. The consideration of the non-normalizable deformations requires a modified Toric duality. The new approach considers the tachyon condensation between pairs of wrapped D5 branes and anti D5 branes and the resulting mixing between some cycles in the geometry. We enlarge the class of metastable vacua to the case of branes-antibranes wrapped on cycles of deformed A_n singularities.
