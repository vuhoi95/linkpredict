Title: Consistent Kaluza-Klein Reductions for General Supersymmetric AdS  Solutions
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Oscar Varela
Abstract: For the most general supersymmetric solutions of type IIB supergravity consisting of a warped product of AdS_5 with a five-dimensional manifold M_5, we construct an explicit consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction on M_5 to minimal D=5 gauged supergravity. Thus, any solution of the gauged supergravity can be uplifted on M_5 to obtain an exact solution of type IIB supergravity. We also show that for general AdS_4 x SE_7 solutions, where SE_7 is a seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold, and for a general class of supersymmetric solutions that are a warped product of AdS_4 with a seven-dimensional manifold N_7, there is an analogous consistent reduction to minimal D=4 gauged supergravity.
