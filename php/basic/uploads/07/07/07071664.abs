Title: Multipoint correlation functions in Liouville field theory and minimal  Liouville gravity
Authors: V. A. Fateev and A. V. Litvinov
Abstract: We study n+3-point correlation functions of exponential fields in Liouville field theory with n degenerate and 3 arbitrary fields. An analytical expression for these correlation functions is derived in terms of Coulomb integrals. The application of these results to the minimal Liouville gravity is considered.
