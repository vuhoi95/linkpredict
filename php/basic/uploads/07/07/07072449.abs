Title: Hawking Radiation and Covariant Anomalies
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Shailesh Kulkarni
Abstract: Generalising the method of Wilczek and collaborators we provide a derivation of Hawking radiation from charged black holes using only covariant gauge and gravitational anomalies. The reliability and universality of the anomaly cancellation approach to Hawking radiation is also discussed.
