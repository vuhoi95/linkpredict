Title: On conformal Killing-Yano tensors for Plebanski-Demianski family of  solutions
Authors: David Kubiznak and Pavel Krtous
Abstract: We present the explicit expressions for the conformal Killing-Yano tensors for the Plebanski-Demianski family of type D solutions in four dimensions. Some physically important special cases are discussed in more detail. In particular, it is demonstrated how the conformal Killing-Yano tensor becomes the Killing-Yano tensor for the solutions without acceleration. A possible generalization into higher dimensions is studied. Whereas the transition from the nonaccelerating to accelerating solutions in four dimensions is achieved by the conformal rescaling of the metric, we show that such a procedure is not sufficiently general in higher dimensions - only the maximally symmetric spacetimes in 'accelerated' coordinates are obtained.
