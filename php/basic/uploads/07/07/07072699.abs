Title: Wilson loops: From four-dimensional SYM to two-dimensional YM
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Simone Giombi and Riccardo Ricci and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: In this note we study supersymmetric Wilson loops restricted to an S^2 submanifold of four-dimensional space in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We provide evidence from both perturbation theory and the AdS dual that those loops are equal to the analogous observables in two-dimensional Yang-Mills on S^2 (excluding non-perturbative contributions). This relates a subsector of N=4 SYM to a low-dimensional soluble model and also suggests that this subsector of N =4 SYM is invariant under area preserving diffeomorphisms.
