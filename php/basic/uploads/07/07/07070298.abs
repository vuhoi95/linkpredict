Abstract: We introduce new techniques based on brane tilings to investigate D3-branes probing orientifolds of toric Calabi-Yau singularities. With these new tools, one can write down many orientifold models and derive the resulting low-energy gauge theories living on the D-branes. Using the set of ideas in this paper one recovers essentially all orientifolded theories known so far. Furthermore, new orientifolds of non-orbifold toric singularities are obtained. The possible applications of the tools presented in this paper are diverse. One particular application is the construction of models which feature dynamical supersymmetry breaking as well as the computation of D-instanton induced superpotential terms.
