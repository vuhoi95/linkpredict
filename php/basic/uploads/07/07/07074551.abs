Title: Preon Model and Family Replicated E_6 Unification
Authors: Chitta Ranjan Das and Larisa V. Laperashvili
Abstract: Previously we suggested a new preon model of composite quark-leptons and bosons with the 'flipped' $E_6\times \widetilde{E_6}$ gauge symmetry group. We assumed that preons are dyons having both hyper-electric $g$ and hyper-magnetic $\tilde g$ charges, and these preons-dyons are confined by hyper-magnetic strings which are an ${\bf N}=1$ supersymmetric non-Abelian flux tubes created by the condensation of spreons near the Planck scale. In the present paper we show that the existence of the three types of strings with tensions $T_k=k T_0$ $(k = 1,2,3)$ producing three (and only three) generations of composite quark-leptons, also provides three generations of composite gauge bosons ('hyper-gluons') and, as a consequence, predicts the family replicated $[E_6]^3$ unification at the scale $\sim 10^{17}$ GeV. This group of unification has the possibility of breaking to the group of symmetry: $ [SU(3)_C]^3\times [SU(2)_L]^3\times [U(1)_Y]^3 \times [U(1)_{(B-L)}]^3$ which undergoes the breakdown to the Standard Model at lower energies. Some predictive advantages of the family replicated gauge groups of symmetry are briefly discussed.
