Title: T-duality and Generalized Kahler Geometry
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Itai Ryb and Rikard von Unge and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We use newly discovered N = (2, 2) vector multiplets to clarify T-dualities for generalized Kahler geometries. Following the usual procedure, we gauge isometries of nonlinear sigma-models and introduce Lagrange multipliers that constrain the field-strengths of the gauge fields to vanish. Integrating out the Lagrange multipliers leads to the original action, whereas integrating out the vector multiplets gives the dual action. The description is given both in N = (2, 2) and N = (1, 1) superspace.
