Title: On the role of twisted statistics in the noncommutative degenerate  electron gas
Authors: S. Khan and B. Chakraborty and F. G. Scholtz
Abstract: We consider the problem of a degenerate electron gas in the background of a uniformly distributed positive charge, ensuring overall neutrality of the system, in the presence of non-commutativity. In contrast to previous calculations that did not include twisted statistics, we find corrections to the ground state energy already at first order in perturbation theory when the twisted statistics is taken into account. These corrections arise since the interaction energy is sensitive to two particle correlations, which are modified for twisted anti-commutation relations.
