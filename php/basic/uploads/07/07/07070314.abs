Title: Interpolation of SUSY quantum mechanics
Authors: Satoru Odake and Yamac Pehlivan and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: Interpolation of two adjacent Hamiltonians in SUSY quantum mechanics $H_s=(1-s)A^{\dagger}A + sAA^{\dagger}$, $0\le s\le 1$ is discussed together with related operators. For a wide variety of shape-invariant degree one quantum mechanics and their `discrete' counterparts, the interpolation Hamiltonian is also shape-invariant, that is it takes the same form as the original Hamiltonian with shifted coupling constant(s).
