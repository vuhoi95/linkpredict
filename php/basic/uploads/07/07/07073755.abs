Title: Computation of determinants using contour integrals
Authors: Klaus Kirsten and Paul Loya
Abstract: It is shown how the pre-exponential factor of the Feynman propagator for a large class of potentials can be computed using contour integrals. This is of direct relevance in the context of tunnelling processes in quantum theories. The prerequisites for this analysis are accessible to advanced undergraduate students and involve only introductory courses in ordinary differential equations and complex variables.
