Title: AdS$_5$ rotating non-Abelian black holes
Authors: Y. Brihaye and E. Radu and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: We present arguments for the existence of charged, rotating black holes with equal magnitude angular momenta in $d=5$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with negative cosmological constant. These solutions posses a regular horizon of spherical topology and approach asymptotically the Anti-de Sitter spacetime background. The black hole solutions have also an electric charge and a nonvanishing magnetic flux through the sphere at infinity. Different from the static case, no regular solution with a nonvanishing angular momenta is found for a vanishing event horizon radius.
