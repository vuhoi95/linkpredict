Title: General Very Special Relativity is Finsler Geometry
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and Joaquim Gomis and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We ask whether Cohen and Glashow's Very Special Relativity model for Lorentz violation might be modified, perhaps by quantum corrections, possibly producing a curved spacetime with a cosmological constant. We show that its symmetry group ISIM(2) does admit a 2-parameter family of continuous deformations, but none of these give rise to non-commutative translations analogous to those of the de Sitter deformation of the Poincar\'e group: spacetime remains flat. Only a 1-parameter family DISIM_b(2) of deformations of SIM(2) is physically acceptable. Since this could arise through quantum corrections, its implications for tests of Lorentz violations via the Cohen-Glashow proposal should be taken into account. The Lorentz-violating point particle action invariant under DISIM_b(2) is of Finsler type, for which the line element is homogeneous of degree 1 in displacements, but anisotropic. We derive DISIM_b(2)-invariant wave equations for particles of spins 0, 1/2 and 1. The experimental bound, $|b|<10^{-26}$, raises the question ``Why is the dimensionless constant $b$ so small in Very Special Relativity?''
