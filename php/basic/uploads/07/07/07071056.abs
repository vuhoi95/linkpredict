Title: Black holes, parallelizable horizons and half-BPS states for the  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in five dimensions
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Alex Giacomini and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: Exact vacuum solutions with a nontrivial torsion for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in five dimensions are constructed. We consider a class of static metrics whose spacelike section is a warped product of the real line with a nontrivial base manifold endowed with a fully antisymmetric torsion. It is shown requiring solutions of this sort to exist, fixes the Gauss-Bonnet coupling such that the Lagrangian can be written as a Chern-Simons form. The metric describes black holes with an arbitrary, but fixed, base manifold. It is shown that requiring its ground state to possess unbroken supersymmetries, fixes the base manifold to be locally a parallelized three-sphere. The ground state turns out to be half-BPS, which could not be achieved in the absence of torsion in vacuum. The Killing spinors are explicitly found.
