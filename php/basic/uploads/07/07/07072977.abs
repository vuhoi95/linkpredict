Title: N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Multiplet in Non-Adjoint Representations
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We formulate a theory for N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet in a non-adjoint representation R of SO(N) as an important application of our recently-proposed model for N=1 supersymmetry. This system is obtained by dimensional reduction from an N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet in non-adjoint representation in ten dimensions. The consistency with supersymmetry requires that the non-adjoint representation R with the indices i, j, ... satisfy the three conditions \eta^{i j} = \delta^{i j}, (T^I)^{i j} = - (T^I)^{j i} and (T^I)^{[ i j |} (T^I)^{| k ] l} = 0 for the metric \eta^{i j} and the generators T^I, which are the same as the N=1 case.
