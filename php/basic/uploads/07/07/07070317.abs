Title: Signatures of black holes at the LHC
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Romulus Godang and Lucien M. Cremaldi and Donald J. Summers
Abstract: Signatures of black hole events at CERN's Large Hadron Collider are discussed. Event simulations are carried out with the Fortran Monte Carlo generator CATFISH. Inelasticity effects, exact field emissivities, color and charge conservation, corrections to semiclassical black hole evaporation, gravitational energy loss at formation and possibility of a black hole remnant are included in the analysis.
