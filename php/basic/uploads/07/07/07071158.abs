Title: Deconstructing the Little Hagedorn Holography
Authors: Jose L. F. Barbon and Carlos A. Fuertes and Eliezer Rabinovici
Abstract: We study aspects of the thermodynamics of Little String Theory, using its geometrical definition in critical ten-dimensional string theory. We find that bulk radiation effects tend to screen the Hagedorn behaviour of the theory, in contrast to the behaviour in the AdS system background. The resulting density of states of the system, when stable, is described by a seven-dimensional nonrelativistic gas. This requires modifications of the holographic Little Hagedorn picture. Using deconstructions we suggest such modifications. The model is embedded into a system which has an ultraviolet fixed point with an AdS description. We investigate the thermodynamical properties of these UV completed models. It is found that the Hagedorn regime survives in a finite band of superheated states that eventually decay into the plasma phase of the conformal field theory that serves as UV regulator. This is manifested in a first-order phase transition that is driven by radiative corrections.
