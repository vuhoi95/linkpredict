Title: P-term Strings and Semi-local Strings
Authors: C. Burrage and A. C. Davis
Abstract: P-term potentials can give rise to Nielsen-Olesen or semi-local cosmic strings. We present a general analysis of these cosmic strings where we derive the Bogomol'nyi equations and field profiles for both types of string and discuss their stability. We give an analysis of the fermionic zero modes that could live on the strings and a brief discussion of the inflationary period preceding their formation.
