Title: New constraints on Planck-scale Lorentz Violation in QED from the Crab  Nebula
Authors: Luca Maccione and Stefano Liberati and Annalisa Celotti and John G. Kirk
Abstract: We set constraints on O(E/M) Lorentz Violation in QED in an effective field theory framework. A major consequence of such assumptions is the modification of the dispersion relations for electrons/positrons and photons, which in turn can affect the electromagnetic output of astrophysical objects. We compare the information provided by multiwavelength observations with a full and self-consistent computation of the broad-band spectrum of the Crab Nebula. We cast constraints of order 10^{-5} at 95% confidence level on the lepton Lorentz Violation parameters.
