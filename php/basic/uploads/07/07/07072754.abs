Title: On the internal space dependence of the static quark-antiquark potential  in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM plasma wind
Authors: Harald Dorn and Thanh Hai Ngo
Abstract: We study the effect of the relative S^5-angle of a quark and an antiquark on their static potential and the related screening length in a strongly coupled moving ${\cal N}=4$ SYM plasma. The large velocity scaling law for the screening length holds for any relative S^5-angle $\theta$. However, the velocity independent prefactor Z strongly depends on $\theta$. For comparison with QCD we propose to average Z over all relative orientations on S^5. This generates a suppression factor relative to the case $\theta =0$.
