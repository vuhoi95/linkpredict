Title: Planar quark scattering at strong coupling and universality
Authors: Zohar Komargodski and Shlomo S. Razamat
Abstract: We discuss scattering of fundamental matter in the planar and strong coupling limit via the AdS/CFT correspondence, generalizing the recently proposed calculation for adjoint matter due to Alday and Maldacena [arXiv:0705.0303]. Color decomposition of quark amplitudes is a key property allowing to repeat the procedure in the case of fundamental matter and to derive the relation of these strong coupling amplitudes to minimal area problems. We present the results for two different D3-D7 systems, one is only conformal in the planar limit and the other is exactly conformal. Our results suggest a universal behavior of scattering amplitudes at strong coupling and planar limit (both for gluons and quarks).
