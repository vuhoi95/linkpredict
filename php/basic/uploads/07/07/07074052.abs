Title: Interacting Agegraphic Dark Energy
Authors: Hao Wei and Rong-Gen Cai
Abstract: A new dark energy model, named "agegraphic dark energy", has been proposed recently, based on the so-called K\'{a}rolyh\'{a}zy uncertainty relation, which arises from quantum mechanics together with general relativity. In this note, we extend the original agegraphic dark energy model by including the interaction between agegraphic dark energy and pressureless (dark) matter. In the interacting agegraphic dark energy model, there are many interesting features different from the original agegraphic dark energy model and holographic dark energy model. The similarity and difference between agegraphic dark energy and holographic dark energy are also discussed.
