Abstract: We present the first Monte Carlo results for supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics with sixteen supercharges at finite temperature. The recently proposed non-lattice simulation enables us to include the effects of fermionic matrices in a transparent and reliable manner. The internal energy nicely interpolates the weak coupling behavior obtained by the high temperature expansion, and the strong coupling behavior predicted from the dual black hole geometry. The Polyakov line takes large values even at low temperature suggesting the absence of a phase transition in sharp contrast to the bosonic case. These results provide highly non-trivial evidences for the gauge/gravity duality.
