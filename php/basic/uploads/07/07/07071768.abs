Abstract: We study the emission of fermion and gauge boson degrees of freedom on the brane by a rotating higher-dimensional black hole. Using matching techniques, for the near-horizon and far-field regime solutions, we solve analytically the corresponding field equations of motion. From this, we derive analytical results for the absorption probabilities and Hawking radiation emission rates, in the low-energy and low-rotation case, for both species of fields. We produce plots of these, comparing them to existing exact numerical results with very good agreement. We also study the total absorption cross-section and demonstrate that, as in the non-rotating case, it has a different behaviour for fermions and gauge bosons in the low-energy limit, while it follows a universal behaviour -- reaching a constant, spin-independent, asymptotic value -- in the high-energy regime.
