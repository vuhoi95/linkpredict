Title: Near-flat space limit and Einstein manifolds
Authors: Sergio Benvenuti and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We study the near-flat space limit for strings on AdS(5)xM(5), where the internal manifold M(5) is equipped with a generic metric with U(1)xU(1)xU(1) isometry. In the bosonic sector, the limiting sigma model is similar to the one found for AdS(5)xS(5), as the global symmetries are reduced in the most general case. When M(5) is a Sasaki-Einstein space like T(1,1), Y(p,q) and L(p,q,r), whose dual CFT's have N=1 supersymmetry, the near-flat space limit gives the same bosonic sector of the sigma model found for AdS(5)xS(5). This indicates the generic presence of integrable subsectors in AdS/CFT.
