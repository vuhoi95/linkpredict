Title: Analytic perturbation theory versus 1/N expansion in the Gross-Neveu  model
Authors: Alexander A. Osipov and Brigitte Hiller and Alex H. Blin
Abstract: The 1/N expansion can be successfully used to calculate the Green functions of the two-dimensional O(2N) Gross - Neveu model. In parallel, the methods of analytic perturbation theory are also applied. Comparing the results of these two calculations at leading order, we report on the surprising agreement between them.
