Title: Statefinder Diagnostic and w-w' Analysis for the Agegraphic Dark Energy  Models without and with Interaction
Authors: Hao Wei and Rong-Gen Cai
Abstract: A new dark energy model, named as ``agegraphic dark energy'', has been proposed by one of us (R. G. Cai) in arXiv:0707.4049, based on the K\'{a}rolyh\'{a}zy uncertainty relation, which arises from the quantum mechanics together with general relativity. Then, in arXiv:0707.4052, it has been extended by including the interaction between the agegraphic dark energy and the pressureless (dark) matter. In this note, we investigate the agegraphic dark energy models without and with interaction by means of statefinder diagnostic and w-w' analysis.
