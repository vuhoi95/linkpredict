Title: Coalescence of Rotating Black Holes on Eguchi-Hanson Space
Authors: Ken Matsuno and Hideki Ishihara and Masashi Kimura and Shinya Tomizawa
Abstract: We obtain new charged rotating multi-black hole solutions on the Eguchi-Hanson space in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system with a Chern-Simons term and a positive cosmological constant. In the two-black holes case, these solutions describe the coalescence of two rotating black holes with the spatial topologies of S^3 into a single rotating black hole with the spatial topology of the lens space S^3/Z_2. We discuss the differences in the horizon areas between our solutions and the two-centered Klemm-Sabra solutions which describe the coalescence of two rotating black holes with the spatial topologies of S^3 into a single rotating black hole with the spatial topology of S^3.
