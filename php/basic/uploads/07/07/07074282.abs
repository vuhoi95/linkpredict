Title: Matrix and vector models in the strong coupling limit
Authors: D. V. Bykov and A. A. Slavnov
Abstract: In this paper we consider matrix and vector models in the large N limit ($N \times N$ matrices and vectors with N^{2} components). For the case of zero-dimensional model (D=0) it is proved that in the strong coupling limit $g \to \infty$ statistical sums of both models coincide up to a coefficient. This is also true for D=1.
