Title: Noncommutative Inspired Reissner-Nordstr√∂m Black Holes in Large Extra  Dimensions
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and S. Hamid Mehdipour
Abstract: Recently, a new noncommutative geometry inspired solution of the coupled Einstein-Maxwell field equations including black holes in 4-dimension is found. In this paper, we generalize some aspects of this model to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) like geometries with large extra dimensions. We discuss Hawking radiation process based on noncommutative inspired solutions. In this framework, existence of black hole remnant and possibility of its detection in LHC are investigated.
