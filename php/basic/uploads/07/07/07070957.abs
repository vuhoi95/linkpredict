Title: Supergravity solutions with constant scalar invariants
Authors: A. Coley and A. Fuster and S. Hervik
Abstract: We study a class of constant scalar invariant (CSI) spacetimes, which belong to the higher-dimensional Kundt class, that are solutions of supergravity. We review the known CSI supergravity solutions in this class and we explicitly present a number of new exact CSI supergravity solutions, some of which are Einstein.
