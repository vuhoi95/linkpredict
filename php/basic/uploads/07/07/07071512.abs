Title: Mirror Duality in a Joyce Manifold
Authors: Selman Akbulut and Baris Efe and Sema Salur
Abstract: Previously the two of the authors defined a notion of dual Calabi-Yau manifolds in a G_2 manifold, and described a process to obtain them. Here we apply this process to a compact G_2 manifold, constructed by Joyce, and as a result we obtain a pair of Borcea-Voisin Calabi-Yau manifolds, which are known to be mirror duals of each other.
