Title: Stress Tensor of Static Dipoles in strongly coupled $\cal{N}$=4 Gauge  Theory
Authors: Shu Lin and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence we calculate the induced stress tensor of static dipoles (electric-electric and electric-magnetic) in a strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ SYM gauge theory, by solving the linearized Einstein equation with Maldecena string as a source. Analytic expressions are given for the far-field and a near-field close to one charge, and compared to what one has in weak coupling. The result can be compared to lattice results for QCD-like theories in a deconfined but strongly coupled regime.
