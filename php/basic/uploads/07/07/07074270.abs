Abstract: We investigate the emergence of supersymmetric negative-vacuum-energy ground states in four dimensions. First, we rely on the analysis of the effective superpotential, which depends on the background fluxes of the internal manifold, or equivalently has its origin in the underlying gauged supergravity. Four-dimensional, supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua with all moduli stabilized appear when appropriate Ramond and Neveu--Schwarz fluxes are introduced in IIA. Geometric fluxes are not necessary. Then the whole setup is analyzed from the perspective of the sources, namely D/NS-branes or Kaluza--Klein monopoles. Orientifold planes are also required for tadpole cancellation. The solutions found in four dimensions correspond to domain walls interpolating between AdS4 and flat spacetime. The various consistency conditions (equations of motion, Bianchi identities and tadpole cancellation conditions) are always satisfied, albeit with source terms. We also speculate on the possibility of assigning (formal) entropies to AdS4 flux vacua via the corresponding dual brane systems.
