Title: A Note on the Pfaffian Integration Theorem
Authors: Alexei Borodin and Eugene Kanzieper
Abstract: Two alternative, fairly compact proofs are presented of the Pfaffian integration theorem that is surfaced in the recent studies of spectral properties of Ginibre's Orthogonal Ensemble. The first proof is based on a concept of the Fredholm Pfaffian; the second proof is purely linear-algebraic.
