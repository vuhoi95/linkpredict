Title: Quantum mechanics on manifolds and topological effects
Authors: G. Morchio and F. Strocchi
Abstract: A unique classification of the topological effects associated to quantum mechanics on manifolds is obtained on the basis of the invariance under diffeomorphisms and the realization of the Lie-Rinehart relations between the generators of the diffeomorphism group and the algebra of infinitely differentiable functions on the manifold. This leads to a unique ("Lie-Rinehart") C* algebra as observable algebra; its regular representations are shown to be locally Schroedinger and in one to one correspondence with the unitary representations of the fundamental group of the manifold. Therefore, in the absence of spin degrees of freedom and external fields, the first homotopy group of the manifold appears as the only source of topological effects.
