Title: Hermite and Gegenbauer polynomials in superspace using Clifford analysis
Authors: Hendrik De Bie and Frank Sommen
Abstract: The Clifford-Hermite and the Clifford-Gegenbauer polynomials of standard Clifford analysis are generalized to the new framework of Clifford analysis in superspace in a merely symbolic way. This means that one does not a priori need an integration theory in superspace. Furthermore a lot of basic properties, such as orthogonality relations, differential equations and recursion formulae are proven. Finally, an interesting physical application of the super Clifford-Hermite polynomials is discussed, thus giving an interpretation to the super-dimension.
