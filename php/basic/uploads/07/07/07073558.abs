Title: Brane-World Black Hole Solutions via a Confining Potential
Authors: M. Heydari-Fard and H. Razmi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: Using a confining potential, we consider spherically symmetric vacuum (static black hole) solutions in a brane-world scenario. Working with a constant curvature bulk, two interesting cases/solutions are studied. A Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole solution similar to the standard solution in the presence of a cosmological constant is obtained which confirms the idea that an extra term in the field equations on the brane can play the role of a positive cosmological constant and may be used to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe. The other solution is one in which we can have a proper potential to explain the galaxy rotation curves without assuming the existence of dark matter and without working with new modified theories (modified Newtonian dynamics).
