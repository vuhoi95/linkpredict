Title: Confinement from gluodynamics in curved space-time
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: We determine the static potential for a heavy quark-antiquark pair from gluodynamics in curved space-time. Our calculation is done within the framework of the gauge-invariant, path-dependent, variables formalism. The potential energy is the sum of a Yukawa and a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static charges.
