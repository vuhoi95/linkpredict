Abstract: We consider the XXZ spin chain with diagonal boundary conditions in the framework of algebraic Bethe Ansatz. Using the explicit computation of the scalar products of Bethe states and a revisited version of the bulk inverse problem, we calculate the elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. In the limit of half-infinite chain, they are obtained as multiple integrals of usual functions, similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions.
