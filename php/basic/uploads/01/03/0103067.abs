Title: A Large N Duality via a Geometric Transition
Authors: F. Cachazo and K. Intriligator and C. Vafa
Abstract: We propose a large N dual of 4d, N=1 supersymmetric, SU(N) Yang-Mills with adjoint field \Phi and arbitrary superpotential W(\Phi). The field theory is geometrically engineered via D-branes partially wrapped over certain cycles of a non-trivial Calabi-Yau geometry. The large N, or low-energy, dual arises from a geometric transition of the Calabi-Yau, where the branes have disappeared and have been replaced by suitable fluxes. This duality yields highly non-trivial exact results for the gauge theory. The predictions indeed agree with expected results in cases where it is possible to use standard techniques for analyzing the strongly coupled, supersymmetric gauge theories. Moreover, the proposed large N dual provides a simpler and more unified approach for obtaining exact results for this class of supersymmetric gauge theories.
