Title: Energy-momentum Tensors in Matrix Theory and in Noncommutative Gauge  Theories
Authors: Yuji Okawa and Hirosi Ooguri
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor of Matrix Theory is derived by computing disk amplitudes with one closed string and an arbitrary number of open strings and by taking the DKPS limit. We clarify its relation to the energy-momentum tensor of the noncommutative gauge theory derived in our previous paper.
