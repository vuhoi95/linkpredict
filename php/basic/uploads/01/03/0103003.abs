Title: A Remark on Topological Charges over the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Harald Grosse and Christian W. Rupp
Abstract: We determine the Chern characters of two projective modules over the fuzzy sphere and calculate the corresponding topological charges (Chern numbers). These turn out to have corrections - compared to the commutative limit - induced by the noncommutative structure of the three coordinates.
