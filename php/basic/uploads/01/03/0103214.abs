Title: Toric complete intersections and weighted projective space
Authors: Maximilian Kreuzer and Erwin Riegler and David Sahakyan
Abstract: It has been shown by Batyrev and Borisov that nef partitions of reflexive polyhedra can be used to construct mirror pairs of complete intersection Calabi--Yau manifolds in toric ambient spaces. We construct a number of such spaces and compute their cohomological data. We also discuss the relation of our results to complete intersections in weighted projective spaces and try to recover them as special cases of the toric construction. As compared to hypersurfaces, codimension two more than doubles the number of spectra with $h^{11}=1$. Alltogether we find 87 new (mirror pairs of) Hodge data, mainly with $h^{11}\le4$.
