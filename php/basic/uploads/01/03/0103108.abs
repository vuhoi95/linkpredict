Title: The Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Taub-Bolt-AdS Spacetimes
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Soussan Mokhtari
Abstract: We consider the conformal field theory which is dual to the Taub-Bolt-AdS spacetime. It is shown that the Cardy-Verlinde formula for the entropy of the conformal field theory agrees precisely with the entropy of the Taub-Bolt-AdS spacetime, at high temperatures. This result may be viewed as providing a conformal field theory interpretation of Taub-Bolt-AdS entropy.
