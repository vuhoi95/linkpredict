Title: Geometric Stability of Brane-worlds
Authors: M. D. Maia and E. M. Monte
Abstract: The stability conditions for coordinate gauge independent perturbations of brane-worlds are analyzed. It is shown that, these conditions lead to the Einstein-Hilbert dynamics and to a confined gauge potential, independently of models and metric ansatzes. The size of the extra dimensions are estimated without assuming a fixed topology. The quantum modes corresponding to high frequency gravitational waves are defined through a canonical structure.
