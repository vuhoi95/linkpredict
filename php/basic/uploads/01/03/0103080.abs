Title: Supergravity duals of gauge theories from F(4) gauged supergravity in  six dimensions
Authors: Carlos Nunez and I. Y. Park and Martin Schvellinger and Tuan A. Tran
Abstract: We construct supergravity solutions dual to twisted field theories that are the worldvolume theories of D4-branes wrapped on 2, 3-cycles, and NS-fivebranes on 3-cycles. We first obtain the solutions for the Romans' six-dimensional gauged supergravity theories and then up-lift them to ten dimensions. In particular, we find solutions for field configurations with either non-Abelian fields or B-fields being excited. One of these solutions, in the massless case, is up-lifted to the massless type IIA string theory. This is the first example of such a kind. The cases studied provide new examples of the AdS/CFT duality involving twisted field theories.
