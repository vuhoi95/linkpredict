Title: Large-N_c meson theory
Authors: Shin-Ichiro Kuroki and Keiichi Morikawa and Takuya Morozumi
Abstract: We derive an effective Lagrangian for meson fields. This is done in the light-cone gauge for two-dimensional large-N_c QCD by using the bilocal auxiliary field method. The auxiliary fields are bilocal on light-cone space and their Fourier transformation determines the parton momentum distribution. As the first test of our method, the 't Hooft equation is derived from the effective Lagrangian.
