Abstract: Starting from a recently proposed Abelian topological model in (2+1) dimensions, which involve the Kalb-Ramond two form field, we study a non-Abelian generalization of the model. An obstruction for generalization is detected. However we show that the goal is achieved if we introduce a vectorial auxiliary field. Consequently, a model is proposed, exhibiting a non-Abelian topological mass generation mechanism in D=3, that provides mass for the Kalb-Ramond field. The covariant quantization of this model requires ghosts for ghosts. Therefore in order to quantize the theory we construct a complete set of BRST and anti-BRST equations using the horizontality condition.
