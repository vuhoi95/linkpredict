Title: HQET quark-gluon vertex at one loop
Authors: A. I. Davydychev and A. G. Grozin
Abstract: We calculate the HQET quark-gluon vertex at one loop, for arbitrary external momenta, in an arbitrary covariant gauge and space-time dimension. Relevant results and algorithms for the three-point HQET integrals are presented. We also show how one can obtain the HQET limit directly from QCD results for the quark-gluon vertex.
