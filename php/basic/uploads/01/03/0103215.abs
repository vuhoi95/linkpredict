Title: Affleck-Dine baryogensis in large extra dimensions
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: Baryogenesis in the models where the fundamental scale is as low as TeV in the context of large extra dimensions is a challenging problem. The requirement for the departure from thermal equilibrium necessarily ties any low scale baryogenesis with that of a successful inflationary model which automatically provides the out of equilibrium condition after the end of inflation. However, it is also noticeable that in these models the reheat temperature of the Universe is strongly constrained from the overproduction of Kaluza-Klein modes, which enforces a very low reheat temperature. In this paper we describe a possible scenario for baryogenesis which has a similar characteristics of an Affleck-Dine field. We notice that in order to have an adequate baryon to entropy ratio one requires to promote this Affleck-Dine field to reside in the bulk.
