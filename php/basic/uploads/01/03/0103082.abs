Title: Holographic Trace Anomaly and Cocycle of Weyl Group
Authors: R. Manvelyan and R. Mkrtchyan and H. J. W. Mueller-Kirsten
Abstract: The behavior of the divergent part of the bulk AdS/CFT effective action is considered with respect to the special finite diffeomorphism transformations acting on the boundary as a Weyl transformation of the boundary metric. The resulting 1-cocycle of the Weyl group is in full agreement with the 1-cocycle of the Weyl group obtained from the cohomological consideration of the effective action of the corresponding CFT.
