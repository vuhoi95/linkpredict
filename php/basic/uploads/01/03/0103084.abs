Title: ADE-Quiver Theories and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: C. Albertsson and B. Brinne and U. Lindstrom and M. Rocek and R. von Unge
Abstract: We show that the Higgs branch of a four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, with gauge and matter content summarised by an ADE quiver diagram, is identical to the generalised Coulomb branch of a four-dimensional superconformal strongly coupled gauge theory with ADE global symmetry. This equivalence suggests the existence of a mirror symmetry between the quiver theories and the strongly coupled theories.
