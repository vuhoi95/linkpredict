Title: Dirac Operator on the Quantum Sphere
Authors: A. Pinzul and A. Stern
Abstract: We construct a Dirac operator on the quantum sphere $S^2_q$ which is covariant under the action of $SU_q(2)$. It reduces to Watamuras' Dirac operator on the fuzzy sphere when $q\to 1$. We argue that our Dirac operator may be useful in constructing $SU_q(2)$ invariant field theories on $S^2_q$ following the Connes-Lott approach to noncommutative geometry.
