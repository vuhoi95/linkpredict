Title: Supersymmetric Model with Grassmann-odd Lagrangian
Authors: D. V. Soroka and V. A. Soroka and J. Wess
Abstract: A supersymmetric $D = 1, N =1$ model with a Grassmann-odd Lagrangian is proposed which, in contrast to the model with an even Lagrangian, contains not only a kinetic term but also an interaction term for the coordinates entering into one real scalar Grassmann-even (bosonic) superfield.
