Title: From Surface Roughening to QCD String Theory
Authors: K. Jimmy Juge and Julius Kuti and Colin Morningstar
Abstract: Surface critical phenomena and the related onset of Goldstone modes represent fundamental properties of the confining flux in Quantum Chromodynamics. New ideas on surface roughening and their implications for lattice studies of quark confinement and string formation are presented. Problems with a simple string description of the large Wilson surface are discussed.
