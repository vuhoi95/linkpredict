Title: Heavy quark induced effective action for gauge fields in the SU(N_c) x  U(1) model and the low-energy structure of heavy quark current correlators
Authors: S. Groote and A. A. Pivovarov
Abstract: We calculate the low-energy limit of heavy quark current correlators within an expansion in the inverse heavy quark mass. The induced low-energy currents built from the gluon fields corresponding to the initial heavy quark currents are obtained from an effective action for gauge fields in the one-loop approximation at the leading order of the 1/m expansion. Explicit formulae for the low-energy spectra of electromagnetic and tensor heavy quark current correlators are given. Consequences of the appearance of a nonvanishing spectral density below the two-particle threshold for high precision phenomenology of heavy quarks are discussed quantitatively.
