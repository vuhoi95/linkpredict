Title: Aspects of Gauge Theory on Commutative and Noncommutative Tori
Authors: Zachary Guralnik and Jan Troost
Abstract: We study aspects of gauge theory on tori which are a consequences of Morita equivalence. In particular we study the behavior of gauge theory on noncommutative tori for arbitrarily close rational values of Theta. For such values of Theta, there are Morita equivalent descriptions in terms of Yang-Mills theories on commutative tori with very different magnetic fluxes and rank. In order for the correlators of open Wilson lines to depend smoothly on Theta, the correlators of closed Wilson lines in the commutative Yang-Mills theory must satisfy strong constraints. If exactly satisfied, these constraints give relations between small and large N gauge theories. We verify that these constraints are obeyed at leading order in the 1/N expansion of pure 2-d QCD and of strongly coupled N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
