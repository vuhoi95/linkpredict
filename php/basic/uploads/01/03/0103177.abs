Title: Orientifold dual for stuck NS5 branes
Authors: Bo Feng and Yang-Hui He and Andreas Karch and Angel Uranga
Abstract: We establish T-duality between NS5 branes stuck on an orientifold 8-plane in type I' and an orientifold construction in type IIB with D7 branes intersecting at angles. Two applications are discussed. For one we obtain new brane constructions, realizing field theories with gauge group a product of symplectic factors, giving rise to a large new class of conformal N=1 theories embedded in string theory. Second, by studying a D2 brane probe in the type I' background, we get some information on the still elusive (0,4) linear sigma model describing a perturbative heterotic string on an ADE singularity.
