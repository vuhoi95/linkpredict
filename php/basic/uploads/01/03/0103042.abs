Title: High Spin Gauge Fields and Two-Time Physics
Authors: Itzhak Bars and Cemsinan Deliduman
Abstract: All possible interactions of a point particle with background electromagnetic, gravitational and higher-spin fields is considered in the two-time physics worldline formalism in (d,2) dimensions. This system has a counterpart in a recent formulation of two-time physics in non-commutative field theory with local Sp(2) symmetry. In either the worldline or field theory formulation, a general Sp(2) algebraic constraint governs the interactions, and determines equations that the background fields of any spin must obey. The constraints are solved in the classical worldline formalism (h-bar=0 limit) as well as in the field theory formalism (all powers of h-bar). The solution in both cases coincide for a certain 2T to 1T holographic image which describes a relativistic particle interacting with background fields of any spin in (d-1,1) dimensions. Two disconnected branches of solutions exist, which seem to have a correspondence as massless states in string theory, one containing low spins in the zero Regge slope limit, and the other containing high spins in the infinite Regge slope limit.
