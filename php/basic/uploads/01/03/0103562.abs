Title: Landau Diamagnetism in Noncommutative Space and the Nonextensive  Thermodynamics of Tsallis
Authors: O. F. Dayi and A. Jellal
Abstract: We consider the behavior of electrons in an external uniform magnetic field B where the space coordinates perpendicular to B are taken as noncommuting. This results in a generalization of standard thermodynamics. Calculating the susceptibility, we find that the usual Landau diamagnetism is modified. We also compute the susceptibility according to the nonextensive statistics of Tsallis for (1-q)<<1, in terms of the factorization approach. Two methods agree under certain conditions.
