Title: Giant non-linearities accompanying electromagnetically induced  transparency
Authors: Le-Man Kuang and Guang-Hong Chen and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: We develop a fully quantum treatment of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a vapor of three-level $\Lambda$-type atoms. Both the probe and coupling lasers with arbitrary intensities are quantized, and treated on the same footing. In addition to reproducing known results on ultraslow pulse propagation at the lowest order in the ratio of their Rabi frequencies, our treatment uncovers that the atomic medium with EIT exhibits giant Kerr as well as higher order non-linearities. Enhancement of many orders of magnitude is predicted for higher-order refractive-index coefficients.
