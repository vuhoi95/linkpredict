Title: Absence of Higher Order Corrections to Noncommutative Chern-Simons  Coupling
Authors: Ashok Das and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We analyze the structure of noncommutative pure Chern-Simons theory systematically in the axial gauge. We show that there is no IR/UV mixing in this theory in this gauge. In fact, we show, using the usual BRST identities as well as the identities following from vector supersymmetry, that this is a free theory. As a result, the tree level Chern-Simons coefficient is not renormalized. It also holds that the Chern-Simons coefficient is not modified at finite temperature. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that the ghosts completely decouple in the axial gauge in a noncommutative gauge theory.
