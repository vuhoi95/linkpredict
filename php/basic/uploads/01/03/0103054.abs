Title: Broken Supersymmetric Shape Invariant Systems and Their Potential  Algebras
Authors: Asim Gangopadhyaya and Jeffry V. Mallow and Uday P. Sukhatme
Abstract: Although eigenspectra of one dimensional shape invariant potentials with unbroken supersymmetry are easily obtained, this procedure is not applicable when the parameters in these potentials correspond to broken supersymmetry, since there is no zero energy eigenstate. We describe a novel two-step shape invariance approach as well as a group theoretic potential algebra approach for solving such broken supersymmetry problems.
