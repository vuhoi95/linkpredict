Title: Modular transformation and boundary states in logarithmic conformal  field theory
Authors: Shinsuke Kawai and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We study the $c=-2$ model of logarithmic conformal field theory in the presence of a boundary using symplectic fermions. We find boundary states with consistent modular properties. A peculiar feature of this model is that the vacuum representation corresponding to the identity operator is a sub-representation of a ``reducible but indecomposable'' larger representation. This leads to unusual properties, such as the failure of the Verlinde formula. Despite such complexities in the structure of modules, our results suggest that logarithmic conformal field theories admit bona fide boundary states.
