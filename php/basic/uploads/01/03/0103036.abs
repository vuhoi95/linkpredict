Abstract: We obtain (3+1) and (3+2) dimensional global flat embeddings of (2+1) uncharged and charged black strings, respectively. In particular, the charged black string, which is the dual solution of the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes, is shown to be embedded in the same global embedding Minkowski space structure as that of the (2+1) charged de Sitter black hole solution.
