Title: Supersymmetric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models and Jack  superpolynomials
Authors: P. Desrosiers and L. Lapointe and P. Mathieu
Abstract: A new generalization of the Jack polynomials that incorporates fermionic variables is presented. These Jack superpolynomials are constructed as those eigenfunctions of the supersymmetric extension of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) model that decomposes triangularly in terms of the symmetric monomial superfunctions. Many explicit examples are displayed. Furthermore, various new results have been obtained for the supersymmetric version of the CMS models: the Lax formulation, the construction of the Dunkl operators and the explicit expressions for the conserved charges. The reformulation of the models in terms of the exchange-operator formalism is a crucial aspect of our analysis.
