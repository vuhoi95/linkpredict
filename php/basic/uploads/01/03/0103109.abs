Title: The Semi-Classical Relativistic Darwin Potential for Spinning Particles  in the Rest-Frame Instant Form: 2-Body Bound States with Spin 1/2  Constituents
Authors: D. Alba and H. Crater and L. Lusanna
Abstract: In the semiclassical approximation of Grassmann-valued electric charges for regularizing Coulomb self-energies, we extract the unique acceleration-independent interaction hidden in any Lienard-Wiechert solution for the system of N positive-energy spinning particles plus the electromagnetic field in the radiation gauge of the rest-frame instant form. With the help of a semiclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, this allows us to find the relativistic semiclassical Darwin potential. In the 2-body case the quantization of the lowest order reproduces exactly the results from the reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation.
