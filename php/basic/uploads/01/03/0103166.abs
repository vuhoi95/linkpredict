Abstract: We investigate systems of real scalar fields in bidimensional spacetime, dealing with potentials that are small modifications of potentials that admit supersymmetric extensions. The modifications are controlled by a real parameter, which allows implementing a perturbation procedure when such parameter is small. The approach allows obtaining the energy and topological charge in closed forms, up to first order in the parameter. We illustrate the procedure with some examples. In particular, we show how to remove the degeneracy in energy for the one-field and the two-field solutions that appear in a model of two real scalar fields.
