Title: On the holographic duals of N=1 gauge dynamics
Authors: J. Sonnenschein and A. Loewy
Abstract: We analyze the holographic description of several properties of $\N=1$ confining gauge dynamics. In particular we discuss Wilson loops including the issues of a Luscher term and the broadening of the flux tubes, 't Hooft loops, baryons, instantons, chiral symmetry breaking, the gluino condensate and BPS domain walls.
