Title: Hybrid Inflation and Baryogenesis at the TeV Scale
Authors: Edmund J. Copeland and David Lyth and Arttu Rajantie and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We consider the construction of inverted hybrid inflation models in which the vacuum energy during inflation is at the TeV scale, and the inflaton couples to the Higgs field. Such models are of interest in the context of some recently proposed models of electroweak baryogenesis. We demonstrate how constraints on these models arise from quantum corrections, and how self-consistent examples may be constructed, albeit at the expense of fine-tuning. We discuss two possible ways in which the baryon asymmetry of the universe may be produced in these models. One of them is based on preheating and a consequent non-thermal electroweak symmetry restoration and the other on the formation of Higgs winding configurations by the Kibble mechanism at the end of inflation.
