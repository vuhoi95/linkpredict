Title: Scalar gravitational waves and Einstein frame
Authors: S. Bellucci and V. Faraoni and D. Babusci
Abstract: The response of a gravitational wave detector to scalar waves is analysed in the framework of the debate on the choice of conformal frames for scalar-tensor theories. A correction to the geodesic equation arising in the Einstein conformal frame modifies the geodesic deviation equation. This modification is due to the non-metricity of the theory in the Einstein frame, yielding a longitudinal mode that is absent in the Jordan conformal frame.
