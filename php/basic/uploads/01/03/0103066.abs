Title: A Vector Non-abelian Chern-Simons Duality
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez
Abstract: Abelian Chern-Simons gauge theory is known to possess a `$S$-self-dual' action where its coupling constant $k$ is inverted {\it i.e.} $k \leftrightarrow {1 \over k}$. Here a vector non-abelian duality is found in the pure non-abelian Chern-Simons action at the classical level. The dimensional reduction of the dual Chern-Simons action to two-dimensions constitutes a dual Wess-Zumino-Witten action already given in the literature.
