Title: KÃ¤hler geometry and SUSY mechanics
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: We present two examples of SUSY mechanics related with K\"ahler geometry. The first system is the N=4 supersymmetric one-dimensional sigma-model proposed in hep-th/0101065. Another system is the N=2 SUSY mechanics whose phase space is the external algebra of an arbitrary K\"ahler manifold. The relation of these models with antisymplectic geometry is discussed.
