Title: After bulky brane inflation
Authors: Jun'ichi Yokoyama and Yoshiaki Himemoto
Abstract: Reheating or entropy production on the three-brane from a decaying bulk scalar field is studied in the brane-world picture of the Universe. It is shown that a significant amount of dark radiation is produced in this process unless only the specific modes are excited, so that subsequent entropy production within the brane is required in general before primordial nucleosynthesis.
