Title: The Cosmological Moduli Problem and Preheating
Authors: G. F. Giudice and A. Riotto and I. Tkachev
Abstract: Many models of supersymmetry breaking, in the context of either supergravity or superstring theories, predict the presence of particles with Planck-suppressed couplings and masses around the weak scale. These particles are generically called moduli. The excessive production of moduli in the early Universe jeopardizes the successful predictions of nucleosynthesis. In this paper we show that the efficient generation of these dangerous relics is an unescapable consequence of a wide variety of inflationary models which have a preheating stage. Moduli are generated as coherent states in a novel way which differs from the usual production mechanism during parametric resonance. The corresponding limits on the reheating temperature are often very tight and more severe than the bound of 10^9 GeV coming from the production of moduli via thermal scatterings during reheating.
