Title: Discrete Symmetries and Localization in a Brane-world
Authors: R. Casadio and A. Gruppuso
Abstract: Discrete symmetries are studied in warped space-times with one extra dimension. In particular, we analyze the compatibility of five- and four-dimensional charge conjugation, parity, time reversal and the orbifold symmetry Z_2 with localization of fermions on the four-dimensional brane-world and Lorentz invariance. We then show that, when a suitable topological scalar field (the ``kink'') is included, fermion localization is a consequence of (five-dimensional) CPT invariance.
