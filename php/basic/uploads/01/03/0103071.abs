Title: The Quantum Newton's Law
Authors: A. Bouda and T. Djama
Abstract: Using the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation within the framework of the equivalence postulate, we construct a Lagrangian of a quantum system in one dimension and derive a third order equation of motion representing a first integral of the quantum Newton's law. We then integrate this equation in the free particle case and compare our results to those of Floydian trajectories. Finally, we propose a quantum version of Jacobi's theorem.
