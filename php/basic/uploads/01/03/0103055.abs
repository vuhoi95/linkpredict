Title: N=2 Supersymmetric Integrable Hierarchies: Additional Symmetries and  Darboux-Backlund Solutions
Authors: Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: We study additional non-isospectral symmetries of constrained (reduced) N=2 supersymmetric KP hierarchies of integrable ``soliton''-like evolution equations. These symmetries are shown to form an infinite-dimensional non-Abelian superloop superalgebra. Furthermore we study the general Darboux-Backlund (DB) transformations (including adjoint-DB and binary DB) of N=2 super- KP hierarchies preserving (most of) the additional symmetries. Also we derive the explicit form of the general DB (N=2 ``super- soliton''-like) solutions in the form of generalized Wronskian-like super-determinants.
