Title: *-Products on Quantum Spaces
Authors: Hartmut Wachter and Michael Wohlgenannt
Abstract: In this paper we present explicit formulas for the *-product on quantum spaces which are of particular importance in physics, i.e., the q-deformed Minkowski space and the q-deformed Euclidean space in 3 and 4 dimensions, respectively. Our formulas are complete and formulated using the deformation parameter q. In addition, we worked out an expansion in powers of h=lnq up to second order, for all considered cases.
