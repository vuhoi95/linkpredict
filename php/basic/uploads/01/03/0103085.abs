Title: Open string field theory without open strings
Authors: Ian Ellwood and Washington Taylor
Abstract: Witten's cubic open string field theory is expanded around the perturbatively stable vacuum, including all scalar fields at levels 0, 2, 4 and 6. The (approximate) BRST cohomology of the theory is computed, giving strong evidence for the absence of physical open string states in this vacuum.
