Abstract: The possibility of generating a color superconducting state in 2+1 dimensional QCD is analyzed. The gap equation in the leading, hard-dense loop improved, one-gluon exchange approximation is derived and solved. The magnitude of the order parameter is proportional to a power of the coupling constant. For an asymptotically large chemical potential, a qualitatevely new (with respect to the 3+1 dimensional case) phenomenon of nondecoupling of the fermion pairing dynamics from the infrared one is revealed and discussed.
