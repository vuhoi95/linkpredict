Title: Inflation Induced by Vacuum Energy and Graceful Exit from it
Authors: E. Papantonopoulos and I. Pappa
Abstract: Motivated by brane cosmology we solve the Einstein equations with a time dependent cosmological constant. Assuming that at an early epoch the vacuum energy scales as $1/logt $, we show that the universe passes from a fast growing phase (inflation) to an expanding phase in a natural way.
