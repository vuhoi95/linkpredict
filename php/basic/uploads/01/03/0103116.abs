Title: Fully Off-shell Effective Action and its Supersymmetry in Matrix Theory
Authors: Y. Kazama and T. Muramatsu
Abstract: As a step toward clarification of the power of supersymmetry (SUSY) in Matrix theory, a complete calculation, including all the spin effects, is performed of the effective action of a probe D-particle, moving along an arbitrary trajectory in interaction with a large number of coincident source D-particles, at one loop at order 4 in the derivative expansion. Furthermore, exploiting the SUSY Ward identity developed previously, the quantum-corrected effective supersymmetry transformation laws are obtained explicitly to the relevant order and are used to verify the SUSY-invariance of the effective action. Assuming that the agreement with 11-dimensional supergravity persists, our result can be regarded as a prediction for supergravity calculation, which, yet unavailable, is known to be highly non-trivial.
