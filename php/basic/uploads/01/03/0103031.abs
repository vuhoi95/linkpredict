Title: A Solitonic 3-Brane in 6D Bulk
Authors: Olindo Corradini and Zurab Kakushadze
Abstract: We construct a solitonic 3-brane solution in the 6-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a (negative) cosmological term. This solitonic brane world is delta-function-like. Near the brane the metric is that for a product of the 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space with a 2-dimensional ``wedge'' with a deficit angle (which depends on the solitonic brane tension). Far from the brane the metric approaches that for a product of the 5-dimensional AdS space and a circle. This solitonic solution exists for a special value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling (for which we also have a delta-function-like codimension-1 solitonic solution), and the solitonic brane tension can take values in a continuous range. We discuss various properties of this solitonic brane world, including coupling between gravity and matter localized on the brane.
