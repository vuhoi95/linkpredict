Title: Non-commutative D- and M-brane Bound States
Authors: Boris Kors and Dieter Lust and Andre Miemiec
Abstract: We analyze certain brane bound states in M-theory and their descendants in type IIA string theory, all involving 3-form or 2-form background fluxes. Among them are configurations which represent NCYM, NCOS and ODp-theories in the scaling limit of OM-theory. In particular, we show how the conditions for the embedding to preserve supersymmetry are modified by the presence of the flux and discuss their relations for the various different bound states. Via the formalism of geometric quantization such a deformation of a supersymmetric cycle is related to a non-commutativity of its coordinates. We also study possible non-commutative deformations of the Seiberg-Witten curve of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories due to non-trivial H-flux.
