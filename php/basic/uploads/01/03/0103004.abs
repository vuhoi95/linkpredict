Title: Dualities in integrable systems: geometrical aspects
Authors: A. Gorsky and V. Rubtsov
Abstract: We discuss geometrical aspects of different dualities in the integrable systems of the Hitchin type and its various generalizations. It is shown that T duality known in the string theory context is related to the separation of variables procedure in dynamical system. We argue that there are analogues of S duality as well as mirror symmetry in the many-body systems of Hitchin type. The different approaches to the double elliptic systems are unified using the geometry behind the Mukai-Odesskii algebra.
