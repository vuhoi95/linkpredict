Title: $κ$--deformed Wigner construction of relativistic wave functions  and free fields on $κ$-Minkowski space
Authors: P. Kosiński and J. Lukierski and P. Maślanka
Abstract: We describe the extension of the Wigner`s infinite-dimensional unitary representations of Poincar\'{e} group to the case of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group. We show that the corresponding coordinate wave functions on noncommutative space-time are described by free field equations on $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space. The cases of Klein--Gordon, Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields are considered. Finally some aspects of second quantization are also discussed.
