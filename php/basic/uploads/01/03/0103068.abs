Title: M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds with background flux
Authors: Michael Haack and Jan Louis
Abstract: We perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction of M-theory on warped Calabi-Yau fourfolds with non-trivial four-form flux turned on. The resulting scalar- and superpotential is computed and compared with the superpotential obtained by Gukov, Vafa and Witten using different methods.
