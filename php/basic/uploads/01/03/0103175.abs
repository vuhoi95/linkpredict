Title: New remarks on the linear constraint self-dual boson and Wess-Zumino  terms
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Alvaro de Souza Dutra
Abstract: In this work we prove in a precise way that the soldering formalism can be applied to the Srivastava chiral boson (SCB), in contradiction with some results appearing in the literature. We have promoted a canonical transformation that shows directly that the SCB is composed of two Floreanini-Jackiw's particles with the same chirality which spectrum is a vacuum-like one. As another conflictive result we have proved that a Wess-Zumino term used in the literature consists of the scalar field, once again denying the assertion that the WZ term adds a new degree of freedom to the SCB theory in order to modify the physics of the system.
