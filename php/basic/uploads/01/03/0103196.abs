Title: Noncommutative Solitons in Open N=2 String Theory
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander D. Popov and Bernd Spendig
Abstract: Coincident D2-branes in open N=2 fermionic string theory with a B-field background yield an integrable modified U(n) sigma model on noncommutative R^{2,1}. This model provides a showcase for an established method (the `dressing approach') to generate solutions for integrable field equations, even in the noncommutative case. We demonstrate the technique by constructing moving U(1) and U(2) solitons and by computing their energies. It is outlined how to derive multi-soliton configurations with arbitrary relative motion; they correspond to D0-branes moving inside the D2-branes.
