Title: A family of quantum interiors for ordinary and stringy black holes II:  Geometric considerations and global properties
Authors: E. Elizalde and Sergi R. Hildebrandt
Abstract: A family of spacetimes suitable for describing the matter conditions of a static, spherically symmetric quantum vacuum is studied, as well as its reliability for describing a regular model for the interior of a semiclassical, static black hole ---without ever invoking a mass shell for the final object. In paper I, this condition was seen to limit the search to only one, distinguished family, that was investigated in detail. Here it will be proven that, aside from being mathematically generic (in its uniqueness), this family exhibits beautiful physical properties, that one would reasonably demand from a collapse process, including the remarkable result that isotropization may take place conveniently far from the (unavoidable) regularization scale. The analysis is also extended in order to include the possibility of a stringy core, always within the limits imposed by the semiclassical approach to gravitation. This constitutes a first approximation to the final goal of trying to characterize a regular, self-gravitating, stringy black hole.
