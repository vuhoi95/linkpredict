Title: Two-Loop Self-Energy and Multiple Scattering at Finite Temperature
Authors: J. I. Kapusta and S. M. H. Wong
Abstract: One and two loop self-energies are worked out explicitly for a heavy scalar field interacting weakly with a light self-interacting scalar field at finite temperature. The ring/daisy diagrams and a set of necklace diagrams can be summed simultaneously. This simple model serves to illustrate the connection between multi-loop self-energy diagrams and multiple scattering in a medium.
