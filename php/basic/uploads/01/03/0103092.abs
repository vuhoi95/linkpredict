Title: Integrable Supersymmetric Fluid Mechanics from Superstrings
Authors: Y. Bergner and R. Jackiw
Abstract: Following the construction of a model for the planar supersymmetric Chaplygin gas, supersymmetric fluid mechanics in (1+1)-dimensions is obtained from the light-cone parametrized Nambu-Goto superstring in (2+1)-dimensions. The lineal model is completely integrable and can be formulated neatly using Riemann coordinates. Infinite towers of conserved charges and supercharges are exhibited. They form irreducible representations of a dynamical (hidden) SO(2,1) symmetry group.
