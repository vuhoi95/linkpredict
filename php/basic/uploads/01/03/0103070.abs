Title: Shortcuts in the fifth dimension
Authors: Robert R. Caldwell and David Langlois
Abstract: If our Universe is a three-brane embedded in a five-dimensional anti-deSitter spacetime, in which matter is confined to the brane and gravity inhabits an infinite bulk space, then the causal propagation of luminous and gravitational signals is in general different. A gravitational signal traveling between two points on the brane can take a ``shortcut'' through the bulk, and appear quicker than a photon traveling between the same two points along a geodesic on the brane. Similarly, in a given time interval, a gravitational signal can propagate farther than a luminous signal. We quantify this effect, and analyze the impact of these shortcuts through the fifth dimension on cosmology.
