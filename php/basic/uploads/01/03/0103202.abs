Title: Coupled fields in external background with application to nonthermal  production of gravitinos
Authors: Hans Peter Nilles and Marco Peloso and Lorenzo Sorbo
Abstract: We provide the formalism for the quantization of systems of coupled bosonic and fermionic fields in a time dependent classical background. The occupation numbers of the particle eigenstates can be clearly defined and computed, through a generalization of the standard procedure valid for a single field in which Bogolyubov coefficients are employed. We apply our formalism to the problem of nonthermal gravitino production in a two-fields model where supersymmetry is broken gravitationally in the vacuum. Our explicit calculations show that this production is strongly suppressed in the model considered, due to the weak coupling between the sector which drives inflation and the one responsible for supersymmetry breakdown.
