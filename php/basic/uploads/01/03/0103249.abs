Title: The C-Theorem and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Asymptotically Free  Vectorlike Gauge Theories
Authors: R. D. Ball and P. H. Damgaard
Abstract: We confront Cardy's suggested c-function for four-dimensional field theories with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetries in asymptotically free vectorlike gauge theories with fermions transforming according to different representations under the gauge group. Assuming that the infrared limit of the c-function is determined by the dimension of the associated Goldstone manifold, we find that this c-function always decreases between the ultraviolet and infrared fixed points.
