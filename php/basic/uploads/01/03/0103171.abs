Title: Deconstructing de Sitter
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Petr Horava and Djordje Minic
Abstract: Semiclassical gravity predicts that de Sitter space has a finite entropy. We suggest a picture for Euclidean de Sitter space in string theory, and use the AdS/CFT correspondence to argue that de Sitter entropy can be understood as the number of degrees of freedom in a quantum mechanical dual.
