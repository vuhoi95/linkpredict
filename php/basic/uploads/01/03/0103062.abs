Title: On the thin-string limit of the 6d stringlike defect model
Authors: Peter Tinyakov and Katarzyna Zuleta
Abstract: We show that in 6d models localizing gravity on stringlike defects and satisfying the dominant energy condition, the metric exterior to the string inevitably depends on the string's thickness. As a consequence, in the limit of thin string either the gravity delocalizes, or the six-dimensional Planck scale must be much larger that the four-dimensional one.
