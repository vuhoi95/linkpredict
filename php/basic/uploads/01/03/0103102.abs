Title: Boundary Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Vasilis Niarchos and Nikolaos Prezas
Abstract: Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism we provide a detailed analysis of the NS sector of boundary superstring field theory. We construct explicitly the relevant BV structure and derive the master action. Furthermore, we show that this action is exactly equal to the superdisk worldsheet partition function as was recently conjectured.
