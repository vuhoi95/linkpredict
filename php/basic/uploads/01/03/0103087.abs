Title: Currents and charges for mixed fields
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Petr Jizba and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We present an analysis of currents and charges for a system of two mixed fields, both for spinless bosons and for Dirac fermions. This allows us to obtain in a straightforward way the exact field theoretical oscillation formulas exhibiting corrections with respect to the usual ones derived in quantum mechanics.
