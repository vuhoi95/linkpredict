Title: Super Liouville Black Holes
Authors: J. Kamnitzer and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We describe in superspace a classical theory of of two dimensional $(1,1)$ dilaton supergravity coupled to a super-Liouville field, and find exact super black hole solutions to the field equations that have non-constant curvature. We consider the possibility that a gravitini condensate forms and look at the implications for the resultant spacetime structure. We find that all such condensate solutions have a condensate and/or naked curvature singularity.
