Title: Higher-Derivative Gravity and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and So Matsuura and Tadakatsu Sakai
Abstract: We investigate the AdS/CFT correspondence for higher-derivative gravity systems, and develop a formalism in which the generating functional of the boundary field theory is given as a functional that depends only on the boundary values of bulk fields. We also derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-like equation that uniquely determines the generating functional, and give an algorithm calculating the Weyl anomaly. Using the expected duality between a higher-derivative gravity system and N=2 superconformal field theory in four dimensions, we demonstrate that the resulting Weyl anomaly is consistent with the field theoretic one.
