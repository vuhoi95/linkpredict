Title: Remarks on Time-Space Noncommutative Field Theories
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and J. L. F. Barbon and R. Zwicky
Abstract: We propose a physical interpretation of the perturbative breakdown of unitarity in time-like noncommutative field theories in terms of production of tachyonic particles. These particles may be viewed as a remnant of a continuous spectrum of undecoupled closed-string modes. In this way, we give a unified view of the string-theoretical and the field-theoretical no-go arguments against time-like noncommutative theories. We also perform a quantitative study of various locality and causality properties of noncommutative field theories at the quantum level.
