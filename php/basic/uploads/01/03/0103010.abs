Title: Creation operators and Bethe vectors of the osp(1|2) Gaudin model
Authors: P. P. Kulish and N. Manojlovic
Abstract: Gaudin model based on the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1|2) is studied. The eigenvectors of the osp(1|2) invariant Gaudin hamiltonians are constructed by algebraic Bethe Ansatz. Corresponding creation operators are defined by a recurrence relation. Furthermore, explicit solution to this recurrence relation is found. The action of the creation operators on the lowest spin vector yields Bethe vectors of the model. The relation between the Bethe vectors and solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation of the corresponding super-conformal field theory is established.
