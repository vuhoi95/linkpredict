Title: Instanton interactions in dense-matter QCD
Authors: D. T. Son and M. A. Stephanov and A. R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: A Coulomb gas representation of dense-matter QCD is derived from a dual transformation of the low-energy effective Lagrangian. The point-like charges Q=+1,-1 of the gas are identified with the instantons and anti-instantons of such topological charges. An instanton repels another instanton with the same force as it attracts an anti-instanton, in contrast to the semiclassical interaction.
