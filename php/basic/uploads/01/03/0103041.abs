Title: Complete factorization of equations of motion in supersymmetric field  theories
Authors: D. Bazeia and J. Menezes and M. M. Santos
Abstract: We investigate bosonic sectors of supersymmetric field theories. We consider superpotentials described by one and by two real scalar fields, and we show how the equations of motion can be factorized into a family of first order Bogomol'nyi equations, so that all the topological defects are of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield type. We examine explicit models, that engender the Z_N symmetry, and we identify all the topological sectors, illustrating their integrability.
