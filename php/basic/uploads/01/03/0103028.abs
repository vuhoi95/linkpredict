Title: Sfermion masses in Nelson-Strassler type of models: SUSY standard models  coupled with SCFTs
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Haruhiko Terao
Abstract: We study soft SUSY breaking parameters in the Nelson-Strassler type of models: SUSY standard models coupled with SCFTs. In this type of models, soft SUSY breaking parameters including sfermion masses can be suppressed around the decoupling scale of SCFTs. We clarify the condition to derive exponential suppression of sfermion masses within the framework of pure SCFTs. Such behavior is favorable for degeneracy of sfermion masses. However, the realistic sfermion masses are not quite degenerate due to the gauge couplings and the gaugino masses in the SM sector. We show the sfermion mass spectrum obtained in such models. The aspect of suppression for the soft SUSY breaking parameters is also demonstrated in an explicit model. We also give a mechanism generating the $\mu$-term of the Electro-Weak scale by a singlet field coupled with the SCFT.
