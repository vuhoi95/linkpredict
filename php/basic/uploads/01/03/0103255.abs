Title: Stability of Massive Cosmological Gravitons
Authors: S. Deser and A. Waldron
Abstract: We analyze the physics of massive spin 2 fields in (A)dS backgrounds and exhibit that: The theory is stable only for masses m^2 >= 2\Lambda/3, where the conserved energy associated with the background timelike Killing vector is positive, while the instability for m^2<2\Lambda/3 is traceable to the helicity 0 energy. The stable, unitary, partially massless theory at m^2=2\Lambda/3 describes 4 propagating degrees of freedom, corresponding to helicities (+/-2,+/-1) but contains no 0 helicity excitation.
