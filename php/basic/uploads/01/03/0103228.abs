Title: A simplified model for monopole catalysis of nucleon decay
Authors: Y. Brihaye and V. A. Rubakov and D. H. Tchrakian and F. Zimmerschied
Abstract: We present a simple model where a nucleon is treated as the Skyrmion, both monopole and Skyrmion are smooth solutions of the classical field equations,the baryon number non-conservation is explicitly built in and is due to the classical analogue of the triangle anomaly, and there is no necessity to consider leptons. We show by numerical analysis that there are no static classical solutions with non-zero baryon number on top of the monopole, i.e., that the monopole catalysis of Skyrmion decay indeed proceeds classically.
