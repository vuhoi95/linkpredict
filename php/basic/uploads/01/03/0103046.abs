Title: Skyrmions on the Two-Sphere
Authors: M. de Innocentis and R. S. Ward
Abstract: We study static solutions of the Skyrme model on the two-sphere of radius L, for various choices of potential. The high-density Skyrmion phase corresponds to the ratio beta=L/(size of Skyrmion) being small, whereas the low-density phase corresponds to beta being large. The transition between these two phases, and in particular the behaviour of a relevant order parameter, is examined.
