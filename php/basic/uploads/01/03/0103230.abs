Abstract: We show that certain classes of apparently unprotected operators in N=4 SYM_4 do not receive quantum corrections as a consequence of a partial non-renormalization theorem for the 4-point function of chiral primary operators. We develop techniques yielding the asymptotic expansion of the 4-point function of CPOs up to order O(\lambda^2) and we perform a detailed OPE analysis. Our results reveal the existence of new non-renormalized operators of approximate dimension 6.
