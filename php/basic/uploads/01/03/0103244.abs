Title: Cosmological Perturbations with Multiple Fluids and Fields
Authors: J. Hwang and H. Noh
Abstract: We consider the evolution of perturbed cosmological spacetime with multiple fluids and fields in Einstein gravity. Equations are presented in gauge-ready forms, and are presented in various forms using the curvature (\Phi or \phi_\chi) and isocurvature (S_{(ij)} or \delta \phi_{(ij)}) perturbation variables in the general background with K and \Lambda. We clarify the conditions for conserved curvature and isocurvature perturbations in the large-scale limit. Evolutions of curvature perturbations in many different gauge conditions are analysed extensively. In the multi-field system we present a general solution to the linear order in slow-roll parameters.
