Title: Vibration modes of giant gravitons in the background of dilatonic  D-branes
Authors: Jin Young Kim and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We consider the perturbation of giant gravitons in the background of dilatonic D-branes whose geometry is not of a conventional form of ${\rm AdS}_m \times {\rm S}^n$. We use the quadratic approximation to the brane action to investigate their vibrations around the equilibrium configuration. We found the normal modes of small vibrations of giant gravitons and these vibrations are turned out to be stable.
