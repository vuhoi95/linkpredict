Title: Multi-Field Generalisations of the Klein-Gordon Theory associated with  p-Branes
Authors: David B. Fairlie and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to initiate a study of a class of Lorentz invariant, yet tractable, Lagrangian Field Theories which may be viewed as an extension of the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian to many scalar fields in a novel manner. These Lagrangians are quadratic in the Jacobians of the participating fields with respect to the base space co-ordinates. In the case of two fields, real valued solutions of the equations of motion are found and a phenomenon reminiscent of instanton behaviour is uncovered; an ansatz for a subsidiary equation which implies a solution of the full equations yields real solutions in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Each of these is associated with a spherical harmonic function.
