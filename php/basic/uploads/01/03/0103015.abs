Title: The Uniqueness of the Abelian Born-Infeld Action
Authors: Lies De Fosse and Paul Koerber and Alexander Sevrin
Abstract: Starting from BPS solutions to Yang-Mills which define a stable holomorphic vector bundle, we investigate its deformations. Assuming slowly varying fieldstrengths, we find in the abelian case a unique deformation given by the abelian Born-Infeld action. We obtain the deformed Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau stability condition to all orders in alpha'. This result provides strong evidence supporting the claim that the only supersymmetric deformation of the abelian d=10 supersymmetric Yang-Mills action is the Born-Infeld action.
