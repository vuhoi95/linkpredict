Abstract: The gravity duals of nonlocal field theories in the large N limit exhibit a novel behavior near the boundary. To explore this, we present and study the duals of dipole theories - a particular class of nonlocal theories with fundamental dipole fields. The nonlocal interactions are manifest in the metric of the gravity dual and type-0 string theories make a surprising appearance. We compare the situation to that in noncommutative SYM.
