Title: Comments on supergravity dual of pure N=1 Super Yang Mills theory with  unbroken chiral symmetry
Authors: Alex Buchel and Andrew Frey
Abstract: Maldacena and Nunez [hep-th/0008001] identified a gravity solution describing pure N=1 Yang-Mills (YM) in the IR. Their (smooth) supergravity solution exhibits confinement and the U(1)_R chiral symmetry breaking of the dual YM theory, while the singular solution corresponds to the gauge theory phase with unbroken U(1)_R chiral symmetry. In this paper we discuss supersymmetric type IIB compactifications on resolved conifolds with torsion. We rederive singular background of [hep-th/0008001] directly from the supersymmetry conditions. This solution is the relevant starting point to study non-BPS backgrounds dual to the high temperature phase of pure YM. We construct the simplest black hole solution in this background. We argue that it has a regular Schwarzschild horizon and provides a resolution of the IR singularity of the chirally symmetric extremal solution as suggested in [hep-th/0011146].
