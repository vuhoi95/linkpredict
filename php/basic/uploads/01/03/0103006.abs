Title: Anomalies and Schwinger terms in NCG field theory models
Authors: E. Langmann and J. Mickelsson and S. Rydh
Abstract: We study the quantization of chiral fermions coupled to generalized Dirac operators arising in NCG Yang-Mills theory. The cocycles describing chiral symmetry breaking are calculated. In particular, we introduce a generalized locality principle for the cocycles. Local cocycles are by definition expressions which can be written as generalized traces of operator commutators. In the case of pseudodifferential operators, these traces lead in fact to integrals of ordinary local de Rham forms. As an application of the general ideas we discuss the case of noncommutative tori. We also develop a gerbe theoretic approach to the chiral anomaly in hamiltonian quantization of NCG field theory.
