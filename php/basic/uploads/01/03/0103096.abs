Title: Strong-weak coupling duality in anisotropic current interactions
Authors: Denis Bernard and Andre' LeClair
Abstract: The recently proposed all orders beta function is further investigated. By using a strong-weak coupling duality of the beta function, and some added topology of the space of couplings we are able to extend the flows to arbitrarily large or small scales. Using a non-trivial RG invariant we are able to identify sine-Gordon, sinh-Gordon and Kosterlitz-Thouless phases. We also find an additional phase with cyclic or roaming RG trajectories.
