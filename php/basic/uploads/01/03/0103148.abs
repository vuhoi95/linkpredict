Title: Massive fermion production in nonsingular superstring cosmology
Authors: Shinji Tsujikawa and Hiroki Yajima
Abstract: We study massive spin-1/2 fermion production in nonsingular superstring cosmology, taking into account one-loop quantum corrections to a superstring effective action with dilaton and modulus fields. While no creation occurs in the massless limit, massive fermions can be produced by the existence of a time-dependent frequency. Due to the increase of the Hubble expansion rate during the modulus-driven phase, the occupation of number of fermions continues to grow until the point of the graceful exit, after which fermion creation ceases with the decrease of the Hubble rate.
