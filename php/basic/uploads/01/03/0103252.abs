Title: Constructing Infinite Particle Spectra
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and A. Fring
Abstract: We propose a general construction principle which allows to include an infinite number of resonance states into a scattering matrix of hyperbolic type. As a concrete realization of this mechanism we provide new S-matrices generalizing a class of hyperbolic ones, which are related to a pair of simple Lie algebras, to the elliptic case. For specific choices of the algebras we propose elliptic generalizations of affine Toda field theories and the homogeneous sine-Gordon models. For the generalization of the sinh-Gordon model we compute explicitly renormalization group scaling functions by means of the c-theorem and the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. In particular we identify the Virasoro central charges of the corresponding ultraviolet conformal field theories.
