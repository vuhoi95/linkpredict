Title: On Domain Walls of N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills in Four Dimensions
Authors: Bobby Acharya and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We study the BPS domain walls of supersymmetric Yang-Mills for arbitrary gauge group. We describe the degeneracies of domain walls interpolating between arbitrary pairs of vacua. A recently proposed large N duality sheds light on various aspects of such domain walls. In particular, for the case of G = SU(N) the domain walls correspond to wrapped D-branes giving rise to a 2+1 dimensional U(k) gauge theory on the domain wall with a Chern-Simons term of level N. This leads to a counting of BPS degeneracies of domain walls in agreement with expected results.
