Title: Classical-to-critical crossovers from field theory
Authors: C. Bagnuls and C. Bervillier
Abstract: We extent the previous determinations of nonasymptotic critical behavior of Phys. Rev B32, 7209 (1985) and B35, 3585 (1987) to accurate expressions of the complete classical-to-critical crossover (in the 3-d field theory) in terms of the temperature-like scaling field (i.e., along the critical isochore) for : 1) the correlation length, the susceptibility and the specific heat in the homogeneous phase for the n-vector model (n=1 to 3) and 2) for the spontaneous magnetization (coexistence curve), the susceptibility and the specific heat in the inhomogeneous phase for the Ising model (n=1). The present calculations include the seventh loop order of Murray and Nickel (1991) and closely account for the up-to-date estimates of universal asymptotic critical quantities (exponents and amplitude combinations) provided by Guida and Zinn-Justin [J. Phys. A31, 8103 (1998)].
