Title: The Boundary State Formalism and Conformal Invariance in Off-shell  String Theory
Authors: M. Laidlaw and G. W. Semenoff
Abstract: We present a generalization of the boundary state formalism for the bosonic string that allows us to calculate the overlap of the boundary state with arbitrary closed string states. We show that this generalization exactly reproduces world-sheet sigma model calculations, thus giving the correct overlap with both on- and off-shell string states, and that this new boundary state automatically satisfies the requirement for integrated vertex operators in the case of non-conformally invariant boundary interactions.
