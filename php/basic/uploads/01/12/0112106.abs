Title: Elliptic supertube and a Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield  D2-brane--anti-D2-brane Pair
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Phillial Oh
Abstract: An exact solution, in which a D2-brane and an anti-D2-brane are connected by an elliptically tubular D2-brane, is obtained without any junction condition. The solution is shown to preserve one quarter of the supersymmetries of the type-IIA Minkowski vacuum. We show that the configuration cannot be obtained by "blowing-up" from some inhomogeneously D0-charged superstrings. The BPS bound tells us that it is rather composed of D0-charged D2-brane-anti-D2-brane pair and a strip of superstrings connecting them. We obtain the correction to the charges of the string end points in the constant magnetic background.
