Title: The Seiberg-Witten prepotential and the Euler class of the reduced  moduli space of instantons
Authors: R. Flume and R. Poghossian and H. Storch
Abstract: The n-instanton contribution to the Seiberg-Witten prepotential of N=2 supersymmetric d=4 Yang Mills theory is represented as the integral of the exponential of an equivariantly exact form. Integrating out an overall scale and a U(1) angle the integral is rewritten as (4n-3) fold product of a closed two form. This two form is, formally, a representative of the Euler class of the Instanton moduli space viewed as a principal U(1) bundle, because its pullback under bundel projection is the exterior derivative of an angular one-form.
