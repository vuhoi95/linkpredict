Title: [SU(5)]^3 SUSY unification
Authors: L. Laperashvili and D. A. Ryzhikh
Abstract: In the present paper we demonstrate the possibility of the [SUSY(5)]^3 SUSY unification at the energy scale $\mu_{GUT}\approx 10^{18.3} GeV$ with the value of GUT inverse finestructure constant $\alpha_{GUT}^{-1}\approx 34.4$, which is very close to its critical value $\alpha_{5, crit}^{-1}\approx 34.0$, existing at the Planck scale.
