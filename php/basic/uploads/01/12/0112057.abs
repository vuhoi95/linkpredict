Title: Non local Thirring model with backward and umklapp interactions
Authors: V. I. Fernández and C. A. Iucci and C. M. Naón
Abstract: We extend a non local and non covariant version of the Thirring model in order to describe a many-body system with backward and umklapp scattering processes. We express the vacuum to vacuum functional in terms of a non trivial fermionic determinant. Using path-integral methods we find a bosonic representation for this determinant which allows us to obtain an effective action for the collective excitations of the system. By introducing a non local version of the self-consistent harmonic approximation, we get an expression for the gap of the charge-density excitations as functional of arbitrary electron-electron potentials. As an example we also consider the case of a non contact umklapp interaction.
