Title: Nonlinear Supersymmetry
Authors: Sergey M. Klishevich and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: After a short discussion of the intimate relation between the generalized statistics and supersymmetry, we review the recent results on the nonlinear supersymmetry obtained in the context of the quantum anomaly problem and of the universal algebraic construction associated with the holomorphic nonlinear supersymmetry.
