Title: Non-Gaussianity from Inflation
Authors: N. Bartolo and S. Matarrese and A. Riotto
Abstract: Correlated adiabatic and isocurvature perturbation modes are produced during inflation through an oscillation mechanism when extra scalar degrees of freedom other than the inflaton field are present. We show that this correlation generically leads to sizeable non-Gaussian features both in the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. The non-Gaussianity is first generated by large non-linearities in some scalar sector and then efficiently transferred to the inflaton sector by the oscillation process. We compute the cosmic microwave background angular bispectrum, providing a characteristic feature of such inflationary non-Gaussianity,which might be detected by upcoming satellite experiments.
