Title: Implications of bulk causality for holography in AdS
Authors: Matthew Kleban and John McGreevy and Scott Thomas
Abstract: Gravitational time delay in asymptotically Anti de Sitter spaces has consequences for holographic duality. We argue that the requirement of bulk causality implies that it is not possible for a collection of boundary observers, performing local measurements, to extract information from precursors. Using similar arguments, we derive an integrated weak energy constraint on spacetimes which can admit a holographic dual.
