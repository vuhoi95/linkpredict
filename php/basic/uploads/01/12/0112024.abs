Title: Can one restore Lorentz invariance in quantum N=2 string?
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Anton Galajinsky
Abstract: We consider quantum N=2 string embedded into the N=4 topological framework from the perspective of the old covariant quantisation. Making use of the causality and cyclic symmetry of tree amplitudes we argue that no Lorentz covariant boson emission vertex can be constructed within the N=4 topological formalism.
