Title: Collective excitations at the boundary of a 4D quantum Hall droplet
Authors: Jiangping Hu and Shou-Cheng Zhang
Abstract: In this work we investigate collective excitations at the boundary of a recently constructed 4D quantum Hall state. Local bosonic operators for creating these collective excitations can be constructed explicitly. Massless relativistic wave equations with helicity $S$ can be derived exactly for these operators from their Heisenberg equation of motion. For the S=1 and S=2 cases these equations reduce to the free Maxwell and linearized Einstein equation respectively. These collective excitations can be interpreted as hydrodynamical modes at the boundary of the 4D QHE droplet. Outstanding issues are critically discussed.
