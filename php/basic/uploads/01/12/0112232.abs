Title: Comments on Bosonization of the extended Thirring Model with SU(2)  Symmetry
Authors: J. Sakamoto and K. Mano
Abstract: Bosonization of the extended Thirring model with SU(2) symmetry in the Minkowski path integral method is discussed. We argue that it is not an easy task to bosonize such a model if we derive correctly the fermion determinant which is induced with the decoupling transformation because it seems that there arise ghost fields. This is contrary to what is shown in a textbook and some people believe.
