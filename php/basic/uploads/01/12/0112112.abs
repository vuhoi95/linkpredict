Title: Warped Solitonic Deformations and Propagation of Black Holes in 5D  Vacuum Gravity
Authors: Sergiu I. Vacaru and D. Singleton
Abstract: In this paper we use the anholonomic frames method to construct exact solutions for vacuum 5D gravity with metrics having off-diagonal components. The solutions are in general anisotropic and possess interesting features such as an anisotropic warp factor with respect to the extra dimension, or a gravitational scaling/running of some of the physical parameters associated with the solutions. A certain class of solutions are found to describe Schwarzschild black holes which ``solitonically'' propagate in spacetime. The solitonic character of these black hole solutions arises from the embedding of a 3D soliton configuration (e.g. the soliton solutions to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvily or sine-Gordon equations) into certain ansatz functions of the 5D metric. These solitonic solutions may either violate or preserve local Lorentz invariance. In addition there is a connection between these solutions and noncommutative field theory.
