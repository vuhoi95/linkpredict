Title: Low Momentum Scattering in the Dirac Equation
Authors: Norman Dombey and Piers Kennedy
Abstract: It is shown that the amplitude for reflection of a Dirac particle with arbitrarily low momentum incident on a potential of finite range is -1 and hence the transmission coefficient T=0 in general. If however the potential supports a half-bound state at k=0 this result does not hold. In the case of an asymmetric potential the transmission coefficient T will be non-zero whilst for a symmetric potential T=1.
