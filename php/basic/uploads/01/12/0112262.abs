Title: Conformal Covariantization of Moyal-Lax Operators
Authors: Ming-Hsien Tu and Niann-Chern Lee and Yu-Tung Chen
Abstract: A covariant approach to the conformal property associated with Moyal-Lax operators is given. By identifying the conformal covariance with the second Gelfand-Dickey flow, we covariantize Moyal-Lax operators to construct the primary fields of one-parameter deformation of classical $W$-algebras.
