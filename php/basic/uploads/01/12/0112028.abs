Title: Spinors and Space-Time Anisotropy
Authors: Sergiu Vacaru and Panayiotis Stavrinos
Abstract: This is the first monograph on the geometry of anisotropic spinor spaces and its applications in modern physics. The main subjects are the theory of gravity and matter fields in spaces provided with off--diagonal metrics and associated anholonomic frames and nonlinear connection structures, the algebra and geometry of distinguished anisotropic Clifford and spinor spaces, their extension to spaces of higher order anisotropy and the geometry of gravity and gauge theories with anisotropic spinor variables. The book summarizes the authors' results and can be also considered as a pedagogical survey on the mentioned subjects.
