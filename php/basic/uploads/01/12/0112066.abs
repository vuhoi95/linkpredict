Title: The de Sitter/Anti- de Sitter Black Holes phase transition?
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We investigate the Schwarzschild-Anti-deSitter (SAdS) and SdS BH thermodynamics in 5d higher derivative gravity. The interesting feature of higher derivative gravity is the possibility for negative (or zero) SdS (or SAdS) BH entropy which depends on the parameters of higher derivative terms. The appearence of negative entropy may indicate a new type instability where a transition between SdS (SAdS) BH with negative entropy to SAdS (SdS) BH with positive entropy would occur or where definition of entropy should be modified.
