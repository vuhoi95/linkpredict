Title: Dirac Quantization of Some Singular Theories
Authors: A Shirzad and P Moyassari
Abstract: Analyzing the constraint structure of electrodynamics, massive vector bosons, Dirac fermions and electrodynamics coupled to fermions, we show that Dirac quantization method leads to appropriate creation-annihilation algebra among the Forier coefficients of the fields.
