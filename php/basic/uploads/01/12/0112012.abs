Title: Relativistic Gravity With a Dynamical Preferred Frame
Authors: David Mattingly and Ted Jacobson
Abstract: While general relativity possesses local Lorentz invariance, both canonical quantum gravity and string theory suggest that Lorentz invariance may be broken at high energies. Broken Lorentz invariance has also been postulated as an explanation for astrophysical anomalies such as the missing GZK cutoff. Therefore, we seek an effective field theory description of gravity where Lorentz invariance is broken. We will construct a candidate theory and then briefly discuss some of the implications.
