Title: Dielectric Fundamental Strings in Matrix String Theory
Authors: Dominic Brecher and Bert Janssen and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: Matrix string theory is equivalent to type IIA superstring theory in the light-cone gauge, together with extra degrees of freedom representing D-brane states. It is therefore the appropriate framework in which to study systems of multiple fundamental strings expanding into higher-dimensional D-branes. Starting from Matrix theory in a weakly curved background, we construct the linear couplings of closed string fields to type IIA Matrix strings. As a check, we show that at weak coupling the resulting action reproduces light-cone gauge string theory in a weakly curved background. Further dualities give a type IIB Matrix string theory and a type IIA theory of Matrix strings with winding. We comment on the dielectric effect in each of these theories, giving some explicit solutions describing fundamental strings expanding into various Dp-branes.
