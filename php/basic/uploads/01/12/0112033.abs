Title: Evolution of the Chern-Simons Vortices
Authors: Li-Bin Fu and Yi-Shi Duan and Hong Zhang
Abstract: Based on the gauge potential decomposition theory and the $\phi $-mapping theory, the topological inner structure of the Chern-Simons-Higgs vortex has been showed in detail. The evolution of CSH vortices is studied from the topological properties of the Higgs scalar field. The vortices are found generating or annihilating at the limit points and encountering, splitting or merging at the bifurcation points of the scalar field $\phi .$
