Title: Fractional branes on ALE orbifolds
Authors: M. Billo' and L. Gallot and A. Liccardo
Abstract: We derive the classical type IIB supergravity solution describing fractional D3-branes transverse to a C^2/Gamma orbifold singularity, for Gamma any Kleinian ADE subgroup. This solution fully describes the N=2 gauge theory with appropriate gauge groups and matter living on the branes, up to non-perturbative instanton contributions.
