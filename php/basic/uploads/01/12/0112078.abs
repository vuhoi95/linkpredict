Title: Maximally symmetric D-branes in gauged WZW models
Authors: Takahiro Kubota and Jorgen Rasmussen and Mark A. Walton and Jian-Ge Zhou
Abstract: Gluing conditions are proposed to characterize the D-branes in gauged WZW models. From them the boundary conditions for the group-valued and the subgroup-valued fields are determined. We construct a gauged WZW action for open strings that coincides classically with those written previously, when the gluing conditions are imposed.
