Title: Warped brane-world compactification with Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Ishwaree P. Neupane
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane-world model a singular delta-function source is matched by the second derivative of the warp factor. So one should take possible curvature corrections in the effective action of the RS models in a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) form. We present a linearized treatment of gravity in the RS brane-world with the Gauss-Bonnet modification to Einstein gravity. We give explicit expressions for the Neumann propagator in arbitrary D dimensions and show that a bulk GB term gives, along with a tower of Kaluza-Klein modes in the bulk, a massless graviton on the brane, as in the standard RS model. Moreover, a non-trivial GB coupling can allow a new branch of solutions with finite Planck scale and no naked bulk singularity, which might be useful to avoid some of the previously known ``no--go theorems'' for RS brane-world compactifications.
