Abstract: We present an entirely new approach towards a realization of the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the lattice. The action consists of the staggered fermion and the plaquette variables distributed in the Euclidean space with a particular pattern. The system is shown to have fermionic symmetries relating the fermion and the link variables.
