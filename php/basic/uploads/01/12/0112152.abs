Title: Wilson loop and dS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We calculate Wilson loop (quark anti-quark potential) in dS/CFT correspondence. The brane-world model is considered where bulk is two 5d Euclidean de Sitter spaces and boundary (brane) is 4d de Sitter one. Starting from the Nambu-Goto action, the calculation of the effective tension (average energy) is presented. Unlike to the case of supergravity calculation of Wilson loop in AdS/CFT set-up, there is no need to regularize the Nambu-Goto action (the volume of de Sitter space is finite). It turns out that at sufficiently small curvature of 5d background the energy (potential) is positive and linear on the distance between quark and anti-quark what indicates to the possibility of confinement.
