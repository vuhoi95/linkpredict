Title: How Is the Maximum Entropy of a Quantized Surface Related to Its Area?
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and R. V. Korkin
Abstract: The maximum entropy of a quantized surface is demonstrated to be proportional to the surface area in the classical limit. The result is valid in loop quantum gravity, and in a somewhat more general class of approaches to surface quantization. The maximum entropy is calculated explicitly for some specific cases.
