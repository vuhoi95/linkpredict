Title: Hoop Conjecture and Cosmic Censorship in the Brane-World
Authors: Ken-ichi Nakao and Kouji Nakamura and Takashi Mishima
Abstract: The initial data of gravity for a cylindrical matter distribution confined on the brane is studied in the framework of the single brane Randall-Sundrum scenario. In this scenario, 5-dimensional aspect of gravity appears in the short range gravitational interaction. We found that the sufficiently thin configuration of matter leads to the formation of the marginal surface even if the configuration is infinitely long. This means that the hoop conjecture proposed by Thorne does not hold in the Randall-Sundrum scenario; Even if a mass $M$ does not get compacted into a region whose circumference in every direction is ${\cal C}\le 4\pi GM$, black holes with horizons can form in the Randall-Sundrum scenario.
