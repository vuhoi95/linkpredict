Title: A new wrinkle on the enhancon
Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We generalize the basic enhancon solution of Johnson, Peet and Polchinski by constructing solutions without spherical symmetry. A careful consideration of boundary conditions at the enhancon surface indicates that the interior of the supergravity solution is still flat space in the general case. We provide some explicit analytic solutions where the enhancon locus is a prolate or oblate sphere.
