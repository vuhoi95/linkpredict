Authors: R. Apreda and F. Bigazzi and A. L. Cotrone and M. Petrini and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We discuss various aspects of gauge theories realized on the world-volume of wrapped branes. In particular we analyze the coupling of SYM operators to space-time fields both in N=1 and N=2 models and give a description of the gluino condensate in the Maldacena-Nunez N=1 solution. We also explore the seven dimensional BPS equations relevant for these solutions and their generalizations.
