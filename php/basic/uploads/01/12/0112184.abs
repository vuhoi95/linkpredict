Title: On free massless (pseudo)scalar quantum field theory in 1+1-dimensional  space-time
Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov
Abstract: We construct a consistent quantum field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-times free of infrared divergences. We show that a continuous symmetry of (pseudo)scalar field translations is spontaneously broken. Goldstone bosons appear as quanta of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field. We show that the main inequality between vacuum expectation values of certain operators which has been used for the derivation of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem is fulfilled in the quantum field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field free of infrared divergences.
