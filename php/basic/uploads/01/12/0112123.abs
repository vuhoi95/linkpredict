Title: A Broken Gauge Approach to Gravitational Mass and Charge
Authors: T. Dereli and R. W. Tucker
Abstract: We argue that a spontaneous breakdown of local Weyl invariance offers a mechanism in which gravitational interactions contribute to the generation of particle masses and their electric charge. The theory is formulated in terms of a spacetime geometry whose natural connection has both dynamic torsion and non-metricity. Its structure illuminates the role of dynamic scales used to determine measurable aspects of particle interactions and it predicts an additional neutral vector boson with electroweak properties.
