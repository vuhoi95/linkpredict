Title: "Double-trace" Deformations, Boundary Conditions and Spacetime  Singularities
Authors: Micha Berkooz and Amit Sever and Assaf Shomer
Abstract: Double-trace deformations of the AdS/CFT duality result in a new perturbation expansion for string theory, based on a non-local worldsheet. We discuss some aspects of the deformation in the low energy gravity approximation, where it appears as a change in the boundary condition of fields. We relate unique features of the boundary of AdS to the worldsheet becoming non-local, and conjecture that non-local worldsheet actions may be generic in other classes of backgrounds.
