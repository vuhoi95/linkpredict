Title: The partition function of the linear Poisson-sigma model on arbitrary  surfaces
Authors: Allen C. Hirshfeld and Thomas Schwarzweller
Abstract: We perform the calculation of the partition function of the Poisson-sigma model on the world sheet with the topology of a two-dimensional disc. Considering the special case of a linear Poisson structure we recover the partition function of the Yang-Mills theory. Using a glueing procedure we are able to calculate the partition function for arbitrary base manifolds.
