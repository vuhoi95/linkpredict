Title: A remark on the numerical validation of triviality for scalar field  theories using high-temperature expansions
Authors: P. Butera and M. Comi
Abstract: We suggest a simple modification of the usual procedures of analysis for the high-temperature (strong-coupling or hopping-parameter) expansions of the renormalized four-point coupling constant in the fourdimensional phi^4 lattice scalar field theory. As a result we can more convincingly validate numerically the triviality of the continuum limit taken from the high temperature phase.
