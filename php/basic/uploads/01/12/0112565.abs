Title: Accelerating Universe from the Evolution of Extra Dimensions
Authors: Je-An Gu and W-Y. P. Hwang
Abstract: In this paper we propose that the accelerating expansion of the present matter-dominated universe, as suggested by the recent distance measurements of type Ia supernovae, is generated along with the evolution of space in extra dimensions. The Einstein equations are first analyzed qualitatively and then solved numerically, so as to exhibit explicitly these patterns of the accelerating expansion in this scenario. A fine-tuning problem associated with such a scenario is also described and discussed.
