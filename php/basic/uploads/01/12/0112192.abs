Title: Consistent reduction of N=2 -> N=1 four dimensional supergravity coupled  to matter
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We analyze the constraints which follow both on the geometry and on the gauge sector for a consistent supergravity reduction of a general matter-coupled N=2 supergravity theory in four dimensions. These constraints can be derived in an elegant way by looking at the fermionic sector of the theory.
