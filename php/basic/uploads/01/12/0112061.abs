Title: Higgs Driven Geodetic Evolution/Nucleation of de-Sitter Brane
Authors: Aharon Davidson and David Karasik and Yoav Lederer
Abstract: Geodetic evolution of a de-Sitter brane is exclusively driven by a Higgs potential, rather than by a plain cosmological constant. The deviation from Einstein gravity, parameterized by the conserved bulk energy, is characterized by a hairy horizon which serves as the locus of unbroken symmetry. The quartic structure of the potential, singled out on finiteness grounds of the total (including the dark component) energy density, chooses the no-boundary proposal.
