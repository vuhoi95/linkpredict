Title: General structure of the photon self-energy in non-commutative QED
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study the behavior of the photon two point function, in non-commutative QED, in a general covariant gauge and in arbitrary space-time dimensions. We show, to all orders, that the photon self-energy is transverse. Using an appropriate extension of the dimensional regularization method, we evaluate the one-loop corrections, which show that the theory is renormalizable. We also prove, to all orders, that the poles of the photon propagator are gauge independent and briefly discuss some other related aspects.
