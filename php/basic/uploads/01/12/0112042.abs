Title: Testing an approximation to large-Nc QCD with a toy model
Authors: M. Golterman and S. Peris and B. Phily and E. de Rafael
Abstract: We consider a simple model of large-Nc QCD defined by a spectrum consisting of an infinite set of equally spaced zero-width vector resonances. This model is an excellent theoretical laboratory for investigating certain approximation schemes which have been used recently in calculations of hadronic parameters, such as the Minimal Hadronic Approximation. We also comment on some of the questions concerning issues of local duality versus global duality and finite-energy sum rules.
