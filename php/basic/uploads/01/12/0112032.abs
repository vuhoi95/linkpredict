Title: Unrenormalizable Theories Can Be Predictive
Authors: Jisuke Kubo and Masanori Nunami
Abstract: Unrenormalizable theories contain infinitely many free parameters. Considering these theories in terms of the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG), we suggest a method for removing this large ambiguity. Our basic assumption is the existence of the maximal ultraviolet cutoff in a cutoff theory, and we require that the theory be so fine-tuned as to reach the maximal cutoff. The theory so obtained behaves as a local continuum theory to the shortest distance. In concrete examples of the scalar theory we find that at least in a certain approximation to the Wilsonian RG, this requirement enable us to make unique predictions in the infrared regime in terms of a finite number of independent parameters. Therefore, the method might provide a way for calculating quantum corrections in a low-energy effective theory of quantum gravity.
