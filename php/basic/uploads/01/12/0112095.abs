Title: Integrable quantum field theories with OSP(m/2n) symmetries
Authors: Hubert Saleur and Birgit Wehefritz-Kaufmann
Abstract: We conjecture the factorized scattering description for OSP(m/2n)/OSP(m-1/2n) supersphere sigma models and OSP(m/2n) Gross Neveu models. The non-unitarity of these field theories translates into a lack of `physical unitarity' of the S matrices, which are instead unitary with respect to the non-positive scalar product inherited from the orthosymplectic structure. Nevertheless, we find that formal thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations appear meaningful, reproduce the correct central charges, and agree with perturbative calculations. This paves the way to a more thorough study of these and other models with supergroup symmetries using the S matrix approach.
