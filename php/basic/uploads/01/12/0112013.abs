Title: Second order perturbations in the radius stabilized Randall-Sundrum two  branes model
Authors: Hideaki Kudoh and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational interaction is investigated in the Randall-Sundrum two branes model with the radius stabilization mechanism. As the stabilization model, we assume a single scalar field that has a potential in the bulk and a potential on each brane. We develop a formulation of the second order gravitational perturbations under the assumption of a static and axial-symmetric five-dimensional metric that is spherically symmetric in the four-dimensional sense. After deriving the formal solutions for the perturbations, we discuss the gravity on each brane induced by the matter on its own side, taking the limit of large coupling of the scalar field interaction term on the branes. We show using the Goldberger-Wise stabilization model that four-dimensional Einstein gravity is approximately recovered in the second order perturbations.
