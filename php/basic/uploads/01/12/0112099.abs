Title: Gravitational collapse and its boundary description in AdS
Authors: Steven B. Giddings and Aleksey Nudelman
Abstract: We provide examples of gravitational collapse and black hole formation in AdS, either from collapsing matter shells or in analogy to the Oppenheimer-Sneider solution. We then investigate boundary properties of the corresponding states. In particular, we describe the boundary two-point function corresponding to a shell outside its horizon; if the shell is quasistatically lowered into the horizon, the resulting state is the Boulware state. We also describe the more physical Hartle-Hawking state, and discuss its connection to the quasistatic shell states and to thermalization on the boundary.
