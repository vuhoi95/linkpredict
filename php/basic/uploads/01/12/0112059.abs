Title: Time-Varying alpha and Particle Physics
Authors: T. Banks and M. Dine and M. R. Douglas
Abstract: We argue that models in which an observable variation of the fine structure constant is explained by motion of a cosmic scalar field, are not stable under renormalization, and require massive fine tuning that cannot be explained by any known mechanism.
