Title: Critical behavior of Ginzburg-Landau model coupled to massless Dirac  fermions
Authors: Hagen Kleinert and Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: We point out interesting effects of additional massless Dirac fermions with N_F colors upon the critical behavior of the Ginzburg-Landau model. For increasing N_F, the model is driven into the type II regime of superconductivity. The critical exponents are given as a function of N_F.
