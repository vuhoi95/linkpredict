Title: Intersoliton forces in the Wess-Zumino model
Authors: Ruben Portugues and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The spectrum of supersymmetric domain wall solitons of the Wess-Zumino model is known to be discontinuous across a curve (of marginal stability) in the moduli space of quartic superpotentials. Here we show how this phenomenon can be understood from the behavior of the long-range inter-soliton force, which we compute by a method due to Manton.
