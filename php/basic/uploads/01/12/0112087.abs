Title: Finite-Temperature Gluon Condensate with Renormalization Group Flow  Equations
Authors: B. -J. Schaefer and O. Bohr and J. Wambach
Abstract: Within a self-consistent proper-time Renormalization Group (RG) approach we investigate an effective QCD trace anomaly realization with dilatons and determine the finite-temperature behavior of the gluon condensate. Fixing the effective model at vanishing temperature to the glueball mass and the bag constant a possible gluonic phase transition is explored in detail. Within the RG framework the full non-truncated dilaton potential analysis is compared with a truncated potential version.
