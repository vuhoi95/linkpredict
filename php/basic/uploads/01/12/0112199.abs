Title: Unstable particles versus resonances in impurity systems, conductance in  quantum wires
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and A. Fring
Abstract: We compute the DC conductance for a homogeneous sine-Gordon model and an impurity system of Luttinger liquid type by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and standard potential scattering theory. We demonstrate that unstable particles and resonances in impurity systems lead to a sharp increase of the conductance as a function of the temperature, which is characterized by the Breit-Wigner formula.
