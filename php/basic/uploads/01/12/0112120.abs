Title: Supersymmetry-based Approach to Quantum Particle Dynamics
Authors: Seok Kim and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: We present the N=2 supersymmetric formulation for the classical and quantum dynamics of a nonrelativistic charged particle on a curved surface in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. For a particle moving on a constant-curvature surface in a constant magnetic field, our Hamiltonian possesses the shape-invariance property in addition. On the surface of a sphere and also on the hyperbolic plane, we exploit the supersymmetry and shape-invariance properties to obtain complete solutions to the corresponding quantum mechanical problems.
