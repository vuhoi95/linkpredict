Title: Boundary States for AdS_2 Branes in AdS_3
Authors: Peter Lee and Hirosi Ooguri and Jongwon Park
Abstract: We construct boundary states for the AdS_2 D-branes in AdS_3. We show that, in the semi-classical limit, the boundary states correctly reproduce geometric configurations of these branes. We use the boundary states to compute the one loop free energy of open string stretched between the branes. The result agrees precisely with the open string computation in hep-th/0106129.
