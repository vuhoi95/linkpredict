Title: Duality and Confinement in N=1 Supersymmetric Theories from Geometric  Transitions
Authors: Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We study large N dualities for a general class of N=1 theories realized on type IIB D5 branes wrapping 2-cycles of local Calabi-Yau threefolds or as effective field theories on D4 branes in type IIA brane configurations. We completely solve the issue of the classical moduli space for N=2, U(N_1)x ... x U(N_n) theories deformed by a general superpotential for the adjoint and bifundamental fields. The N=1 geometries in type IIB and its T-dual brane configurations are presented and they agree with the field theory analysis. We investigate the geometric transitions in the ten dimensional theories as well as in M-theory. Strong coupling effects in field theory are analyzed in the deformed geometry with fluxes. Gluino condensations are identified the normalizable deformation parameters while the vacuum expectation values of the bifundamental fields are with the non-normalizable ones. By lifting to M theory, we get a transition from finite coverings of non-hyperelliptic curves to non-hyperelliptic curves. We also discuss orientifold theories, Seiberg dualities and mirror symmetries.
