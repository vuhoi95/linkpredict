Title: A Note on Noncommutative D-Brane Actions
Authors: Calin Ciocarlie and Peter Lee and Jongwon Park
Abstract: We use the nonabelian action of N coincident D(-1) branes in constant background fields, in the N $\to \infty$ limit, to construct noncommutative D-brane actions in an arbitrary noncommutative description and comment on tachyon condensation from this perspective.
