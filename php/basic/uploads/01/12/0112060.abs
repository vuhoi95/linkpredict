Title: On the Wilson loop in the dual representation within the dual Higgs  model with dual Dirac strings
Authors: V. A. Ivanova and N. I. Troitskaya
Abstract: The vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop in the dual representation is calculated in the dual Higgs model with dual Dirac strings. It is shown that the averaged value of the Wilson loop in the dual representation obeys the area-law falloff. Quantum fluctuations of the dual-vector and the Higgs field around Abrikosov flux lines induced by dual Dirac strings in a dual superconducting vacuum and string shape fluctuations are taken into account.
