Title: Vacua of N=2 gauged supergravity derived from non-homogeneous  quaternionic spaces
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Gianguido Dall'Agata
Abstract: We discuss a class of 4-dimensional non-homogeneous quaternionic spaces, which become the two known homogeneous spaces (EAdS_4$ and SU(2,1)/U(2)) in certain limits. These moduli spaces have two regions where the metric is positive definite, separated by a non-physical region where the metric has timelike directions and which contains a curvature singularity. They admit four isometries and we consider their general Abelian gauging. The critical points of the resulting superpotential and hence the possible domain wall solutions differ significantly in the two regions. On one side one can construct only singular walls, whereas in the other we found a smooth domain wall interpolating between two infra-red critical points located exactly on the boundary of the physical allowed parameter region.
