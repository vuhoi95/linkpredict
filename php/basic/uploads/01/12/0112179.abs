Abstract: Dirac-like monopoles are studied in three-dimensional Abelian Maxwell and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models. Their scalar nature is highlighted and discussed through a dimensional reduction of four-dimensional electrodynamics with electric and magnetic sources. Some general properties and similarities of them when are considered in Minkowski or Euclidian space are mentioned. However, by virtue of the structure of the space-time in which they are considered a number of differences among them take place. Furthermore, we pay attention to some consequences of these objects when acting upon usual particles. Among other subjects, special attention is given to the study of a Lorentz-violating non-minimal coupling between neutral fermions and the field generated by a monopole alone. In addition, an analogue of the Aharonov-Casher effect is discussed in this framework.
