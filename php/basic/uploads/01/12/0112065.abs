Title: Gravitational couplings of orientifold planes
Authors: P. Henry-Labordere and B. Julia
Abstract: We reanalyse the gravitational couplings of the perturbative orientifold planes $Op^-$, $Op^+$ (and D-branes). We first compute their $D_{-1}$ instantonic corrections for $p=3$. Then, by using U-dualities, we obtain the Wess-Zumino terms of orientifolds with RR flux for $p \leq 5$. The expressions for the effective actions can be partially checked via M-theory. We point out a previous oversimplification and we show in fact that the difficulty still stands in the way of the full computation of 7 Brane instanton corrections.
