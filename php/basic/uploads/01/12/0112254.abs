Title: Black hole collision with a scalar particle in three dimensional anti-de  Sitter spacetime
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We study the collision between a BTZ black hole and a test particle coupled to a scalar field. We compute the power spectrum, the energy radiated and the plunging waveforms for this process. We show that for late times the signal is dominated by the quasinormal ringing. In terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence the bulk gravity process maps into a thermal state, an expanding bubble and gauge particles decaying into bosons of the associated operator. These latter thermalize in a timescale predicted by the bulk theory.
