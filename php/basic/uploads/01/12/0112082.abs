Title: New Theories With Quantum Modified Moduli Space
Authors: Hitoshi Murayama and Elena Perazzi
Abstract: Kutasov--type duals of supersymmetric gauge theories had been studied only in the dual regime and the s-confining case. Here we extend the discussion to the case of less flavor, analogous to the case of quantum-modified moduli space in Seiberg duality. Unlike the Seiberg duality, however, we find that parts of the moduli space become superconformal, generalizing the so far isolated example of SU(2) theory with two doublets and a triplet. We also point out that the magnetic superpotential needs to be augmented by an additional instanton-generated piece when the magnetic group is SU(2).
