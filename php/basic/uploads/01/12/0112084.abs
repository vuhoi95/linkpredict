Title: K-Theory and S-Duality: Starting Over from Square 3
Authors: Jarah Evslin and Uday Varadarajan
Abstract: Recently Maldacena, Moore, and Seiberg (MMS) have proposed a physical interpretation of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which roughly computes the K-homology groups that classify D-branes. We note that in IIB string theory, this approach can be generalized to include NS charged objects and conjecture an S-duality covariant, nonlinear extension of the spectral sequence. We then compute the contribution of the MMS double-instanton configuration to the derivation d_5. We conclude with an M-theoretic generalization reminiscent of 11-dimensional E_8 gauge theory.
