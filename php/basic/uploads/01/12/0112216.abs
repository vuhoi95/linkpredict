Title: Mass scale effects for the Sudakov form factors in theories with the  broken gauge symmetry
Authors: A. Barroso and B. I. Ermolaev
Abstract: The off-shell and the on-shell Sudakov form factors in theories with broken gauge symmetry are calculated in the double-logarithmic approximation. We have used different infrared cut-offs, i.e. different mass scales, for virtual photons and weak gauge bosons.
