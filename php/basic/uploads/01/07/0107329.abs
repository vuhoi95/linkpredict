Title: Scaling function and universal amplitude combinations for self-avoiding  polygons
Authors: C. Richard and A. J. Guttmann and I. Jensen
Abstract: We analyze new data for self-avoiding polygons, on the square and triangular lattices, enumerated by both perimeter and area, providing evidence that the scaling function is the logarithm of an Airy function. The results imply universal amplitude combinations for all area moments and suggest that rooted self-avoiding polygons may satisfy a $q$-algebraic functional equation.
