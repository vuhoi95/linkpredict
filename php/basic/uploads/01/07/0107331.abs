Title: Gauge-Higgs Unification in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Lawrence Hall and Yasunori Nomura and David Smith
Abstract: The electroweak Higgs doublets are identified as components of a vector multiplet in a higher dimensional supersymmetric field theory. We construct a minimal model in 6D where the electroweak $SU(2) \otimes U(1)$ gauge group is extended to SU(3), and unified 6D models with the unified SU(5) gauge symmetry extended to SU(6). In these realistic theories the extended gauge group is broken by orbifold boundary conditions, leaving Higgs doublet zero modes which have Yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons on the orbifold fixed points. In one SU(6) model the weak mixing angle receives power law corrections, while in another the fixed point structure forbids such corrections. A 5D model is also constructed in which the Higgs doublet contains the fifth component of the gauge field. In this case Yukawa couplings are introduced as non-local operators involving the Wilson line of this gauge field.
