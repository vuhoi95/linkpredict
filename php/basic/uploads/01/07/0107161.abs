Title: Complete Lagrangian formulation for N=4 topological string
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Anton Galajinsky
Abstract: We give a Lagrangian and display all local symmetries for N=4 topological string by Berkovits, Vafa and Siegel, the latter previously known in the superconformal gauge. Leading to a small N=4 superconformal algebra and exhibiting the manifest Lorentz invariance the model is proposed to be a framework for restoring the manifest Lorentz invariance in N=2 string scattering amplitudes.
