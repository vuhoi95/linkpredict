Title: Simple SUSY Breaking Mechanism by Coexisting Walls
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai and Yutaka Sakamura and Ryo Sugisaka
Abstract: A SUSY breaking mechanism with no messenger fields is proposed. We assume that our world is on a domain wall and SUSY is broken only by the coexistence of another wall with some distance from our wall. We find an ${\cal N}=1$ model in four dimensions which admits an exact solution of a stable non-BPS configuration of two walls and studied its properties explicitly. We work out how various soft SUSY breaking terms can arise in our framework. Phenomenological implications are briefly discussed. We also find that effective SUSY breaking scale becomes exponentially small as the distance between two walls grows.
