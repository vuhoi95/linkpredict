Title: Ramond-Ramond Couplings of Noncommutative Branes
Authors: Sunil Mukhi and Nemani V Suryanarayana
Abstract: We obtain the couplings of noncommutative branes of type II string theories to constant Ramond-Ramond backgrounds, for BPS as well as non-BPS branes, in the background-independent description. For the BPS branes, we also generalize these couplings to other descriptions, and thereby argue their equivalence to the known couplings in the commutative description. The first part is a review of earlier work while the second part contains some additional observations.
