Title: Inflationary spectra in generalized gravity: Unified forms
Authors: H. Noh and J. Hwang
Abstract: The classical evolution and the quantum generation processes of the scalar- and tensor-type cosmological perturbations in the context of a broad class of generalized gravity theories are presented in unified forms. The exact forms of final spectra of the two types of structures generated during a generalized slow-roll inflation are derived. Results in generalized gravity are characterized by two additional parameters which are the coupling between gravity and field, and the nonminimal coupling in the kinetic part of the field. Our general results include widely studied gravity theories and inflation models as special cases, and show how the well known consistency relation and spectra in ordinary Einstein gravity inflation models are affected by the generalized nature of the gravity theories.
