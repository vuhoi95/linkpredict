Title: (2,0) Superconformal OPEs in D=6, Selection Rules and  Non-renormalization Theorems
Authors: B. Eden and S. Ferrara and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We analyse the OPE of any two 1/2 BPS operators of (2,0) SCFT$_6$ by constructing all possible three-point functions that they can form with another, in general long operator. Such three-point functions are uniquely determined by superconformal symmetry. Selection rules are derived, which allow us to infer ``non-renormalization theorems'' for an abstract superconformal field theory. The latter is supposedly related to the strong-coupling dynamics of $N_c$ coincident M5 branes, dual, in the large-$N_c$ limit, to the bulk M-theory compactified on AdS$_7 \times$S$_4$. An interpretation of extremal and next-to-extremal correlators in terms of exchange of operators with protected conformal dimension is given.
