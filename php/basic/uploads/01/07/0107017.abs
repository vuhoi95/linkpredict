Title: Recursive Graphical Construction for Feynman Diagrams and Their Weights  in Ginzburg-Landau Theory
Authors: Hagen Kleinert and Axel Pelster and Bruno Van den Bossche
Abstract: The free energy of the Ginzburg-Landau theory satisfies a nonlinear functional differential equation which is turned into a recursion relation. The latter is solved graphically order by order in the loop expansion to find all connected vacuum diagrams, and their corresponding weights. In this way we determine the connected vacuum diagrams and their weights up to four loops.
