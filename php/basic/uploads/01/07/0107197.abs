Abstract: The gauge invariance of cubic open superstring field theory is considered in a framework of level truncation, and applications to the tachyon condensation problem are discussed. As it is known, in the bosonic case the Feynman-Siegel gauge is not universal within the level truncation method. We explore another gauge that is more suitable for calculation of the tachyon potential for fermionic string at level (2,6). We show that this new gauge has no restrictions on the region of its validity at least at this level.
