Title: Vacuum polarisation induced coupling between Maxwell and Kalb-Ramond  Fields
Authors: N. D. Hari Dass and K. V. Shajesh
Abstract: We present here a manifestly gauge invariant calculation of vacuum polarization to fermions in the presence of a constant Maxwell and a constant Kalb-Ramond field in four dimensions. The formalism is a generalisation of the one used by Schwinger in his famous paper on gauge invariance and vacuum polarization. We get an explicit expression for the vacuum polarization induced effective Lagrangian for a constant Maxwell field interacting with a constant Kalb-Ramond field. In the weak field limit we get the coupling between the Maxwell field and the Kalb-Ramond field to be $(\tilde{H}.\tilde{F})^2$, where ${\tilde H}_{\mu}= {1\over {3!}}\epsilon_{\mu\alpha\beta\lambda}H^{\alpha\beta\lambda}$ and $\tilde F$ is the dual of $F_{\mu\nu}$.
