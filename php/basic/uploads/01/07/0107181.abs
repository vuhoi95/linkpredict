Title: Kac-Moody Symmetries of IIB Supergravity
Authors: Igor Schnakenburg and Peter West
Abstract: We formulate the bosonic sector of IIB supergravity as a non-linear realisation. We show that this non-linear realisation contains the Borel subalgebras of SL(11) and $E_7$ and argue that it can be enlarged so as to be based on the rank eleven Kac-Moody algebra $E_{11}$
