Title: The Jacobi identity for Dirac-like brackets
Authors: E. M. C. Abreu and D. Dalmazi and E. A. Silva
Abstract: For redundant second-class constraints the Dirac brackets cannot be defined and new brackets must be introduced. We prove here that the Jacobi identity for the new brackets must hold on the surface of the second-class constraints. In order to illustrate our proof we work out explicitly the cases of a fractional spin particle in 2+1 dimensions and the original Brink-Schwarz massless superparticle in D=10 dimensions in a Lorentz covariant constraints separation.
