Title: Three Body Interactions, Angular Momentum and Black Hole Moduli Spaces
Authors: J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a pair of (4+1)-dimensional black holes in the moduli approximation and with fixed angular momentum. We find that spinning black holes at small separations are described by the de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan model. For more than two black holes, we find an explicit expression for the three-body interactions in the moduli metric by associating them with the one-loop three-point amplitude of a four-dimensional $\phi^3$ theory. We also investigate the dynamics of a three black hole system in various approximations.
