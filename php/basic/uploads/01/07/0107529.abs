Title: Energy spectrum of a 2D Dirac electron in the presence of a constant  magnetic field
Authors: V. M. Villalba and A. Rincon Maggiolo
Abstract: In this paper we obtain exact solutions of a 2D relativistic Dirac oscillator in the presence of a constant magnetic field. We compute the energy spectrum and discuss its dependence on the spin and magnetic field strength.
