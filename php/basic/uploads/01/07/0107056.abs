Title: Proton Stability in Six Dimensions
Authors: Thomas Appelquist and Bogdan A. Dobrescu and Eduardo Ponton and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We show that Lorentz and gauge invariance explain the long proton lifetime within the standard model in six dimensions. The baryon-number violating operators have mass dimension 15 or higher. Upon TeV-scale compactification of the two universal extra dimensions on a square $T^2/Z_2$ orbifold, a discrete subgroup of the 6-dimensional Lorentz group continues to forbid dangerous operators.
