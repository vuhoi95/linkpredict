Title: Generalized sine-Gordon/massive Thirring models and soliton/particle  correspondences
Authors: J. Acosta and H. Blas
Abstract: We consider a real Lagrangian off-critical submodel describing the soliton sector of the so-called conformal affine $sl(3)^{(1)}$ Toda model coupled to matter fields (CATM). The theory is treated as a constrained system in the context of Faddeev-Jackiw and the symplectic schemes. We exhibit the parent Lagrangian nature of the model from which generalizations of the sine-Gordon (GSG) or the massive Thirring (GMT) models are derivable. The dual description of the model is further emphasized by providing the relationships between bilinears of GMT spinors and relevant expressions of the GSG fields. In this way we exhibit the strong/weak coupling phases and the (generalized) soliton/particle correspondences of the model. The $sl(n)^{(1)}$ case is also outlined.
