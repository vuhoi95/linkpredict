Title: Quasi-normal modes of toroidal, cylindrical and planar black holes in  anti-de Sitter spacetimes: scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational  perturbations
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We study the quasi-normal modes (QNM) of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of black holes in general relativity whose horizons have toroidal, cylindrical or planar topology in an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The associated quasinormal frequencies describe the decay in time of the corresponding test field in the vicinities of the black hole. In terms of the AdS/CFT conjecture, the inverse of the frequency is a measure of the dynamical timescale of approach to thermal equilibrium of the corresponding conformal field theory.
