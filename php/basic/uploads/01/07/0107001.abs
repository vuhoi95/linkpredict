Title: Twisted partition functions for ADE boundary conformal field theories  and Ocneanu algebras of quantum symmetries
Authors: Robert Coquereaux and Gil Schieber
Abstract: For every ADE Dynkin diagram, we give a realization, in terms of usual fusion algebras (graph algebras), of the algebra of quantum symmetries described by the associated Ocneanu graph. We give explicitly, in each case, the list of the corresponding twisted partition functions
