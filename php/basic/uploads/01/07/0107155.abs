Title: Teleparallel Superspace in Eleven Dimensions Coupled to Supermembranes
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present a superspace formulation of N=1 eleven-dimensional supergravity with no manifest local Lorentz covariance, which we call teleparallel superspace. This formulation will be of great importance, when we deal with other supergravity theories in dimensions higher than eleven dimensions, or a possible formulation of noncommutative supergravity. As an illustrative example, we apply our teleparallel superspace formulation to the case of N=1 supergravity in twelve-dimensions. We also show the advantage of teleparallel superspace as backgrounds for supermembrane action.
