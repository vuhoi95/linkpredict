Title: *-Trek III: The Search for Ramond-Ramond Couplings
Authors: Hong Liu and Jeremy Michelson
Abstract: We give a detailed discussion of the disk amplitudes with one closed string insertion, which we used to construct the supergravity couplings of noncommutative D-branes to the RR potentials, given in hep-th/0104139. We prove the inclusion of Elliott's formula, the integer-valued modification of the noncommutative Chern character, to all orders in the gauge field. We also give a detailed comparison between the form of the result in which Elliott's formula is manifest, and the form expressed in Matrix model variables.
