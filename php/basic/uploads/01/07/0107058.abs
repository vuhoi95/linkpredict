Abstract: In this paper we propose a new mechanism of inflating the Universe with non-BPS $D4$ branes which decay into stable $D3$ branes via tachyon condensation. In a single brane scenario the tachyon potential is very steep and unable to support inflation. However if the universe lives in a stack of branes produced by a set of non-interacting unstable $\tilde {D4}$ branes, then the associated set of tachyons may drive inflation along our 3 spatial dimensions. After tachyon condensation the Universe is imagined to be filled with a set of parallel stable $D3$ branes. We study the scalar density perturbations and reheating within this setup.
