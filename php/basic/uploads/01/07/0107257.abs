Title: Non-BPS Branes of Supersymmetric Brane Worlds
Authors: Philippe Brax and Adam Falkowski and Zygmunt Lalak
Abstract: We consider five-dimensional brane worlds with N=2 gauged supergravity in the bulk coupled supersymmetrically to two boundary branes at the fixed points of a Z_2 symmetry. We analyse two mechanisms that break supersymmetry either by choosing flipped fermionic boundary conditions on the boundary branes or by modifying the gravitino variation to include both Z_2-odd and Z_2-even operators. In all cases we find the corresponding background. Including an even part in the gravitino variation leads to tilted branes. Choosing the flipped boundary conditions leads to AdS_4 branes and stabilized radion in the detuned case, when the expectation value of the even variation is nonzero. Another solution has the interpretation of moving AdS_4 branes separated by a horizon. The solution with moving branes separated by a horizon can be extended to the tuned case. In the presence of a horizon, temperature mediation communicates supersymmetry breakdown to the branes.
