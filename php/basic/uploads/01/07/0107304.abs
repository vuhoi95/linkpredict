Title: SUSY Scaling Violations and UHECR
Authors: Claudio Coriano and Alon E. Faraggi
Abstract: Advancing QCD toward astroparticle applications generates new challenges for perturbation theory, such as the presence of large evolution scales with sizeable scaling violations involving both the initial and the final state of a collision. Possible applications in the context of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) of these effects are discussed.
