Title: Gravitational Rainbow
Authors: Antonio Accioly and Harold Blas
Abstract: It is shown that unlike Einstein's gravity quadratic gravity produces dispersive photon propagation. The energy-dependent contribution to the deflection of photons passing by the Sun is computed and subsequently the angle at which the visible spectrum would be spread over is plotted as a function of the $R_{\mu\nu}^2-$sector mass.
