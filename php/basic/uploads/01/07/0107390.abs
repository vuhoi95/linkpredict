Title: Correlation functions for composite operators in the Hubbard model
Authors: Tobias Baier and Eike Bick and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: We compute the correlation functions for antiferromagnetic and d-wave superconducting fermion bilinears in a generalized mean field type approximation for the Hubbard model. For high temperature our explicit expressions show that homogeneous field configurations are preferred for these composite bosons. Below a critical temperature we find spontaneous symmetry breaking with homogeneous expectation values of the composite fields. Our results can be used to device a nonperturbative flow equation for the exploration of the low temperature regime.
