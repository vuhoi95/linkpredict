Title: A non-rational CFT with c=1 as a limit of minimal models
Authors: I. Runkel and G. M. T. Watts
Abstract: We investigate the limit of minimal model conformal field theories where the central charge approaches one. We conjecture that this limit is described by a non-rational CFT of central charge one. The limiting theory is different from the free boson but bears some resemblance to Liouville theory. Explicit expressions for the three point functions of bulk fields are presented, as well as a set of conformal boundary states. We provide analytic and numerical arguments in support of the claim that this data forms a consistent CFT.
