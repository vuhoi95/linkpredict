Title: Can Black Holes Decay to Naked Singularities?
Authors: Saurya Das and J. Gegenberg and V. Husain
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamic properties of two types of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes: black holes and singular scalar field spacetimes. We describe the possibility that thermodynamic phase transitions can transform one spacetime into another, suggesting that black holes can radiate to naked singularities.
