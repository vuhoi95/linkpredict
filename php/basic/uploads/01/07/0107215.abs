Title: Leptogenesis and Neutrinos at a TeV
Authors: Salah Nasri and Mark Trodden
Abstract: We consider a model for leptogenesis in which all the relevant physics is accessible in collider experiments. This requires a moderate extension of the standard model which generates small neutrino masses via TeV scale right-handed neutrinos. The necessary Sakharov criteria are satisfied in such a way that all existing experimental constraints are satisfied. We demonstrate how the requisite baryon to entropy ratio is generated, and discuss some possible experimental signatures of the model.
