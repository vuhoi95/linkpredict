Title: Noncommutative Chiral Gauge Theories on the Lattice with Manifest  Star-Gauge Invariance
Authors: J. Nishimura and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We show that noncommutative U(r) gauge theories with a chiral fermion in the adjoint representation can be constructed on the lattice with manifest star-gauge invariance in arbitrary even dimensions. Chiral fermions are implemented using a Dirac operator which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. A gauge-invariant integration measure for the fermion fields can be given explicitly, which simplifies the construction as compared with lattice chiral gauge theories in ordinary (commutative) space-time. Our construction includes the cases where continuum calculations yield a gauge anomaly. This reveals a certain regularization dependence, which is reminiscent of parity anomaly in commutative space-time with odd dimensions. We speculate that the gauge anomaly obtained in the continuum calculations in the present cases can be cancelled by an appropriate counterterm.
