Title: Three-Family Supersymmetric Standard-like Models from Intersecting Brane  Worlds
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Gary Shiu and Angel M. Uranga
Abstract: We construct the first three family N=1 supersymmetric string model with Standard Model gauge group SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y from an orientifold of type IIA theory on T^6/(Z_2 x Z_2) and D6-branes intersecting at angles. In addition to the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model particles, the model contains right-handed neutrinos, a chiral (but anomaly-free) set of exotic multiplets, and extra vector-like multiplets. We discuss some phenomenological features of this model.
