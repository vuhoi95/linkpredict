Title: Relation between polymer and Fock excitations
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Jerzy Lewandowski
Abstract: To bridge the gap between background independent, non-perturbative quantum gravity and low energy physics described by perturbative field theory in Minkowski space-time, Minkowskian Fock states are located, analyzed and used in the background independent framework. This approach to the analysis of semi-classical issues is motivated by recent results of Varadarajan. As in that work, we use the simpler U(1) example to illustrate our constructions but, in contrast to that work, formulate the theory in such a way that it can be extended to full general relativity.
