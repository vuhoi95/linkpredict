Title: Understanding flavor mixing in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: M. Blasone and A. Capolupo and G. Vitiello
Abstract: We report on recent results showing that a rich non-perturbative vacuum structure is associated with flavor mixing in Quantum Field Theory. We treat explicitly the case of mixing among three generations of Dirac fermions. Exact oscillation formulas are presented exhibiting new features with respect to the usual ones. CP and T violation are also discussed.
