Title: The Hydrodynamical Limit of Quantum Hall system
Authors: D. Sreedhar Babu and R. Shankar and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: We study the current algebra of FQHE systems in the hydrodynamical limit of small amplitude, long-wavelength fluctuations. We show that the algebra simplifies considerably in this limit. The hamiltonian is expressed in a current-current form and the operators creating inter-Landau level and lowest Landau level collective excitations are identified.
