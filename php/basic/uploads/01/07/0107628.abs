Title: Low energy Collective Modes of a Superfluid Trapped atomic Fermi Gas
Authors: G. M. Bruun and B. R. Mottelson
Abstract: We consider the low energy collective mode spectrum of a superfluid Fermi gas in a spherical trap in the collisionless regime. Using a self-consistent random-phase approximation, the effects of superfluidity on modes of dipole and quadrupole symmetries are systematically examined. The spectrum is calculated for varying pairing strength and temperature and we identify several spectral features such as the emergence of Goldstone modes that can be used to detect the onset of superfluidity. Our analysis is relevant for present experiments aimed at observing a superfluid phase transition in trapped Fermi gases.
