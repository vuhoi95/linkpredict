Abstract: We present a generalization of the five dimensional multigravity models to six dimensions. The key characteristic of these constructions is that that we obtain solutions which do not have any negative tension branes while at the same time the branes are kept flat. This is due to the fact that in six dimensions the internal space is not trivial and its curvature allows bounce configurations with the above feature. These constructions give for the first time a theoretically and phenomenologically viable realization of multigravity.
