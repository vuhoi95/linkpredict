Title: SUSY a consequence of smoothness?
Authors: H. B. Nielsen and S. Pallua and P. Prester
Abstract: The consequences of certain simple assumptions like smoothness of ground state properties and vanishing of the vacuum energy (at least perturbatively) are explored. It would be interesting from the point of view of building realistic theories to obtain these properties without supersymmetry. Here we show, however, at least in some quantum mechanical models, that these simple assumptions lead to supersymmetric theories.
