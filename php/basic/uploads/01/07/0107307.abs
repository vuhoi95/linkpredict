Title: Multi-Localization in Multi-Brane Worlds

Abstract: We study bulk fields in various multi-brane models with localized gravity. In the case of spin 0, 1/2 and 3/2 fields, the non-trivial background geometry itself can induce (multi-) localization of the zero modes along the extra dimension. The addition of appropriate mass terms controls the strength or/and the position of this localization and can induce (multi-) localization of spin 1 fields as well. We show that multi-brane models may also give rise to anomalously light KK modes which are also localized. The possibility of multi-localization in the context of supersymmetric brane world models in AdS_5 spacetime is also discussed.
