Title: A Superfield Formalism of osp(1,2) Covariant Quantization
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and P. Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We propose a superfield description of osp(1,2) covariant quantization by extending the set of admissibility conditions for the quantum action. We realize a superfield form of the generating equations, specify the vacuum functional and obtain the corresponding transformations of extended BRST symmetry.
