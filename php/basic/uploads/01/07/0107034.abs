Title: Brane world sum rules and the AdS soliton
Authors: Frederic Leblond and Robert C. Myers and David J. Winters
Abstract: We discuss brane world sum rules for compactifications involving an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. One of the most striking results derived from such consistency conditions is the necessity for negative tension branes to appear in five-dimensional scenarios. We show how this result can be evaded for brane world models with more than five dimensions. As an example, we consider a novel realization of the Randall-Sundrum scenario in six dimensions involving only positive tension branes. A complete account of our results appeared in hep-th/0106140.
