Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and Subrata Sur and Radhika Vathsan
Abstract: We study soliton solutions in supersymmetric scalar field theory with a class of potentials. We study both bosonic and fermionic zero-modes around the soliton solution. We study two possible couplings of gauge fields to these models. While the Born-Infeld like coupling has one normalizable mode (the zero mode), the other kind of coupling has no normalizable modes. We show that quantum mechanical problem which determines the spectrum of fluctuation modes of the scalar, fermion and the gauge field is identical. We also show that only the lowest lying mode, i.e., the zero mode, is normalizable and the rest of the spectrum is continuous.
