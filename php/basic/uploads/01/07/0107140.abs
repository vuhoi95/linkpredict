Title: Superstrings in 2D Backgrounds with R-R Flux and New Extremal Black  Holes
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Sergei Gukov and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: The hybrid formalism is used to quantize the superstring compactified to two-dimensional target-space in a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric manner. A quantizable sigma model action is then constructed for the Type II superstring in curved two-dimensional supergravity backgrounds which can include Ramond-Ramond flux. Such curved backgrounds include Calabi-Yau four-fold compactifications with Ramond-Ramond flux, and new extremal black hole solutions in two-dimensional dilaton supergravity theory. These black hole solutions are a natural generalization of the CGHS model and might be possible to describe using a supergroup version of the SL(2,R)/U(1) WZW model. We also study some dynamical aspects of the new black holes, such as formation and evaporation.
