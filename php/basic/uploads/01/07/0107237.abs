Title: Stability of bound states in the light-front Yukawa model
Authors: V. A. Karmanov and J. Carbonell and M. Mangin-Brinet
Abstract: We show that in the system of two fermions interacting by scalar exchange, the solutions for J$^{\pi}$=$0^+$ bound states are stable without any cutoff regularization, for values of the coupling constant $\alpha$ below a critical value $\alpha_c$. This latter is calculated from an eigenvalue equation.
