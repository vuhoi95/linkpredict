Title: Scaling fields in the two-dimensional abelian sandpile model
Authors: S. Mahieu and P. Ruelle
Abstract: We consider the isotropic two-dimensional abelian sandpile model from a perspective based on two-dimensional (conformal) field theory. We compute lattice correlation functions for various cluster variables (at and off criticality), from which we infer the field-theoretic description in the scaling limit. We find a perfect agreement with the predictions of a c=-2 conformal field theory and its massive perturbation, thereby providing direct evidence for conformal invariance and more generally for a description in terms of a local field theory. The question of the height 2 variable is also addressed, with however no definite conclusion yet.
