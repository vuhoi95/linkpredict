Title: Hierarchy of Dirac, Pauli and Klein-Gordon conserved operators in  Taub-NUT background
Authors: Ion I. CotÄƒescu and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The algebra of conserved observables of the SO(4,1) gauge-invariant theory of the Dirac fermions in the external field of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is investigated. It is shown that the Dirac conserved operators have physical parts associated with Pauli operators that are also conserved in the sense of the Klein-Gordon theory. In this way one gets simpler methods of analyzing the properties of the conserved Dirac operators and their main algebraic structures including the representations of dynamical algebras governing the Dirac quantum modes.
