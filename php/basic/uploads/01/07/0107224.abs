Title: Abelian Higgs Hair for AdS-Schwarzschild Black Hole
Authors: M. H. Dehghani and A. M. Ghezelbash and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We show that the Abelian Higgs field equations in the background of the four dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole have a vortex line solution. This solution, which has axial symmetry, is a generalization of the AdS spacetime Nielsen-Olesen string. By a numerical study of the field equations, we show that black hole could support the Abelian Higgs field as its Abelian hair. Also, we conside the self gravity of the Abelian Higgs field both in the pure AdS spacetime and AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background and show that the effect of string as a black hole hair is to induce a deficit angle in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole.
