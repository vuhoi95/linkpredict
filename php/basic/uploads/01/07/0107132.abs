Title: Kaluza-Klein theory, AdS/CFT correspondence and black hole entropy
Authors: J. M. Izquierdo and J. Navarro-Salas and P. Navarro
Abstract: The asymptotic symmetries of the near-horizon geometry of a lifted (near-extremal) Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, obtained by inverting the Kaluza-Klein reduction, explain the deviation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from extremality. We point out the fact that the extra dimension allows us to justify the use of a Virasoro mode decomposition along the time-like boundary of the near-horizon geometry, AdS$_2\times$S$^n$, of the lower-dimensional (Reissner-Nordstrom) spacetime.
