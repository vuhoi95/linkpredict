Title: Nonthermal radiation of rotating black holes
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and R. V. Korkin
Abstract: Nonthermal radiation of a Kerr black hole is considered as tunneling of created particles through an effective Dirac gap. In the leading semiclassical approximation this approach is applicable to bosons as well. Our semiclassical results for photons and gravitons do not contradict those obtained previously. For neutrinos the result of our accurate quantum mechanical calculation is about two times larger than the previous one.
