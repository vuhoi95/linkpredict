Title: Baryogenesis via Density Fluctuations with a Second Order Electroweak  Phase Transition
Authors: Biswanath Layek and Soma Sanyal and Ajit M. Srivastava
Abstract: We consider the presence of cosmic string induced density fluctuations in the universe at temperatures below the electroweak phase transition temperature. Resulting temperature fluctuations can restore the electroweak symmetry locally, depending on the amplitude of fluctuations and the background temperature. The symmetry will be spontaneously broken again in a given fluctuation region as the temperature drops there (for fluctuations with length scales smaller than the horizon), resulting in the production of baryon asymmetry. The time scale of the transition will be governed by the wavelength of fluctuation and, hence, can be much smaller than the Hubble time. This leads to strong enhancement in the production of baryon asymmetry for a second order electroweak phase transition as compared to the case when transition happens due to the cooling of the universe via expansion. For a two-Higgs extension of the Standard Model (with appropriate CP violation), we show that one can get the required baryon to entropy ratio if fluctuations propagate without getting significantly damped. If fluctuations are damped rapidly, then a volume factor suppresses the baryon production. Still, the short scale of the fluctuation leads to enhancement of the baryon to entropy ratio by at least 3 - 4 orders of magnitude compared to the conventional case of second order transition where the cooling happens due to expansion of the universe.
