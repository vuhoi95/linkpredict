Title: OPEs and 3-point correlators of protected operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: P. J. Heslop and P. S. Howe
Abstract: Two- and three-point correlation functions of arbitrary protected operators are constructed in N=4 SYM using analytic superspace methods. The OPEs of two chiral primary multiplets are given. It is shown that the $n$-point functions of protected operators for $n\leq4$ are invariant under $U(1)_Y$ and it is argued that this implies that the two- and three-point functions are not renormalised. It is shown explicitly how unprotected operators can be accommodated in the analytic superspace formalism in a way which is fully compatible with analyticity. Some new extremal correlators are exhibited.
