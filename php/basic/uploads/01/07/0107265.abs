Title: Matrix description of D-branes on 3-spheres
Authors: Jacek Pawelczyk and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We discuss a matrix model for D0-branes on S^3 \times M^7 based on quantum group symmetries. For finite radius of S^3 (i.e. for finite k), it gives results beyond the reach of the ordinary matrix model. For large k all known static properties of branes on S^3 are reproduced.
