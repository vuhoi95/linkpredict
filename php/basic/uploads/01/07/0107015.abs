Title: Form factors from free fermionic Fock fields, the Federbush model
Authors: Olalla Castro-Alvaredo and Andreas Fring
Abstract: By representing the field content as well as the particle creation operators in terms of fermionic Fock operators, we compute the corresponding matrix elements of the Federbush model. Only when these matrix elements satisfy the form factor consistency equations involving anyonic factors of local commutativity, the corresponding operators are local. We carry out the ultraviolet limit, analyze the momentum space cluster properties and demonstrate how the Federbush model can be obtained from the $SU(3)_3$-homogeneous sine-Gordon model. We propose a new Lagrangian which on one hand constitutes a generalization of the Federbush model in a Lie algebraic fashion and on the other a certain limit of the homogeneous sine-Gordon models.
