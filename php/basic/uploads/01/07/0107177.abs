Title: M-Theory Dynamics On A Manifold Of G_2 Holonomy
Authors: Michael Atiyah and Edward Witten
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of M-theory on a manifold of G_2 holonomy that is developing a conical singularity. The known cases involve a cone on CP^3, where we argue that the dynamics involves restoration of a global symmetry, SU(3)/U(1)^2, where we argue that there are phase transitions among three possible branches corresponding to three classical spacetimes, and S^3 x S^3 and its quotients, where we recover and extend previous results about smooth continuations between different spacetimes and relations to four-dimensional gauge theory.
