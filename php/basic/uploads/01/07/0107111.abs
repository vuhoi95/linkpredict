Title: Hot Little String Correlators: A View From Supergravity
Authors: K. Narayan and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We study the propagation of a massless minimally coupled scalar in the near horizon geometry of non-extremal NS5-branes. Using the holographic principle for dilatonic backgrounds we compute the two-point function of an operator in Little String Theory at the Hagedorn temperature. We then comment on relations with correlation functions in two dimensional string theory.
