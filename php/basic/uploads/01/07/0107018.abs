Title: 't Hooft Loops, Electric Flux Sectors and Confinement in SU(2)  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Philippe de Forcrand and Lorenz von Smekal
Abstract: We use 't Hooft loops of maximal size on finite lattices to calculate the free energy in the sectors of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with fixed electric flux as a function of temperature and (spatial) volume. Our results provide evidence for the mass gap. The confinement of electric fluxes in the low temperature phase and their condensation in the high temperature phase are demonstrated. In a surprisingly large scaling window around criticality, the transition is quantitatively well described by universal exponents and amplitude ratios relating the properties of the two phases.
