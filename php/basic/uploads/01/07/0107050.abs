Title: From the braided to the usual Yang-Baxter relation
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Marco Rossi
Abstract: Quantum monodromy matrices coming from a theory of two coupled (m)KdV equations are modified in order to satisfy the usual Yang-Baxter relation. As a consequence, a general connection between braided and {\it unbraided} (usual) Yang-Baxter algebras is derived and also analysed.
