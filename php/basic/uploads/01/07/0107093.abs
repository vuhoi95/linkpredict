Title: Solvable Confining Gauge Theories at Large N
Authors: U. Ellwanger and N. Wschebor
Abstract: In this letter we consider models with N U(1) gauge fields together with N Kalb-Ramond fields in the large N limit. These models can be solved explicitely and exhibit confinement for a large class of bare actions. The confining phase is characterized by an approximate "low energy" vector gauge symmetry under which the Kalb-Ramond fields transform. A duality transformation shows that confinement is associated with magnetic monopoles condensation.
