Title: Scalar wave propagation in topological black hole backgrounds
Authors: Bin Wang and Elcio Abdalla and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a scalar field coupled to curvature in topological black hole spacetimes. We solve numerically the scalar wave equation with different curvature-coupling constant $\xi$ and show that a rich spectrum of wave propagation is revealed when $\xi$ is introduced. Relations between quasinormal modes and the size of different topological black holes have also been investigated.
