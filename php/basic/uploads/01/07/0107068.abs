Title: Fuzzy Instantons
Authors: Harald Grosse and Marco Maceda and John Madore and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We present a series of instanton-like solutions to a matrix model which satisfy a self-duality condition and possess an action whose value is, to within a fixed constant factor, an integer l^2. For small values of the dimension n^2 of the matrix algebra the integer resembles the result of a quantization condition but as n -> \infty the ratio l/n can tend to an arbitrary real number between zero and one.
