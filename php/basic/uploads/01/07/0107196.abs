Title: Confinement with Kalb - Ramond Fields
Authors: U. Ellwanger and N. Wschebor
Abstract: We consider models with N U(1) gauge fields A_{\mu}^n, N Kalb-Ramond fields B_{\mu \nu}^n, an arbitrary bare action and a fixed UV cutoff \Lambda. Under mild assumptions these can be obtained as effective low energy theories of SU(N+1) Yang Mills theories in the maximal abelian gauge. For a large class of bare actions they can be solved in the large N limit and exhibit confinement. The confining phase is characterized by an approximate ``low energy'' vector gauge symmetry under which the Kalb-Ramond fields B_{\mu\nu}^n transform. The same symmetry allows for a duality transformation showing that magnetic monopoles have condensed. The models allow for various mechanisms of confinement, depending on which sources for A_{\mu}^n or B_{\mu \nu}^n are switched on, but the area law for the Wilson loop is obtained in any case.
