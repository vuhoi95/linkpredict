Title: Motion on moduli spaces with potentials
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Marija Zamaklar
Abstract: In the limit of small velocities, the dynamics of half-BPS Yang-Mills-Higgs solitons can be described by the geodesic approximation. Recently, it has been shown that quarter-BPS states require the addition of a potential term to this approximation. We explain the logic behind this modification for a larger class of models and then analyse in detail the dynamics of two five-dimensional dyonic instantons, using both analytical and numerical techniques. Nonzero-modes are shown to play a crucial role in the analysis of these systems, and we explain how these modes lead to qualitatively new types of dynamics.
