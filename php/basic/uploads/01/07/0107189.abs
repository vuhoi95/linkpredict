Title: Boundary States of D-branes in AdS_3 Based on Discrete Series
Authors: Yasuaki Hikida and Yuji Sugawara
Abstract: We study D-branes in the Lorentzian AdS_3 background from the viewpoint of boundary states, emphasizing the role of open-closed duality in string theory. Employing the world sheet with Lorentzian signature, we construct the Cardy states with the discrete series. We show that they are compatible with (1) unitarity and normalizability, and (2) the spectral flow symmetry, in the open string spectrum. We also discuss their brane interpretation. We further show that in the case of superstrings on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4, our Cardy states yield an infinite number of physical BPS states in the open string channel, on which the spectral flows act consistently.
