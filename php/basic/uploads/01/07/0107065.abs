Title: Hierarchy of (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equation,  self-dual Yang-Mills equation, and toroidal Lie algebras
Authors: Saburo Kakei and Takeshi Ikeda and Kanehisa Takasaki
Abstract: The hierarchy structure associated with a (2+1)-dimensional Nonlinear Schroedinger equation is discussed as an extension of the theory of the KP hierarchy. Several methods to construct special solutions are given. The relation between the hierarchy and a representation of toroidal Lie algebras are established by using the language of free fermions. A relation to the self-dual Yang-Mills equation is also discussed.
