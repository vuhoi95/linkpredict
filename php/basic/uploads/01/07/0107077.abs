Title: On boundary terms and conformal transformations in curved space-times
Authors: R. Casadio and A. Gruppuso
Abstract: We intend to clarify the interplay between boundary terms and conformal transformations in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. We first consider the action for pure gravity in five dimensions and show that, on compactifing a la Kaluza-Klein to four dimensions, one obtains the correct boundary terms in the Jordan (or String) Frame form of the Brans-Dicke action. Further, we analyze how the boundary terms change under the conformal transformations which lead to the Pauli (or Einstein) frame and to the non-minimally coupled massless scalar field. In particular, we study the behaviour of the total energy in asymptotically flat space-times as it results from surface terms in the Hamiltonian formalism.
