Title: Orientifold planes, affine algebras and magnetic monopoles
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Jan Troost
Abstract: We analyze string theory backgrounds that include different kinds of orientifold planes and map out a natural correspondence to (twisted) affine Kac-Moody algebras. The low-energy description of specific BPS states in these backgrounds leads to a construction of explicit twisted magnetic monopole solutions on R^3 x S^1. These backgrounds yield new low-energy field theories with twisted boundary conditions and the link with affine algebras yields a natural guess for the superpotentials of the corresponding pure N=1, and N=1* gauge theories.
