Title: Supergrassmannian and large N limit of quantum field theory with bosons  and fermions
Authors: Anatoly Konechny and O. Teoman Turgut
Abstract: We study a large N_{c} limit of a two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory coupled to bosons and fermions in the fundamental representation. Extending an approach due to Rajeev we show that the limiting theory can be described as a classical Hamiltonian system whose phase space is an infinite-dimensional supergrassmannian. The linear approximation to the equations of motion and the constraint yields the 't Hooft equations for the mesonic spectrum. Two other approximation schemes to the exact equations are discussed.
