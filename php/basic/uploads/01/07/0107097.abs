Title: Domain Walls with Strings Attached
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Sergey Prokushkin and Marina Shmakova
Abstract: We have constructed a bulk & brane action of IIA theory which describes a pair of BPS domain walls on S_1/Z_2, with strings attached. The walls are given by two orientifold O8-planes with coincident D8-branes and `F1-D0'-strings are stretched between the walls. This static configuration satisfies all matching conditions for the string and domain wall sources and has 1/4 of unbroken supersymmetry.
