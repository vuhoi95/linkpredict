Title: Implementing holographic projections in Ponzano--Regge gravity
Authors: G. Arcioni and M. Carfora and A. Marzuoli and M. O'Loughlin
Abstract: We consider the path-sum of Ponzano-Regge with additional boundary contributions in the context of the holographic principle of Quantum Gravity. We calculate an holographic projection in which the bulk partition function goes to a semi-classical limit while the boundary state functional remains quantum-mechanical. The properties of the resulting boundary theory are discussed.
