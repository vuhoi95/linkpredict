Title: A Remark on Non-conformal Non-supersymmetric Theories with Vanishing  Vacuum Energy Density
Authors: Olindo Corradini and Alberto Iglesias and Zurab Kakushadze and Peter Langfelder
Abstract: We discuss non-conformal non-supersymmetric large N gauge theories with vanishing vacuum energy density to all orders in perturbation theory. These gauge theories can be obtained via a field theory limit of Type IIB D3-branes embedded in orbifolded space-times. We also discuss gravity in this setup.
