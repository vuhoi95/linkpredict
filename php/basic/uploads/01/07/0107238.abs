Title: On the Phase Transition of Conformal Field Theories with Holographic  Duals
Authors: L. Cappiello and W. Mueck
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic relations of conformal field theories (CFTs), which are holographically dual to anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild bulk space-times. A Cardy-Verlinde formula is derived thermodynamically for CFTs living on S^n x R with S^n having an arbitrary radius. The Hawking-Page phase transition of the CFT is described using Landau's theory of phase transitions, and an alternative derivation of the Cardy-Verlinde formula is presented. The condensate in the high temperature phase is identified as being composed of radiational matter.
