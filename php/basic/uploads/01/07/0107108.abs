Title: Braneworld Instantons
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Antonio Padilla
Abstract: We derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing a (localized) domain wall. Euclideanization gives the geometry for braneworld false vacuum decay. We explicitly derive these instantons and compute the amplitude for false vacuum decay. We also show how to construct a toy ekpyrotic instanton. Finally, we comment on braneworlds with a compact spatial direction and the adS soliton.
