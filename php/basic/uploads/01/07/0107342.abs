Title: Interaction induced localization in a gas of pyramidal molecules
Authors: Giovanni Jona-Lasinio and Carlo Presilla and Cristina Toninelli
Abstract: We propose a model to describe a gas of pyramidal molecules interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. The interaction modifies the tunneling properties between the classical equilibrium configurations of the single molecule and, for sufficiently high pressure, the molecules become localized in these classical configurations. We explain quantitatively, without free parameters, the shift to zero frequency of the inversion line observed upon increase of the pressure in a gas of ammonia or deuterated ammonia. For sufficiently high pressures, our model suggests the existence of a superselection rule for states of different chirality in substituted derivatives.
