Title: Supersymmetry Breaking, M-Theory and Fluxes
Authors: Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker
Abstract: We consider warped compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory to three-dimensional Minkowski space on compact eight-manifolds. Taking all the leading quantum gravity corrections of eleven-dimensional supergravity into account we obtain the solution to the equations of motion and Bianchi identities. Generically these vacua are not supersymmetric and yet have a vanishing three-dimensional cosmological constant.
