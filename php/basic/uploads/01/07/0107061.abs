Title: Non-renormalization theorems in softly broken SQED and the soft  $β$-functions
Authors: E. Kraus and D. Stöckinger
Abstract: The renormalization of softly broken SQED is related to the one of supersymmetric QED by using the construction with a local gauge supercoupling and by taking into account softly broken anomalous axial U(1) symmetry. From this extended model one obtains the non-renormalization theorems of SQED and the counterterms of the soft breaking parameters as functions of the supersymmetric counterterms. Due to the Adler-Bardeen anomaly of the axial current an invariant regularization scheme does not exist, and therefore the $\beta$-functions of soft breaking parameters are derived from an algebraic construction of the Callan-Symanzik equation and of the renormalization group equation. We obtain the soft $\beta$-functions in terms of the gauge $\beta$-function and of the anomalous dimension of the supersymmetric matter mass. In particular, we find that the X-term of the scalar mass $\beta$-function as well as the gauge $\beta$-function in $l\geq 2$ are due to the Adler-Bardeen anomaly of the axial symmetry.
