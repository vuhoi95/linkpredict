Title: The covariant graviton propagator in de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Atsushi Higuchi and Spyros S. Kouris
Abstract: We consider the covariant graviton propagator in de Sitter spacetime in a gauge with two parameters, alpha and beta, in the Euclidean approach. We give an explicit form of the propagator with a particular choice of beta but with arbitrary value of alpha. We confirm that two-point functions of local gauge-invariant quantities do not increase as the separation of the two points becomes large.
