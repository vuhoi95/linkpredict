Title: Gauge-fixing Independence of Test Fields in Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Sergio M. Iguri and Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We derive a generalized Nielsen identity for the case of Yang-Mills theories that include some classical fields. We discuss under which circumstances the effective action of the classical fields (i.e., after integration of quantum fields) becomes gauge fixing independent. We conclude that classical test fields provide a physical insight into the problem of the gauge-fixing dependence of the quantum effective action.
