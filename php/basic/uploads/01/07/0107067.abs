Title: Differential-difference system related to toroidal Lie algebra
Authors: Saburo Kakei and Yasuhiro Ohta
Abstract: We present a novel differential-difference system in (2+1)-dimensional space-time (one discrete, two continuum), arisen from the Bogoyavlensky's (2+1)-dimensional KdV hierarchy. Our method is based on the bilinear identity of the hierarchy, which is related to the vertex operator representation of the toroidal Lie algebra $\sl_2^{tor}$.
