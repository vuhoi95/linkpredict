Title: QED Effective Action Revisited
Authors: Ulrich D. Jentschura and Holger Gies and Sree Ram Valluri and Darrell R. Lamm and Ernst Joachim Weniger
Abstract: The derivation of a convergent series representation for the quantum electrodynamic effective action obtained by two of us (S.R.V. and D.R.L.) in [Can. J. Phys. vol. 71, p. 389 (1993)] is reexamined. We present more details of our original derivation. Moreover, we discuss the relation of the electric-magnetic duality to the integral representation for the effective action, and we consider the application of nonlinear convergence acceleration techniques which permit the efficient and reliable numerical evaluation of the quantum correction to the Maxwell Lagrangian.
