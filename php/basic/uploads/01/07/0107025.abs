Title: Thick Brane Worlds and Their Stability
Authors: Shinpei Kobayashi and Kazuya Koyama and Jiro Soda
Abstract: Three types of thick branes, i.e., Poincar\'{e}, de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter brane are considered. They are realized as the non-singular solutions of the Einstein equations with the non-trivial dilatons and the potentials. The scalar perturbations of these systems are also investigated. We find that the effective potentials of the master equations of the scalar perturbations are positive definite and consequently these systems are stable under the small perturbations.
