Title: Applications of scalar attractor solutions to Cosmology
Authors: S. C. C. Ng and N. J. Nunes and F. Rosati
Abstract: We develop a framework to study the phase space of a system consisting of a scalar field rolling down an arbitrary potential with varying slope and a background fluid, in a cosmological setting. We give analytical approximate solutions of the field evolution and discuss applications of its features to the issues of quintessence, moduli stabilisation and quintessential inflation.
