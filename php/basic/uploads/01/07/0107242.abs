Title: Cosmological constant and the fate of the DDM theory
Authors: Milan M. Cirkovic and Srdjan Samurovic
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the non-zero cosmological constant on the classical decaying dark matter theory developed by the late Dennis Sciama. In particular, we concentrate on the change in relevant values of cosmological parameters in comparison to the high-precision estimates given by Sciama (1997). It is shown that the appropriate changes in resulting parameter values are such to make the DDM concept less plausible. This is in complete agreement with recently reported observational results detrimental to this theory.
