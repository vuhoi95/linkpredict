Title: A new sequence for topological terms at any spacetime dimensions
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and E. C. Marino
Abstract: We investigate a sequence of quadratic topological terms of the Chern-Simons type in different spacetime dimensions, related by dimensional compactification and sharing the properties of topological mass generation and statistical transmutation. The implications for bosonization in several dimensions are also analyzed.
