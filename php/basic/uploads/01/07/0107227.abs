Title: Comments on conformal stability of brane-world models
Authors: M. Bouhmadi-Lopez and A. Zhuk
Abstract: The stability of 5-D brane-world models under conformal perturbations is investigated. The analysis is carried out in the general case and then it is applied to particular solutions. It is shown that models with the Poincare and the de Sitter branes are unstable because they have negative mass squared of gravexcitons whereas models with the Anti de Sitter branes have positive gravexciton mass squared and are stable. It is also shown that 4-D effective cosmological and gravitational constants on branes as well as gravexciton masses undergo hierarchy: they have different values on different branes.
