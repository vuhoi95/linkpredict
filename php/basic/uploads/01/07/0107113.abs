Title: The slowly rotating near extremal D1-D5 system as a `hot tube'
Authors: Oleg Lunin and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: The geometry of the D1-D5 system with a small angular momentum j has a long throat ending in a conical defect. We solve the scalar wave equation for low energy quanta in this geometry. The quantum is found to reflect off the end of the throat, and stay trapped in the throat for a long time. The length of the throat for j=1/2 equals n_1n_5 R, the length of the effective string in the CFT; we also find that at this distance the incident wave becomes nonlinear. Filling the throat with several quanta gives a `hot tube' which has emission properties similar to those of the near extremal black hole.
