Title: Non-abelian plane waves and stochastic regimes for (2+1)-dimensional  gauge field models with Chern-Simons term
Authors: D. Ebert and V. Ch. Zhukovsky and M. V. Rogal
Abstract: An exact time-dependent solution of field equations for the 3-d gauge field model with a Chern-Simons (CS) topological mass is found. Limiting cases of constant solution and solution with vanishing topological mass are considered. After Lorentz boost, the found solution describes a massive nonlinear non-abelian plane wave. For the more complicate case of gauge fields with CS mass interacting with a Higgs field, the stochastic character of motion is demonstrated.
