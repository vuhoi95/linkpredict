Title: Noncommutative Cohomological Field Theory and GMS soliton
Authors: Tomomi Ishikawa and Shin-Ichiro Kuroki and Akifumi Sako
Abstract: We show that it is possible to construct a quantum field theory that is invariant under the translation of the noncommutative parameter $\theta_{\mu\nu}$. This is realized in a noncommutative cohomological field theory. As an example, a noncommutative cohomological scalar field theory is constructed, and its partition function is calculated. The partition function is the Euler number of Gopakumar, Minwalla and Strominger (GMS) soliton space.
