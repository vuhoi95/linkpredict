Title: Noncommutative Solitons and the W_{1+\infty} Algebras in Quantum Hall  Theory
Authors: Chuan-Tsung Chan and Jen-Chi Lee
Abstract: We show that U(\infty) symmetry transformations of the noncommutative field theory in the Moyal space are generated by a combination of two W_{1+\infty} algebras in the Landau problem. Geometrical meaning of this infinite symmetry is illustrated by examining the transformations of an invariant subgroup on the noncommutative solitons, which generate deformations and boosts of solitons. In particular, we find that boosts of solitons, which was first introduced in Ref[22], are valid only in the infinite "theta" limit.
