Authors: C. Burdik and A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: The lagrangian description of irreducible massless representations of the Poincare group with the corresponding Young tableaux having two rows along with some explicit examples including the notoph and Weyl tensor is given. For this purpose is used the method of the BRST constructions adopted to the systems of second class constraints by the construction of an auxiliary representations of the algebras of constraints in terms of Verma modules.
