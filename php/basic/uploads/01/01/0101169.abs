Title: Scalar field spacetimes and the AdS/CFT conjecture
Authors: Saurya Das and J. Gegenberg and V. Husain
Abstract: We describe a class of asymptotically AdS scalar field spacetimes, and calculate the associated conserved charges for three, four and five spacetime dimensions using the conformal and counter-term prescriptions. The energy associated with the solutions in each case is proportional to $\sqrt{M^2 - k^2}$, where $M$ is a constant and $k$ is a scalar charge. In five spacetime dimensions, the counter-term prescription gives an additional vacuum (Casimir) energy, which agrees with that found in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. We find a surprising degeneracy: the energy of the ``extremal'' scalar field solution $M=k$ equals the energy of pure AdS. This result is discussed in light of the AdS/CFT conjecture.
