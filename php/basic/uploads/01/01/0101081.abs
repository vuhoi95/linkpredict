Title: Noncommutativity and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect
Authors: J. Gamboa and M. Loewe and J. C. Rojas
Abstract: The possibility of detecting noncommutive space relics is analyzed by using the Aharonov-Bohm effect. If space is non-commutative, it turns out that the holonomy receives kinematical corrections that tend to diffuse the fringe pattern. This fringe pattern has a non-trivial energy dependence and, therefore, one could observe noncommutative effects by modifying the energy of the incident electrons beam in the Tonomura experimental arrangement
