Title: Light Cone Consistency in Bimetric General Relativity
Authors: J. Brian Pitts and W. C. Schieve
Abstract: General relativity can be formally derived as a flat spacetime theory, but the consistency of the resulting curved metric's light cone with the flat metric's null cone has not been adequately considered. If the two are inconsistent, then gravity is not just another field in flat spacetime after all. Here we discuss recent progress in describing the conditions for consistency and prospects for satisfying those conditions.
