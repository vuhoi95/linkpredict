Title: Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics of Colored Particles
Authors: Sh. Mamedov and Jian-Zu Zhang and V. Zhukovskii
Abstract: The role of supercharge operators is studied in the case of a Dirac particle moving in a constant chromomagnetic field. The Hamiltonian is factorised and the ground state wave function in the case of unbroken supersymmetry is determined.
