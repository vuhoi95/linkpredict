Title: On Fractional Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics: The Fractional  Supersymmetric Oscillator
Authors: M. Daoud and M. R. Kibler
Abstract: The Hamiltonian for a fractional supersymmetric oscillator is derived from three approaches. The first one is based on a decomposition in which a Q-uon gives rise to an ordinary boson and a k-fermion (a k-fermion being an object interpolating between boson and fermion). The second one starts from a generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra. Finally, the third one relies on the quantum algebra Uq(sl(2)) where q is a root of unity.
