Title: On the Polarization of Unstable D0-Branes into Non-Commutative Odd  Spheres
Authors: Z. Guralnik and S. Ramgoolam
Abstract: We consider the polarization of unstable type IIB D0-branes in the presence of a background five-form field strength. This phenomenon is studied from the point of view of the leading terms in the non-abelian Born Infeld action of the unstable D0-branes. The equations have SO(4) invariant solutions describing a non-commutative 3-sphere, which becomes a classical 3-sphere in the large N limit. We discuss the interpretation of these solutions as spherical D3-branes. The tachyon plays a tantalizingly geometrical role in relating the fuzzy S^3 geometry to that of a fuzzy S^4.
