Title: Background Independent Open String Field Theory with Constant B field On  the Annulus
Authors: R. Rashkov and K. S. Viswanathan and Y. Yang
Abstract: We study Witten's background independent open-string field theory in the presence of a constant B-field at one loop level. The Green's function and the partition function with a constant B-field are evaluated for an annulus.
