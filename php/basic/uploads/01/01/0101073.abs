Title: Quasi Exactly Solvable NxN-Matrix Schroedinger Operators
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: New examples of matrix quasi exactly solvable Schroedinger operators are constructed. One of them constitutes a matrix generalization of the quasi exactly solvable anharmonic oscillator, the corresponding invariant vector space is constructed explicitely. Also investigated are matrix generalizations of the Lame equation.
