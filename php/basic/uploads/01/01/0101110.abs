Title: Exact renormalization group equations and the field theoretical approach  to critical phenomena
Authors: C. Bagnuls and C. Bervillier
Abstract: After a brief presentation of the exact renormalization group equation, we illustrate how the field theoretical (perturbative) approach to critical phenomena takes place in the more general Wilson (nonperturbative) approach. Notions such as the continuum limit and the renormalizability and the presence of singularities in the perturbative series are discussed.
