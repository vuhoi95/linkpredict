Title: Refined chiral Slavnov-Taylor identities: Renormalization and Local  Physics
Authors: Marco Picariello and Andrea Quadri
Abstract: We study the quantization of chiral QED by means of an extended Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identity under which an external source and the ghost field form a doublet. This ST identity incorporates the Adler-Bardeen anomaly. We prove that the cohomology classes of the extended classical linearized ST operator ${\cal S}'_0$ are modified with respect to the ones of the classical BRST differential in the FP neutral sector (physical observables). This provides a counterexample showing that the introduction of a doublet can modify the cohomology of the model, as a consequence of the fact that the counting operator for the doublet does not commute with ${\cal S}'_0$.
