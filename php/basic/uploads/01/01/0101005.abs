Title: Nonlocal two-dimensional Yang-Mills- and generalized Yang-Mills-theories
Authors: Khaled Saaidi and Mohammad Khorrami
Abstract: A generalization of the two-dimensional Yang-Mills and generalized Yang-Mills theory is introduced in which the building B-F theory is nonlocal in the auxiliary field. The classical and quantum properties of this nonlocal generalization are investigated and it is shown that for large gauge groups, there exist a simple correspondence between the properties a nonlocal theory and its corresponding local theory.
