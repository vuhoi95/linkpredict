Authors: Carl M. Bender and Gerald V. Dunne and Peter N. Meisinger and Mehmet Simsek
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical PT-symmetric theories associated with complex cubic potentials such as V=x^2+y^2+igxy^2 and V=x^2+y^2+z^2+igxyz, where g is a real parameter, are investigated. These theories appear to possess real, positive spectra. Low-lying energy levels are calculated to very high order in perturbation theory. The large-order behavior of the perturbation coefficients is determined using multidimensional WKB tunneling techniques. This approach is also applied to the complex Henon-Heiles potential V=x^2+y^2+ig(xy^2-x^3/3).
