Title: Test of Siegel Gauge for the Lump Solution
Authors: Partha Mukhopadhyay and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: We test the validity of the Siegel gauge condition for the lump solution of cubic open bosonic string field theory by checking the equations of motion of the string field components outside the Siegel gauge. At level (3,6) approximation, the linear and quadratic terms of the equations of motion of these fields are found to cancel within about 20%.
