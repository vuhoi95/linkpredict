Title: Entropy bounds, monotonicity properties and scaling in CFTs
Authors: D. Klemm and A. C. Petkou and G. Siopsis
Abstract: We study the ratio of the entropy to the total energy in conformal field theories at finite temperature. For the free field realizations of {\cal N}=4 super Yang-Mills theory in D=4 and the (2,0) tensor multiplet in D=6, the ratio is bounded from above. The corresponding bounds are less stringent than the recently proposed Verlinde bound. We show that entropy bounds arise generically in CFTs in connection to monotonicity properties with respect to temperature changes of a generalized C-function. For strongly coupled CFTs with AdS duals, we show that the ratio obeys the Verlinde bound even in the presence of rotation. For such CFTs, we point out an intriguing resemblance in their thermodynamic formulas with the corresponding ones of two-dimensional CFTs. We show that simple scaling forms for the free energy and entropy of CFTs with AdS duals reproduce the thermodynamical properties of (D+1)-dimensional AdS black holes.
