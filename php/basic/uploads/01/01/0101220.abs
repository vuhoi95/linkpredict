Title: Hamiltonian Formulation of Open WZW Strings
Authors: S. Giusto and M. B. Halpern
Abstract: Using a Hamiltonian approach, we construct the classical and quantum theory of open WZW strings on a strip. (These are the strings which end on WZW branes.) The development involves non-abelian generalized Dirichlet images in an essential way. At the classical level, we find a new non-commutative geometry in which the equal-time coordinate brackets are non-zero at the world-sheet boundary, and the result is an intrinsically non-abelian effect which vanishes in the abelian limit. Using the classical theory as a guide to the quantum theory, we also find the operator algebra and the analogue of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the the conformal field theory of open WZW strings.
