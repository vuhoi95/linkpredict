Title: Exotic plasma as classical Hall Liquid
Authors: C. Duval Z. Horváth and P. A. Horváthy
Abstract: A non-relativistic plasma model endowed with an ``exotic'' structure associated with the two-parameter central extension of the planar Galilei group is constructed. Introducing a Chern-Simons statistical gauge field provides us with a self-consistent system; when the magnetic field takes a critical value determined by the extension parameters, the fluid becomes incompressible and moves collectively, according to the Hall law.
