Title: Relic Dark energy from Trans-Planckian Regime
Authors: Laura Mersini and Mar Bastero-Gil and Panagiota Kanti
Abstract: As yet, there is no underlying fundamental theory for the transplanckian regime. There is a need to address the issue of how the observables in our present universe are affected by processes that may have occured during the transplanckian regime. A particular feature of the family of dispersion functions chosen is the production of ultralow frequencies at very high momenta $k> M_P$. We name the range of the ultralow energy modes (of very short distances) that have frequencies equal or less than the current Hubble rate $H_0$ as the $\it{tail}$ modes. These modes are still frozen today due to the expansion of the universe. We calculate their energy today and show that the $tail$ provides a strong candidate for the {\it dark energy} of the universe. During inflation, their energy is about 122-123 orders of magnitude smaller than the total energy. We present the exact solutions and show that: the CMBR spectrum is that of a (nearly) black body, and that the adiabatic vacuum is the only choice for the initial conditions. Finally, some of these results can also be applied to black hole physics.
