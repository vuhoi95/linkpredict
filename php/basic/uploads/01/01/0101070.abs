Title: p-Branes from Generalized Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: S. Ansoldi and C. Castro and E. Spallucci
Abstract: We consider the reduced, quenched version of a generalized Yang-Mills action in 4k-dimensional spacetime. This is a new kind of matrix theory which is mapped through the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal correspondence into a field theory over a non-commutative phase space. We show that the ``classical'' limit of this field theory is encoded into the effective action of an open, (4k-1)-dimensional, bulk brane enclosed by a dynamical, Chern-Simons type, (4k-2)-dimensional, boundary brane. The bulk action is a pure volume term, while the boundary action carries all the dynamical degrees of freedom.
