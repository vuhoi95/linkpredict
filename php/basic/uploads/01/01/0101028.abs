Title: Holographic Renormalization Group and Fermionic Boundary Data
Authors: Jussi Kalkkinen and Dario Martelli
Abstract: We discuss Holographic Renormalization Group equations in the presence of fermions and form fields in the bulk. The existence of a holographically dual quantum field theory for a given bulk gravity theory imposes consistency conditions on the ranks of the form fields, the fermion - form field couplings, and leads to a novel Ward identity.
