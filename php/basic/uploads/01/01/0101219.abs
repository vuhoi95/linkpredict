Title: Lattice measurement of the energy-gap in a spontaneously broken phase
Authors: P. Cea and M. Consoli and L. Cosmai
Abstract: Using lattice simulations of a one-component $(\lambda \Phi^4)_4$ theory, we have measured the energy spectrum $\omega({\mathbf{k}})$ in the broken phase at various lattice sizes. Our data show that the energy-gap $\omega(0)$ is {\it not} the `Higgs mass' $M_h$ but an infrared-sensitive quantity that becomes smaller and smaller by increasing the lattice size and may even vanish in the infinite-volume limit.
