Title: Unitary representations of SW(3/2,2) superconformal algebra
Authors: Doron Gepner and Boris Noyvert
Abstract: SW(3/2,2) superconformal algebra is W algebra with two Virasoro operators. The Kac determinant is calculated and the complete list of unitary representations is determined. Two types of extensions of SW(3/2,2) algebra are discussed. A new approach to construction of W algebras from rational conformal field theories is proposed.
