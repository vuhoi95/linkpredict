Title: Quark-Antiquark Potential for Siegel Strings
Authors: Arshad Momen and G. Dastegir Al-Quaderi
Abstract: We compute the quark-antiquark potential employing the continuum action for QCD-like random lattice strings proposed by Siegel. The model leads to a potential similar to those obtained from Nambu-Goto string theory but has some modifications which we interpret as velocity dependent contributions. We also propose to add extra terms in the action which lead to physically interesting propagators for partons for the infrared region.
