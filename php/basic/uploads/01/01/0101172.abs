Title: Fractional Supersymmetry As a Matrix Model
Authors: Ilham Benkaddour and El Hassane Saidi
Abstract: Using parafermionic field theoretical methods, the fundamentals of 2d fractional supersymmetry ${\bf Q}^{K} =P$ are set up. Known difficulties induced by methods based on the $U_{q}(sl(2))$ quantum group representations and non commutative geometry are overpassed in the parafermionic approach. Moreover we find that fractional supersymmetric algebras are naturally realized as matrix models. The K=3 case is studied in details. Links between 2d $({1\over 3},0)$ and $(({1\over 3}^{2}),0)$ fractional supersymmetries and N=2 U(1) and N=4 su(2) standard supersymmetries respectively are exhibited. Field theoretical models describing the self couplings of the matter multiplets $(0^{2},({1\over 3})^{2},({2\over 3})^{2})$ and $(0^{4},({1\over 3})^{4},({2\over 3})^{4})$ are given.
