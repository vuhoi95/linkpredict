Title: Heat trace asymptotics with transmittal boundary conditions and quantum  brane-world scenario
Authors: P. B. Gilkey and K. Kirsten and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We study the spectral geometry of an operator of Laplace type on a manifold with a singular surface. We calculate several first coefficients of the heat kernel expansion. These coefficients are responsible for divergences and conformal anomaly in quantum brane-world scenario.
