Title: On an exactly solvable $B_N$ type Calogero model with nonhermitian PT  invariant interaction
Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: An exactly solvable many-particle quantum system is proposed by adding some nonhermitian but PT invariant interactions to the $B_N$ Calogero model. We have shown that such extended $B_N$ Calogero model leads to completely real spectrum which obey generalised exclusion statistics. It is also found that the corresponding exchange statistics parameter exhibit `reflection symmetry' provided the strength of a PT invariant interaction exceeds a critical value.
