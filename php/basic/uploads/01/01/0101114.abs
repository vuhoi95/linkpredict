Title: Casimir Effect for a Dielectric Wedge
Authors: I. Brevik and K. Pettersen
Abstract: The Casimir effect is considered for a wedge with opening angle $\alpha $, with perfectly conducting walls, when the interior region is filled with an isotropic and nondispersive medium with permittivity $\epsilon $ and permeability $\mu $. The electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor in the bulk is calculated, together with the surface stress on the walls. A discussion is given on the possibilities for measuring the influence of the medium, via the Casimir-Polder force.
