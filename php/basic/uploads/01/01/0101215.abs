Title: Interference of Spin-2 Self-Dual Modes
Authors: Anderson Ilha and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We study the effects of interference between the self-dual and anti self-dual massive modes of the linearized Einstein-Chern-Simons topological gravity. The dual models to be used in the interference process are carefully analyzed with special emphasis on their propagating spectrum. We identify the opposite dual aspects, necessary for the application of the interference formalism on this model. The soldered theory so obtained displays explicitly massive modes of the Proca type. It may also be written in a form of Polyakov-Weigman identity to a better appreciation of its physical contents.
