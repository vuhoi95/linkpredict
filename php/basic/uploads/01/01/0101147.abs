Title: Gromov-Witten theory, Hurwitz numbers, and Matrix models, I
Authors: Andrei Okounkov and Rahul Pandharipande
Abstract: The main goal of the paper is to present a new approach via Hurwitz numbers to Kontsevich's combinatorial/matrix model for the intersection theory of the moduli space of curves. A secondary goal is to present an exposition of the circle of ideas involved: Hurwitz numbers, Gromov-Witten theory of the projective line, matrix integrals, and the theory of random trees. Further topics will be treated in a sequel.
