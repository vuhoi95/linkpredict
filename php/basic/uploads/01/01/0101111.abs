Title: Dirac-Connes Operator on Discrete Abelian Groups and Lattices
Authors: Jian Dai and Xing-Chang Song
Abstract: A kind of Dirac-Connes operator defined in the framework of Connes' NCG is introduced on discrete abelian groups; it satisfies a Junk-free condition, and bridges the NCG composed by Dimakis, M\"{u}ller-Hoissen and Sitarz and the NCG of Connes. Then we apply this operator to d-dimensional lattices.
