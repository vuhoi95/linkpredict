Title: Supersymmetry Transformation of Quantum Fields
Authors: Christian Rupp and Rainer Scharf and Klaus Sibold
Abstract: In the Wess-Zumino gauge, supersymmetry transformations become non-linear and are usually incorporated together with BRS transformations in the form of Slavnov-Taylor identities, such that they appear at first sight to be even non-local. Furthermore, the gauge fixing term breaks supersymmetry. In the present paper, we clarify in which sense supersymmetry is still a symmetry of the system and how it is realized on the level of quantum fields.
