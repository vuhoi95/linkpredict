Title: High-temperature, classical, real-time dynamics of non-abelian gauge  theories as seen by a computer

Abstract: We test at the electroweak scale the recently proposed elaborate theoretical scenario for real-time dynamics of non-abelian gauge theories at high temperature. We see no sign of the predicted behavior. This indicates that perturbative concepts like color conductivity and Landau damping might be irrelevant at temperatures corresponding to the electroweak scale.
