Title: The Generalized Gell-Mann--Low Theorem for Relativistic Bound States
Authors: Axel Weber and Norbert E. Ligterink
Abstract: The recently established generalized Gell-Mann--Low theorem is applied in lowest perturbative order to bound-state calculations in a simple scalar field theory with cubic couplings. The approach via the generalized Gell-Mann--Low Theorem retains, while being fully relativistic, many of the desirable features of the quantum mechanical approaches to bound states. In particular, no abnormal or unphysical solutions are found in the model under consideration. Both the non-relativistic and one-body limits are straightforward and consistent. The results for the spectrum are compared to those of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (in the ladder approximation) and related equations.
