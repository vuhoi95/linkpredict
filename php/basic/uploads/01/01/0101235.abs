Abstract: In the context of $AdS/CFT$ correspondence the two Wilson loop correlator is examined at both zero and finite temperatures. On the basis of an entirely analytical approach we have found for Nambu-Goto strings the functional relation $d S_c^{(Reg)} / dL = 2 \pi k$ between Euclidean action $S_c$ and loop separation $L$ with integration constant $k$, which corresponds to the analogous formula for point-particles. The physical implications of this relation are explored in particular for the Gross-Ooguri phase transition at finite temperature.
