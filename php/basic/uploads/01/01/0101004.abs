Title: Black Hole Horizon in Superstring Inspired D-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
Authors: E. G. Vorontsova and G. S. Sharov
Abstract: In $D$-dimensional dilaton gravitational model stationary Schwarzschild type solutions (centrally symmetrical solutions in vacuum) are obtained. They contain the two-parameter set of solutions: the first parameter is proportional to a central mass and the second one describes intensity of the dilaton field. If the latter parameter equals zero we have pure Schwarzschild solution with the black hole and constant dilaton field. But when the mentioned parameter is non-zero and the dilaton is non-constant, the black hole horizon vanishes.
