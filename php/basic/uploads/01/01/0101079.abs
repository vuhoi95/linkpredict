Title: Perturbative Algebraic Field Theory, and Deformation Quantization
Authors: Michael Duetsch and Klaus Fredenhagen
Abstract: A perturbative formulation of algebraic field theory is presented, both for the classical and for the quantum case, and it is shown that the relation between them may be understood in terms of deformation quantization.
