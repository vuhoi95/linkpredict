Title: Role of the brane curvature scalar in the brane world cosmology
Authors: N. J. Kim and H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We include the brane curvature scalar to study its cosmological implication in the brane world cosmology. This term is usually introduced to obtain the well-defined stress-energy tensor on the boundary of anti de Sitter-Schwarzschild space. Here we treat this as the perturbed term for cosmological purpose. We find corrections to the well-known equation of the brane cosmology. It contains new interesting terms which may play the important role in the brane cosmology.
