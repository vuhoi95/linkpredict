Title: Gravitational waves in non-singular string cosmologies
Authors: C. Cartier and E. J. Copeland and M. Gasperini
Abstract: We study the evolution of tensor metric fluctuations in a class of non-singular models based on the string effective action, by including in the perturbation equation the higher-derivative and loop corrections needed to regularise the background solutions. We discuss the effects of such higher-order corrections on the final graviton spectrum, and we compare the results of analytical and numerical computations.
