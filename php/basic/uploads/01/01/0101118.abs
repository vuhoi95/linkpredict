Title: A diagrammatic approach to the spectrum of cosmological perturbations
Authors: G. De Risi and M. Gasperini
Abstract: We compute the spectral distribution of the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum, amplified by inflation, after an arbitrary number of background transitions. Using a graphic representation of the process we find that the final spectrum can be completely determined trough a synthetic set of working rules, and a list of simple algebraic computations.
