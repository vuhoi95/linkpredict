Title: A note on N=4 supersymmetric mechanics on KÃ¤hler manifolds
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: The geometric models of N=4 supersymmetric mechanics with $(2d.2d)_{\DC}$-dimensional phase space are proposed, which can be viewed as one-dimensional counterparts of two-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric sigma-models by Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Freedman. The related construction of supersymmetric mechanics whose phase space is a K\"ahler supermanifold is considered. Also, its relation with antisymplectic geometry is discussed.
