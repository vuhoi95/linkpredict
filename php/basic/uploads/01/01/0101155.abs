Title: Vacuum densities and zero-point energy for fields obeying Robin  conditions on cylindrical surfaces
Authors: August Romeo and Aram A. Saharian
Abstract: The Casimir effect for general Robin conditions on the surface of a cylinder in $D$-spacetime dimensions is studied for massive scalar field with general curvature coupling. The energy distribution and vacuum stress are investigated. We separate volumic and superficial energy contributions, for both interior and exterior space regions. The possibility that some special conditions may be energetically singled out is indicated.
