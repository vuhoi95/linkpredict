Title: On the high derivative fermionic operator and trace anomaly
Authors: G. de Berredo-Peixoto and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: We construct a new example of the high derivative four-dimensional conformal operator. This operator acts on fermions, and its contribution to the trace anomaly has opposite sign, as compared to conventional scalars, spinors and vectors. Possible generalizations and applications are discussed.
