Title: A Theory of the Casimir Effect for Compact Regions
Authors: Luiz A. Manzoni and Walter F. Wreszinski
Abstract: We develop a mathematically precise framework for the Casimir effect. Our working hypothesis, verified in the case of parallel plates, is that only the regularization-independent Ramanujan sum of a given asymptotic series contributes to the Casimir pressure. As an illustration, we treat two cases: parallel plates, identifying a previous cutoff free version (by G. Scharf and W. W.) as a special case, and the sphere.We finally discuss the open problem of the Casimir force for the cube. We propose an Ansatz for the exterior force and argue why it may provide the exact solution, as well as an explanation of the repulsive sign of the force.
