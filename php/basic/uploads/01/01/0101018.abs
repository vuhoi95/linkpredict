Title: D-branes and constant electro-magnetic backgrounds
Authors: J. Bogaerts and A. Sevrin and J. Troost and W. Troost and S. van der Loo
Abstract: We probe the effective worldvolume theory of a set of coinciding D-branes by switching on constant electro-magnetic fields on them. The comparison of the mass spectrum predicted by string theory with the mass spectrum obtained from the effective action provides insights in the structure of the effective theory.
