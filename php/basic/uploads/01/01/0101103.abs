Authors: Wen-Fa Lu and Chul Koo Kim and Jae Hyung Yee and Kyun Nahm
Abstract: A Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory based on the Gaussian wavefunctional is constructed. The method can be used for calculating the energies of both the vacuum and the excited states. A model calculation is carried out for the vacuum state of the $\lambda\phi^4$ field theory.
