Title: The Layer Phase in the Non-isotropic SU(3) Gauge Model at Finite  Temperature
Authors: Guo-Li Wang and Ying-Kai Fu
Abstract: The phase structure of a non-isotropic non-Abelian SU(3) lattice gauge model at finite temperature is investigated to the third order in the variational-cumulant expansion (VCE) approach. The layer phase exists in this model in the cases of dimensions D=4, D=5 (d=D-1).
