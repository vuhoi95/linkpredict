Title: Large scale geometry and evolution of a universe with radiation pressure  and cosmological constant
Authors: Robert Coquereaux and Alex Grossmann
Abstract: In view of new experimental results that strongly suggest a non-zero cosmological constant, it becomes interesting to revisit the Friedman-Lemaitre model of evolution of a universe with cosmological constant and radiation pressure. In this paper, we discuss the explicit solutions for that model and perform numerical explorations for reasonable values of cosmological parameters. We also analyse the behaviour of redshifts in such models and the description of ``very large scale geometrical features'' when analysed by distant observers.
