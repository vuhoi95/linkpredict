Title: Energy Spectrum of a Relativistic Two-dimensional Hydrogen-like Atom in  a Constant Magnetic Field of arbitrary strength
Authors: V. M. Villalba and R. Pino
Abstract: We compute, via a variational mixed-base method, the energy spectrum of a two dimensional relativistic atom in the presence of a constant magnetic field of arbitrary strength. The results are compared to those obtained in the non-relativistic and spinless case. We find that the relativistic spectrum does not present $s$ states.
