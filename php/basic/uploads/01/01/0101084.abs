Abstract: We simulate a supersymmetric matrix model obtained from dimensional reduction of 4d SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory. The model is well defined for finite N and it is found that the large N limit obtained by keeping g^2 N fixed gives rise to well defined operators which represent string amplitudes. The space-time structure which arises dynamically from the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices is discussed, as well as the effect of supersymmetry on the dynamical properties of the model. Eguchi-Kawai equivalence of this model to ordinary gauge theory does hold within a finite range of scale. We report on new simulations of the bosonic model for N up to 768 that confirm this property, which comes as a surprise since no quenching or twist is introduced.
