Title: Black Hole Evaporation and Compact Extra Dimensions
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Benjamin Harms
Abstract: We study the evaporation of black holes in space-times with extra dimensions of size L. We first obtain a description which interpolates between the expected behaviors of very large and very small black holes and then show that the luminosity is greatly damped when the horizon shrinks towards L from a larger value. Analogously, black holes born with an initial size smaller than L are almost stable. This effect is due to the dependence of both the Hawking temperature and the grey-body factor of a black hole on the dimensionality of space. Although the picture of what happens when the horizon becomes of size L is still incomplete, we argue that there occurs a (first order) phase transition, possibly signaled by an outburst of energy which leaves a quasi-stable remnant.
