Title: Our World as an Intersection of Walls and a String
Authors: Norisuke Sakai and Shigemitsu Tomizawa
Abstract: A solution of Einstein equations is obtained for our four-dimensional world as an intersection of a wall and a string-like defect in seven-dimensional spacetime with a negative cosmological constant. A matter energy-momentum tensor localized on the wall and on the string is needed. A single massless graviton is found and is localized around the intersection. The leading correction to the gravitational Newton potential from massive spin 2 graviton is found to be almost identical to that of a wall in five dimensions, contrary to the case of a string in six dimensions. The generalization to the intersection of a string and $n$ orthogonally intersecting walls is also obtained and a similar result is found for the gravitational potential.
