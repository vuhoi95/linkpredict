Title: Dyonic BIon black hole in string inspired model
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We construct static and spherically symmetric particle-like and black hole solutions with magnetic and/or electric charge in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton-axion system, which is a generalization of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) system and of the Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) system. They have remarkable properties which are not seen for the corresponding solutions in the EMDA and the EBI system.
