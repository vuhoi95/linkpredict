Title: Scalar, electromagnetic and Weyl perturbations of BTZ black holes: quasi  normal modes
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We calculate the quasinormal modes and associated frequencies of the Banados, Zanelli and Teitelboim (BTZ) non-rotating black hole. This black hole lives in 2+1-dimensions in an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime. We obtain exact results for the wavefunction and quasi normal frequencies of scalar, electromagnetic and Weyl (neutrino) perturbations.
