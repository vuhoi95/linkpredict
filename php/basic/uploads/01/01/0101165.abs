Title: Supersymmetry Transformation of Quantum Fields II: Supersymmetric  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Christian Rupp and Klaus Sibold
Abstract: We study the transformation law of quantum fields in super Yang-Mills theory quantized in the Wess-Zumino gauge. It can be derived from a local version of generalized Slavnov-Taylor identities for general Green functions. Under suitable normalization conditions the transformations are local. Within the vector multiplet anomalous dimensions become equal. The breaking of susy shows up in Fock but not in Hilbert space and is not reflected in the transformation law for the fields.
