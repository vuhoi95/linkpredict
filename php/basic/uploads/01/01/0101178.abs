Title: New supersymmetry algebra on gravitational interaction of  Nambu-Goldstone fermion
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: The spacetime symmetries of SGM action proposed as the gravitational coupling of N-G fermions are investigated. The commutators of new nonlinear supersymmetry (NL SUSY) transformations form a closed algebra, which reveals N-G fermion (NL SUSY) nature and a generalized general coordinate transformation. A generalized local Lorentz transformation, which forms a closed algebra, is also introduced.
