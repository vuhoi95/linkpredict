Title: Compactified D=11 Supermembranes and Symplectic Non-Commutative Gauge  Theories
Authors: I. Martin and J. Ovalle and A. Restuccia
Abstract: It is shown that a double compactified D=11 supermembrane with non trivial wrapping may be formulated as a symplectic non-commutative gauge theory on the world volume. The symplectic non commutative structure is intrinsically obtained from the symplectic 2-form on the world volume defined by the minimal configuration of its hamiltonian. The gauge transformations on the symplectic fibration are generated by the area preserving diffeomorphisms on the world volume. Geometrically, this gauge theory corresponds to a symplectic fibration over a compact Riemman surface with a symplectic connection.
