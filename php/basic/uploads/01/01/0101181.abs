Title: Non-critical Non-singular Bosonic Strings, Linear Dilatons and  Holography
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Cesar Gomez and Lorenzo Hernandez and Pedro Resco
Abstract: $AdS_{5}$ with linear dilaton and non vanishing $B$-field is shown to be a solution of the non critical string beta function equations. A non critical $(D=5)$ solution interpolating between flat space-time and $AdS_{5}$, with asymptotic linear dilaton and non vanishing $B$-field is also presented. This solution is free of space-time singularities and has got the string coupling constant everywhere bounded. Both solutions admit holographic interpretation in terms of ${\cal N}=0$ field theories. Closed string tachyon stability is also discussed.
