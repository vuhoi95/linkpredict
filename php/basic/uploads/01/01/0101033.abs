Title: Classical mechanics on GL(n, R) group and Euler-Calogero-Sutherland  model
Authors: A. M. Khvedelidze and D. M. Mladenov
Abstract: Relations between the free motion on the GL^+(n, R) group manifold and the dynamics of an n-particle system with spin degrees of freedom on a line interacting with the pairwise 1/sinh^2 x ``potential'' (Euler-Calogero-Sutherland model) is discussed in the framework of Hamiltonian reduction. Two kinds of reductions of the degrees of freedom are considered: due to the continuous invariance and due to the discrete symmetry. It is shown that after projection on the corresponding invariant manifolds the resulting Hamiltonian system represents the Euler-Calogero-Sutherland model in both cases.
