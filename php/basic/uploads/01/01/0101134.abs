Title: Phase Transitions for Flat adS Black Holes
Authors: Sumati Surya and Kristin Schleich and Donald M. Witt
Abstract: We reexamine the thermodynamics of adS black holes with Ricci flat horizons using the adS soliton as the thermal background. We find that there is a phase transition which is dependent not only on the temperature, but also on the black hole area, which is an independent parameter. As in the spherical adS black hole, this phase transition is related via the adS/CFT correspondence to a confinement-deconfinement transition in the large N gauge theory on the conformal boundary at infinity.
