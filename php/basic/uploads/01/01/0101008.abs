Abstract: We study a cosmic string solution of an N=1-supersymmetric version of the Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond (CSKR) Lagrangian coupled to a vector superfield by means of a topological mass term. The 2-form gauge potential is proposed to couple non-minimally to matter, here described by a chiral scalar superfield. The important outcome is that supersymmetry is kept exact both in the core and in the exterior region of the string. We contemplate the bosonic configurations and it can be checked that the solutions saturate the Bogomolnyi bound. A glimpse on the fermionic zero modes is also given.
