Title: Group Invariant Solutions in Mathematical Physics and Differential  Geometry
Authors: I. M. Anderson and M. E. Fels and C. G. Torre
Abstract: This is a brief overview of our work on the theory of group invariant solutions to differential equations. The motivations and applications of this work stem from problems in differential geometry and relativistic field theory. The key feature in our theory is that we allow for non-transverse symmetry group actions, which are very common in applications.
