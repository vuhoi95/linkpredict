Title: Minimal model boundary flows and c=1 CFT
Authors: K. Graham and I. Runkel and G. M. T Watts
Abstract: We consider perturbations of unitary minimal models by boundary fields. Initially we consider the models in the limit as c -> 1 and find that the relevant boundary fields all have simple interpretations in this limit. This interpretation allows us to conjecture the IR limits of flows in the unitary minimal models generated by the fields \phi_{rr} of `low' weight. We check this conjecture using the truncated conformal space approach. In the process we find evidence for a new series of integrable boundary flows.
