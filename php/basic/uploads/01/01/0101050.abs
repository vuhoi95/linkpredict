Abstract: The fully developed turbulence with weak anisotropy is investigated by means of renormalization group approach (RG) and double expansion regularization for dimensions $d\ge 2$. Some modification of the standard minimal substraction scheme has been used to analyze stability of the Kolmogorov scaling regime which is governed by the renormalization group fixed point. This fixed point is unstable at $d=2$; thus, the infinitesimally weak anisotropy destroyes above scaling regime in two-dimensional space. The restoration of the stability of this fixed point, under transition from $d=2$ to $d=3,$ has been demonstrated at borderline dimension $ 2<d_c<3$. The results are in qualitative agreement with ones obtained recently in the framework of the usual analytical regularization scheme.
