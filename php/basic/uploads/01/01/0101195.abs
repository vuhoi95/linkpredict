Title: Towards the complete N=2 superfield Born-Infeld action with partially  broken N=4 supersymmetry
Authors: S. Bellucci and E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos
Abstract: We propose a systematic way of constructing $N=2, d=4$ superfield Born-Infeld action with a second nonlinearly realized N=2 supersymmetry. The latter, together with the manifest N=2 supersymmetry, form a central-charge extended $N=4, d=4$ supersymmetry. We embed the Goldstone-Maxwell N=2 multiplet into an infinite-dimensional off-shell supermultiplet of this N=4 supersymmetry and impose an infinite set of covariant constraints which eliminate all extra N=2 superfields through the Goldstone-Maxwell one. The Born-Infeld superfield Lagrangian density is one of these composite superfields. The constraints can be solved by iterations to any order in the fields. We present the sought N=2 Born-Infeld action up to the 10th order. It encompasses the action found earlier by Kuzenko and Theisen to the 8th order from a self-duality requirement. This is a strong indication that the complete N=2 Born-Infeld action with partially broken N=4 supersymmetry is also self-dual.
