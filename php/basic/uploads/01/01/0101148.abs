Title: Multidimensional Phase Space and Sunset Diagrams
Authors: A. Bashir and R. Delbourgo and M. L. Roberts
Abstract: We derive expressions for the phase-space of a particle of momentum $p$ decaying into $N$ particles, that are valid for any number of dimensions. These are the imaginary parts of so-called `sunset' diagrams, which we also obtain. The results are given as a series of hypergeometric functions, which terminate for odd dimensions and are also well-suited for deriving the threshold behaviour.
