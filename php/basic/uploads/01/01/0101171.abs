Title: Instanton molecules at high temperature - the Georgi-Glashow model and  beyond
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Alex Kovner and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We show that correlators of some local operators in gauge theories are sensitive to the presence of the instantons even at high temperature where the latter are bound into instanton-anti-instanton "molecules". We calculate correlation functions of such operators in the deconfined phase of the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model and discuss analogous quantities in the chirally symmetric phase of QCD. We clarify the mechanism by which the instanton-anti-instanton molecules contribute to the anomaly of axial U(1) at high temperature.
