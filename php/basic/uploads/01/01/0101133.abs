Title: Object picture of quasinormal ringing on the background of small  Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes
Authors: Jiong-Ming Zhu and Bin Wang and Elcio Abdalla
Abstract: We investigated the evolution of a scalar field propagating in small Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes. The imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency decreases with the horizon size and the real part of the quasinormal frequency keeps nearly as a constant. The object-picture clarified the question on the quasinormal modes for small Anti-de Sitter black holes. Dependence of quasinormal modes on spacetime dimensions and the multipole index for small Anti-de Sitter black holes have also been illustrated.
