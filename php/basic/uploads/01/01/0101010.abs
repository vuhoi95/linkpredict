Title: Comments on Unstable Branes
Authors: Ken Intriligator and Matt Kleban and Jason Kumar
Abstract: We argue that type II string theories contain unstable NS4 branes, which descend from a conjectured unstable M4 brane of M-theory. Assuming that an M2 brane can arise in M5 brane/anti-brane annihilation, the unstable M4 brane, and also an unstable M3 brane, must exist as sphalerons. We compare the tensions of the unstable NS4 branes, M4 brane, and related type II unstable D-branes, and present 11d supergravity solutions for unstable Mp branes for all p. We study the Z_2 gauge symmetry on the worldvolume of unstable branes, and argue that it can never be unbroken in the presence of lower brane charge.
