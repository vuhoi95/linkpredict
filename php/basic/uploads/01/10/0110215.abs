Title: Interacting Open Wilson Lines in Noncommutative Field Theories
Authors: Y. Kiem and S. Lee and S. -J. Rey and H. -T. Sato
Abstract: In noncommutative field theories, it was known that one-loop effective action describes propagation of non-interacting open Wilson lines, obeying the flying dipole's relation. We show that two-loop effective action describes cubic interaction among `closed string' states created by open Wilson lines. Taking d-dimensional noncommutative [\Phi^3] theory as the simplest setup, we compute nonplanar contribution at low-energy and large noncommutativity limit. We find that the contribution is expressible in a remarkably simple cubic interaction involving scalar open Wilson lines only and nothing else. We show that the interaction is purely geometrical and noncommutative in nature, depending only on sizes of each open Wilson line.
