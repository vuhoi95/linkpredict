Title: Hitchin Systems - Symplectic Hecke Correspondence and Two-dimensional  Version
Authors: A. M. Levin and M. A. Olshanetsky and A. Zotov
Abstract: The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we define symplectic maps between Hitchin systems related to holomorphic bundles of different degrees. We call these maps the Symplectic Hecke Correspondence (SHC) of the corresponding Higgs bundles. They are constructed by means of the Hecke correspondence of the underlying holomorphic bundles. SHC allows to construct B\"{a}cklund transformations in the Hitchin systems defined over Riemann curves with marked points. We apply the general scheme to the elliptic Calogero-Moser (CM) system and construct SHC to an integrable $\SLN$ Euler-Arnold top (the elliptic $\SLN$-rotator). Next, we propose a generalization of the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable theories related to the Higgs bundles of infinite rank. The main example is an integrable two-dimensional version of the two-body elliptic CM system. The previous construction allows to define SHC between the two-dimensional elliptic CM system and the Landau-Lifshitz equation.
