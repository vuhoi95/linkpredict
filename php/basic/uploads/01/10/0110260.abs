Title: A rotating black ring in five dimensions
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations in five dimensions are shown to admit a solution describing an asymptotically flat spacetime regular on and outside an event horizon of topology S^1 x S^2. It describes a rotating ``black ring''. This is the first example of an asymptotically flat vacuum solution with an event horizon of non-spherical topology. There is a range of values for the mass and angular momentum for which there exist two black ring solutions as well as a black hole solution. Therefore the uniqueness theorems valid in four dimensions do not have simple higher dimensional generalizations. It is suggested that increasing the spin of a five dimensional black hole beyond a critical value results in a transition to a black ring, which can have an arbitrarily large angular momentum for a given mass.
