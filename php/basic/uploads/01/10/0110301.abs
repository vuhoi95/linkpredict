Title: A Worldsheet Description of Large N_c Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Korkut Bardakci and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: The N_c to infinity limit of a matrix quantum field theory is equivalent to summing only planar Feynman diagrams. The possibility of interpreting this sum as some kind world-sheet theory has been in the air ever since 't Hooft's original paper. We establish here just such a world sheet description for a scalar quantum field with interaction term g\Tr\phi^3, and we indicate how the approach might be extended to more general field theories.
