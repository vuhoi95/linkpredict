Title: Characters of $\hat{sl}(4)_k$ fusion algebra at non-rational level
Authors: P. Furlan and V. B. Petkova
Abstract: We construct the fusion ring of a quasi-rational $\hat{sl}(4)_k$ WZNW theory at generic level $k \not\in Q$. It is generated by commutative elements in the group ring $Z[\tilde{W}]$ of the affine Weyl group $\tilde{W}$ which extend polynomially the formal characters of finite dimensional representations of $sl(4)$.
