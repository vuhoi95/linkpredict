Title: Geometric Transition versus Cascading Solution
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Kyungho Oh and Jaemo Park and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We study Vafa's geometric transition and Klebanov - Strassler solution from various points of view in M-theory. In terms of brane configurations, we show the detailed equivalences between the two models. In some limits, both models have an alternative realization as fourfolds in M-theory with appropriate G-fluxes turned on. We discuss some aspects of the fourfolds including how to see the transition and a possible extension to the non-supersymmetric case.
