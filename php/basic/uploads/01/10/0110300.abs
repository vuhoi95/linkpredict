Title: Finite Chern-Simons matrix model - algebraic approach
Authors: Larisa Jonke and Stjepan Meljanac
Abstract: We analyze the algebra of observables and the physical Fock space of the finite Chern-Simons matrix model. We observe that the minimal algebra of observables acting on that Fock space is identical to that of the Calogero model. Our main result is the identification of the states in the l-th tower of the Chern-Simons matrix model Fock space and the states of the Calogero model with the interaction parameter nu=l+1. We describe quasiparticle and quasihole states in the both models in terms of Schur functions, and discuss some nontrivial consequences of our algebraic approach.
