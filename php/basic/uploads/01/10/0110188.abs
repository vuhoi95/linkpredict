Abstract: We consider non-perturbative effects in theories with extra dimensions and the deconstructed versions of these theories. We establish the rules for instanton calculations in 5D theories on the circle, and use them for an explicit one-instanton calculation in a supersymmetric gauge theory. The results are then compared to the known exact Seiberg-Witten type solution for this theory, confirming the validity both of the exact results and of the rules for instanton calculus for extra dimensions introduced here. Next we consider the non-perturbative results from the perspective of deconstructed extra dimensions. We show that the non-perturbative results of the deconstructed theory do indeed reproduce the known results for the continuum extra dimensional theory, thus providing the first non-perturbative evidence in favor of deconstruction. This way deconstruction also allows us to make exact predictions in higher dimensional theories which agree with earlier results, and helps to clarify the interpretation of 5D instantons.
