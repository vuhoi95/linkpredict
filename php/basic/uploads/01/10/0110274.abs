Title: Exact solutions in multidimensional gravity with antisymmetric forms
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: This topical review deals with a multidimensional gravitational model containing dilatonic scalar fields and antisymmetric forms. The manifold is chosen in the form M = M_0 x M_1 x ...x M_n, where M_i are Einstein spaces (i >0). The sigma-model approach and exact solutions in the model are reviewed and the solutions with p-branes (e.g. Majumdar-Papapetrou-type, cosmological, spherically symmetric, black-brane and Freund-Rubin-type ones) are considered.
