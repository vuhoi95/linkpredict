Title: Dashen's Phenomenon in Gauge Theories with Spontaneously Broken Chiral  Symmetries
Authors: G. Akemann and J. T. Lenaghan and K. Splittorff
Abstract: We examine Dashen's phenomenon in the Leutwyler--Smilga regime of QCD with any number of colors and quarks in either the fundamental or adjoint representations of the gauge group. In this limit, the theories only depend on simple combinations of quark masses, volume, chiral condensate and vacuum angle. Based upon this observation, we derive simple expressions for the chiral condensate and the topological density and show that they are in fact related. By examining the zeros of the various partition functions, we elucidate the mechanism leading to Dashen's phenomena in QCD.
