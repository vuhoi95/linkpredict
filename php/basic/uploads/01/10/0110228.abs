Authors: K. Sogut and A. Havare and I. Acikgoz
Abstract: We aimed to obtain the energy levels of spin-1 particles moving in a constant magnetic field. The method used here is completely algebraic. In the process to obtain the energy levels the wave function is choosen in terms of Laguerre Polynomials.
