Title: Semiclassical properties and chaos degree for the quantum baker's map
Authors: K. Inoue and M. Ohya and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: We study the chaotic behaviour and the quantum-classical correspondence for the baker's map. Correspondence between quantum and classical expectation values is investigated and it is numerically shown that it is lost at the logarithmic timescale. The quantum chaos degree is computed and it is demonstrated that it describes the chaotic features of the model. The correspondence between classical and quantum chaos degrees is considered.
