Title: Non-planar double-box, massive and massless pentabox Feynman integrals  in negative dimensional approach
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and Alexandre G. de M. Schmidt
Abstract: Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) is a technique which can be applied, with success, in usual covariant gauge calculations. We consider three two-loop diagrams: the scalar massless non-planar double-box with six propagators and the scalar pentabox in two cases, where six virtual particles have the same mass and in the case where all of them are massless. Our results are given in terms hypergeometric functions of Mandelstam variables and for arbitrary exponents of propagators and dimension $D$ as well.
