Title: Creation and annihilation operators and coherent states for the  PT-symmetric oscillator
Authors: B. Bagchi and C. Quesne
Abstract: We construct two commuting sets of creation and annihilation operators for the PT-symmetric oscillator. We then build coherent states of the latter as eigenstates of such annihilation operators by employing a modified version of the normalization integral that is relevant to PT-symmetric systems. We show that the coherent states are normalizable only in the range (0, 1) of the underlying coupling parameter $\alpha$.
