Title: Local Casimir Energy for a Wedge with circular outer boundary
Authors: Amir H. Rezaeian and Aram A. Saharian
Abstract: The local Casimir energy is investigated for a wedge with and without a circular outer boundary due to the confinement of a massless scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter and satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Regularization procedure is carried out making use of a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula, previously established by one of the authors. The surface divergences in the vacuum expectation values of the energy density near the boundaries are considered. The corresponding results can be applied to the cosmic strings.
