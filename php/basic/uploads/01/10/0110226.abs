Title: Imprints of Short Distance Physics On Inflationary Cosmology
Authors: Richard Easther and Brian R. Greene and William H. Kinney and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We analyze the impact of certain modifications to short distance physics on the inflationary perturbation spectrum. For the specific case of power-law inflation, we find distinctive -- and possibly observable -- effects on the spectrum of density perturbations.
