Title: On the Cardy-Verlinde Entropy Formula in Viscous Cosmology
Authors: I. Brevik and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The results of the paper of Verlinde [hep-th/0008140], discussing the holographic principle in a radiation dominated universe, are extended when allowing the cosmic fluid to possess a bulk viscosity. This corresponds to a non-conformally invariant theory. The generalization of the Cardy-Verlinde entropy formula to the case of a viscous universe seems from a formal point of view to be possible, although we question on physical grounds some elements in this kind of theory, especially the manner in which the Casimir energy is evaluated. Our discussion suggests that for non-conformally invariant theories the holographic definition of Casimir energy should be modified.
