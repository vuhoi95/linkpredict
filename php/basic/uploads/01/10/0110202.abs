Title: Magnetic strings in anti-de Sitter General Relativity
Authors: Oscar J. C. Dias and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We obtain spacetimes generated by static and spinning magnetic string sources in Einstein Relativity with negative cosmological constant. Since the spacetime is asymptotically a cylindrical anti-de Sitter spacetime, we will be able to calculate the mass, momentum, and electric charge of the solutions. We find two families of solutions, one with longitudinal magnetic field and the other with angular magnetic field. The source for the longitudinal magnetic field can be interpreted as composed by a system of two symmetric and superposed electrically charged lines with one of the electrically charged lines being at rest and the other spinning. The angular magnetic field solution can be similarly interpreted as composed by charged lines but now one is at rest and the other has a velocity along the axis. This solution cannot be extended down to the origin.
