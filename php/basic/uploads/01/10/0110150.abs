Title: Numerical study of Frohlich and Marchetti monopole creation operator
Authors: V. A. Belavin and M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov
Abstract: The monopole creation operator proposed recently by Frohlich and Marchetti is investigated in the Abelian Higgs model with compact gauge field. We show numerically that the creation operator detects the condensation of monopoles in the presence of the dynamical matter field.
