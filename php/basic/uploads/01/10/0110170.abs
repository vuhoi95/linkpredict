Title: Generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes
Authors: José Figueroa-O'Farrill and Joan Simón
Abstract: We classify generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes in type II string theory obtained as Kaluza-Klein reductions of the Minkowski space vacuum of eleven-dimensional supergravity. We obtain two families of smooth solutions which contains all the known solutions, new solutions called nullbranes, and solutions interpolating between them. We explicitly construct all the solutions and we study the U-duality orbits of some of these backgrounds.
