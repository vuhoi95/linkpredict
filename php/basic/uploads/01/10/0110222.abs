Title: Stability of Antisymmetric Tensor Fields of Chern-Simons Type in AdS  Spacetime
Authors: H. Hata and Y. Tanii
Abstract: Stability of massive antisymmetric tensor fields with the Chern-Simons type action in anti de Sitter spacetime is studied. It is found that there exists a complete set of solutions whose energy is conserved and positive definite if the mass is positive. Scalar products of the solutions are shown to be well-defined and conserved. In contrast to the previously studied scalar field case there is no other set of stable solutions with a different kind of boundary condition.
