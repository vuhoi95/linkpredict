Title: Reflection Amplitudes of Boundary Toda Theories and Thermodynamic Bethe  Ansatz
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Chanju Kim and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We study the ultraviolet asymptotics in $A_n$ affine Toda theories with integrable boundary actions. The reflection amplitudes of non-affine Toda theories in the presence of conformal boundary actions have been obtained from the quantum mechanical reflections of the wave functional in the Weyl chamber and used for the quantization conditions and ground-state energies. We compare these results with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz derived from both the bulk and (conjectured) boundary scattering amplitudes. The two independent approaches match very well and provide the non-perturbative checks of the boundary scattering amplitudes for Neumann and $(+)$ boundary conditions. Our results also confirm the conjectured boundary vacuum energies and the duality conjecture between the two boundary conditions.
