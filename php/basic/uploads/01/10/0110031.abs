Title: On Two Approaches to Fractional Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: M. Daoud and M. Kibler
Abstract: Two complementary approaches of N = 2 fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics of order k are studied in this article. The first one, based on a generalized Weyl-Heisenberg algebra W(k) (that comprizes the affine quantum algebra Uq(sl(2)) with q to k = 1 as a special case), apparently contains solely one bosonic degree of freedom. The second one uses generalized bosonic and k-fermionic degrees of freedom. As an illustration, a particular emphasis is put on the fractional supersymmetric oscillator of order k.
