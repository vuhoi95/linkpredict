Title: Hints on the power corrections from current correlators in x-space
Authors: S. Narison and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We consider an interpretation of the recent lattice data on the current-current correlators in the x-space. The data indicate rather striking difference between (axial)vector and (pseudo)scalar channels which goes beyond the predictions of the standard non-perturbative models. We argue that if the difference is to be explained by power corrections, there is a unique choice of the form of the correction. We discuss the emerging picture of the power corrections.
