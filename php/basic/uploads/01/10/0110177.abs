Title: Seiberg Witten Map and the Axial Anomaly in Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: Using the point-splitting regularisation, we calculate the axial anomaly in an arbitrary even dimensional Non-Commutative (NC) field theory. Our result is (star) gauge invariant in its {\it unintegrated} form, to the leading order in the NC parameter. Exploiting the Seiberg Witten map, this result gets transformed to the familiar Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in ordinary space-time. Furthermore, using this map, we derive an expression for the unintegrated axial anomaly for constant fields in NC space-time, that is valid to all finite orders of the NC parameter.
