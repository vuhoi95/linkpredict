Title: Equilibration Time Scales in Homogeneous Bose-Einstein Condensate  Dynamics
Authors: Daniel G. Barci and Eduardo S. Fraga and Marcelo Gleiser and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium growth of a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose gas after a quench from a high-temperature state to a temperature below the Bose-Einstein critical condensation temperature. We quantitatively characterize the departure from thermal equilibrium and observe the presence of two equilibration time scales. The equilibration times are shown to be inversely proportional to the density.
