Title: Parity Violating Bosonic Loops at Finite Temperature
Authors: V. S. Alves and Ashok Das and Gerald V. Dunne and Silvana Perez
Abstract: The finite temperature parity-violating contributions to the polarization tensor are computed at one loop in a system without fermions. The system studied is a Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs system in the broken phase, for which the parity-violating terms are well known at zero temperature. At nonzero temperature the static and long-wavelength limits of the parity violating terms have very different structure, and involve non-analytic log terms depending on the various mass scales. At high temperature the boson loop contribution to the Chern-Simons term goes like T in the static limit and like T log T in the long-wavelength limit, in contrast to the fermion loop contribution which behaves like 1/T in the static limit and like log T/T in the long wavelength limit.
