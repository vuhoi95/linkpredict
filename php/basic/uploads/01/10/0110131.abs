Title: Superfield Noether Procedure
Authors: M. Magro and I. Sachs and S. Wolf
Abstract: We develop a superspace Noether procedure for supersymmetric field theories in 4-dimensions for which an off-shell formulation in ordinary superspace exists. In this way we obtain an elegant and compact derivation of the various supercurrents in these theories. We then apply this formalism to compute the central charges for a variety of effective actions. As a by-product we also obtain a simple derivation of the anomalous superconformal Ward-identity in N=2 Yang-Mills theory. The connection with linearized supergravity is also discussed.
