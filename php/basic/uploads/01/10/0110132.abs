Title: Supersymmetry breaking on orbifolds from Wilson lines
Authors: G. v. Gersdorff and M. Quiros
Abstract: We consider five dimensional theories compactified on the orbifold S^1/Z_2 and prove that spontaneous local supersymmetry breaking by Wilson lines and by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism are equivalent. Wilson breaking is triggered by the SU(2)_R symmetry which is gauged in off-shell N=2 supergravity by auxiliary fields. The super-Higgs mechanism disposes of the would-be Goldstinos which are absorbed by the gravitinos to become massive. The breaking survives in the flat limit, where we decouple all gravitational interactions, and the theory becomes softly broken global supersymmetry.
