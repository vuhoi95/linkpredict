Title: Remarks on Noncommutative Solitons
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Jorge Moreno
Abstract: In the first part of this work we consider an unstable non-BPS Dp-\bar{Dp}-brane pair in Type II superstring theory. Turning on a background NS-NS B-field (constant and nonzero along two spatial directions), we show that the tachyon responsible for the unstability has a complex GMS solitonic solution, which is interpreted as the low energy remnant of the resulting D(p-2)-brane. In the second part, we apply these results to construct the noncommutative soliton analogous of Witten's superconducting string. This is done by considering the complex GMS soliton arising from the D3-\bar{D3}-brane annihilation in Type IIB superstring theory. In the presence of left-handed fermions, we apply the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal correspondence and the bosonization technique to show that this object behaves like a superconducting wire.
