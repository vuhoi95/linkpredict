Title: Is the truncated SU(N) non-Abelian gauge theory in extra dimensions  renormalizable?
Authors: Qi-Shu Yan and Dong-Sheng Du
Abstract: In this letter we show that in the extra dimension model, contrary to the widely accepted conception, the simply truncated $\phi^4$ and non-Abelian SU(N) Kaluza-Klein theories are not renormalizable, i.e. the tree level relations of the effective theories can not sustain the quantum corrections. The breaking down of the tree level relations of the effective theories can be traced back to several factors: the breaking of the higher dimension Lorentz symmetry and higher dimension gauge symmetry, interactions assumed in the underlying Lagrangians, and the dimension reduction and rescaling procedure.
