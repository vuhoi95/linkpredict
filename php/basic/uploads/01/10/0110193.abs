Title: Monopole fields from vortex sheets reconciling Abelian and center  dominance
Authors: J. Froehlich and P. A. Marchetti
Abstract: We describe a new order parameter for the confinement-deconfinement transition in lattice SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is expressed in terms of magnetic monopole field correlators represented as sums over sheets of center vortices. Our construction establishes a link between "abelian" and "center dominance". It avoids an inconsistency in the treatment of small scales present in earlier definitions of monopole fields by respecting Dirac's quantization condition for magnetic fluxes.
