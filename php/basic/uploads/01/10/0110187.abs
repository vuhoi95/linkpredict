Title: Heterotic String Theory with Background Fluxes
Authors: Jan Louis and Andrei Micu
Abstract: We discuss compactifications of the heterotic string in the presence of background fluxes. Specifically we consider compactifications on T^6, T^5, K3 x T^2 and K3 x S^1 for which we derive the bosonic sector of the low energy effective action. The consistency with the corresponding gauged supergravities is demonstrated.
