Title: Noncommutative SU(N) and Gauge Invariant Baryon Operator
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Harald Dorn
Abstract: We propose a constraint on the noncommutative gauge theory with U(N) gauge group which gives rise to a noncommutative version of the SU(N) gauge group. The baryon operator is also constructed.
