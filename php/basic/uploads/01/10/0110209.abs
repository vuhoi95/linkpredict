Title: Comments on orientifold projection in the conifold and SO x USp duality  cascade
Authors: Shin'ichi Imai and Takashi Yokono
Abstract: We study the O3-plane in the conifold. On the D3-brane world-volume we obtain SO x USp gauge theory that exhibits a duality cascade phenomenon. The orientifold projection is determined on the type IIB string side, and corresponds to that of O4-plane on the dual type IIA side. We show that SUGRA solutions of Klebanov-Tseytlin and Klebanov-Strassler survive under the projection. We also investigate the orientifold projection in the generalized conifolds, and verify desired features of the O4-projection in the type IIA picture.
