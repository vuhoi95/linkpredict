Title: Superfield algorithms for topological field theories
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: A superfield algorithm for master actions of a class of gauge field theories including topological ones in arbitrary dimensions is presented generalizing a previous treatment in two dimensions. General forms for master actions in superspace are given, and possible theories are determined by means of a ghost number prescription and the master equations. The resulting master actions determine the original actions together with their gauge invariances. Generalized Poisson sigma models in arbitrary dimensions are constructed by means of this algorithm, and other applications in low dimensions are given including the Chern-Simon model.
