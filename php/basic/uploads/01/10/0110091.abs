Title: The Long Range Gravitational Potential Energy Between Strings
Authors: Margaret E. Wessling and Mark B. Wise
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational potential energy between infinitely long parallel strings with tensions \tau_1 and \tau_2. Classically, it vanishes, but at one loop, we find that the long range gravitational potential energy per unit length is U/L = 24G_N^2\tau_1\tau_2/(5 \pi a^2) + ..., where a is the separation between the strings, G_N is Newton's constant, and we set \hbar = c =1. The ellipses represent terms suppressed by more powers of G_N \tau_i. Typically, massless bulk fields give rise at one loop to a long range potential between p-branes in space-times of dimension p+2+1. The contribution to this potential from bulk scalars is computed for arbitrary p (strings correspond to p=1) and in the case of three-branes its possible relevance for cosmological quintessence is commented on.
