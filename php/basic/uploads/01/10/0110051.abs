Title: Bulk versus brane running couplings
Authors: Kimball A. Milton and Sergei D. Odintsov and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: A simplified higher dimensional Randall-Sundrum-like model in 6 dimensions is considered. It has been observed previously by Goldberger and Wise that in such a self-interacting scalar theory on the bulk with a conical singularity there is mixing of renormalization of 4d brane couplings with that of the bulk couplings. We study the influence of the running bulk couplings on the running of the 4d brane couplings. We find that bulk quantum effects may completely alter the running of brane couplings. In particular, the structure of the Landau pole may be drastically altered and non-asymptotically free running may turn into asymptotically safe (or free) behavior.
