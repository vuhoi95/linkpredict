Title: Heat kernel Coefficients and Divergencies of the Casimir Energy for the  Dispersive Sphere
Authors: M. Bordag and K. Kirsten
Abstract: The first heat kernel coefficients are calculated for a dispersive ball whose permittivity at high frequency differs from unity by inverse powers of the frequency. The corresponding divergent part of the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field is given and ultraviolet divergencies are seen to be present. Also in a model where the number of atoms is fixed the pressure exhibits infinities. As a consequence, the ground-state energy for a dispersive dielectric ball cannot be interpreted easily.
