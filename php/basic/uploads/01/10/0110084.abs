Abstract: We discuss predictions for the interaction energy of the fundamental monopoles in gluodynamics introduced via the 't Hooft loop. At short distances, the heavy monopole potential is calculable from first principles. At larger distances, we apply the Abelian dominance models. We discuss the measurements which would be crucial to distinguish between various models. Non-zero temperatures are also considered. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with the existing lattice data. We discuss further measurements which would be crucial to check the model.
