Title: All minimal supergravity extensions of 2d dilaton theories
Authors: W. Kummer and M. Ertl and T. Strobl
Abstract: The formulation of 2d-dilaton theories, like spherically reduced Einstein gravity, is greatly facilitated in a formulation as a first order theory with nonvanishing bosonic torsion. This is especially also true at the quantum level. The interpretation of superextensions as graded Poisson sigma models is found to cover generically all possible 2d supergravities. Superfields and thus superfluous auxiliary fields are avoided altogether. The procedure shows that generalizations of bosonic 2d models are highly ambiguous.
