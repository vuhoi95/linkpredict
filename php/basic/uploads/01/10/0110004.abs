Title: Nonlinear Transformation Group of CAR Fermion Algebra
Authors: Mitsuo Abe and Katsunori Kawamura
Abstract: Based on our previous work on the recursive fermion system in the Cuntz algebra, it is shown that a nonlinear transformation group of the CAR fermion algebra is induced from a $U(2^p)$ action on the Cuntz algebra ${\cal O}_{2^p}$ with an arbitrary positive integer $p$. In general, these nonlinear transformations are expressed in terms of finite polynomials in generators. Some Bogoliubov transformations are involved as special cases.
