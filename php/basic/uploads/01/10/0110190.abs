Title: Generation of Neutrino mass in a Kalb-Ramond Background in large extra  dimensions
Authors: Soumitra SenGupta and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: In this paper we investigate whether spacetime torsion induced by a Kalb-Ramond field in a string inspired background can generate a mass for the left-handed neutrino. We consider an Einstein-Dirac-Kalb-Ramond lagrangian in higher dimensional spacetime with torsion generated by the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric field in the presence of a bulk fermion. We show that such a coupling can generate a mass term for the four dimensional neutrino after a suitable large radius compactification of the extra dimensions.
