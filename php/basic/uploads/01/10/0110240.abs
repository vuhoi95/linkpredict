Title: The coefficients of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential as intersection  numbers (?)
Authors: R. Flume and R. Poghossian and H. Storch
Abstract: The $n$-instanton contribution to the Seiberg-Witten prepotential of ${\bf N}=2$ supersymmetric $d=4$ Yang Mills theory is represented as the integral of the exponential of an equivariantly exact form. Integrating out an overall scale and a U(1) angle the integral is rewritten as $(4n-3)$ fold product of a closed two form. This two form is, formally, a representative of the Euler class of the Instanton moduli space viewed as a principal U(1) bundle, because its pullback under bundel projection is the exterior derivative of an angular one-form. We comment on a recent speculation of Matone concerning an analogy linking the instanton problem and classical Liouville theory of punctured Riemann spheres.
