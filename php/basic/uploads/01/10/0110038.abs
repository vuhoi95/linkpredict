Title: Elliptic Gaudin models and elliptic KZ Equations
Authors: Mark D. Gould and Yao-Zhong Zhang and Shao-You Zhao
Abstract: The Gaudin models based on the face-type elliptic quantum groups and the $XYZ$ Gaudin models are studied. The Gaudin model Hamiltonians are constructed and are diagonalized by using the algebraic Bethe ansatz method. The corresponding face-type Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and their solutions are given.
