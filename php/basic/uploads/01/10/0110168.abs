Title: One-Loop N-Point Superstring Amplitudes with Manifest d=4 Supersymmetry
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: The hybrid formalism for the superstring is used to compute one-loop amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external d=4 supergravity states. These one-loop N-point amplitudes are expressed as Koba-Nielsen-like formulas with manifest d=4 supersymmetry.
