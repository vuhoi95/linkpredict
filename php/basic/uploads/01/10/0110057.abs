Title: Global Embeddings of Two-dimensional Dilatonic Black Holes
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Won Tae Kim and John J. Oh and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We obtain minimal (2+1) and (2+2) dimensional global flat embeddings of uncharged and charged dilatonic black holes in (1+1) dimensions, respectively. Moreover, we obtain the Hawking temperatures and the black hole ones of these dilatonic black holes. However, even though the minimal flat embedding structures are mathematically meaningful, through this minimal embeddings the proper entropies are shown to be unattainable, contrast to the cases of other black holes in (2+1) or much higher dimensions.
