Title: The quantum anharmonic oscillator in the Heisenberg picture and multiple  scale techniques
Authors: Guy Auberson and Michel Capdequi Peyranere
Abstract: Multiple scale techniques are well-known in classical mechanics to give perturbation series free from resonant terms. When applied to the quantum anharmonic oscillator, these techniques lead to interesting features concerning the solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion and the Hamiltonian spectrum.
