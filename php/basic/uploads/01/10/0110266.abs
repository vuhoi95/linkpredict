Title: Chern-Simons theory and BCS superconductivity
Authors: Manuel Asorey and Fernando Falceto and German Sierra
Abstract: We study the relationship between the holomorphic unitary connection of Chern-Simons theory with temporal Wilson lines and the Richardson's exact solution of the reduced BCS Hamiltonian. We derive the integrals of motion of the BCS model, their eigenvalues and eigenvectors as a limiting case of the Chern-Simons theory.
