Title: Macroscopic properties of A-statistics
Authors: A. Jellal and T. D. Palev and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: A-statistics is defined in the context of the Lie algebra sl(n+1). Some thermal properties of A-statistics are investigated under the assumption that the particles interact only via statistical interaction imposed by the Pauli principle of A-statistics. Apart from the general case, three particular examples are studied in more detail: (a) the particles have one and the same energy and chemical potential; (b) equidistant energy spectrum; (c) two species of particles with one and the same energy and chemical potential within each class. The grand partition functions and the average number of particles are among the thermodynamical quantities written down explicitly.
