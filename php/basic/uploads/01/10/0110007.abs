Title: Les Houches Lectures on De Sitter Space
Authors: Marcus Spradlin and Andrew Strominger and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: These lectures present an elementary discussion of some background material relevant to the problem of de Sitter quantum gravity. The first two lectures discuss the classical geometry of de Sitter space and properties of quantum field theory on de Sitter space, especially the temperature and entropy of de Sitter space. The final lecture contains a pedagogical discussion of the appearance of the conformal group as an asymptotic symmetry group, which is central to the dS/CFT correspondence. A (previously lacking) derivation of asymptotically de Sitter boundary conditions is also given.
