Title: Chiral Extrapolation: An Analogy with Effective Field Theory
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Anthony W. Thomas and Stewart V. Wright
Abstract: We draw an analogy between the chiral extrapolation of lattice QCD calculations from large to small quark masses and the interpolation between the large mass (weak field) and small mass (strong field) limits of the Euler--Heisenberg QED effective action. In the latter case, where the exact answer is known, a simple extrapolation of a form analogous to those proposed for the QCD applications is shown to be surprisingly accurate over the entire parameter range.
