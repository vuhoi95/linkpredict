Title: Measuring Cosmic Defect Correlations in Liquid Crystals
Authors: Rajarshi Ray and Ajit M. Srivastava
Abstract: From the theory of topological defect formation proposed for the early universe, the so called Kibble mechanism, it follows that the density correlation functions of defects and anti-defects in a given system should be completely determined in terms of a single length scale $\xi$, the relevant domain size. Thus, when lengths are expressed in units of $\xi$, these distributions should show universal behavior, depending only on the symmetry of the order parameter, and space dimensions. We have verified this prediction by analyzing the distributions of defects/anti-defects formed in the isotropic-nematic phase transition in a thin layer of nematic liquid crystals. Our experimental results confirm this prediction and are in reasonable agreement with the results of numerical simulations.
