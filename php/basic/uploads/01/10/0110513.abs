Title: Duality and self-duality in Ginzburg-Landau theory with Chern-Simons  term
Authors: Hagen Kleinert and Flavio S. Nogueira
Abstract: We derive the exact dual theory of a lattice Ginzburg-Landau theory with an additional topological Chern-Simons (CS) term. It is shown that in the zero-temperature limit, the statistical parameter $\theta=1/2\pi$ corresponds to a fixed point of the duality transformation. Thus we have found a nontrivial example of self-duality in three dimensions. In this scenario, the specialization of anyonic to fermionic statistics my be viewed as a phase transition.
