Title: New analytic results for electroweak baryon number violation
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and Y. J. Lee
Abstract: Real-time anomalous fermion number violation has been investigated for massless chiral fermions in spherically symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge field backgrounds which can be weakly dissipative or even nondissipative. Restricting consideration to spherically symmetric fermion fields, a relation has been found between the spectral flow of the Dirac Hamiltonian and two characteristics of the background gauge field. This new result may be relevant to electroweak baryon number violation in the early universe.
