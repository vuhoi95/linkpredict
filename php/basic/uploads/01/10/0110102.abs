Title: A Constrained Standard Model: Effects of Fayet-Iliopoulos Terms
Authors: Riccardo Barbieri and Lawrence J. Hall and Yasunori Nomura
Abstract: In hep-ph/0011311 the one Higgs doublet standard model was obtained by an orbifold projection of a 5D supersymmetric theory in an essentially unique way, resulting in a prediction for the Higgs mass m_H = 127 \pm 8 GeV and for the compactification scale 1/R = 370 \pm 70 GeV. The dominant one loop contribution to the Higgs potential was found to be finite, while the above uncertainties arose from quadratically divergent brane Z factors and from other higher loop contributions. In hep-th/0108184, a quadratically divergent Fayet-Iliopoulos term was found at one loop in this theory. We show that the resulting uncertainties in the predictions for the Higgs boson mass and the compactification scale are small, about 25% of the uncertainties quoted above, and hence do not affect the original predictions. However, a tree level brane Fayet-Iliopoulos term could, if large enough, modify these predictions, especially for 1/R.
