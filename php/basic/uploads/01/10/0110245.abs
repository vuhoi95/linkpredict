Title: Dyons in Nonabelian Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Antun Balaz and Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: We analyze a nonabelian extension of Born--Infeld action for the SU(2) group. In the class of spherically symmetric solutions we find that, besides the Gal'tsov--Kerner glueballs, only the analytic dyons have finite energy. The presented analytic and numerical investigation excludes the existence of pure magnetic monopoles of 't Hooft--Polyakov type.
