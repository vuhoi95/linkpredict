Title: D-Brane Stability and Monodromy
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Michael R. Douglas
Abstract: We review the idea of Pi-stability for B-type D-branes on a Calabi-Yau manifold. It is shown that the octahedral axiom from the theory of derived categories is an essential ingredient in the study of stability. Various examples in the context of the quintic Calabi-Yau threefold are studied and we plot the lines of marginal stability in several cases. We derive the conjecture of Kontsevich, Horja and Morrison for the derived category version of monodromy around a "conifold" point. Finally, we propose an application of these ideas to the study of supersymmetry breaking.
