Title: Mechanical Systems with Poincare Invariance
Authors: H. W. Braden and J. G. B. Byatt-Smith
Abstract: Some years ago Ruijsenaars and Schneider initiated the study of mechanical systems exhibiting an action of the Poincare algebra. The systems they discovered were far richer: their models were actually integrable and possessed a natural quantum version. We follow this early work finding and classifying mechanical systems with such an action. New solutions are found together with a new class of models exhibiting an action of the Galilean algebra. These are related to the functional identities underlying the various Hirzebruch genera. The quantum mechanics is also discussed.
