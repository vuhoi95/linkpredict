Title: Quantum-like approach to financial risk: quantum anthropic principle
Authors: E. W. Piotrowski and J. SÅ‚adkowski
Abstract: We continue the analysis of quantum-like description of market phenomena and economics. We show that it is possible to define a risk inclination operator acting in some Hilbert space that has a lot of common with quantum description of the harmonic oscillator. The approach has roots in the recently developed quantum game theory and quantum computing. A quantum anthropic principle is formulated
