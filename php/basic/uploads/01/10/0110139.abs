Title: Classification of Poisson-Lie T-dual models with two-dimensional targets
Authors: L. Hlavaty and L. Snobl
Abstract: Four-dimensional Manin triples and Drinfeld doubles are classified and corresponding two-dimensional Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models on them are constructed. The simplest example of a Drinfeld double allowing decomposition into two nontrivially different Manin triples is presented.
