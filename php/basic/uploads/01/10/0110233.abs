Title: Dispersion relations in differential form
Authors: Pavel Kolar and Jan Fischer
Abstract: Various forms of derivative dispersion relations, in which the dispersion integral is replaced by a series of derivatives of the imaginary part of a scattering amplitude, are reviewed. Conditions of their validity and practical applicability as well as their relevance to high-energy small-angle hadron-hadron scattering are discussed.
