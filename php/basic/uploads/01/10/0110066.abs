Title: Anatomy of Two-Loop Effective Action in Noncommutative Field Theories
Authors: Y. Kiem and S. -S. Kim and S. -J. Rey and H. -T. Sato
Abstract: We compute, at two-loop order, one-particle-irreducible Green functions and effective action in noncommutative $\lambda[\Phi^3]_\star$-theory for both planar (g=0, h=3) and nonplanar (g=1, h=1) contributions. We adopt worldline formulation of the Feynman diagrammatics so that relation to string theory diagrammatics is made transparent in the Seiberg-Witten limit. We argue that the resulting two-loop effective action is expressible via open Wilson lines: one-particle-irreducible effective action is generating functional of connected diagrams for interacting open Wilson lines.
