Abstract: We argue that two four-dimensional strongly coupled superconformal field theories, on the Higgs branch in certain large N limits, become respectively (2,0) theory and (1,1) little string theory in six dimensions. We identify the spectrum of states responsible for the generation of the two extra dimensions and string winding modes. We establish the equivalence using orbifold realizations of the field theories and exploiting string dualities. We also speculate on deconstructions of M-theory.
