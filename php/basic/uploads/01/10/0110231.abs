Abstract: In this letter we apply the methods of our previous paper hep-th/0108045 to noncommutative fermions. We show that the fermions form a spin-1/2 representation of the Lorentz algebra. The covariant splitting of the conformal transformations into a field-dependent part and a \theta-part implies the Seiberg-Witten differential equations for the fermions.
