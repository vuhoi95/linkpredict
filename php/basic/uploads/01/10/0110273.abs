Title: Thick brane world model from perfect fluid
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: A (1 + d)-dimensional thick "brane world" model with varying Lambda-term is considered. The model is generalized to the case of a chain of Ricci-flat internal spaces when the matter source is an anisotropic perfect fluid. The "horizontal" part of potential is obtained in the Newtonian approximation. In the multitemporal case (with a Lambda-term) a set of equations for potentials is presented.
