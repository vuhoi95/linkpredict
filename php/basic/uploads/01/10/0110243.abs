Title: Two-dimensional gauge theories of the symmetric group S_n in the large-n  limit
Authors: A. D'Adda and P. Provero
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional gauge theory of the symmetric group S_n describing the statistics of branched n-coverings of Riemann surfaces. We consider the theory defined on the disk and on the sphere in the large-n limit. A non trivial phase structure emerges, with various phases corresponding to different connectivity properties of the covering surface. We show that any gauge theory on a two-dimensional surface of genus zero is equivalent to a random walk on the gauge group manifold: in the case of S_n, one of the phase transitions we find can be interpreted as a cutoff phenomenon in the corresponding random walk. A connection with the theory of phase transitions in random graphs is also pointed out. Finally we discuss how our results may be related to the known phase transitions in Yang-Mills theory. We discover that a cutoff transition occurs also in two dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a sphere, in a large N limit where the coupling constant is scaled with N with an extra log N compared to the standard 't Hooft scaling.
