Title: Dilatonic wormholes: construction, operation, maintenance and collapse  to black holes
Authors: Sean A. Hayward and Sung-Won Kim and Hyunjoo Lee
Abstract: The CGHS two-dimensional dilaton gravity model is generalized to include a ghost Klein-Gordon field, i.e. with negative gravitational coupling. This exotic radiation supports the existence of static traversible wormhole solutions, analogous to Morris-Thorne wormholes. Since the field equations are explicitly integrable, concrete examples can be given of various dynamic wormhole processes, as follows. (i) Static wormholes are constructed by irradiating an initially static black hole with the ghost field. (ii) The operation of a wormhole to transport matter or radiation between the two universes is described, including the back-reaction on the wormhole, which is found to exhibit a type of neutral stability. (iii) It is shown how to maintain an operating wormhole in a static state, or return it to its original state, by turning up the ghost field. (iv) If the ghost field is turned off, either instantaneously or gradually, the wormhole collapses into a black hole.
