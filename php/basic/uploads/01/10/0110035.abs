Title: Non-Commutative Instantons and the Seiberg-Witten Map
Authors: Per Kraus and Masaki Shigemori
Abstract: We present several results concerning non-commutative instantons and the Seiberg-Witten map. Using a simple ansatz we find a large new class of instanton solutions in arbitrary even dimensional non-commutative Yang-Mills theory. These include the two dimensional ``shift operator'' solutions and the four dimensional Nekrasov-Schwarz instantons as special cases. We also study how the Seiberg-Witten map acts on these instanton solutions. The infinitesimal Seiberg-Witten map is shown to take a very simple form in operator language, and this result is used to give a commutative description of non-commutative instantons. The instanton is found to be singular in commutative variables.
