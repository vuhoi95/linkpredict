Title: String Theory and Hybrid Inflation/Acceleration
Authors: Carlos Herdeiro and Shinji Hirano and Renata Kallosh
Abstract: We find a description of hybrid inflation in (3+1)-dimensions using brane dynamics of Hanany-Witten type. P-term inflation/acceleration of the universe with the hybrid potential has a slow-roll de Sitter stage and a waterfall stage which leads towards an N=2 supersymmetric ground state. We identify the slow-roll stage of inflation with a non-supersymmetric `Coulomb phase' with Fayet-Iliopoulos term. This stage ends when the mass squared of one of the scalars in the hypermultiplet becomes negative. At that moment the brane system starts undergoing a phase transition via tachyon condensation to a fully Higgsed supersymmetric vacuum which is the absolute ground state of P-term inflation. A string theory/cosmology dictionary is provided, which leads to constraints on parameters of the brane construction from cosmological experiments. We display a splitting of mass levels reminiscent of the Zeeman effect due to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
