Title: Spin Chains with Twisted Monodromy
Authors: I. M. Krichever and D. H. Phong
Abstract: The integrable model corresponding to the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with matter in the symmetric representation is constructed. It is a spin chain model, whose key feature is a new twisted monodromy condition.
