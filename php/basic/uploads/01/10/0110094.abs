Title: High energy constraints on Lorentz symmetry violations
Authors: S. Liberati and T. A. Jacobson and D. Mattingly
Abstract: Lorentz violation at high energies might lead to non linear dispersion relations for the fundamental particles. We analyze observational constraints on these without assuming any a priori equality between the coefficients determining the amount of Lorentz violation for different particle species. We focus on constraints from three high energy processes involving photons and electrons: photon decay, photo-production of electron-positron pairs, and vacuum Cerenkov radiation. We find that cubic momentum terms in the dispersion relations are strongly constrained.
