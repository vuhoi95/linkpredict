Title: Orbifolds as Melvin Geometry
Authors: Tadashi Takayanagi and Tadaoki Uesugi
Abstract: In this paper we explicitly show that the various noncompact abelian orbifolds are realized as special limits of parameters in type II (NSNS) Melvin background and its higher dimensional generalizations. As a result the supersymmetric ALE spaces (A-type C^2/Z_N) and nonsupersymmetric orbifolds in type II and type 0 theory are all connected with each other by the exactly marginal deformation. Our results provide new examples of the duality between type II and type 0 string theory. We also discuss the decay of unstable backgrounds in this model which include closed string tachyons.
