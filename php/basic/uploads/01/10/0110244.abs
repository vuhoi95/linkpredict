Title: Boundary Liouville Field Theory: Boundary Three Point Function
Authors: B. Ponsot and J. Teschner
Abstract: Liouville field theory is considered on domains with conformally invariant boundary conditions. We present an explicit expression for the three point function of boundary fields in terms of the fusion coefficients which determine the monodromy properties of the conformal blocks.
