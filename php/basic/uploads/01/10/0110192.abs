Title: On the M5 and the AdS7/CFT6 Correspondence
Authors: A. J. Nurmagambetov and I. Y. Park
Abstract: The chiral primary operators of the D=6 superconformal (2,0) theory corresponding to 14 scalars of N=4 D=7 supergravity are obtained by expanding the world volume action for the M5-brane around an AdS_7 x S^4 background. In the leading order, the operators take their values in the symmetric traceless representation of the SO(5) R-symmetry group in consistency with the early conjecture on their structure based on the superconformal symmetry and Matrix-like model arguments.
