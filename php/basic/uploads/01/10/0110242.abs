Title: A new maximally supersymmetric background of IIB superstring theory
Authors: Matthias Blau and Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Christopher Hull and George Papadopoulos
Abstract: We present a maximally supersymmetric IIB string background. The geometry is that of a conformally flat lorentzian symmetric space G/K with solvable G, with a homogeneous five-form flux. We give the explicit supergravity solution, compute the isometries, the 32 Killing spinors, and the symmetry superalgebra, and then discuss T-duality and the relation to M-theory.
