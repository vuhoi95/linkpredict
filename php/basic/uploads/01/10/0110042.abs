Title: Structure of singularities on the world sheets of relativistic strings
Authors: Stanislav Klimenko and Igor Nikitin and Lialia Nikitina
Abstract: We show that relativistic strings of open and closed types in Minkowski space-time of dimension 3 and 4 have topologically stable singular points. This paper describes the structure of singularities, derives their normal forms, and introduces a local characteristic of singularity (topological charge), possessing a global law of conservation. Two other types of solutions (breaking and exotic strings) are also considered, which have singularities at arbitrary value of dimension.
