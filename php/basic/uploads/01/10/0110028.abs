Title: A Geometric Unification of Dualities
Authors: F. Cachazo and B. Fiol and K. Intriligator and S. Katz and C. Vafa
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a large class of N=1 quiver theories, geometrically realized by type IIB D-brane probes wrapping cycles of local Calabi-Yau threefolds. These include N=2 (affine) A-D-E quiver theories deformed by superpotential terms, as well as chiral N=1 quiver theories obtained in the presence of vanishing 4-cycles inside a Calabi-Yau. We consider the various possible geometric transitions of the 3-fold and show that they correspond to Seiberg-like dualities (represented by Weyl reflections in the A-D-E case or `mutations' of bundles in the case of vanishing 4-cycles) or large N dualities involving gaugino condensates (generalized conifold transitions). Also duality cascades are naturally realized in these classes of theories, and are related to the affine Weyl group symmetry in the A-D-E case.
