Title: KÃ¤hler polarisation and Wick Quantisation of Hamiltonian systems  subject to second class constraints
Authors: S. L. Lyakhovich and A. A. Sharapov
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the second-class constraint surface to be (an almost) K\"ahler manifold. The deformation quantisation for such systems is scetched resulting in the Wick-type symbols for the respective Dirac brackets.
