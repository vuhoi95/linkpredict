Title: Symplectic Quantization of Open Strings and Noncommutativity in Branes
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Cresus F. L. Godinho
Abstract: We show how to translate boundary conditions into constraints in the symplectic quantization method by an appropriate choice of generalized variables. This way the symplectic quantization of an open string attached to a brane in the presence of an antisymmetric background field reproduces the non commutativity of the brane coordinates.
