Title: Check of the Mass Bound Conjecture in the de Sitter Space
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Yun Soo Myung and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: Recently an interesting conjecture was put forward which states that any asymptotically de Sitter space whose mass exceeds that of exact de Sitter space contains a cosmological singularity. In order to test this mass bound conjecture, we present two solutions. One is the topological de Sitter solution and the other is its dilatonic deformation. Although the latter is not asymptotically de Sitter space, the two solutions have a cosmological horizon and a cosmological singularity. Using surface counterterm method we compute the quasilocal stress-energy tensor of gravitational field and the mass of the two solutions. It turns out that this conjecture holds within the two examples. Also we show that the thermodynamic quantities associated with the cosmological horizon of the two solutions obey the first law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the nonconformal extension of dS/CFT correspondence is discussed.
