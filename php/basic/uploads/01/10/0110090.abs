Title: Classification of String-like Solutions in Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Y. Verbin and S. Madsen and A. L. Larsen and M. Christensen
Abstract: The static string-like solutions of the Abelian Higgs model coupled to dilaton gravity are analyzed and compared to the non-dilatonic case. Except for a special coupling between the Higgs Lagrangian and the dilaton, the solutions are flux tubes that generate a non-asymptotically flat geometry. Any point in parameter space corresponds to two branches of solutions with two different asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the non-dilatonic case, where one branch is always asymptotically conic, in the present case the asymptotic behavior changes continuously along each branch.
