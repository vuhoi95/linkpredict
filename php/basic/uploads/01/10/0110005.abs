Title: Restoration of Angular Lie Algebra Symmetries from a Covariant  Hamiltonian
Authors: A. Berard and J. Lages and H. Mohrbach
Abstract: The sO(3) and the Lorentz algebra symmetries breaking with gauge curvatures are studied by means of a covariant Hamiltonian. The restoration of these algebra symmetries in flat and curved spaces is performed and led to the apparition of a monopole field. Then in the context of the Lorentz algebra we consider an application to the gravitoelectromagnetism theory. In this last case a qualitative relation giving a mass spectrum for dyons is established.
