Title: Superconformal Field Theories for Compact G_2 Manifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Volker Braun
Abstract: We present the construction of exactly solvable superconformal field theories describing Type II string models compactified on compact G_2 manifolds. These models are defined by anti-holomorphic quotients of the form (CY*S^1)/Z_2, where we realize the Calabi-Yau as a Gepner model. In the superconformal field theory the Z_2 acts as charge conjugation implying that the representation theory of a W(2,4,6,8,10) algebra plays an important role in the construction of these models. Intriguingly, in all three examples we study, including the quintic, the massless spectrum in the Z_2 twisted sector of the superconformal field theory differs from what one expects from the supergravity computation. This discrepancy is explained by the presence of a discrete NS-NS background two-form flux in the Gepner model.
