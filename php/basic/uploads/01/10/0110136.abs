Title: Hubble-induced radiative corrections and Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Manuel Drees and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We examine the viability of the Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis under radiatively induced running of soft breaking $({\rm mass})^2$ of the flat directions stemming from non-zero energy density of the inflaton during inflation. A major difference from analogous phenomenological studies is that the horizon radius provides a natural infrared cut-off to the quantum corrections in this case. We identify different scenarios which may arise and point out that the $H_{u}L$ flat direction remains the most promising flat direction, since it is largely independent of uncertainties about high scale physics and details of the inflationary model.
