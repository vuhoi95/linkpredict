Title: Noncommutativity of Boundary Closed String Coordinates for an Open  Membrane on p-Brane
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Maharana and A. Melikyan
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an open membrane with a cylindrical topology, in the background of a constant three form. We use the action, due to Bergshoeff, London and Townsend, to study the noncommutativity properties of the boundary string coordinates. The constrained Hamiltonian formalism due to Dirac is used to derive the noncommutativity of coordinates. The chain of constraints is found to be finite for a suitable gauge choice.
