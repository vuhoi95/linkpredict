Title: Gravity-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking in the Brane World
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: We study the transmission of supersymmetry breaking via gravitational interactions in a five-dimensional brane-world compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. We assume that chiral matter and gauge fields are confined at the orbifold fixed points, where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by effective brane superpotentials. Using an off-shell supergravity multiplet we integrate out the auxiliary fields and examine the couplings between the bulk supergravity fields and boundary matter fields. The corresponding tree-level shift in the bulk gravitino mass spectrum induces one-loop radiative masses for the boundary fields. We calculate the boundary gaugino and scalar masses for arbitrary values of the brane superpotentials, and show that the mass spectrum reduces to the Scherk-Schwarz limit for arbitrarily large values of the brane superpotentials.
