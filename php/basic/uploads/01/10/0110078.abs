Title: Real null coframes in general relativity and GPS type coordinates
Authors: M. Blagojevic and J. Garecki and F. W. Hehl and Yu. N. Obukhov
Abstract: Based on work of Derrick, Coll, and Morales, we define a `symmetric' null coframe with {\it four real null covectors}. We show that this coframe is closely related to the GPS type coordinates recently introduced by Rovelli.
