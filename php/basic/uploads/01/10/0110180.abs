Title: The One Loop Effective Action of QED for a General Class of Electric  Fields
Authors: H. M. Fried and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We compute the effective action of QED at one loop order for an electric field which points in the $\hat{z}$ direction and depends arbitrarily upon the light cone time coordinate, $x^+ = (x^0 + x^3)/\sqrt{2}$. This calculation generalizes Schwinger's formula for the vacuum persistence probability in the presence of a constant electric field.
