Title: Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics from Noncommutative Quantum Field  Theory
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Hsien-Chung Kao
Abstract: We derive noncommutative multi-particle quantum mechanics from noncommutative quantum field theory in the nonrelativistic limit. Paricles of opposite charges are found to have opposite noncommutativity. As a result, there is no noncommutative correction to the hydrogen atom spectrum at the tree level. We also comment on the obstacles to take noncommutative phenomenology seriously, and propose a way to construct noncommutative SU(5) grand unified theory.
