Title: Recursive Graphical Construction of Tadpole-Free Feynman Diagrams and  Their Weights in phi^4-Theory
Authors: Axel Pelster and Konstantin Glaum
Abstract: We review different approaches to the graphical generation of the tadpole-free Feynman diagrams of the self-energy and the one-particle irreducible four-point function. These are needed for calculating the critical exponents of the euclidean multicomponent scalar phi^4-theory with renormalization techniques in d=4-epsilon dimensions.
