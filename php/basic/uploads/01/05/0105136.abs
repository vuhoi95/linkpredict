Title: Metric of the multiply wound rotating string
Authors: Oleg Lunin and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: We consider a string wrapped many times around a compact circle in space, and let this string carry a right moving wave which imparts momentum and angular momentum to the string. The angular momentum causes the strands of the `multiwound' string to separate and cover the surface of a torus. We compute the supergravity solution for this string configuration. We map this solution by dualities to the D1-D5 system with angular momentum that has been recently studied. We discuss how constructing this multiwound string solution may help us to relate the microscopic and macroscopic pictures of black hole absorption.
