Title: Duality and Non-linear Response for Quantum Hall Systems
Authors: B. P. Dolan and C. P. Burgess
Abstract: We derive the implications of particle-vortex duality for the electromagnetic response of Quantum Hall systems beyond the linear-response regime. This provides a first theoretical explanation of the remarkable duality which has been observed in the nonlinear regime for the electromagnetic response of Quantum Hall systems.
