Title: Generation of bright soliton through the interaction of black solitons
Authors: L. Losano and B. Baseia and D. Bazeia
Abstract: We report on the possibility of having two black solitons interacting inside a silica fiber that presents normal group-velocity dispersion, to generate a pair of solitons, a vector soliton of the black-bright type. The model obeys a pair of coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, that follows in accordance with a Ginzburg-Landau equation describing the anisotropic XY model. We solve the coupled equations using a trial-orbit method, which plays a significant role when the Schr\"odinger equations are reduced to first order differential equations.
