Title: Fate of Vector Dominance in the Effective Field Theory
Authors: Masayasu Harada and Koichi Yamawaki
Abstract: We reveal the full phase structure of the effective field theory for QCD, based on the hidden local symmetry (HLS) through the one-loop renormalization group equation including quadratic divergences. We then show that vector dominance (VD) is not a sacred discipline of the effective field theory but rather an accidental phenomenon peculiar to three-flavored QCD. In particular, the chiral symmetry restoration in HLS model takes place in a wide phase boundary surface, on which the VD is realized nowhere. This suggests that VD may not be valid for chiral symmetry restoration in hot and/or dense QCD.
