Title: Lorentz Invariance of the Pure Spinor BRST Cohomology for the  Superstring
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Osvaldo Chandia
Abstract: In a previous paper, the BRST cohomology in the pure spinor formalism of the superstring was shown to coincide with the light-cone Green-Schwarz spectrum by using an SO(8) parameterization of the pure spinor. In this paper, the SO(9,1) Lorentz generators are explicitly constructed using this SO(8) parameterization, proving the Lorentz invariance of the pure spinor BRST cohomology.
