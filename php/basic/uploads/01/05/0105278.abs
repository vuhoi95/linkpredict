Title: Supersymmetric Model of Neutrino Mass and Leptogenesis with String-Scale  Unification
Authors: Biswajoy Brahmachari and Ernest Ma and Utpal Sarkar
Abstract: Adjoint supermultiplets (1,3,0) and (8,1,0) modify the evolution of gauge couplings. If the unification of gauge couplings occurs at the string scale, their masses are fixed at around $10^{13}$ GeV. This scale coincides with expected gaugino condensation scale in the hidden sector $M_{string}^{2/3} m^{1/3}_{3/2} \sim 10^{13}$ GeV. We show how neutrino masses arise in this unified model which naturally explain the present atmospheric and solar neutrino data. The out-of-equilibrium decay of the superfield (1,3,0) at $10^{13}$ GeV may also lead to a lepton asymmetry which then gets converted into the present observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe.
