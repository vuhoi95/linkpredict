Title: Orientifolds with branes at angles
Authors: Stefan Forste and Gabriele Honecker and Ralph Schreyer
Abstract: We present supersymmetry breaking four dimensional orientifolds of type IIA strings. The compact space is a torus times a four dimensional orbifold. The orientifold group reflects one direction in each torus. RR tadpoles are cancelled by D6-branes intersecting at angles in the torus and in the orbifold. The angles are chosen such that supersymmetry is broken. The resulting four dimensional theories contain chiral fermions. The tadpole cancellation conditions imply that there are no non-abelian gauge anomalies. The models also contain anomaly-free U(1) factors.
