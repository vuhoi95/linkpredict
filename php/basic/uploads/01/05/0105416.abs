Title: Finite temperature correlations for the U_q(sl(2|1))-invariant  generalized Hubbard model
Authors: Andreas Kluemper and Kazumitsu Sakai
Abstract: We study an integrable model of one-dimensional strongly correlated electrons at finite temperature by explicit calculation of the correlation lengths of various correlation functions. The model is invariant with respect to the quantum superalgebra U_q(sl(2|1)) and characterized by the Hubbard interaction, correlated hopping and pair-hopping terms. Using the integrability, the graded quantum transfer matrix is constructed. From the analyticity of its eigenvalues, a closed set of non-linear integral equations is derived which describe the thermodynamical quantities and the finite temperature correlations. The results show a crossover from a regime with dominating density-density correlations to a regime with dominating superconducting pair correlations. Analytical calculations in the low temperature limit are also discussed.
