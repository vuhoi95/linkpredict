Title: Super Gravitons Interacting with the Super Virasoro Group
Authors: S. James Gates Jr and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: We describe actions that correspond to the interaction of the Super Virasoro algebra with supergravitons. These new field theories introduce a superfield that corresponds to dual elements of the super Virasoro algebra. We are also able to extend the definition of these field theories to higher dimensions. We explicitly exhibit the 2, 3 and 4 dimensional cases. Remarkably, the fundamental prepotentials describing these dual elements of the super Virasoro algebra, in each model, agrees with the known prepotentials of the corresponding supergravity theory. These theories might be important in the quantization of the super Virasoro group, supergravity and in AdS and super AdS gravity.
