Title: Chaotic Quantization of Classical Gauge Fields
Authors: T. S. Biro and S. G. Matinyan and B. MÃ¼ller
Abstract: We argue that the quantized non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained as the infrared limit of the corresponding classical gauge theory in a higher dimension. We show how the transformation from classical to quantum field theory emerges and calculate Planck's constant from quantities defined in the underlying classical gauge theory.
