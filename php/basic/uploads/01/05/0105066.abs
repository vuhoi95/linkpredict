Title: Geometric Transition, Large N Dualities and MQCD Dynamics
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We study Vafa's geometric transition from a brane setup in M-theory. In this transition D5 branes wrapped on P^1 cycles of a resolved conifold disappear and are replaced by fluxes on a deformed conifold. In the limit of small sized P^1, we describe this mechanism as a transition from curved M5 branes to plane M5 branes which replaces SU(N) MQCD by U(1) theories on the bulk. This agrees with the results expected from the geometric transition. We also discuss the reduction to ten dimensions and a brane creation mechanism in the presence of fluxes.
