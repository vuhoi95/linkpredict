Title: Higher-Derivative Boson Field Theories and Constrained Second-Order  Theories
Authors: F. J. de Urries and J. Julve and Eduardo J. S. Villase√±or
Abstract: As an alternative to the covariant Ostrogradski method, we show that higher-derivative relativistic Lagrangian field theories can be reduced to second differential-order by writing them directly as covariant two-derivative theories involving Lagrange multipliers and new fields. Despite the intrinsic non-covariance of the Dirac's procedure used to deal with the constraints, the explicit Lorentz invariance is recovered at the end. We develop this new setting on the grounds of a simple scalar model and then its applications to generalized electrodynamics and higher-derivative gravity are worked out. For a wide class of field theories this method is better suited than Ostrogradski's for a generalization to 2n-derivative theories
