Title: Causality and radiatively induced CPT violation
Authors: C. Adam and F. R. Klinkhamer
Abstract: We consider quantum electrodynamics with an additional Lorentz- and CPT-violating axial-vector term in the fermionic sector and discuss the possibility that radiative corrections induce a Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons-like term for the gauge field. From the requirement of causality and the assumed validity of perturbation theory, we conclude that the induced Chern-Simons-like term must be absent in the full quantum field theory.
