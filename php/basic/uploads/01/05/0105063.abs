Title: The Quantum Physics of Black Holes: Results from String Theory
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: We review recent progress in our understanding of the physics of black holes. In particular, we discuss the ideas from string theory that explain the entropy of black holes from a counting of microstates of the hole, and the related derivation of unitary Hawking radiation from such holes.
