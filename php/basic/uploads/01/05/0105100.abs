Title: Bulk effects in the cosmological dynamics of brane-world scenarios
Authors: Antonio Campos and Carlos F. Sopuerta
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the cosmological dynamics of Randall-Sundrum brane-world type scenarios in which the five-dimensional Weyl tensor has a non-vanishing projection onto the three-brane where matter fields are confined. Using dynamical systems techniques, we study how the state space of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) and Bianchi type I cosmological models is affected by the bulk Weyl tensor, focusing in the differences that appear with respect to general relativity and also Randall-Sundrum cosmological scenarios without the Weyl tensor contribution.
