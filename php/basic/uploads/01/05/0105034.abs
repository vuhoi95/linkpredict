Title: S-matrix for s-wave gravitational scattering
Authors: P. Fischer and D. Grumiller and W. Kummer and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: In the s-wave approximation the 4D Einstein gravity with scalar fields can be reduced to an effective 2D dilaton gravity coupled nonminimally to the matter fields. We study the leading order (tree level) vertices. The 4-particle matrix element is calculated explicitly. It is interpreted as scattering with formation of a virtual black hole state. As one novel feature we predict the gravitational decay of s-waves.
