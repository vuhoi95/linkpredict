Title: On Form Factors of SU(2) Invariant Thirring Model
Authors: Atsushi Nakayashiki and Yoshihiro Takeyama
Abstract: Integral formulae for form factors of a large family of charged local operators in SU(2) invariant Thirring model are given extending Smirnov's construction of form factors of chargeless local operators in the sine-Gordon model. New abelian symmetry acting on this family of local operators is found. It creates Lukyanov's operators which are not in the above family of local operators in general.
