Title: Boundary Superstring Field Theory Annulus Partition Function in the  Presence of Tachyons
Authors: G. Arutyunov and A. Pankiewicz and B. Stefanski Jr
Abstract: We compute the Boundary Superstring Field Theory partition function on the annulus in the presence of independent linear tachyon profiles on the two boundaries. The R-R sector is found to contribute non-trivially to the derivative terms of the space-time effective action. In the process we construct a boundary state description of D-branes in the presence of a linear tachyon. We quantize the open string in a tachyonic background and address the question of open/closed string duality.
