Title: Lattice study of the simplified model of M-theory
Authors: P. Bialas and J. Wosiek
Abstract: Lattice discretization of the supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanics is reviewed and results of the Monte Carlo simulations of the simplified model are presented. The D=4, N=2, quenched system, studied at finite temperature, reveals existence of the two distinct regions which may correspond to a black hole and the elementary 0-branes phases of the M-theory conjectured in the literature. New results for higher gauge groups N < 9 lead to the similar picture, however the nature of the transition between the two phases and its precise scaling with N is yet unresolved.
