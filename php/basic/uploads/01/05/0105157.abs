Title: Phase Transition in Compact QED(3) and the Josephson Junction
Authors: Vakif K. Onemli and Murat Tas and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We study the finite temperature phase transition in 2+1 dimensional compact QED and its dual theory: Josephson junction. Duality of these theories at zero temperature was established long time ago by Hosotani. Phase transition in compact QED is well studied and we employ the `duality' to study the superconductivity phase transition in a Josephson junction. For a thick junction we obtain a critical temperature in terms of the geometrical properties of the junction.
