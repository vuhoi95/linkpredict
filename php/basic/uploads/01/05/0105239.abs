Title: Electroweak symmetry breaking from dimensional deconstruction
Authors: Nima Arkani-Hamed and Andrew G. Cohen and Howard Georgi
Abstract: We propose a new class of four-dimensional theories for natural electroweak symmetry breaking, relying neither on supersymmetry nor on strong dynamics at the TeV scale. The new TeV physics is perturbative, and radiative corrections to the Higgs mass are finite. The softening of this mass occurs because the Higgs is an extended object in theory space, resulting in an accidental symmetry. A novel Higgs potential emerges naturally, requiring a second light SU(2) doublet scalar.
