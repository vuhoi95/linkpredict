Title: Torsion, topology and CPT anomaly in two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge  theory
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and C. Mayer
Abstract: We consider the CPT anomaly of two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge theory on a torus with topologically nontrivial zweibeins corresponding to the presence of spacetime torsion. The resulting chiral determinant can be expressed in terms of the standard chiral determinant without torsion, but with modified spinor boundary conditions. This implies that the two-dimensional CPT anomaly can be moved from one spin structure to another by choosing appropriate zweibeins. Similar results apply to higher-dimensional chiral gauge theories.
