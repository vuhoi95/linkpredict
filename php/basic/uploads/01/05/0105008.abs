Title: Quantum M^2 -> 2Lambda/3 discontinuity for massive gravity with a Lambda  term
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu and H. Sati
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that the absence of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity as M^2 -> 0 for massive spin-2 with a Lambda term is an artifact of the tree approximation, and that the discontinuity reappears at one loop, as a result of going from five degrees of freedom to two. In this paper we show that a similar classical continuity but quantum discontinuity arises in the "partially massless" limit M^2 -> 2Lambda/3, as a result of going from five degrees of freedom to four.
