Title: A possible way to relate the "covariantization" and the negative  dimensional integration methods in the light cone gauge
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and R. Bent√≠n
Abstract: In this work we present a possible way to relate the method of covariantizing the gauge dependent pole and the negative dimensional integration method for computing Feynman integrals pertinent to the light-cone gauge fields. Both techniques are applicable to the algebraic light-cone gauge and dispense with prescriptions to treat the characteristic poles.
