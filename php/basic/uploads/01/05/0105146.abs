Authors: A. Kuniba and T. Nakanishi and Z. Tsuboi
Abstract: It is shown that the numbers of off-diagonal solutions to the U_q(X^{(r)}_N) Bethe equation at q=0 coincide with the coefficients in the recently introduced canonical power series solution of the Q-system. Conjecturally the canonical solutions are characters of the KR (Kirillov-Reshetikhin) modules. This implies that the numbers of off-diagonal solutions agree with the weight multiplicities, which is interpreted as a formal completeness of the U_q(X^{(r)}_N) Bethe ansatz at q=0.
