Title: Late-time evolution of a self-interacting scalar field in the spacetime  of dilaton black hole
Authors: R. Moderski and M. Rogatko
Abstract: We investigate the late-time tails of self-interacting (massive) scalar fields in the spacetime of dilaton black hole. Following the no hair theorem we examine the mechanism by which self-interacting scalar hair decay. We revealed that the intermediate asymptotic behavior of the considered field perturbations is dominated by an oscillatory inverse power-law decaying tail. The numerical simulations showed that at the very late-time massive self-interacting scalar hair decayed slower than any power law.
