Title: A Planck-like problem for quantum charged black holes
Authors: A. Fabbri and D. J. Navarro and J. Navarro-Salas
Abstract: Motivated by the parallelism existing between the puzzles of classical physics at the beginning of the XXth century and the current paradoxes in the search of a quantum theory of gravity, we give, in analogy with Planck's black body radiation problem, a solution for the exact Hawking flux of evaporating Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Our results show that when back-reaction effects are fully taken into account the standard picture of black hole evaporation is significantly altered, thus implying a possible resolution of the information loss problem.
