Abstract: We numerically construct static and spherically symmetric electrically charged black hole solutions in Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity with massive dilaton. The numerical solutions show that the dilaton potential allows many more black hole causal structures than the massless dilaton. We find that depending on the black hole mass and charge and the dilaton mass the black holes can have either one, two, or three horizons. The extremal solutions are also found out. As an interesting peculiarity we note that there are extremal black holes with an inner horizon and with triply degenerated horizon.
