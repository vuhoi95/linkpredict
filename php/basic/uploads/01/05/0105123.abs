Title: On the AdS/CFT Correspondence and Logarithmic Operator
Authors: S. Moghimi-Araghi and S. Rouhani and M. Saadat
Abstract: Logarithmic conformal field theory is investigated using the AdS/CFT correspondence and a novel method based on nilpotent weights. Using this device we add ghost fermions and point to a BRST invariance of the theory.
