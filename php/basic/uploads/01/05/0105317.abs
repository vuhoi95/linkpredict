Title: Single-channel correlators and residue calculus
Authors: P. Jacob and P. Mathieu
Abstract: Some simple (namely, single-channel) correlation functions involving an arbitrary number of fields are computed by means of a direct application of the residue calculus, through partial fraction expansions. Examples are presented in minimal models and parafermionic conformal theories. A generic factorized expression is deduced for the corresponding single-channel structure constants.
