Title: Open and Closed String Interpretation of SUSY CFT's on Branes with  Boundaries
Authors: Andreas Karch and Lisa Randall
Abstract: We consider certain supersymmetric configurations of intersecting branes and branes ending on branes and analyze the duality between their open and closed string interpretation. The examples we study are chosen such that we have the lower dimensional brane realizing an n+1 dimensional conformal field theory on its worldvolume and the higher dimensional one introducing a conformal boundary. We also consider two CFTs, possibly with different central charges, interacting along a common conformal boundary. We show with a probe calculation that the dual closed string description is in terms of gravity in an AdS_{n+2} bulk with an AdS_{n+1} defect or two different AdS_{n+2} spaces joined along a defect. We also comment briefly on the expected back-reaction.
