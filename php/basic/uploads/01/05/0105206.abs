Title: \$tring Theory and an Accelerating Universe
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: An accelerating Universe can be accommodated naturally within non-critical string theory, in which scattering is described by a superscattering matrix \$ that does not factorize as a product of $S$- and $S^\dagger$-matrix elements and time evolution is described by a modified Liouville equation characteristic of open quantum-mechanical systems. We describe briefly alternative representations in terms of the stochastic Ito and Fokker-Planck equations. The link between the vacuum energy and the departure from criticality is stressed. We give an explicit example in which non-marginal \$tring couplings cause a departure from criticality, and the corresponding cosmological vacuum energy relaxes to zero \`a la quintessence.
