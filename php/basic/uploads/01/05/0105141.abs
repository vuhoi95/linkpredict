Title: Exact correlation functions of the BCS model in the canonical ensemble
Authors: Luigi Amico and Andreas Osterloh
Abstract: We evaluate correlation functions of the BCS model for finite number of particles. The integrability of the Hamiltonian relates it with the Gaudin algebra ${\cal G}[sl(2)]$. Therefore, a theorem that Sklyanin proved for the Gaudin model, can be applied. Several diagonal and off-diagonal correlators are calculated. The finite size scaling behavior of the pairing correlation function is studied.
