Title: On Unification of RR Couplings
Authors: Emil T. Akhmedov and Anton A. Gerasimov and Samson L. Shatashvili
Abstract: We consider the couplings of RR fields with open string sector for $Dp$-${\overline{Dp}}$ backgrounds of various $p$. Proposed approach, based on the approximation of the open string algebra by the algebra of differential operators, provides the unified description of these couplings and their interrelations.
