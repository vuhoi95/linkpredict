Authors: G. S. Djordjevic and B. Dragovich and L. Nesic
Abstract: Feynman's path integral in adelic quantum mechanics is considered. The propagator K(x'',t'';x',t') for one-dimensional adelic systems with quadratic Lagrangians is analytically evaluated. Obtained exact general formula has the form which is invariant under interchange of the number fields R and Q_p.
