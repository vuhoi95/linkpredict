Title: Fuzzy Line Bundles, the Chern Character and Topological Charges over the  Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Harald Grosse and Christian W. Rupp and Alexander Strohmaier
Abstract: Using the theory of quantized equivariant vector bundles over compact coadjoint orbits we determine the Chern characters of all noncommutative line bundles over the fuzzy sphere with regard to its derivation based differential calculus. The associated Chern numbers (topological charges) arise to be non-integer, in the commutative limit the well known integer Chern numbers of the complex line bundles over the 2-sphere are recovered.
