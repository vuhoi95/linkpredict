Title: The Fuzzy Kaehler Coset Space by the Fedosov Formalism
Authors: Shogo Aoyama and Takahiro Masuda
Abstract: We discuss deformation quantization of the Kaehler coset space by using the Fedosov formalism. We show that the Killing potentials of the Kaehler coset space satisfy the fuzzy algebrae, when the coset space is irreducible.
