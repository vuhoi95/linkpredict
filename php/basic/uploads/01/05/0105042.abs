Title: The Standard Model on a D-brane
Authors: David Berenstein and Vishnu Jejjala and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: We present a consistent string theory model which reproduces the Standard Model, consisting of a D3-brane at a simple orbifold singularity. We study some simple features of the phenomenology of the model. We find that the scale of stringy physics must be in the multi-TeV range. There are natural hierarchies in the fermion spectrum and there are several possible experimental signatures of the model.
