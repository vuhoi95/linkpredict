Title: Poisson Structure and Moyal Quantisation of the Liouville Theory
Authors: George Jorjadze and Gerhard Weigt
Abstract: The symplectic and Poisson structures of the Liouville theory are derived from the symplectic form of the SL(2,R) WZNW theory by gauge invariant Hamiltonian reduction. Causal non-equal time Poisson brackets for a Liouville field are presented. Using the symmetries of the Liouville theory, symbols of chiral fields are constructed and their *-products calculated. Quantum deformations consistent with the canonical quantisation result, and a non-equal time commutator is given.
