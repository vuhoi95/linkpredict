Title: Membranes Wrapped on Holomorphic Curves
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Nakwoo Kim and Stathis Pakis and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We construct supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theories arising when M-theory membranes wrap holomorphic curves in Calabi-Yau n-folds. The solutions are constructed in an Abelian truncation of maximal D=4 gauged supergravity and then uplifted to D=11. For four-folds and five-folds we find new smooth AdS/CFT examples and for all cases we analyse the nature of the singularities that arise. Our results provide an interpretation of certain charged topological AdS black holes. We also present the generalised calibration two-forms for the solutions.
