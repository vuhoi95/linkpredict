Title: D-branes on Noncommutative Orbifolds
Authors: El Mostapha Sahraoui and El Hassan Saidi
Abstract: We study tachyon condensation on noncommutative toric orbifolds with a $Z_2$ discrete group and explore the various kins of brane bound states arising in the case of irrational values of the B-field. We show that $Z_$ symmetry of the orbifolds incorporates naturally anti-branes in the spectrum and leads to equivalent results as those obtained by starting from an original pair of D-barD system on quantum torii. A specific analysis is deserved to the irrational representation of NC orbifolds and to the unstable bound states generated by the condensation.
