Title: D-branes and Vector Bundles on Calabi-Yau Manifolds: a view from the  Helix
Authors: Suresh Govindarajan and T. Jayaraman
Abstract: We review some recent results on D-branes on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds. We show the existence of structures (helices and quivers) which enable one to make statements about large families of D-branes in various phases of the Gauged Linear Sigma Model (GLSM) associated with the CY manifold. A comparison of the quivers of two phases leads to the prediction that certain D-brane configurations will decay as one moves across phases. We discuss how boundary fermions can be used to realise various D-brane configurations associated with coherent sheaves in the GLSM with boundary. This is based on the talk presented by S.G. at Strings 2001, Mumbai.
