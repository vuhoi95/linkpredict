Abstract: We present a cohomological method for obtaining the non-Abelian Seiberg-Witten map for any gauge group and to any order in theta. By introducing a ghost field, we are able to express the equations defining the Seiberg-Witten map through a coboundary operator, so that they can be solved by constructing a corresponding homotopy operator.
