Title: Contraction and decomposition matrices for vacuum diagrams
Authors: K. Knecht and H. Veschelde
Abstract: Tensor reduction of vacuum diagrams uses contraction and decomposition matrices. We present general recurrence relations for the calculation of those matrices and an explicit formula for the 3-loop decomposition matrix and its determinant.
