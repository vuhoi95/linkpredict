Title: Brane-World and Holography
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Takashi Torii and Daisuke Ida
Abstract: We consider the brane-world in the holographic point of view. Bearing the realistic models in mind, the bulk massless scalar field is introduced. First of all, we find the constraint on the coupling of the scalar fields with the matter(not holographic CFT) on the brane. We show that the traceless part of the energy-momentum tensor of holographic CFT is a part of the bulk Weyl tensor. The trace part which comes from the trace-anomaly is corresponding to the $\rho^2$-term appeared in the generalized FRW equation in the brane-world.
