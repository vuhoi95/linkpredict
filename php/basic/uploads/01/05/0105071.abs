Title: Quantum electrodynamics in the squeezed vacuum state: Electron mass  shift
Authors: Volkmar Putz and Karl Svozil
Abstract: Due to the nonvanishing average photon population of the squeezed vacuum state, finite corrections to the scattering matrix are obtained. The lowest order contribution to the electron mass shift for a one mode squeezed vacuum state is given by $\delta m(\Omega, s)/m=\alpha (2/\pi)(\Omega /m)^2\sinh^2(s)$, where $\Omega$ and $s$ stand for the mode frequency and the squeeze parameter and $\alpha$ for the fine structure constant, respectively.
