Abstract: We analyze different types of quantum corrections to the Cardy-Verlinde entropy formula in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe and in an (anti)-de Sitter space. In all cases we show that quantum corrections can be represented by an effective cosmological constant which is then used to redefine the parameters entering the Cardy-Verlinde formula so that it becomes valid also with quantum corrections, a fact that we interpret as a further indication of its universality. A proposed relation between Cardy-Verlinde formula and the ADM Hamiltonian constraint is given.
