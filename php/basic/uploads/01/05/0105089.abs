Title: UV/IR connection, a matrix perspective
Authors: Y. Kinar and G. Lifschytz and J. Sonnenschein
Abstract: We show that the matrix formulation of non-commutative field theories is equivalent, in the continuum, to a formulation in a mixed configuration-momentum space. In this formulation, the non-locality of the interactions, that leads to the IR/UV mixing, becomes transparent. We clarify the relation between long range effects (and IR divergences) and the non-planarity of the corresponding Feynman diagrams.
