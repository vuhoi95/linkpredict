Title: An N=8 Superaffine Malcev Algebra and Its N=8 Sugawara
Authors: H. L. Carrion and M. Rojas and F. Toppan
Abstract: A supersymmetric affinization of the algebra of octonions is introduced. It satisfies a super-Malcev property and is N=8 supersymmetric. Its Sugawara construction recovers, in a special limit, the non-associative N=8 superalgebra of Englert et al. This paper extends to supersymmetry the results obtained by Osipov in the bosonic case.
