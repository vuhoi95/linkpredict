Title: Triplectic Gauge Fixing for N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: C. N. Ferreira and C. F. L. Godinho
Abstract: The Sp(2)-gauge fixing of N = 1 super-Yang-Mills theory is considered here. We thereby apply the triplectic scheme, where two classes of gauge-fixing bosons are introduced. The first one depends only on the gauge field, whereas the second boson depends on this gauge field and also on a pair of Majorana fermions. In this sense, we build up the BRST extended (BRST plus antiBRST) algebras for the model, for which the nilpotency relations, s^2_1=s^2_2=s_1s_2+s_2s_1=0, hold.
