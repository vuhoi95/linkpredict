Title: Some comments on Anti-de Sitter D-branes
Authors: P. M. Petropoulos and S. Ribault
Abstract: We present some preliminary investigations about the AdS2*S2 D3-branes in AdS3*S3. We analyse the quadratic fluctuations of Dirac-Born-Infeld action around a given semi-classical D-brane configuration and compare them with results obtained by using conformal field theory techniques. We finally study classical motions of open strings attached to those D-branes and analyse the role of the spectral flow in this context.
