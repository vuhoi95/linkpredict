Title: Massless neutrino oscillations
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: Quantum dynamical semigroups provide a general framework for studying the evolution of open systems. Neutrino propagation both in vacuum and in matter can be analyzed using these techniques: they allow a consistent treatment of non-standard, dissipative effects that can alter the pattern of neutrino oscillations. In particular, initially massless neutrinos can give rise to a nonvanishing flavour transition probability, involving in addition the Majorana CP-violating mixing phase.
