Title: The Operator Algebra and Twisted KZ Equations of WZW Orbifolds
Authors: J. de Boer and M. B. Halpern and N. A. Obers
Abstract: We obtain the operator algebra of each twisted sector of all WZW orbifolds, including the general twisted current algebra and the algebra of the twisted currents with the twisted affine primary fields. Surprisingly, the twisted right and left mover current algebras are not a priori copies of each other. Using the operator algebra we also derive world-sheet differential equations for the twisted affine primary fields of all WZW orbifolds. Finally we include ground state properties to obtain the twisted Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations of the WZW permutation orbifolds and the inner-automorphic WZW orbifolds.
