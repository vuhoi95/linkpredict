Title: Asymptotics of the heat equation with `exotic' boundary conditions or  with time dependent coefficients
Authors: Peter B. Gilkey and Klaus Kirsten and JeongHyeong Park and Dmitri Vassilevich
Abstract: The heat trace asymptotics are discussed for operators of Laplace type with Dirichlet, Robin, spectral, D/N, and transmittal boundary conditions. The heat content asymptotics are discussed for operators with time dependent coefficients and Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions.
