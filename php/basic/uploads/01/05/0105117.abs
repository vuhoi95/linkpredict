Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Sachiko Ogushi
Abstract: Higher derivative bulk gravity (without Riemann tensor square term) admits AdS-Schwarzschild black hole as exact solution. It is shown that induced brane geometry on such background is open, flat or closed FRW radiation dominated Universe. Higher derivative terms contributions appear in the Hawking temperature, entropy and Hubble parameter via the redefinition of 5-dimensional gravitational constant and AdS scale parameter. These higher derivative terms do not destroy the AdS-dual description of radiation represented by strongly-coupled CFT. Cardy-Verlinde formula which expresses cosmological entropy as square root from other parameters and entropies is derived in $R^2$ gravity. The corresponding cosmological entropy bounds are briefly discussed.
