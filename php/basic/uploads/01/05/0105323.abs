Title: Dynamical Electroweak Breaking and Latticized Extra Dimensions
Authors: Hsin-Chia Cheng and Christopher T. Hill and Jing Wang
Abstract: Using gauge invariant effective Lagrangians in 1+3 dimensions describing the Standard Model in 1+4 dimensions, we explore dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. The Top Quark Seesaw model arises naturally, as well as the full CKM structure. We include a discussion of effects of warping, and indicate how other dynamical schemes may also be realized.
