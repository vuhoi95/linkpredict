Title: Operator product expansion in SL(2) conformal field theory
Authors: Kazuo Hosomichi and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: In the conformal field theories having affine SL(2) symmetry, we study the operator product expansion (OPE) involving primary fields in highest weight representations. For this purpose, we analyze properties of primary fields with definite SL(2) weights, and calculate their two- and three-point functions. Using these correlators, we show that the correct OPE is obtained when one of the primary fields belongs to the degenerate highest weight representation. We briefly comment on the OPE in the SL(2,R) WZNW model.
