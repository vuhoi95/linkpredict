Title: Probe Brane Dynamics and the Cosmological Constant
Authors: Eanna Flanagan and Richard J. Hill and Nicholas Jones and S. -H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman
Abstract: Recently a brane world perspective on the cosmological constant and the hierarchy problems was presented. Here, we elaborate on some aspects of that particular scenario and discuss the stability of the stationary brane solution and the dynamics of a probe brane. Even though the brane is unstable under a small perturbation from its stationary position, such instability is harmless when the 4-D cosmological constant is very small, as is the case of our universe. One may also introduce radion stabilizing potentials in a more realistic scenario.
