Title: Einstein equations for an asymmetric brane-world
Authors: Richard A. Battye and Brandon Carter and Andrew Mennim and Jean-Philippe Uzan
Abstract: We consider a brane-world of co-dimension one without the reflection symmetry that is commonly imposed between the two sides of the brane. Using the coordinate-free formalism of the Gauss-Codacci equations, we derive the effective Einstein equations by relating the local curvature to the matter on the brane in the case when its bare tension is much larger than the localized matter, and hence show that Einstein gravity is a natural consequence of such models in the weak field limit. We find agreement with the recently derived cosmological case, which can be solved exactly, and point out that such models can be realized naturally in the case where there is a minimally coupled form field in the bulk.
