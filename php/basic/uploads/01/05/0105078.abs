Title: Confinement and soliton solutions in the SL(3) Toda model coupled to  matter fields
Authors: A. G. Bueno and L. A. Ferreira and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: We consider an integrable conformally invariant two dimensional model associated to the affine Kac-Moody algebra SL(3). It possesses four scalar fields and six Dirac spinors. The theory does not possesses a local Lagrangian since the spinor equations of motion present interaction terms which are bilinear in the spinors. There exists a submodel presenting an equivalence between a U(1) vector current and a topological current, which leads to a confinement of the spinors inside the solitons. We calculate the one-soliton and two-soliton solutions using a procedure which is a hybrid of the dressing and Hirota methods. The soliton masses and time delays due to the soliton interactions are also calculated. We give a computer program to calculate the soliton solutions.
