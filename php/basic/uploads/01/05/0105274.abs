Title: Supersymmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld revisited
Authors: E. A. Bergshoeff and A. Bilal and M. de Roo and A. Sevrin
Abstract: We determine the non-abelian Born-Infeld action, including fermions, as it results from the four-point tree-level open superstring scattering amplitudes at order alpha'^2. We find that, after an appropriate field redefinition all terms at this order can be written as a symmetrised trace. We confront this action with the results that follow from kappa-symmetry and conclude that the recently proposed non-abelian kappa-symmetry cannot be extended to cubic orders in the Born-Infeld curvature.
