Title: Quadrupole Instabilities of Relativistic Rotating Membranes
Authors: M. Axenides and E. G. Floratos and L. Perivolaropoulos
Abstract: We generalize recent study of the stability of isotropic (spherical) rotating membranes to the anisotropic ellipsoidal membrane. We find that while the stability persists for deformations of spin $l=1$, the quadrupole and higher spin deformations ($l\geq 2$) lead to instabilities. We find the relevant instability modes and the corresponding eigenvalues. These indicate that the ellipsoidal rotating membranes generically decay into finger-like configurations.
