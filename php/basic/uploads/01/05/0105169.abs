Title: QCD, Wick's Theorem for KdV $Ï„$-functions and the String Equation
Authors: H. W. Braden and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: Two consistency conditions for partition functions established by Akemann and Dam-gaard in their studies of the fermionic mass dependence of the QCD partition function at low energy ({\it a la} Leutwiller-Smilga-Verbaarschot) are interpreted in terms of integrable hierarchies. Their algebraic relation is shown to be a consequence of Wick's theorem for 2d fermionic correlators (Hirota identities) in the special case of the 2-reductions of the KP hierarchy (that is KdV/mKdV). The consistency condition involving derivatives is an incarnation of the string equation associated with the particular matrix model (the particular kind of the Kac-Schwarz operator).
