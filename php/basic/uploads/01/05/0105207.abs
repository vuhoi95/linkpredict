Title: Curved Domain Walls of Five Dimensional Gauged Supergravity
Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We study curved domain wall solutions for gauged supergravity theories obtained by gauging some of the isometries of the manifold spanned by the scalars of vector and hypermultiplets. We first consider the case obtained by compactifying M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold in the presence of G-fluxes. It is found that supersymmetry allows for the construction of domain wall configurations with curved worldvolume and a cosmological constant. However it turns out that the equations of motion, if one insists on the supersymmetric ansatz for the scalars and warp factor, rule out solutions with a cosmological constant and allows only for Ricci-flat worldvolumes. Moreover, in the absence of flux, there are non-supersymmetric solutions with worldvolumes given by Einstein manifolds. We also generalize our results to all five dimensional gauged supergravity.
