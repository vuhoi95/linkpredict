Title: Lagrangian Sp(3) BRST symmetry for irreducible gauge theories
Authors: C. Bizdadea and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: The Lagrangian Sp(3) BRST symmetry for irreducible gauge theories is constructed in the framework of homological perturbation theory. The canonical generator of this extended symmetry is shown to exist. A gauge-fixing procedure specific to the standard antibracket-antifield formalism, that leads to an effective action, which is invariant under all the three differentials of the Sp(3) algebra, is given.
