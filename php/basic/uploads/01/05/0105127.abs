Title: Noncommutative field theory description of quantum Hall skyrmions
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Kyungsun Moon and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We revisit the quantum Hall system with no Zeeman splitting energy using the noncommutative field theory. We analyze the BPS condition for the delta-function interaction near the filling factor $\nu=1$. Multi-skyrmions are shown to saturate the BPS bounds. The dimension of the moduli space of $k$ skyrmions is $4k+2$. Advantage of the noncommutative field description is demonstrated through the derivation of the effective nonlinear $\sigma$ model Lagrangian.
