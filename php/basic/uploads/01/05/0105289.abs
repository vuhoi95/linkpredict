Title: Electric-Magnetic Duality and WDVV Equations
Authors: B. de Wit and A. Marshakov
Abstract: We consider the associativity (or WDVV) equations in the form they appear in Seiberg-Witten theory and prove that they are covariant under generic electric-magnetic duality transformations. We discuss the consequences of this covariance from various perspectives.
