Title: Test of gauged N=8 SUGRA / N=1 SYM duality at sub-leading order
Authors: Paul Mansfield and David Nolland
Abstract: An infra-red fixed point of ${\mathcal N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory is believed to be dual to a solution of five-dimensional gauged ${\mathcal N}=8$ supergravity. We test this conjecture at next to leading order in the large $N$ expansion by computing bulk one-loop corrections to the anomaly coefficient $a-c$. The one-loop corrections are non-zero for all values of the bulk mass, and not just special ones as claimed in previous work.
