Title: Proof of Polyakov conjecture for general elliptic singularities
Authors: Luigi Cantini and Pietro Menotti and Domenico Seminara
Abstract: A proof is given of Polyakov conjecture about the accessory parameters of the SU(1,1) Riemann-Hilbert problem for general elliptic singularities on the Riemann sphere. Its relevance to 2+1 dimensional gravity is stressed.
