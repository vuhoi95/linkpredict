Title: Representations of the Renormalization Group as Matrix Lie Algebra
Authors: M. Berg and P. Cartier
Abstract: Renormalization is cast in the form of a Lie algebra of infinite triangular matrices. By exponentiation, these matrices generate counterterms for Feynman diagrams with subdivergences. As representations of an insertion operator, the matrices are related to the Connes-Kreimer Lie algebra. In fact, the right-symmetric nonassociative algebra of the Connes-Kreimer insertion product is equivalent to an "Ihara bracket" in the matrix Lie algebra. We check our results in a three-loop example in scalar field theory. Apart from possible applications in high-precision phenomenology, we give a few ideas about possible applications in noncommutative geometry and functional integration.
