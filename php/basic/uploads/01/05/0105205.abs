Title: Stacking non-BPS D-Branes
Authors: Gian Luigi Alberghi and Elena Caceres and Kevin Goldstein and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We present a candidate supergravity solution for a stacked configuration of stable non-BPS D-branes in Type II string theory compactified on T^4/Z_2. This gives a supergravity description of nonabelian tachyon condensation on the brane worldvolume.
