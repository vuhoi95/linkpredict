Title: A No-Go Theorem for the Compatibility between Involutions of the First  Order Differentials on a Lattice and the Continuum Limit
Authors: Jian DAI and Xing-Chang SONG
Abstract: We prove that the following three properties can not match each other on a lattice, that differentials of coordinate functions are algebraically dependent to their involutive conjugates, that the involution on a lattice is an antihomomorphism and that differential calculus has a natural continuum limit.
