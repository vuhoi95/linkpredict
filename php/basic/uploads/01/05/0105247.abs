Title: Some computation on g Function and Disc Partition Function and Boundary  String Field Theory
Authors: A. Fujii and H. Itoyama
Abstract: Quadratic tachyon profile has been discussed in the boundary string field theory. We here compute the g-function by factorizing the cylinder amplitude. The answer is compared with the disc partition function. The boundary state is constructed. We extend these computations to those of the boundary sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point.
