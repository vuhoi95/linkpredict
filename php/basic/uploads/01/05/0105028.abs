Title: On the Detection of a Scalar Stochastic Background of Gravitational  Waves
Authors: D. Babusci and L. Baiotti and F. Fucito and A. Nagar
Abstract: In the near future we will witness the coming to a full operational regime of laser interferometers and resonant mass detectors of spherical shape. In this work we study the sensitivity of pairs of such gravitational wave detectors to a scalar stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our computations are carried out both for minimal and non minimal coupling of the scalar fields.
