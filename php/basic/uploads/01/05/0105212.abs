Title: A Brief Comment on "The Pyrotechnic Universe"
Authors: Justin Khoury and Burt A. Ovrut and Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok
Abstract: We respond to the criticisms by Kallosh, Kofman and Linde concerning our proposal of the ekpyrotic universe scenario. We point out a number of errors in their considerations and argue that, at this stage, the ekpyrotic model is a possible alternative to inflationary cosmology as a description of the very early universe.
