Title: Geometric Origin of Staggered Fermion: Direct Product K-Cycle
Authors: Jian Dai and Xing-Chang Song
Abstract: Staggered formalism of lattice fermion can be cast into a form of direct product K-cycle in noncommutative geometry. The correspondence between this staggered K-cycle and a canonically defined K-cycle for finitely generated abelian group where lattice appears as a special case is proved.
