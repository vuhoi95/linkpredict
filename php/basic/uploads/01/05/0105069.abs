Title: Photon Decay at the Schwarzschild Horizon
Authors: B. Altschul and R. Jackiw
Abstract: A recent proposal that gravity theory is an emergent phenomenon also entails the possibility of photon decay near the Schwarzschild event horizon. We present a possible mechanism for such decay, which utilizes a dimensional reduction near the horizon.
