Title: From a Thick to a Thin Supergravity Domain Wall
Authors: Francisco A. Brito and Mirjam Cvetic and SangChul Yoon
Abstract: Within D=4 N=1 supergravity theory we obtain an effective theory of the thin wall limit for a flat domain wall configuration, interpolating between isolated supersymmetric extrema of the matter potential. We focus on the Z_2 symmetric flat wall and derive the supersymmetric effective action both in the bulk and on the wall; in the thin wall limit the scalar field, forming the wall, is frozen, and provides the delta function domain wall source, while its fermionic partner decouples due to its large mass. In addition, the interaction between the gravitational supermultiplet and the interaction of the matter multiplet decouples on the wall. While the results are explicitly demonstrated within N=1 D=4 supergravity, we also provide a generalization of the result to D-dimensions.
