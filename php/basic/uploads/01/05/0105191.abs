Title: Noncommutative Differential Calculus for D-brane in Non-Constant B Field  Background
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Shun-Pei Miao
Abstract: In this paper we try to construct noncommutative Yang-Mills theory for generic Poisson manifolds. It turns out that the noncommutative differential calculus defined in an old work is exactly what we need. Using this calculus, we generalize results about the Seiberg-Witten map, the Dirac-Born-Infeld action, the matrix model and the open string quantization for constant B field to non-constant background with H=0.
