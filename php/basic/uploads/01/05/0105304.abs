Abstract: We construct the second variation Lagrangian for Randall-Sundrum model with two branes, study its gauge invariance, find the corresponding equations of motion and decouple them. We also derive an effective Lagrangian for this model in the unitary gauge, which describes a massless graviton, massive gravitons and a massless scalar radion. It is shown that the mass spectra of these fields and their couplings to the matter are different on different branes.
