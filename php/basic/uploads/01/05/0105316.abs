Title: Dirac Spinor Waves and Solitons in Anisotropic Taub-NUT Spaces
Authors: Sergiu I. Vacaru and Florian Catalin Popa
Abstract: We apply a new general method of anholonomic frames with associated nonlinear connection structure to construct new classes of exact solutions of Einstein-Dirac equations in five dimensional (5D)gravity. Such solutions are parametrized by off-diagonal metrics in coordinate (holonomic) bases, or, equivalently, by diagonal metrics given with respect to some anholonomic frames (pentads, or funfbiends, satisfing corresponding constraint relations). We consider two possibilities of generalization of the Taub NUT metric in order to obtain vacuum solutions of 5D Einsitein equations with effective renormalization of constants having distinguished anisotropies on an angular parameter or on extra dimension coordinate. The constructions are extended to solutions describing self-consistent propagations of 3D Dirac wave packets in 5D anisotropic Taub NUT spacetimes. We show that such anisotropic configurations of spinor matter can induce gravitational 3D solitons being solutions of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili or of sine-Gordon equations.
