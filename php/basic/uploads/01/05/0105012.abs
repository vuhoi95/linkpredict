Title: Scattering of Noncommutative (n,1) Solitons
Authors: Takeo Araki and Katsushi Ito
Abstract: We study scattering of noncommutative solitons in 2+1 dimensional scalar field theory. In particular, we investigate a system of two solitons with level n and n' (the (n,n')-system) in the large noncommutativity limit. We show that the scattering of a general (n,n')-system occurs at right angles in the case of zero impact parameter. We also derive an exact Kahler potential and the metric of the moduli space of the (n,1)-system. We examine numerically the (n,1) scattering and find that the closest distance for a fixed scattering angle is well approximated by a function a+b*sqrt{n} where a and b are some numerical constants.
