Title: The non-perturbative groundstate of Q.C.D and the local composite  operator A_mu^2
Authors: H. Verschelde and K. Knecht and K. Van Acoleyen and M. Vanderkelen
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the dimension 2 condensate A_mu^2 has a non zero non-perturbative value in Yang-Mills theory. We introduce a multiplicatively renormalisable effective potential for this condensate and show through two loop calculations that a non zero condensate is energetically favoured.
