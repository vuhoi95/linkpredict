Title: Domain formation in noninstantaneous symmetry breaking phase transitions
Authors: E. Alfinito and G. Vitiello
Abstract: In the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau harmonic potential approximation, we present a possible modeling of the time-dependence of the frequency of the order parameter mode suitable to account for the formation of correlated domains in non-instantaneous symmetry breaking phase transitions. An interesting spectrum of possibilities for the size and the life-time of these domains emerges, which appears to be consistent with the conclusions of other, differently grounded analysis.
