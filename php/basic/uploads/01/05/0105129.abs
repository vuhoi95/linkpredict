Title: Open String Fields As Matrices
Authors: Teruhiko Kawano and Kazumi Okuyama
Abstract: We present a new representation of the string vertices of the cubic open string field theory. By using this three-string vertex, we attempt to identify open string fields as huge-sized matrices by following Witten's idea. By using these huge matrices, we obtain some results about the construction of partial isometries in the algebra of open string fields.
