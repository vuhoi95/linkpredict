Title: Cosmological constant and Brane New World
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Octavio Obregon and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The estimation of the cosmological constant in inflationary Brane New World models is done. It is shown that basically it is quite large, of the same order as in anomaly-driven inflation. However, for some fine-tuning of bulk gravitational constant and AdS scale parameter $l^2$ it may be reduced to sufficiently small value. Bulk higher derivative AdS gravity with quantum brane matter may also serve as the model where small positive cosmological constant occurs.
