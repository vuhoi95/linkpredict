Title: Hierarchies from Fluxes in String Compactifications
Authors: Steven B. Giddings and Shamit Kachru and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: Warped compactifications with significant warping provide one of the few known mechanisms for naturally generating large hierarchies of physical scales. We demonstrate that this mechanism is realizable in string theory, and give examples involving orientifold compactifications of IIB string theory and F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau four-folds. In each case, the hierarchy of scales is fixed by a choice of RR and NS fluxes in the compact manifold. Our solutions involve compactifications of the Klebanov-Strassler gravity dual to a confining N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory,and the hierarchy reflects the small scale of chiral symmetry breaking in the dual gauge theory.
