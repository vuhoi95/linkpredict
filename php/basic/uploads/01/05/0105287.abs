Title: Classification of Conformal Field Theories Based on Coulomb gases.  Application to Loop Models
Authors: Vladimir S. Dotsenko and Jesper Lykke Jacobsen and Marco Picco
Abstract: We present a method for classifying conformal field theories based on Coulomb gases (bosonic free-field construction). Given a particular geometric configuration of the screening charges, we give necessary conditions for the existence of degenerate representations and for the closure of the vertex-operator algebra. The resulting classification contains, but is more general than, the standard one based on classical Lie algebras. We then apply the method to the Coulomb gas theory for the two-flavoured loop model of Jacobsen and Kondev. The purpose of the study is to clarify the relation between Coulomb gas models and conformal field theories with extended symmetries.
