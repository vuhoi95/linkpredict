Title: Bound States of String Networks and D-branes
Authors: Alok Kumar and Rashmi Rekha Nayak and Kamal Lochan Panigrahi
Abstract: We show the existence of non-threshold bound states of (p, q) string networks and D3-branes, preserving 1/4 of the full type IIB supersymmetry, interpreted as string networks dissolved in D3-branes. We also write down the expression for the mass density of the system and discuss the extension of the construction to other Dp-branes. Differences in our construction of string networks with the ones interpreted as dyons in N=4 gauge theories are also pointed out.
