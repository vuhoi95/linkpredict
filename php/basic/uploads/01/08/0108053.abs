Title: A thick shell Casimir effect
Authors: I. Klich and A. Mann and M. Revzen
Abstract: We consider the Casimir energy of a thick dielectric-diamagnetic shell under a uniform velocity light condition, as a function of the radii and the permeabilities. We show that there is a range of parameters in which the stress on the outer shell is inward, and a range where the stress on the outer shell is outward. We examine the possibility of obtaining an energetically stable configuration of a thick shell made of a material with a fixed volume.
