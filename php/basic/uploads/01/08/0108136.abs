Title: On the Noncommutative Geometry of Twisted Spheres
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Francesco Bonechi
Abstract: We describe noncommutative geometric aspects of twisted deformations, in particular of the spheres in Connes and Landi [8] and in Connes and Dubois Violette [7], by using the differential and integral calculus on these spaces that is covariant under the action of their corresponding quantum symmetry groups. We start from multiparametric deformations of the orthogonal groups and related planes and spheres. We show that only in the twisted limit of these multiparametric deformations the covariant calculus on the plane gives by a quotient procedure a meaningful calculus on the sphere. In this calculus the external algebra has the same dimension of the classical one. We develop the Haar functional on spheres and use it to define an integral on forms. In the twisted limit (differently from the general multiparametric case) the Haar functional is a trace and we thus obtain a cycle on the algebra. Moreover we explicitely construct the *-Hodge operator on the space of forms on the plane and then by quotient on the sphere. We apply our results to even spheres and we compute the Chern-Connes pairing between the character of this cycle, i.e. a cyclic 2n-cocycle, and the instanton projector defined in [7].
