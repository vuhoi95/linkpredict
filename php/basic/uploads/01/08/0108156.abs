Title: Six-dimensional Abelian vortices with quadratic curvature  self-interactions
Authors: M. Giovannini and H. B. Meyer
Abstract: Six-dimensional Nielsen-Olesen vortices are analyzed in the context of a quadratic gravity theory containing Euler-Gauss-Bonnet self-interactions. The relations among the string tensions can be tuned in such a way that the obtained solutions lead to warped compactification on the vortex. New regular solutions are possible in comparison with the case where the gravity action only consists of the Einstein-Hilbert term. The parameter space of the model is discussed
