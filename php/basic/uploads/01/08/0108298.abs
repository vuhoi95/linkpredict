Title: Critical thermodynamics of three-dimensional MN-component field model  with cubic anisotropy from higher-loop Îµexpansion
Authors: Andrei Mudrov and Konstantin Varnashev
Abstract: The critical thermodynamics of an $MN$-component field model with cubic anisotropy relevant to the phase transitions in certain crystals with complicated ordering is studied within the four-loop $\ve$ expansion using the minimal subtraction scheme. Investigation of the global structure of RG flows for the physically significant cases M=2, N=2 and M=2, N=3 shows that the model has an anisotropic stable fixed point with new critical exponents. The critical dimensionality of the order parameter is proved to be equal to $N_c^C=1.445(20)$, that is exactly half its counterpart in the real hypercubic model.
