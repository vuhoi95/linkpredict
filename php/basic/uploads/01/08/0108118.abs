Title: Scattering of Noncommutative Solitons in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander D. Popov
Abstract: Interactions of noncommutative solitons in a modified U(n) sigma model in 2+1 dimensions can be analyzed exactly. Using an extension of the dressing method, we construct explicit time-dependent solutions of its noncommutative field equation by iteratively solving linear equations. The approach is illustrated by presenting bound states and right-angle scattering configurations for two noncommutative solitons.
