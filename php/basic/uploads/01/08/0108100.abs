Title: D-Brane Instantons and K-Theory Charges
Authors: Juan Maldacena and Gregory Moore and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We discuss some physical issues related to the K-theoretic classification of D-brane charges, putting an emphasis on the role of D-brane instantons. The relation to D-instantons provides a physical interpretation to the mathematical algorithm for computing K-theory known as the ``Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.'' Conjecturally, a formulation in terms of D-instantons leads to a computationally useful formulation of K-homology in general. As an application and illustration of this viewpoint we discuss some issues connected with D-brane charges associated with branes in WZW models. We discuss the case of SU(3) in detail, and comment on the general picture of branes in SU(N), based on a recent result of M. Hopkins.
