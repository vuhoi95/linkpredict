Title: Collective modes of color-flavor locked phase of dense QCD at finite  temperature
Authors: V. P. Gusynin and I. A. Shovkovy
Abstract: A detailed analysis of collective modes that couple to either vector or axial color currents in color-flavor locked phase of color superconducting dense quark matter at finite temperature is presented. Among the realm of collective modes, including the plasmons and the Nambu-Goldstone bosons, we also reveal the gapless Carlson-Goldman modes, resembling the scalar Nambu-Golstone bosons. These latter exist only in a close vicinity of the critical line. Their presence does not eliminate the Meissner effect, proving that the system remains in the color broken phase. The finite temperature properties of the plasmons and the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are also studied. In addition to the ordinary plasmon, we also reveal a "light" plasmon which has a narrow width and whose mass is of the order of the superconducting gap.
