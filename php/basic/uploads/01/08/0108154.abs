Title: Noncommutative Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory in Ten-Dimensions with  Higher-Derivative Terms
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present an action for noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in ten-dimensions, and confirm its invariance under supersymmetry. We next add higher-order derivative terms to such a noncommutative supersymmetric action. These terms contain fields as high as the quartic order. This resulting action can be regarded as supersymmetric generalization of noncommutative non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Some ambiguities related to field redefinitions are also clarified.
