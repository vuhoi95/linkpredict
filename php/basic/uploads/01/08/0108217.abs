Title: Changing alpha With Time: Implications For Fifth-Force-Type Experiments  And Quintessence
Authors: Gia Dvali and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: If the recent observations suggesting a time variation of the fine structure constant are correct, they imply the existence of an ultra light scalar particle. This particle inevitably couples to nucleons through the \alpha-dependence of their masses and thus mediates an isotope-dependent long-range force. The strength of the coupling is within a couple of orders of magnitude from the existing experimental bounds for such forces. The new force can be potentially measured in the precision experimental tests of the equivalence principle. Due to an interesting coincidence of the required time-scales, the scalar filed in question can at the same time play the role of a quintessence field.
