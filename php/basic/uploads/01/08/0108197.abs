Title: Local Physical Coodinates from Symplectic Projector Method
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: The basic arguments underlying the symplectic projector method are presented. By this method, local free coordinates on the constrait surface can be obtained for a broader class of constrained systems. Some interesting examples are analyzed.
