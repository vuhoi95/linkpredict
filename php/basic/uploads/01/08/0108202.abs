Title: Non-BPS D-branes and M-theory
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: A dual pair of supersymmetric string theories that involves an asymmetric orbifold and an orientifold of Type II is considered. The D-branes of the orbifold theory (that were recently determined by Gutperle) are all non-BPS and do not carry any conserved gauge charges. It is shown that they carry non-trivial K-theory charges, and that they can be understood in terms of branes wrapping certain homology classes of the M-theory compactification. Using the adiabatic argument, dual partners of some of these non-BPS D-branes are proposed. The relations between these dual states are found to be in agreement with the M-theory description of the D-branes.
