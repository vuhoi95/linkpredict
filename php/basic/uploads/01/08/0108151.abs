Title: Reduced N=2 Quantum Mechanics: Descendants of the Kahler Geometries
Authors: A. Losev and M. Shifman
Abstract: We discuss an N=2 quantum mechanics with or without a central charge. A representation is constructed with the number of bosonic degrees of freedom less that one half of the fermionic degrees of freedom. We suggest a systematic method of reducing the bosonic degrees of freedom called ``dynamical reduction." Our consideration opens a problem of a general classification of nonstandard representations of N=2$ superalgebra.
