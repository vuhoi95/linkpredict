Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking with Abnormal Number of Nambu-Goldstone  Bosons and Kaon Condensate
Authors: V. A. Miransky and I. A. Shovkovy
Abstract: We describe a class of relativistic models incorporating finite density of matter in which spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries leads to a lesser number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons than that required by the Goldstone theorem. This class, in particular, describes the dynamics of the kaon condensate in the color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD. We describe the spectrum of low energy excitations in this dynamics and show that, despite the presence of a condensate and gapless excitations, this system is not a superfluid.
