Title: Boundary G/G theory and topological Poisson-Lie sigma model
Authors: Fernando Falceto and Krzysztof Gawedzki
Abstract: We study a boundary version of the gauged WZW model with a Poisson-Lie group G as the target. The Poisson-Lie structure of G is used to define the Wess-Zumino term of the action on surfaces with boundary. We clarify the relation of the model to the topological Poisson sigma model with the dual Poisson-Lie group G^* as the target and show that the phase space of the theory on a strip is essentially the Heisenberg double of G introduced by Semenov-Tian-Shansky
