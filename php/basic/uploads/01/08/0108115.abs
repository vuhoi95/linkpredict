Title: Unification and the Hierarchy from AdS5
Authors: Lisa Randall and Matthew D. Schwartz
Abstract: In AdS5, the coupling for bulk gauge bosons runs logarithmically, not as a power law. For this reason, one can preserve perturbative unification of couplings. Depending on the cutoff, this can occur at a high scale. We discuss subtleties in the calculation and present a regularization scheme motivated by the holographic correspondence. We find that generically, as in the standard model, the couplings almost unify. For specific choices of the cutoff and number of scalar multiplets, there is good agreement between the measured couplings and the assumption of high scale unification.
