Title: Ricci-flat Kahler Manifolds from Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Kiyoshi Higashijima and Tetsuji Kimura and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Using techniques of supersymmetric gauge theories, we present the Ricci-flat metrics on non-compact Kahler manifolds whose conical singularity is repaired by the Hermitian symmetric space. These manifolds can be identified as the complex line bundles over the Hermitian symmetric spaces. Each of the metrics contains a resolution parameter which controls the size of these base manifolds, and the conical singularity appears when the parameter vanishes.
