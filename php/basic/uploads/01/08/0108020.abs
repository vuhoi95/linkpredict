Abstract: The multidimensional gravity on the principal bundle with the SU(2) gauge group is considered. The numerical investigation of the spherically symmetric metrics with the center of symmetry is made. The solution of the gravitational equations depends on the boundary conditions of the ``SU(2) gauge potential'' (off-diagonal metric components) at the symmetry center and on the type of symmetry (symmetrical or antisymmetrical) of these potentials. In the chosen range of the boundary conditions it is shown that there are two types of solutions: wormhole-like and flux tube. The physical application of such kind of solutions as quantum handles in a spacetime foam is discussed.
