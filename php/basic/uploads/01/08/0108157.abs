Title: Finite size effects in boundary sine-Gordon theory
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs
Abstract: We examine the spectrum and boundary energy in boundary sine-Gordon theory, based on our recent results on the complete spectrum predicted by closing the boundary bootstrap. We check the spectrum and the reflection factors against truncated conformal space, together with a (still unpublished) prediction by Al.B. Zamolodchikov for the boundary energy and the relation between the parameters of the scattering amplitudes and of the perturbed CFT Hamiltonian. In addition, we give a derivation of Zamolodchikov's formulae. We find an entirely consistent picture and strong evidence for the validity of the conjectured spectrum and scattering amplitudes, which together give a complete description of the boundary sine-Gordon theory on mass shell.
