Title: Geometric Transitions and N=1 Quiver Theories
Authors: F. Cachazo and S. Katz and C. Vafa
Abstract: We construct N=1 supersymmetric theories on worldvolumes of D5 branes wrapped around 2-cycles of threefolds which are A-D-E fibrations over a plane. We propose large N duals as geometric transitions involving blowdowns of two cycles and blowups of three-cycles. This yields exact predictions for a large class of N=1 supersymmetric gauge systems including U(N) gauge theories with two adjoint matter fields deformed by superpotential terms, which arise in A-D-E fibered geometries with non-trivial monodromies.
