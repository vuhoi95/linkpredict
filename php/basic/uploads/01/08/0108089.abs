Title: Accelerated Unification
Authors: Nima Arkani-Hamed and Andrew Cohen and Howard Georgi
Abstract: We construct four dimensional gauge theories in which the successful supersymmetric unification of gauge couplings is preserved but accelerated by N-fold replication of the MSSM gauge and Higgs structure. This results in a low unification scale of $10^{13/N}$ TeV.
