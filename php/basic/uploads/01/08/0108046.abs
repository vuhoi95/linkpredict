Title: Symplectic connections, Noncommutative Yang Mills theory and  Supermembranes
Authors: I. Martin and A. Restuccia
Abstract: In built noncommutativity of supermembranes with central charges in eleven dimensions is disclosed. This result is used to construct an action for a noncommutative supermembrane where interesting topological terms appear. In order to do so, we first set up a global formulation for noncommutative Yang Mills theory over general symplectic manifolds. We make the above constructions following a pure geometrical procedure using the concept of connections over Weyl algebra bundles on symplectic manifolds. The relation between noncommutative and ordinary supermembrane actions is discussed.
