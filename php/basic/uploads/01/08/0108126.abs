Title: Open Strings in Simple Current Orbifolds
Authors: Keizo Matsubara and Volker Schomerus and Mikael Smedback
Abstract: We study branes and open strings in a large class of orbifolds of a curved background using microscopic techniques of boundary conformal field theory. In particular, we obtain factorizing operator product expansions of open string vertex operators for such branes. Applications include branes in Z2 orbifolds of the SU(2) WZW model and in the D-series of unitary minimal models considered previously by Runkel.
