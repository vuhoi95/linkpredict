Title: The Moyal-Lie Theory of Phase Space Quantum Mechanics
Authors: T. Hakioglu and A. Dragt
Abstract: A Lie algebraic approach to the unitary transformations in Weyl quantization is discussed. This approach, being formally equivalent to the $\star$-quantization, is an extension of the classical Poisson-Lie formalism which can be used as an efficient tool in the quantum phase space transformation theory.
