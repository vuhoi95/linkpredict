Title: CP^n, or, entanglement illustrated
Authors: I. Bengtsson and J. Braennlund and K. Zyczkowski
Abstract: We show that many topological and geometrical properties of complex projective space can be understood just by looking at a suitably constructed picture. The idea is to view CP^n as a set of flat tori parametrized by the positive octant of a round sphere. We pay particular attention to submanifolds of constant entanglement in CP^3 and give a few new results concerning them.
