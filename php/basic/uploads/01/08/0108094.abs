Abstract: We have recently suggested a quantum action, which has the form of a classical action and takes into account quantum effects via renormalized action parameters. Here we apply it to quantum chaos. We study a system in 2-D with weak anharmonic coupling ($V_{coupl} \propto x^{2}y^{2}$) being classically chaotic. We construct the quantum action at finite temperature. We compute Poincar\'e sections of the quantum action at that temperature and compare it with those of the classical action. We observe chaotic behavior in both cases.
