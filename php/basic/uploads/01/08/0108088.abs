Title: A General Expression for Symmetry Factors of Feynman Diagrams
Authors: C. D. Palmer and M. E. Carrington
Abstract: The calculation of the symmetry factor corresponding to a given Feynman diagram is well known to be a tedious problem. We have derived a simple formula for these symmetry factors. Our formula works for any diagram in scalar theory ($\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$ interactions), spinor QED, scalar QED, or QCD.
