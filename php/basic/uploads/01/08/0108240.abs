Title: When the Casimir energy is not a sum of zero-point energies
Authors: Luiz C. de Albuquerque and R. M. Cavalcanti
Abstract: We compute the leading radiative correction to the Casimir force between two parallel plates in the $\lambda\Phi^4$ theory. Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions are considered. A heuristic approach, in which the Casimir energy is computed as the sum of one-loop corrected zero-point energies, is shown to yield incorrect results, but we show how to amend it. The technique is then used in the case of periodic boundary conditions to construct a perturbative expansion which is free of infrared singularities in the massless limit. In this case we also compute the next-to-leading order radiative correction, which turns out to be proportional to $\lambda^{3/2}$.
