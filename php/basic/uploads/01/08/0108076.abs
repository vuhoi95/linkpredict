Title: A Two Fluid Description of the Quantum Hall Soliton
Authors: Ben Freivogel and Leonard Susskind and Nicolaos Toumbas
Abstract: We show that the Quantum Hall Soliton constructed in \cite{giantbob} is stable under small perturbations. We find that creating quasiparticles actually lowers the energy of the system, and discuss whether this indicates an instability on the time scales relevant to the problem.
