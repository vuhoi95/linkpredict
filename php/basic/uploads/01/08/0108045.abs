Abstract: We show that the noncommutative Yang-Mills field forms an irreducible representation of the (undeformed) Lie algebra of rigid translations, rotations and dilatations. The noncommutative Yang-Mills action is invariant under combined conformal transformations of the Yang-Mills field and of the noncommutativity parameter \theta. The Seiberg-Witten differential equation results from a covariant splitting of the combined conformal transformations and can be computed as the missing piece to complete a covariant conformal transformation to an invariance of the action.
