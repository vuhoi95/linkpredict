Title: Brane-induced supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Ferruccio Feruglio and Fabio Zwirner
Abstract: We study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking induced by brane-localized dynamics in five-dimensional supergravity compactified on S^1/Z_2. We consider a model with gravity in the bulk and matter localized on tensionless branes at the orbifold fixed points. We assume that the brane dynamics give rise to effective brane superpotentials that trigger the supersymmetry breaking. We analyze in detail the super-Higgs effect. We compute the full spectrum and show that the symmetry breaking is spontaneous but nonlocal in the fifth dimension. We demonstrate that the model can be interpreted as a new, non-trivial implementation of a coordinate-dependent Scherk-Schwarz compactification.
