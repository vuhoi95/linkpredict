Title: Cascade of Special Holonomy Manifolds and Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Katsuyuki Sugiyama and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate hetrotic string theory on special holonomy manifolds including exceptional holonomy G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. The gauge symmetry is F_4 in a G_2 manifold compactification, and so(9) in a Spin(7) manifold compactification. We also study the cascade of the holonomies: so(8) > Spin(7) > G_2 > su(3) > su(2). The differences of adjoining groups are described by Ising, tricritical Ising, 3-state Potts and u(1) models. These theories are essential for spacetime supersymmetries and gauge group enhancements. As concrete examples, we construct modular invariant partition functions and analyze their massless spectra for G_2 and Spin(7) orbifolds. We obtain the relation between topological numbers of the manifolds and multiplicities of matters in specific representations.
