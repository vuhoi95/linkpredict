Title: Reply on "Lifshitz-point critical behaviour to $O(Îµ_L^2)$"
Authors: Luiz C. de Albuquerque and Marcelo M. Leite
Abstract: We reply to a recent comment by H. W. Diehl and M. Shpot (cond-mat/0106502) criticizing our paper J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34 (2001) L327-332. We show that the approximation we use for evaluating higher-loop integrals is consistent with homogeneity. A new renormalization group approach is presented in order to compare the two methods with high-precision numerical data concerning the uniaxial case. We stress that the isotropic behaviour cannot be obtained from the anisotropic one.
