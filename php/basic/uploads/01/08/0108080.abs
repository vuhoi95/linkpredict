Title: D6-branes wrapping Kahler four-cycles
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Toni Mateos
Abstract: We construct supergravity duals of D6-branes wrapping Kahler four-cycles inside a Calabi-Yau threefold, CY_3. We obtain the purely gravitational M-theory description, which turns out to be a Calabi-Yau fourfold, CY_4. We also analyze the dynamics of a probe D6 in this background.
