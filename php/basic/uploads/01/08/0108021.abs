Title: Properties of Supersymmetric Integrable Systems of KP Type
Authors: Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: The recently proposed supersymmetric extensions of reduced Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) integrable hierarchies in $N =1,2$ superspace are shown to contain in the purely bosonic limit new types of ordinary non-supersymmetric integrable systems. The latter are coupled systems of several multi-component non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-like hierarchies whose basic nonlinear evolution equations contain additional quintic and higher-derivative nonlinear terms. Also, we obtain the N=2 supersymmetric extension of Toda chain model as Darboux-B{\"a}cklund orbit of the simplest reduced N=2 super-KP hierarchy and find its explicit solution.
