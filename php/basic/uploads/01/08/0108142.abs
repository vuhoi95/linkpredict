Title: D-Branes on a gauged WZW model
Authors: Shmuel Elitzur and Gor Sarkissian
Abstract: The algebraic classification of Cardy for boundary states on a $G/H$ coset CFT of a compact group G, is geometrically realized on the corresponding manifold resulting from gauging the WZW model. The branes consist of H orbits of quantized G conjugacy classes shifted by quantized H conjugacy classes.
