Title: From Supermembrane to Matrix String
Authors: Yasuhiro Sekino and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: We develop a systematic method of directly embedding supermembrane wrapped around a circle into matrix string theory. Our purpose is to study connection between matrix string and membrane from an entirely 11 dimensional point of view. The method does neither rely upon the DLCQ limit nor upon string dualities. In principle, this enables us to construct matrix string theory with arbitrary backgrounds from the corresponding supermembrane theory. As a simplest application of the formalism, the matrix-string action with a 7 brane background (Kaluza-Klein Melvin solution) with nontrivial RR vector field is given.
