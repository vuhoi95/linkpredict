Title: Causal Entropy Bound for Non-Singular Cosmologies
Authors: Ram Brustein and Stefano Foffa and Avraham E. Mayo
Abstract: The conditions for validity of the Causal Entropy Bound (CEB) are verified in the context of non-singular cosmologies with classical sources. It is shown that they are the same conditions that were previously found to guarantee validity of the CEB: the energy density of each dynamical component of the cosmic fluid needs to be sub-Planckian and not too negative, and its equation of state needs to be causal. In the examples we consider, the CEB is able to discriminate cosmologies which suffer from potential physical problems more reliably than the energy conditions appearing in singularity theorems.
