Title: Remarks on the canonical quantization of noncommutative theories
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: Free noncommutative fields constitute a natural and interesting example of constrained theories with higher derivatives. The quantization methods involving constraints in the higher derivative formalism can be nicely applied to these systems. We study real and complex free noncommutative scalar fields where momenta have an infinite number of terms. We show that these expressions can be summed in a closed way and lead to a set of Dirac brackets which matches the usual corresponding brackets of the commutative case.
