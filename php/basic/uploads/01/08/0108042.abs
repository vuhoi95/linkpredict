Title: N_T=4 equivariant extension of the 3D topological model of Blau and  Thompson
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Dietmar MÃ¼lsch
Abstract: The Blau-Thompson N_T=2, D=3 nonequivariant topological model is extended to a N_T=4, D=3 topological theory. The latter, formally, may be regarded as a topological deformation of the N_T=2, D=4 Yamrom-Vafa-Witten theory after dimensional reduction to D=3. For completeness, also the dimensional reduction of the half-twisted N_T=2, D=4 Yamron model is explicitly constructed.
