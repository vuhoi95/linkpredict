Title: A brane in five-dimensional Minkowski space
Authors: J. Avery and R. Mahurin and G. Siopsis
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravity in five-dimensional Minkowski space in the presence of a four-dimensional brane. We show that there exists a solution to the wave equation that leads to a propagator exhibiting four-dimensional behavior at low energies (long distances) with five-dimensional effects showing up as corrections at high energies (short distances). We compare our results with propagators derived in previous analyses exhibiting five-dimensional behavior at low energies. We show that different solutions correspond to different physical systems.
