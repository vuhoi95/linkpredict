Title: Quantum Field Theory and Unification in AdS5
Authors: Lisa Randall and Matthew D. Schwartz
Abstract: We consider gauge bosons in the bulk of AdS5 in a two-brane theory that addresses the hierarchy problem. We show such a theory can be consistent with gauge coupling unification at a high scale. We discuss subtleties in this calculation and show how to regulate consistently in a bounded AdS5 background. Our regularization is guided by the holographic dual of the calculation.
