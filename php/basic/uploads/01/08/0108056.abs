Title: Semiclassical instability of the brane-world: Randall-Sundrum bubbles
Authors: Daisuke Ida and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Hirotaka Ochiai
Abstract: We discuss the semiclassical instability of the Randall-Sundrum brane-world model against a creation of a kind of Kaluza-Klein bubble. An example describing such a bubble space-time is constructed from the five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild metric. The induced geometry of the brane looks like the Einstein-Rosen bridge, which connects the positive and the negative tension branes. The bubble rapidly expands and there also form a trapped region around it.
