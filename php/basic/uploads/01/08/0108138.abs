Title: Towards the String representation of the dual Abelian Higgs model beyond  the London limit
Authors: Yoshiaki Koma and Miho Koma and Dietmar Ebert and Hiroshi Toki
Abstract: We perform a path-integral analysis of the string representation of the dual Abelian Higgs (DAH) model beyond the London limit, where the string describing the vortex of a flux tube has a finite thickness. We show that besides an additional vortex core contribution to the string tension, a modified Yukawa interaction appears as a boundary contribution in the type-II dual superconducting vacuum. In the London limit, the modified Yukawa interaction is reduced to the Yukawa one.
