Title: The critical dimension of bosonic string theory in AdS space-time
Authors: Ian Davies and Paul Mansfield
Abstract: The Polyakov bosonic string is quantised in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space-time using functional methods. Regularisation of the functional determinants using both heat-kernel and zeta function techniques shows that the AdS_{D+1} string reduces to the Liouville field theory, as in the flat space-time case. A Feynman graph expansion is used to evaluate (approximately) the coefficient multiplying the Liouville action; this then gives the critical dimension for this space-time as 22 (that is, 21 flat directions plus one radial direction).
