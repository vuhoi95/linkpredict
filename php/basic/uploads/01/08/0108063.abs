Title: Parafermionic quasi-particle basis and fermionic-type characters
Authors: P. Jacob and P. Mathieu
Abstract: A new basis of states for highest-weight modules in $\ZZ_k$ parafermionic conformal theories is displayed. It is formulated in terms of an effective exclusion principle constraining strings of $k$ fundamental parafermionic modes. The states of a module are then built by a simple filling process, with no singular-vector subtractions. That results in fermionic-sum representations of the characters, which are exactly the Lepowsky-Primc expressions. We also stress that the underlying combinatorics -- which is the one pertaining to the Andrews-Gordon identities -- has a remarkably natural parafermionic interpretation.
