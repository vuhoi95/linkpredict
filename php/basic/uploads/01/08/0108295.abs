Title: Non-Critical Liouville String Escapes Constraints on Generic Models of  Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that generic models of quantum gravity must contend with severe phenomenological constraints imposed by gravitational Cerenkov radiation, neutrino oscillations and the cosmic microwave background radiation. We show how the non-critical Liouville-string model of quantum gravity we have proposed escapes these constraints. It gives energetic particles subluminal velocities, obviating the danger of gravitational Cerenkov radiation. The effect on neutrino propagation is naturally flavour-independent, obviating any impact on oscillation phenomenology. Deviations from the expected black-body spectrum and the effects of time delays and stochastic fluctuations in the propagation of cosmic microwave background photons are negligible, as are their effects on observable spectral lines from high-redshift astrophysical objects.
