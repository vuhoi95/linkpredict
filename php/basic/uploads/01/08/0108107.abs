Title: On Quantum - Classical Correspondence for Baker's Map
Authors: K. Inoue and M. Ohya and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: Quantum baker`s map is a model of chaotic system. We study quantum dynamics for the quantum baker's map. We use the Schack and Caves symbolic description of the quantum baker`s map. We find an exact expression for the expectation value of the time dependent position operator. A relation between quantum and classical trajectories is investigated. Breakdown of the quantum-classical correspondence at the logarithmic timescale is rigorously established.
