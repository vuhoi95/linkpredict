Title: Searching for string theories of the standard model
Authors: D. Bailin and G. V. Kraniotis and A. Love
Abstract: We briefly review attempts to construct string theories that yield the standard model, concentrating on models with a geometric interpretation. Calabi-Yau compactifications are discussed in the context of both the weakly coupled heterotic string and the strongly coupled version, heterotic M-theory. Similarly, we consider orbifold compactifications of weakly coupled heterotic theory and of Type II theories in the presence of D-branes. The latter allows a "bottom-up" construction that so far seems the most natural and direct route to the standard model.
