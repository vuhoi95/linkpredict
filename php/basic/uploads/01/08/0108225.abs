Abstract: We describe a simple and predictive scenario for baryogenesis in theories with large extra dimensions which resembles Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. The Affleck-Dine field is a complex scalar field carrying a $U(1)_{\chi}$ charge which is dynamically broken after the end of inflation. This generates an excess of $\chi$ over $\bar \chi$, which then decays into Standard Model fermions to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. Our model is very constrained because the Affleck-Dine field has to be sufficiently flat during inflation. It is also a source for density fluctuations which can be tested in the coming satellite and balloon experiments.
