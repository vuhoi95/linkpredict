Title: The non-abelian open superstring effective action through order  $Î±'{}^3$
Authors: Paul Koerber and Alexander Sevrin
Abstract: Using the method developed in {\tt hep-th/0103015}, we determine the non-abelian Born-Infeld action through ${\cal O}(\alpha'{}^3)$. We start from solutions to a Yang-Mills theory which define a stable holomorphic vector bundle. Subsequently we investigate its deformation away from this limit. Through $ {\cal O}(\alpha'{}^2)$, a unique, modulo field redefinitions, solution emerges. At $ {\cal O}(\alpha'{}^3)$ we find a one-parameter family of allowed deformations. The presence of derivative terms turns out to be essential. Finally, we present a detailed comparison of our results to existing, partial results.
