Title: Anisotropic Lifshitz Point at $O(Îµ_L^2)$
Authors: Luiz C. de Albuquerque and Marcelo M. Leite
Abstract: We present the critical exponents $\nu_{L2}$, $\eta_{L2}$ and $\gamma_{L}$ for an $m$-axial Lifshitz point at second order in an $\epsilon_{L}$ expansion. We introduced a constraint involving the loop momenta along the $m$-dimensional subspace in order to perform two- and three-loop integrals. The results are valid in the range $0 \leq m < d$. The case $m=0$ corresponds to the usual Ising-like critical behavior.
