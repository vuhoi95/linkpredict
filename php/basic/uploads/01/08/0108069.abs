Title: D-Brane Scattering of N=2 Strings
Authors: K. Juenemann and Bernd Spendig
Abstract: The amplitudes for emission and scattering of N=2 strings off D-branes are calculated. We consider in detail the amplitudes <cc> and <occ> for the different types of D-branes. For some D-branes we find massive poles in the scattering spectrum that are absent in the ordinary N=2 spectrum.
