Title: Divergences in Kaluza-Klein Models and their String Regularization
Authors: D. M. Ghilencea and H. P. Nilles and S. Stieberger
Abstract: Effective field theories with (large) extra dimensions are studied within a physical regularization scheme provided by string theory. Explicit string calculations then allow us to consistently analyze the ultraviolet sensitivity of Kaluza--Klein theories in the presence or absence of low energy supersymmetry.
