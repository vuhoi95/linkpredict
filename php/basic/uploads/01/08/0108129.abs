Title: Axially Symmetric Monopoles and Black Holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs  Theory
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We investigate static axially symmetric monopole and black hole solutions with magnetic charge n > 1 in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. For vanishing and small Higgs selfcoupling, multimonopole solutions are gravitationally bound. Their mass per unit charge is lower than the mass of the n=1 monopole. For large Higgs selfcoupling only a repulsive phase exists. The static axially symmetric hairy black hole solutions possess a deformed horizon with constant surface gravity. We consider their properties in the isolated horizon framework, interpreting them as bound states of monopoles and black holes. Representing counterexamples to the ``no-hair'' conjecture, these black holes are neither uniquely characterized by their horizon area and horizon charge.
