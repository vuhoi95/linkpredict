Title: Boundary Conditions as Mass Generation Mechanism for Real Scalar Fields
Authors: Jose Alexandre Nogueira and Pedro Leite Barbieri
Abstract: We consider the effects of homogeneous Dirichlet's boundary conditions on two infinite parallel plane surfaces separated by a small distance {\it a}. We find that although spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur for the theory of a massless, quartically self-interacting real scalar field, the theory becomes a theory of a massive scalar field.
