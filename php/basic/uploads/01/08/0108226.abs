Title: On Spin(7) holonomy metric based on SU(3)/U(1)
Authors: Hiroaki Kanno and Yukinori Yasui
Abstract: We investigate the $Spin(7)$ holonomy metric of cohomogeneity one with the principal orbit $SU(3)/U(1)$. A choice of U(1) in the two dimensional Cartan subalgebra is left as free and this allows manifest $\Sigma_3=W(SU(3))$ (= the Weyl group) symmetric formulation. We find asymptotically locally conical (ALC) metrics as octonionic gravitational instantons. These ALC metrics have orbifold singularities in general, but a particular choice of the U(1) subgroup gives a new regular metric of $Spin(7)$ holonomy. Complex projective space ${\bf CP}(2)$ that is a supersymmetric four-cycle appears as a singular orbit. A perturbative analysis of the solution near the singular orbit shows an evidence of a more general family of ALC solutions. The global topology of the manifold depends on a choice of the U(1) subgroup. We also obtain an $L^2$-normalisable harmonic 4-form in the background of the ALC metric.
