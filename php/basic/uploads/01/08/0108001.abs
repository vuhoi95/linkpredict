Title: Boundary States for D-branes in $AdS_3$
Authors: Arvind Rajaraman and Moshe Rozali
Abstract: We construct boundary states representing D-strings in $AdS_3$. These wrap twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2,R), and the boundary states are therefore based on continuous representations only. We check Cardy's condition and find a consistent open string spectrum. The open string spectrum on all the D-branes is the same.
