Title: Two Loops to Two Loops in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Jan Plefka and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We present a full two-loop O(g^6) perturbative field theoretic calculation of the expectation value of two circular Maldacena-Wilson loops in D=4 N=4 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory. It is demonstrated that, after taking into account very subtle cancellations of bulk and boundary divergences, the result is completely finite without any renormalization. As opposed to previous lower order calculations existing in the literature, internal vertex diagrams no longer cancel identically and lead to subleading corrections to the dominant ladder diagrams. Taking limits, we proceed to extract the two-loop static potential corresponding to two infinite anti-parallel lines. Our result gives some evidence that the existing strong-coupling calculations using the AdS/CFT conjecture might sum up the full set of large N planar Feynman diagrams.
