Title: Simple Brane World Scenario with Positive Five Dimensional Cosmological  Constant
Authors: Shoko Hayakawa and Takayuki Hirayama and Ryuichiro Kitano
Abstract: We present a simple brane-world model in five dimensions. In this model we do not need any fine-tuning between the five dimensional cosmological constant and the brane tension to obtain four dimensional flat Minkowski space. The space-time of our solution has no naked singularities. Further the compactification scale of the fifth direction is automatically determined.
