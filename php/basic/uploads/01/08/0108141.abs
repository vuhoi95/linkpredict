Title: The zeros of the QCD partition function
Authors: A. D. Jackson and C. B. Lang and M. Oswald and K. Splittorff
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the zeros of the partition function in the complex mass plane and the spectral properties of the Dirac operator in QCD. This relation is derived within the context of chiral Random Matrix Theory and applies to QCD when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Further, we introduce and examine the concept of normal modes in chiral spectra. Using this formalism we study the consequences of a finite Thouless energy for the zeros of the partition function. This leads to the demonstration that certain features of the QCD partition function are universal.
