Title: Pair creation and axial anomaly in light-cone $QED_2$
Authors: T. N. Tomaras and N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: The 1+1 dimensional massive Dirac equation is solved exactly in light-cone coordinates for $x^+ > 0$ and $x^- > -L$, in the presence of an arbitrary $x^+$ dependent electric field. Our solution resolves the ambiguity at $p^+ = 0$. We also obtain the one loop rate for pair production for a positive electric field, compute the expectation values of the vector and axial vector currents, and recover the well known anomaly $e^2 E/\pi$ in the divergence of the latter. A final intriguing result is that the theory seems to exhibit a phase transition in the limit of infinite $L$.
