Abstract: A new approach towards the composite structure of quarks and leptons in the context of the higher dimensional unified theories is proposed. Owing to the certain strong dynamics, much like an ordinary QCD, every possible vectorlike multiplets of composites appear in higher dimensional bulk space-time, however, through a proper Sherk-Schwarz compactification only chiral set of composite quarks and leptons survive as the massless states in four dimensions. In this scenario restrictions related with the 't Hooft's anomaly matching condition are turned out to be avoided and, as a result, the composite models look rather simple and economic. We demonstrate our approach by an explicit construction of model of preons and their composites unified in the supersymmetric SU(5) GUT in five space-time dimensions. The model predicts exactly three families of the composite quarks and leptons being the triplets of the chiral horizontal symmetry SU(3)_h which automatically appears in the composite spectrum when going to ordinary four dimensions.
