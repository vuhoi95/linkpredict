Title: Quiver Theories from D6-branes via Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Amer Iqbal
Abstract: We study N=1 four dimensional quiver theories arising on the worldvolume of D3-branes at del Pezzo singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We argue that under local mirror symmetry D3-branes become D6-branes wrapped on a three torus in the mirror manifold. The type IIB (p,q) 5-brane web description of the local del Pezzo, being closely related to the geometry of its mirror manifold, encodes the geometry of 3-cycles and is used to obtain gauge groups, quiver diagrams and the charges of the fractional branes.
