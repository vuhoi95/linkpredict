Title: Generalized Continuity Equation and Modified Normalization in  PT-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: B. Bagchi and C. Quesne and M. Znojil
Abstract: The continuity equation relating the change in time of the position probability density to the gradient of the probability current density is generalized to PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. The normalization condition of eigenfunctions is modified in accordance with this new conservation law and illustrated with some detailed examples.
