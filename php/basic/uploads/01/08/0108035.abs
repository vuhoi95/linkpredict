Title: Trace formulas for Annuli
Authors: A. N. Schellekens and Ya. S. Stanev
Abstract: Assuming the completeness condition for boundaries we derive trace formulas for the annulus coefficients in 2-dimensional conformal field theory. We also derive polynomial equations that relate the annulus, Moebius and Klein bottle coefficients, and conjecture an annulus trace formula that is sensitive to the orientation of the boundaries.
