Title: Remarks on the Warped Deformed Conifold
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Igor R. Klebanov and Peter Ouyang
Abstract: We assemble a few remarks on the supergravity solution of hep-th/0007191, whose UV asymptotic form was previously found in hep-th/0002159. First, by normalizing the R-R fluxes, we compare the logarithmic flow of couplings in supergravity with that in field theory, and find exact agreement. We also write the 3-form field strength $G_3 = F_3 - \tau H_3$ present in the solution in a manifestly SO(4) invariant (2,1) form. In addition, we discuss various issues related to the chiral symmetry breaking and wrapped branes.
