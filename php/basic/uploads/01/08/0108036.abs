Title: Quantum corrections for BTZ black hole via 2D reduced model
Authors: Maja Buric and Marija Dimitrijevic and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: The one-loop quantum corrections for BTZ black hole are considered using the dimensionally reduced 2D model. Cases of 3D minimal and conformal coupling are analyzed. Two cases are considered: minimally coupled and conformally coupled 3D scalar matter. In the minimal case, the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacuum states are defined and the corresponding semiclassical corrections of the geometry are found. The calculations are done for the conformal case too, in order to make the comparison with the exact results obtained previously in the special case of spinless black hole. Beside that we find exact corrections for AdS black hole for 2D minimally coupled scalar field in the Hatrle-Hawking and Boulware state
