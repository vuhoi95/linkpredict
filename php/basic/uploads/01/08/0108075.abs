Title: Don't Panic! Closed String Tachyons in ALE Spacetimes
Authors: A. Adams and J. Polchinski and E. Silverstein
Abstract: We consider closed string tachyons localized at the fixed points of noncompact nonsupersymmetric orbifolds. We argue that tachyon condensation drives these orbifolds to flat space or supersymmetric ALE spaces. The decay proceeds via an expanding shell of dilaton gradients and curvature which interpolates between two regions of distinct angular geometry. The string coupling remains weak throughout. For small tachyon VEVs, evidence comes from quiver theories on D-branes probes, in which deformations by twisted couplings smoothly connect non-supersymmetric orbifolds to supersymmetric orbifolds of reduced order. For large tachyon VEVs, evidence comes from worldsheet RG flow and spacetime gravity. For $\IC^2/\IZ_n$, we exhibit infinite sequences of transitions producing SUSY ALE spaces via twisted closed string condensation from non-supersymmetric ALE spaces. In a $T$-dual description this provides a mechanism for creating NS5-branes via {\it closed} string tachyon condensation similar to the creation of D-branes via {\it open} string tachyon condensation. We also apply our results to recent duality conjectures involving fluxbranes and the type 0 string.
