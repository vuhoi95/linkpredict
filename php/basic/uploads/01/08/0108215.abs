Title: Brane-World Cosmology, Bulk Scalars and Perturbations
Authors: P. Brax and C. van de Bruck and A. C. Davis
Abstract: We investigate aspects of cosmology in brane world theories with a bulk scalar field. We concentrate on a recent model motivated from supergravity in singular spaces. After discussing the background evolution of such a brane-world, we present the evolution of the density contrast. We compare our results to those obtained in the (second) Randall-Sundrum scenario and usual 4D scalar-tensor theories.
