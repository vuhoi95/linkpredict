Title: Large-N behaviors of the IIB matrix model and the regularized Schild  models
Authors: Naofumi Kitsunezaki and Shozo Uehara
Abstract: We evaluate $N$ dependences of correlation functions in the bosonic part of the IIB matrix model by the Monte Carlo method. We also evaluate those in two sorts of regularized Schild models and find that the $N$ dependences are different from those in the matrix model. In particular, the distribution of the eigenvalues are logarithmically divergent in the regularized Schild model when $g^2N$ is fixed.
