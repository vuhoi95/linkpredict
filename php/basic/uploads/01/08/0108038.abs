Title: Algorithmic Complexity in Cosmology and Quantum Gravity
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and D. Singleton
Abstract: In this article we use the idea of algorithmic complexity (AC) to study various cosmological scenarios, and as a means of quantizing the gravitational interaction. We look at 5D and 7D cosmological models where the Universe begins as a higher dimensional Planck size spacetime which fluctuates between Euclidean and Lorentzian signatures. These fluctuations are governed by the AC of the two different signatures. At some point a transition to a 4D Lorentzian signature Universe occurs, with the extra dimensions becoming ``frozen'' or non-dynamical. We also apply the idea of algorithmic complexity to study composite wormholes, the entropy of blackholes, and the path integral for quantum gravity.
