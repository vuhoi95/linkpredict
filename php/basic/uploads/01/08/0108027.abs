Title: On the Space Time of a Galaxy
Authors: T. Matos and F. S. Guzman
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the averaged Einstein's field equations in the presence of two real scalar fields and a component of dust with spherical symmetry. We suggest that the space-time found provides the characteristics required by a galactic model that could explain the supermassive central object and the dark matter halo at once, since one of the fields constitutes a central oscillaton surrounded by the dust and the other scalar field distributes far from the coordinate center and can be interpreted as a halo. We show the behavior of the rotation curves all along the background. Thus, the solution could be a first approximation of a ``long exposition photograph'' of a galaxy.
