Title: Putting Liouville String Models of (Quantum) Gravity to Test
Authors: Elias Gravanis and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: Critical String Theory is by definition an $S$-matrix theory. In this sense, (quantum) gravity situations where a unitary $S$-matrix may not be a well-defined concept, as a consequence of the existence of macroscopic (global) or microscopic (local) gravitational fluctuations with event horizons, present a challenge to string theory. In this article, we take some modest steps in suggesting alternative treatments of such cases via non-critical (Liouville) strings,which do not have a well-defined S matrix, but for which a superscattering \$ matrix is mathematically consistent. After a brief review of the underlying mathematical formalism, we consider a specific stringy model of induced non-criticality, with dynamical formation of horizons, associated with the recoil of a D-particle defect, embedded in our four-dimensional space time, during its scattering with a (macroscopic) number of closed string states. We study in detail the associated spacetime distortion in the neighbourhood of the defect, which has the form of a finite-radius curved `bubble', matched with a Minkowskian space-time in the exterior. As a consequence of the non-criticality of the underlying sigma-model, the space time is unstable, and has non-trivial stochastic properties: thermal properties due to its ``Rindler accelerating nature'', and entropy growth for an asymptotic observer, associated with information being carried away by the `recoil' degrees of freedom. We also discuss phenomenological (and cosmological) constraints on the model.
