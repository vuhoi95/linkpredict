Title: A Canonical Approach to the Quantization of the Damped Harmonic  Oscillator
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: We provide a new canonical approach for studying the quantum mechanical damped harmonic oscillator based on the doubling of degrees of freedom approach. Explicit expressions for Lagrangians of the elementary modes of the problem, characterising both forward and backward time propagations are given. A Hamiltonian analysis, showing the equivalence with the Lagrangian approach, is also done. Based on this Hamiltonian analysis, the quantization of the model is discussed.
