Title: A String Bit Hamiltonian Approach to Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
Authors: B. Durhuus and C. -W. H. Lee
Abstract: Motivated by the formalism of string bit models, or quantum matrix models, we study a class of simple Hamiltonian models of quantum gravity type in two space-time dimensions. These string bit models are special cases of a more abstract class of models defined in terms of the sl(2) subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. They turn out to be solvable and their scaling limit coincides in special cases with known transfer matrix models of two-dimensional quantum gravity.
