Title: On the Integrability of Classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model of  $BC_{2}$ Type
Authors: V. I. Inozemtsev and R. Sasaki
Abstract: The problem of finding most general form of the classical integrable relativistic models of many-body interaction of the $BC_{n}$ type is considered. In the simplest nontrivial case of $n=2$,the extra integral of motion is presented in explicit form within the ansatz similar to the nonrelativistic Calogero-Moser models. The resulting Hamiltonian has been found by solving the set of two functional equations.
