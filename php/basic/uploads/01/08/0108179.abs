Title: BPS Walls and Junctions in SUSY Nonlinear Sigma Models
Authors: Masashi Naganuma and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: BPS walls and junctions are studied in ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY nonlinear sigma models in four spacetime dimensions. New BPS junction solutions connecting N discrete vacua are found for nonlinear sigma models with several chiral scalar superfields. A nonlinear sigma model with a single chiral scalar superfield is also found which has a moduli space of the topology of $S^1$ and admits BPS walls and junctions connecting arbitrary points in moduli space. SUSY condition in nonlinear sigma models are classified either as stationary points of superpotential or singularities of the K\"ahler metric in field space. The total number of SUSY vacua is invariant under holomorphic field redefinitions if we count ``runaway vacua'' also.
