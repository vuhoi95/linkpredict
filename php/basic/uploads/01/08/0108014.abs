Title: The Geometric Construction of WZW Effective Action in Non-commutative  Manifold
Authors: Boyu Hou and Yongqiang Wang and Zhanying Yang and Ruihong Yue
Abstract: By constructing close one cochain density ${\Omega^1}_{2n}$ in the gauge group space we get WZW effective Lagrangian on high dimensional non-commutative space.Especially consistent anomalies derived from this WZW effective action in non-commutative four-dimensional space coincides with those by L.Bonora etc.
