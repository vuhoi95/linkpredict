Title: Topological String Defect Formation During the Chiral Phase Transition
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and S. Digal
Abstract: We extend and generalize the seminal work of Brandenberger, Huang and Zhang on the formation of strings during chiral phase transitions(berger) and discuss the formation of abelian and non-abelian topological strings during such transitions in the early Universe and in the high energy heavy-ion collisions. Chiral symmetry as well as deconfinement are restored in the core of these defects. Formation of a dense network of string defects is likely to play an important role in the dynamics following the chiral phase transition. We speculate that such a network can give rise to non-azimuthal distribution of transverse energy in heavy-ion collisions.
