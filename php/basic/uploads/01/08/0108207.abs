Title: Junctions of Supersymmetric Tubes
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Sang-Woo Kim
Abstract: We begin by reviewing the noncommutative supersymmetric tubular configurations in the matrix theory. We identify the worldvolume gauge fields, the charges and the moment of R-R charges carried by the tube. We also study the fluctuations around many tubes and tube-D0 systems. Based on the supersymmetric tubes, we have constructed more general configurations that approach supersymmetric tubes asymptotically. These include a bend with angle and a junction that connects two tubes to one. The junction may be interpreted as a finite-energy domain wall that interpolates U(1) and U(2) worldvolume gauge theories. We also construct a tube along which the noncommutativity scale changes. Relying upon these basic units of operations, one may build physical configurations corresponding to any shape of Riemann surfaces of arbitrary topology. Variations of the noncommutativity scale are allowed over the Riemann surfaces. Particularly simple such configurations are Y-shaped junctions.
