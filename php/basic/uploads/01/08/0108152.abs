Title: D-brane Charges in Five-brane backgrounds
Authors: Juan Maldacena and Gregory Moore and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We discuss the discrete Z_k D-brane charges (twisted K-theory charges) in five-brane backgrounds from several different points of view. In particular, we interpret it as a result of a standard Higgs mechanism. We show that certain degrees of freedom (singletons) on the boundary of space can extend the corresponding Z_k symmetry to U(1). Related ideas clarify the role of AdS singletons in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
