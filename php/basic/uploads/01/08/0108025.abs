Title: RS1, Higher Derivatives and Stability
Authors: Adam Lewandowski and Raman Sundrum
Abstract: We demonstrate the classical stability of the weak/Planck hierarchy within the Randall-Sundrum scenario, incorporating the Goldberger-Wise mechanism and higher-derivative interactions in a systematic perturbative expansion. Such higher-derivative interactions are expected if the RS model is the low-energy description of some more fundamental theory. Generically, higher derivatives lead to ill-defined singularities in the vicinity of effective field theory branes. These are carefully treated by the methods of classical renormalization.
