Title: Generalized BF Theory in Superspace as Underlying Theory of 11D  Supergravity
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We construct a generalized BF theory in superspace that can embed eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. Our topological BF theory can accommodate all the necessary Bianchi identities for teleparallel superspace supergravity in eleven-dimensions, as the simplest but nontrivial solutions to superfield equations for our superspace action. This indicates that our theory may have solutions other than eleven-dimensional supergravity, accommodating generalized theories of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Therefore our topological theory can be a good candidate for the low energy limit of M-theory, as an underlying fundamental theory providing a `missing link' between eleven-dimensional supergravity and M-theory.
