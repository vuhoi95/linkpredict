Title: Quantum gravitational corrections to black hole geometries
Authors: Marco Cavaglia and Alessandro Fabbri
Abstract: We calculate perturbative quantum gravity corrections to eternal two-dimensional black holes. We estimate the leading corrections to the AdS_2 black hole entropy and determine the quantum modification of N-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime.
