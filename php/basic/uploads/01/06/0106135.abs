Title: Bosonic realization of algebras in the Calogero model
Authors: Larisa Jonke and Stjepan Meljanac
Abstract: We study an N-body Calogero model in the S_N-symmetric subspace of the positive definite Fock space. We construct a new algebra of S_N-symmetric operators represented on the symmetric Fock space, and find a natural orthogonal basis by mapping the algebra onto the Heisenberg algebra. Our main result is the bosonic realization of nonlinear symmetry algebra describing the structure of degenerate levels of Calogero model.
