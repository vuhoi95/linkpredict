Title: Off-Shell Formulation of Supergravity on Orbifold
Authors: Tomoyuki Fujita and Taichiro Kugo and Keisuke Ohashi
Abstract: An off-shell formulation is given for the ``supersymmetry in singular spaces'' which has recently been developed in an on-shell formalism by Bergshoeff, Kallosh and Van Proeyen using supersymmetry singlet `coupling constant' field and 4-form multiplier field in five-dimensional space-time. We present this formulation for a general supergravity-Yang-Mills-hypermultiplet coupled system compactified on an orbifold $S^1/Z_2$. Relations between the bulk cosmological constant and brane tensions of the boundary planes are discussed.
