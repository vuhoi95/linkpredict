Title: Gauge theory of second class constraints without extra variables
Authors: Igor Batalin and Robert Marnelius
Abstract: We show that any theory with second class constraints may be cast into a gauge theory if one makes use of solutions of the constraints expressed in terms of the coordinates of the original phase space. We perform a Lagrangian path integral quantization of the resulting gauge theory and show that the natural measure follows from a superfield formulation.
