Title: Supersymmetric theories with compact extra dimensions in N=1 superfields
Authors: Daniel Marti and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: We present an N=1 superfield formulation of supersymmetric gauge theories with a compact extra dimension. The formulation incorporates the radion superfield and allows to write supersymmetric theories on warped gravitational backgrounds. We apply it to study the breaking of supersymmetry by the F-term of the radion, and show that, for flat extra dimensions, this leads to the same mass spectrum as in Scherk-Schwarz models of supersymmetry breaking. We also consider scenarios where supersymmetry is broken on a boundary of a warped extra dimension and compare them with anomaly mediated models.
