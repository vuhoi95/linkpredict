Title: Dilatonic monopoles and ''hairy'' black holes
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We study gravitating monopoles and non-abelian black holes of SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory coupled to a massless dilaton. The domain of existence of these solutions decreases with increasing dilaton coupling constant. The critical solutions of this system are Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton solutions.
