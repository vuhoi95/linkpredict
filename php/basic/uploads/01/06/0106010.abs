Title: Vacuum String Field Theory
Authors: Leonardo Rastelli and Ashoke Sen and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: This is a brief review of vacuum string field theory, a new approach to open string field theory based on the stable vacuum of the tachyon. We discuss the sliver state explaining its role as a projector in the space of half-string functionals. We review the construction of D-brane solutions in vacuum string field theory, both in the algebraic approach and in the more general geometrical approach that emphasizes the role of boundary CFT. -- To appear in the Proceedings of Strings 2001, Mumbai, India.
