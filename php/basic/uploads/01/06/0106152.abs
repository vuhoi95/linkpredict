Title: Hidden symmetry and knot solitons in a charged two-condensate Bose  system
Authors: Egor Babaev and Ludvig D. Faddeev and Antti J. Niemi
Abstract: We show that a charged two-condensate Ginzburg-Landau model or equivalently a Gross-Pitaevskii functional for two charged Bose condensates, can be mapped onto a version of the nonlinear O(3) $\sigma$-model. This implies in particular that such a system possesses a hidden O(3) symmetry and allows for the formation of stable knotted solitons. The results, in particular, should be relevant to the superconducting MgB_2.
