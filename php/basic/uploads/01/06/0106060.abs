Title: Flat Directions in Left-Right Symmetric String Derived Models
Authors: Gerald B. Cleaver and David J. Clements and Alon E. Faraggi
Abstract: The only string models known to reproduce the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in the low energy effective field theory are those constructed in the free fermionic formulation. We demonstrate the existence of quasi-realistic free fermionic heterotic-string models in which supersymmetric singlet flat directions do not exist. This raises the possibility that supersymmetry is broken perturbatively in such models by the one-loop Fayet-Iliopoulos term. We show, however, that supersymmetric flat directions that utilize VEVs of some non-Abelian fields in the massless string spectrum do exist in the model. We argue that hidden sector condensates lift the flat directions and break supersymmetry hierarchically.
