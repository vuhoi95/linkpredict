Abstract: We develop a technique of construction of integrable models with a Z_2 grading of both the auxiliary (chain) and quantum (time) spaces. These models have a staggered disposition of the anisotropy parameter. The corresponding Yang-Baxter Equations are written down and their solution for the gl(N) case are found. We analyze in details the N=2 case and find the corresponding quantum group behind this solution. It can be regarded as quantum U_{q,B}(gl(2)) group with a matrix deformation parameter qB with (qB)^2=q^2. The symmetry behind these models can also be interpreted as the tensor product of the (-1)-Weyl algebra by an extension of U_q(gl(N)) with a Cartan generator related to deformation parameter -1.
