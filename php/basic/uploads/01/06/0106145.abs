Title: Massive vector trapping as a gauge boson on a brane
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Akihiro Nakamura
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to trap massive vector fields as a photon on the Randall-Sundrum brane embedded in the five dimensional AdS space. This localization-mechanism of the photon is realized by considering a brane action, to which a quadratic potential of the bulk-vector fields is added. We also point out that this potential gives several constraints on the fluctuations of the vector fields in the bulk space.
