Title: Causal Approach to Supersymmetry: Chiral Superfields
Authors: Florin Constantinescu and Gunter Scharf
Abstract: We construct quantized free superfields and represent them as operator-valued distributions in Fock space starting with Majorana fields. The perturbative construction of the S-matrix for interacting theories is carried through by extending the causal method of Epstein and Glaser to superspace. We propose a scaling and singular order of distributions in superspace by a procedure which scales both commutative and non-commutative variables. Using this singular order the chiral (Wess-Zumino) model appears to be super-renormalizable.
