Title: A Supernova Brane Scan
Authors: P. P. Avelino and C. J. A. P. Martins
Abstract: We consider a `brane-world scenario' recently introduced by Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati, and subsequently proposed as an alternative to a cosmological constant in explaining the current acceleration of the universe. We show that, contrary to these claims, this proposal is already strongly disfavoured by the available Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Microwave Background and cluster data.
