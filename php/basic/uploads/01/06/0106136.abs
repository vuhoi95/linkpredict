Title: Aspects of noncommutative descriptions of planar systems in high  magnetic fields
Authors: C. D. Fosco and A. Lopez
Abstract: We study some aspects of recent proposals to use the noncommutative Chern-Simons theory as an effective description of some planar condensed matter models in strong magnetic fields, such as the Quantum Hall Effect. We present an alternative justification for such a description, which may be extended to other planar systems where a uniform magnetic field is present.
