Title: 1/N corrections to anomalies and the AdS/CFT correspondence for  orientifolded N=2 orbifold and N=1 conifold models
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Howard J. Schnitzer and Niclas Wyllard
Abstract: We show that for a large class of d=4 N=2 conformal field theories the 1/N correction to the chiral anomaly of the U(1) R-current can be shown to arise from the D7-branes present in the dual orientifolded orbifold string theories, generalizing a result in the literature for the simplest case. We also study the U(1)_R anomaly for d=4 N=1 conformal field theories that arise from orientifolds of the conifold. We find agreement between the field- and string-theoretic calculations, confirming a prediction of the AdS/CFT correspondence at order 1/N for string theories on AdS_5 x T^{11}/Z_2.
