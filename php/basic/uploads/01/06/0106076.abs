Title: Quantized bulk fermions in the Randall-Sundrum brane model
Authors: Antonino Flachi and Ian G Moss and David J Toms
Abstract: The lowest order quantum corrections to the effective action arising from quantized massive fermion fields in the Randall-Sundrum background spacetime are computed. The boundary conditions and their relation with gauge invariance are examined in detail. The possibility of Wilson loop symmetry breaking in brane models is also analysed. The self-consistency requirements, previously considered in the case of a quantized bulk scalar field, are extended to include the contribution from massive fermions. It is shown that in this case it is possible to stabilize the radius of the extra dimensions but it is not possible to simultaneously solve the hierarchy problem, unless the brane tensions are dramatically fine tuned, supporting previous claims.
