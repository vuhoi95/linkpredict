Title: Quantum field components of supersymmetric multiplets
Authors: Florin Constantinescu and Gunter Scharf
Abstract: We adress the problem of Fock space representations of (free) multiplet component fiels encountered in supersymmetric quantum field theory insisting on positivity and causality. We look in detail on the scalar and Majorana components of the chiral supersymmetric multiplet. Several Fock space representations are introduced. The last section contains a short application to the supersymmetric Epstein-Glaser method. The present paper is written in the vane of axiomatic quantum field theory with applications to the causal approach to supersymmetry.
