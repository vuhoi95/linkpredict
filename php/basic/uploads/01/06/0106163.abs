Title: Bulk Observers in Non-Factorizable Geometries
Authors: Benjamin Grinstein and Detlef R. Nolte
Abstract: We consider five dimensional non-factorizable geometries where the transverse dimension is bounded and the remaining (parallel) dimensions are not. We study the construction of effective theories at distances much longer than the transverse size. An observer unable to resolve the transverse direction can only measure distances along the parallel dimensions, but the non-factorizable geometry makes the length of a curve along the parallel dimension sensitive to where on the transverse direction the curve lies. We show that long geodesics that differ in their endpoints only by shifts along the transverse direction all have the same length to within the observer's resolution. We argue that this is the correct notion of distance in the effective theory for a bulk observer. This allows us to present a consistent interpretation of what is measured by observers that live either on a brane or in the bulk.
