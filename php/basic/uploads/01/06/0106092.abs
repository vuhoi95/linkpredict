Title: Einstein Brane-Worlds In 5D Gauged Supergravity
Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We study, in the context of five dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity with vector and hypermultiplets, curved domain wall solutions with worldvolumes given by four dimensional Einstein manifolds. For a choice of the projection condition on the Killing spinors of the BPS solutions, first order differential equations governing the flow of the scalars are derived. With these equations, we analyze the equations of motion and determine conditions under which gauged supergravity theories may admit Einstein domain wall solutions.
