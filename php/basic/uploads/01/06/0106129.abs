Title: A Comparison between Star Products on Regular Orbits of Compact Lie  Groups
Authors: R. Fioresi and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: In this paper an algebraic star product and differential one defined on a regular coadjoint orbit of a compact semisimple group are compared. It is proven that there is an injective algebra homomorphism between the algebra of polynomials with the algebraic star product and the algebra of differential functions with the differential star product structure.
