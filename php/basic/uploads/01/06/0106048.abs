Title: Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Nikita A. Nekrasov
Abstract: We review the generalization of field theory to space-time with noncommuting coordinates, starting with the basics and covering most of the active directions of research. Such theories are now known to emerge from limits of M theory and string theory, and to describe quantum Hall states. In the last few years they have been studied intensively, and many qualitatively new phenomena have been discovered, both on the classical and quantum level. To appear in Reviews of Modern Physics.
