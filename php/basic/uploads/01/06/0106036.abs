Title: Lorentz Invariance and Origin of Symmetries
Authors: J. L. Chkareuli and C. D. Froggatt and H. B. Nielsen
Abstract: In this letter we reconsider the role of Lorentz invariance in the dynamical generation of the observed internal symmetries. We argue that, generally, Lorentz invariance can only be imposed in the sense that all Lorentz non-invariant effects caused by the spontaneous breakdown of Lorentz symmetry are physically unobservable. Remarkably, the application of this principle to the most general relativistically invariant Lagrangian, with arbitrary couplings for all the fields involved, leads by itself to the appearance of a symmetry and, what is more, to the massless vector fields gauging this symmetry in both Abelian and non-Abelian cases. In contrast, purely global symmetries are only generated as accidental consequences of the gauge symmetry.
