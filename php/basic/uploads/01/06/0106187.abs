Title: The Formation of Primary Galactic Nuclei during Phase Transitions in the  Early Universe
Authors: Sergei G. Rubin and Alexander S. Sakharov and Maxim Yu. Khlopov
Abstract: A new mechanism describing the formation of protogalaxies is proposed, which is based on the second- order phase transition in the inflation stage and the domain wall formation upon the end of inflation. The presence of closed domain walls with the size markedly exceeding the cosmological horizon at the instant of their formation and the wall collapse in the postinflation epoch (when the wall size becomes comparable with the cosmological horizon), which leads to the formation of massive black hole clusters that can serve as nuclei for the future galaxies. The black hole mass distributions obtained do not contradict the available experimental data. The number of black holes with M ~ 100 solar masses ($M_{\odot}$) and above is comparable with the number of Galaxies in the visible Universe. Development of the proposed approach gives ground for a principally new scenario of the galaxy formation in the model of hot Universe.
