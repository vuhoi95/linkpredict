Abstract: We examine the stability of ${\rm AdS}_p \times {\rm S}^n \times {\rm S}^{q-n}$. The initial data constructed by De Wolfe et al \cite{Gary} has been carefully analyised and we have confirmed that there is no lower bound for the total mass for $q< 9$. The effective action on ${\rm AdS}_p$ has been derived for dilatonic compactification of the system to describe the non-linear fluctuation of the background space-time. The stability is discussed applying the positive energy theorem to the effective theory on AdS, which again shows the stability for $q \geq 9$.
