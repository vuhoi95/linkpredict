Title: The Dual Phases of Massless/Massive Kalb-Ramond Fields
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci
Abstract: We have developed dualization of ordinary and ``Stueckelberg compensated'' massive phase for the Kalb-Ramond theory. The compensated phase allows to study the interplay between spin jumping and duality. We show that spin jumping is caused by mass, while gauge symmetry is not necessary for this effect to take place.
