Title: The spectrum of boundary states in sine-Gordon model with integrable  boundary conditions
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs and G. Zs. Toth
Abstract: The bound state spectrum and the associated reflection factors are determined for the sine-Gordon model with arbitrary integrable boundary condition by closing the bootstrap. Comparing the symmetries of the bound state spectrum with that of the Lagrangian it is shown how one can "derive" the relationship between the UV and IR parameters conjectured earlier.
