Title: Structures in BC_N Ruijsenaars-Schneider models
Authors: J. Avan and G. Rollet
Abstract: We construct the classical r-matrix structure for the Lax formulation of BC_N Ruijsenaars-Schneider systems proposed in hep-th 0006004. The r-matrix structure takes a quadratic form similar to the A_N Ruijsenaars-Schneider Poisson bracket behavior, although the dynamical dependence is more complicated. Commuting Hamiltonians stemming from the BC_N Ruijsenaars-Schneider Lax matrix are shown to be linear combinations of particular Koornwinder-van Diejen ``external fields'' Ruijsenaars-Schneider models, for specific values of the exponential one-body couplings. Uniqueness of such commuting Hamiltonians is established once the first of them and the general analytic structure are given.
