Title: Calculation of 1-loop Hexagon Amplitudes in the Yukawa Model
Authors: T. Binoth and J. P. Guillet and G. Heinrich and C. Schubert
Abstract: We calculate a class of one-loop six-point amplitudes in the Yukawa model. The construction of multi-particle amplitudes is done in the string inspired formalism and compared to the Feynman diagrammatic approach. We show that there exists a surprisingly efficient way of calculating such amplitudes by using cyclic identities of kinematic coefficients and discuss in detail cancellation mechanisms of spurious terms. A collection of formulas which are useful for the calculation of massless hexagon amplitudes is given.
