Title: Non-Abelian Vortex and Confinement
Authors: K. Konishi and L. Spanu
Abstract: We discuss general properties and possible types of magnetic vortices in non-Abelian gauge theories (we consider here $G= SU(N), SO(N), USp(2N)$) in the Higgs phase. The sources of such vortices carry "fractional" quantum numbers such as $Z_n$ charge (for SU(N)), but also full non-Abelian charges of the dual gauge group. If such a model emerges as an effective dual magnetic theory of the fundamental (electric) theory, the non-Abelian vortices can provide for the mechanism of quark-confinement in the latter.
