Title: Friedmann equation and Cardy formula correspondence in brane universes
Authors: Bin Wang and Elcio Abdalla and Ru-Keng Su
Abstract: We study the brane with arbitrary tension $\sigma$ on the edge of various black holes with AdS asymptotics. We investigate Friedmann equations governing the motion of the brane universes and match the Friedmann equation to Cardy entropy formula.
