Title: Does DLCQ S-matrix have a covariant continuum limit?
Authors: Masa-aki Taniguchi and Shozo Uehara and Satoshi Yamada and Koichi Yamawaki
Abstract: We develop a systematic DLCQ perturbation theory and show that DLCQ S-matrix does not have a covariant continuum limit for processes with $p^+=0$ exchange. This implies that the role of the zero mode is more subtle than ever considered in DLCQ and hence must be treated with great care also in non-perturbative approach. We also make a brief comment on DLCQ in string theory.
