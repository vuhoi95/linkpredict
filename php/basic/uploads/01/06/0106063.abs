Title: OPE between the energy-momentum tensor and the Wilson loop in N=4  Super-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Takehiro Azuma and Hikaru Kawai
Abstract: We analyze the operator product expansion T_{\mu \nu}(z) W[C] in N=4 4-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with U(N) gauge group, and clarify that the closed Wilson loop does not possess an anomalous dimension and that only the shape of the loop is changed by the conformal transformation.
