Title: Complexified PSUSY and SSUSY interpretations of some PT-symmetric  Hamiltonians possessing two series of real energy eigenvalues
Authors: B. Bagchi and S. Mallik and C. Quesne
Abstract: We analyze a set of three PT-symmetric complex potentials, namely harmonic oscillator, generalized Poschl-Teller and Scarf II, all of which reveal a double series of energy levels along with the corresponding superpotential. Inspired by the fact that two superpotentials reside naturally in order-two parasupersymmetry (PSUSY) and second-derivative supersymmetry (SSUSY) schemes, we complexify their frameworks to successfully account for the three potentials.
