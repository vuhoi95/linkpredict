Abstract: In this work we consider the action for a set of complex scalar supermultiplets interacting with the scale factor in the supersymmetric cosmological models. We show that the local conformal supersymmetry leads to a scalar field potential defined in terms of the K\"ahler potential and superpotential. Using supersymmetry breaking we are able to obtain a normalizable wave function for the FRW cosmological model.
