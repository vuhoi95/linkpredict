Title: Hopf reductions, fluxes and branes
Authors: Ruben Minasian and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We use a series of reductions, T-dualities and liftings to construct connections between fractional brane solutions in IIA, IIB and M-theory. We find a number of phantom branes that are not supported by the geometry, however materialize upon untwisting and/or Hopf-reduction.
