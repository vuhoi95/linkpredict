Title: A Mass Formula for EYM Solitons
Authors: Alejandro Corichi and Ulises Nucamendi and Daniel Sudarsky
Abstract: The Isolated Horizon formalism, together with a simple phenomenological model for colored black holes was recently used to predict a formula for the ADM mass of the solitons of the EYM system in terms of horizon properties of black holes {\it for all} values of the horizon area. In this note, this formula is tested numerically --up to a large value of the area-- for spherically symmetric solutions and shown to yield the known masses of the solitons
