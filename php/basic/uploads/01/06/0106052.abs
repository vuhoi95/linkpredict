Title: Primary currents and Riemannian geometry in W-algebras
Authors: G. Bandelloni and S. Lazzarini
Abstract: It is proved that general consistency requirements of stability under complex analytic change of charts show that primary currents in finite chiral W-algebras are described in terms of pure gravitational variables.
