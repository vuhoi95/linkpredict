Abstract: The field theory dual to the Freedman-Townsend model of a non-Abelian anti-symmetric tensor field is a nonlinear sigma model on the group manifold G. This can be extended to the duality between the Freedman-Townsend model coupled to Yang-Mills fields and a nonlinear sigma model on a coset space G/H. We present the supersymmetric extension of this duality, and find that the target space of this nonlinear sigma model is a complex coset space, GC/HC.
