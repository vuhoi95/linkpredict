Title: Mirror Symmetry on Kummer Type K3 Surfaces
Authors: Werner Nahm and Katrin Wendland
Abstract: We investigate both geometric and conformal field theoretic aspects of mirror symmetry on N=(4,4) superconformal field theories with central charge c=6. Our approach enables us to determine the action of mirror symmetry on (non-stable) singular fibers in elliptic fibrations of Z_N orbifold limits of K3. The resulting map gives an automorphism of order 4,8, or 12, respectively, on the smooth universal cover of the moduli space. We explicitly derive the geometric counterparts of the twist fields in our orbifold conformal field theories. The classical McKay correspondence allows for a natural interpretation of our results.
