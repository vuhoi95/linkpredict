Title: On the Schr√∂dinger Equation for the Supersymmetric FRW Model
Authors: J. J. Rosales and V. I. Tkach and A. I. Pashnev
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. We show that for this purpose it is possible to include an additional action invariant under reparametrization of time. The last one does not change the equations of motion for the minisuperspace model, but changes only the constraint. The same procedure is applied to the supersymmetric case.
