Title: Gauge Theory at Large N and New G_2 Holonomy Metrics
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Jaume Gomis and Steven S. Gubser and Sergei Gukov
Abstract: We find a one-parameter family of new G_2 holonomy metrics and demonstrate that it can be extended to a two-parameter family. These metrics play an important role as the supergravity dual of the large $N$ limit of four dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills. We show that these G_2 holonomy metrics describe the M-theory lift of the supergravity solution describing a collection of D6-branes wrapping the supersymmetric three-cycle of the deformed conifold geometry for any value of the string coupling constant.
