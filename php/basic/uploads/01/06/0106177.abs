Title: Resolved Branes and M-theory on Special Holonomy Spaces
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and G. W. Gibbons and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We review the construction of regular p-brane solutions of M-theory and string theory with less than maximal supersymmetry whose transverse spaces have metrics with special holonomy, and where additional fluxes allow brane resolutions via transgression terms. We focus on the properties of resolved M2-branes and fractional D2-branes, whose transverse spaces are Ricci flat eight-dimensional and seven-dimensional spaces of special holonomy. We also review fractional M2-branes with transverse spaces corresponding to the new two-parameter Spin(7) holonomy metrics, and their connection to fractional D2-branes with transverse spaces of G_2 holonomy.
