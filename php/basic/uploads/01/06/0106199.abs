Title: Duality equivalence between nonlinear self-dual and topologically  massive models
Authors: Anderson Ilha and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: In this report we study the dual equivalence between the generalized self-dual (SD) and topologically massive (TM) models. To this end we linearize the model using an auxiliary field and apply a gauge embedding procedure to construct a gauge equivalent model. We clearly show that, under the above conditions, a nonlinear SD model always has a duality equivalent TM action.The general result obtained is then particularized for a number of examples, including the Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons (BICS) model recently discussed in the literature.
