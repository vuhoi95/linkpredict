Title: N-fold Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics - General Formalism -
Authors: Hideaki Aoyama and Masatoshi Sato and Toshiaki Tanaka
Abstract: We report general properties of N-fold supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. N-fold supersymmetry is characterized by supercharges which are N-th polynomials of momentum. Relations between the anti-commutator of the supercharges and the Hamiltonian, the spectra, the Witten index, the non-renormalization theorems and the quasi-solvability are examined. We also present further investigation about a particular class of N-fold supersymmetric models which we dubbed type A. Algebraic equations which determine a part of spectra of type A models are presented, and the non-renormalization theorem are generalized. Finally, we present a possible generalization of N-fold supersymmetry in multi-dimensional quantum mechanics.
