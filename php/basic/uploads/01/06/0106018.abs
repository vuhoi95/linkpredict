Title: Black Hole Decay Rates in Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: R. Casadio and B. Harms
Abstract: We study the evaporation of black holes in space-times with extra dimensions of size L. We show that the luminosity is greatly damped when the horizon becomes smaller than L and black holes born with an initial size smaller than L are almost stable. This effect is due to the dependence of both the occupation number density of Hawking quanta and the grey-body factor of a black hole on the dimensionality of space.
