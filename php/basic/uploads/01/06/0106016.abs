Title: Chern-Simons matrix model: coherent states and relation to Laughlin  wavefunctions
Authors: Dimitra Karabali and Bunji Sakita
Abstract: Using a coherent state representation we derive many-body probability distributions and wavefunctions for the Chern-Simons matrix model proposed by Polychronakos and compare them to the Laughlin ones. We analyze two different coherent state representations, corresponding to different choices for electron coordinate bases. In both cases we find that the resulting probability distributions do not quite agree with the Laughlin ones. There is agreement on the long distance behavior, but the short distance behavior is different.
