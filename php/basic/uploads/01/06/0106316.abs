Title: Natural Quintessence with Gauge Coupling Unification
Authors: A. de la Macorra and C. Stephan-Otto
Abstract: We show that a positive accelerating universe can be obtained simply by the dynamics of a non-abelian gauge group. It is the condensates of the chiral fields that obtain a negative power potential, below the condensation scale, and allow for a quintessence interpretation of these fields. The only free parameters in this model are $N_c$ and $N_f$ and the number of dynamically gauge singlet bilinear fields $\phi$ generated below the condensation scale. We show that it is possible to have unification of all coupling constants, including the standard and non standard model couplings, while having an acceptable phenomenology of $\phi$ as the cosmological constant. This is done without any fine tuning of the initial conditions. The problem of coincidence (why the universe has only recently started an accelerating period) is not solved but it is put at the same level as what the particle content of the standard model is.
