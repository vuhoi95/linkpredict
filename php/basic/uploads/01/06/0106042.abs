Title: Target space symmetries in topological theories I
Authors: L. Baulieu and A. Losev and N. Nekrasov
Abstract: We study realization of the target space diffeomorphisms in the type $C$ topological string. We found that the charges, which generate transformations of the boundary observables, form an algebra, which differs from that of bulk charges by the contribution of the bubbled disks. We discuss applications to noncommutative field theories.
