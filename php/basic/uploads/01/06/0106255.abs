Title: Supergravity, Non-Conformal Field Theories and Brane-Worlds
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider the supergravity dual descriptions of non-conformal super Yang-Mills theories realized on the world-volume of Dp-branes. We use the dual description to compute stress-energy tensor and current correlators. We apply the results to the study of dilatonic brane-worlds described by non-conformal field theories coupled to gravity. We find that brane-worlds based on D4 and D5 branes exhibit a localization of gauge and gravitational fields. We calculate the corrections to the Newton and Coulomb laws in these theories.
