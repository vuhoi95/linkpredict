Title: Anholonomic Triads and New Classes of (2+1)-Dimensional Black Hole  solutions
Authors: Sergiu I. Vacaru and Panayiotis Stavrinos and Evghenii Gaburov
Abstract: We apply the method of moving anholonomic frames in order to construct new classes of solutions of the Einstein equations on (2+1)-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces. There are investigated black holes with deformed horizons and renormalized locally anisotropic constants. We speculate on properties of such anisotropic black holes with characteristics defined by anholonomic frames and anisotropic interactions of matter and gravity. The thermodynamics of locally anisotropic black holes is discussed in connection with a possible statistical mechanics background based on locally anisotropic variants of Chern-Simons theories.
