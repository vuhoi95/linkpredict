Title: Non-commutative Gauge Theory, Open Wilson Lines and Closed Strings
Authors: Avinash Dhar and Yoshihisa Kitazawa
Abstract: A recently proposed connection between closed string field and an open Wilson line defined on an arbitrary contour is further explored here. We suggest that reparametrization invariance of a Wilson line is the principle which determines the coupling of non-commutative gauge theory/matrix model to the modes of the closed string. An analogue of the level matching condition on the gauge theory/matrix model operators emerges quite naturally from the cyclic symmetry of the straight Wilson line. We show that the generating functional of correlation functions of these operators has the space-time gauge symmetry that one expects to find in closed string field theory. We also identify an infinite number of conserved operators in gauge theory/matrix model, the first of which is known to be the conserved stress tensor.
