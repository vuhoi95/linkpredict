Title: Remarks on A_2 Toda Field Theory
Authors: S. A. Apikyan and C. J. Efthimiou
Abstract: We study the Toda field theory with finite Lie algebras using an extension of the Goulian-Li technique. In this way, we show that, after integrating over the zero mode in the correlation functions of the exponential fields, the resulting correlation function resembles that of a free theory. Furthermore, it is shown that for some ratios of the charges of the exponential fields the four-point correlation functions which contain a degenerate field satisfy the Riemann ordinary differential equation. Using this fact and the crossing symmetry, we derive a set of functional equations for the structure constants of the A_2 Toda field theory.
