Authors: A. Pashnev and J. J. Rosales and V. I. Tkach and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: In this work we have constructed the n=4 extended local conformal time supersymmetry for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models. This is based on the superfield construction of the action, which is invariant under wordline local n=4 supersymmetry with $SU(2)_{local} \otimes SU(2)_{global}$ internal symmetry. It is shown that the supersymmetric action has the form of the localized (or superconformal) version of the action for n=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This superfield procedure provides a well defined scheme for including supermatter.
