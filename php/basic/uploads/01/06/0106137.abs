Abstract: The field-dependent invariant representation (the "dynamical" representation) of the Poincar\'e algebra is considered as a dynamical principle in order to get the corresponding "dynamical" electromagnetic coupling for higher spins ($s\geq 1$). If in lower-spin ($s=0,1/2$) cases the "dynamical" coupling is taken to coincide with the minimal electromagnetic coupling the higher-spin coupling is inevitably non-minimal, containing a term linear in the field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. This term leads to $g=2$.
