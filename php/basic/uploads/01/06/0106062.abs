Title: Emptiness Formation Probability for the One-Dimensional Isotropic XY  Model
Authors: Masahiro Shiroishi and Minoru Takahashi and Yoshihiro Nishiyama
Abstract: We study a correlation function for the one-dimensional isotropic ${XY}$ model (${XX0}$ model), which is called the Emptiness Formation Probability (EFP). It is the probability of the formation of a ferromagnetic string in the anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Using the expression of the EFP as a Toeplitz determinant, we discuss its asymptotic behaviors. We also compare the analytical results with numerical calculations as the density-matrix renormalization group and the quantum Monte-Carlo method.
