Title: Large Extra Dimensions from a Small Extra Dimension
Authors: Z. Chacko and Patrick J. Fox and Ann E. Nelson and Neal Weiner
Abstract: Models with extra dimensions have changed our understanding of the hierarchy problem. In general, these models explain the weakness of gravity by diluting gravity in a large bulk volume, or by localizing the graviton away from the standard model. In this paper, we show that the warped geometries necessary for the latter scenario can naturally induce the large volumes necessary for the former. We present a model in which a large volume is stabilized without supersymmetry. We comment on the phenomenology of this scenario and generalizations to additional dimensions.
