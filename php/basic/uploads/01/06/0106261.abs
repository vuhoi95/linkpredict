Title: Absence of a VVDZ Discontinuity in AdS_AdS
Authors: Andreas Karch and Emanuel Katz and Lisa Randall
Abstract: We clarify the role of gauge invariance for the theory of an AdS4 brane embedded in AdS5. The presence of a nonvanishing mass parameter even for the lightest KK mode of the graviton indicates that all of the spin-2 modes propagate five polarization states. Despite this fact, it was shown earlier that the classical theory has a smooth limit as the mass parameter is taken to zero. We argue that locality in the fifth dimension ensures that this property survives at the quantum level.
