Title: Higgs fields, bundle gerbes and string structures
Authors: M. K. Murray and D. Stevenson
Abstract: We use bundle gerbes and their connections and curvings to obtain an explicit formula for a de Rham representative of the string class of a loop group bundle. This is related to earlier work on calorons.
