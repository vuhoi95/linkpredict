Title: Warped Compactification with a Four-Brane
Authors: S. Hayakawa and K. -I. Izawa
Abstract: Warped compactification of the six-dimensional bulk with a negative cosmological constant is realized with a 4-brane along with an abelian gauge theory. No fine tuning of couplings are needed to obtain the vanishing cosmological constant in four dimensions, as is the case for the bulk with a positive cosmological constant.
