Title: Localization of Scalar Fluctuations in a Dilatonic Brane-World Scenario
Authors: V. Bozza and M. Gasperini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We derive and solve the full set of scalar perturbation equations for a class of $Z_2$-symmetric five-dimensional geometries generated by a bulk cosmological constant and by a 3-brane non-minimally coupled to a bulk dilaton field. The massless scalar modes, like their tensor analogues, are localized on the brane, and provide long-range four-dimensional dilatonic interactions, which are generically present even when matter on the brane carries no dilatonic charge. The shorter-range corrections induced by the continuum of massive scalar modes are always present: they persist even in the case of a trivial dilaton background (the standard Randall--Sundrum configuration) and vanishing dilatonic charges.
