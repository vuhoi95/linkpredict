Title: Einstein-Hilbert action on the brane for the bulk graviton
Authors: Steven Corley and David Lowe and Sanjaye Ramgoolam
Abstract: We find new closed string couplings on Dp-branes for the bosonic string. These couplings are quadratic in derivatives and therefore take the form of induced kinetic terms on the brane. For the graviton in particular we find the induced Einstein-Hilbert term as well as terms quadratic in the second fundamental tensor. We comment on tachyon dependences of these brane-localized couplings.
