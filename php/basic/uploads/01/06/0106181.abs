Title: Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and rotating frames
Authors: H. R. Christiansen and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study the effect of noncommutativity of space on the physics of a quantum interferometer located in a rotating disk in a gauge field background. To this end, we develop a path-integral approach which allows defining an effective action from which relevant physical quantities can be computed as in the usual commutative case. For the specific case of a constant magnetic field, we are able to compute, exactly, the noncommutative Lagrangian and the associated shift on the interference pattern for any value of $\theta$.
