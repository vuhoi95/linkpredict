Title: Soft Supersymmetry Breaking due to Dimensional Reduction over  Non-Symmetric Coset Spaces
Authors: P. Manousselis and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: A ten-dimensional supersymmetric $E_8$ gauge theory is compactified over six-dimensional coset spaces, establishing further our earlier conjecture that the resulting four dimensional theory is a softly broken supersymmetric gauge theory in the case that the used coset space is non-symmetric. The specific non-symmetric six-dimensional spaces examined in the present study are $Sp(4)/(SU(2) \times U(1))_{non-max.}$ and $ SU(3)/U(1) \times U(1)$.
