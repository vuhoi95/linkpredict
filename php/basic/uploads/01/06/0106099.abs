Title: Spinning Bound States of Two and Three Black Holes
Authors: Ruth Britto-Pacumio and Alexander Maloney and Mark Stern and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Bound states of BPS particles in five-dimensional N=2 supergravity are counted by a topological index. We compute this bound state index exactly for two and three black holes as a function of the SU(2)_L angular momentum. The required regulator for the infrared continuum of near-coincident black holes is chosen in accord with the enhanced superconformal symmetry.
