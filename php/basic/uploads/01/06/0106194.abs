Title: Twisted K-theory and K-theory of bundle gerbes
Authors: P. Bouwknegt and A. L. Carey and V. Mathai and M. K. Murray and D. Stevenson
Abstract: In this note we introduce the notion of bundle gerbe K-theory and investigate the relation to twisted K-theory. We provide some examples. Possible applications of bundle gerbe K-theory to the classification of D-brane charges in non-trivial backgrounds are discussed.
