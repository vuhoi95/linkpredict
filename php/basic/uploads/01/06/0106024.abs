Title: Derivative Corrections from Noncommutativity
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Sunil Mukhi and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We show that an infinite subset of the higher-derivative alpha' corrections to the DBI and Chern-Simons actions of ordinary commutative open-string theory can be determined using noncommutativity. Our predictions are compared to some lowest order alpha' corrections that have been computed explicitly by Wyllard (hep-th/0008125), and shown to agree.
