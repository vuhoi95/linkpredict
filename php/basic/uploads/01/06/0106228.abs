Title: Quantum corrections to the kinetic term in the Randall-Sundrum model
Authors: Ian G Moss and Wade Naylor
Abstract: The effective action of the radion in the Randall-Sundrum model is analysed. Fine tunings are needed to obtain the observed mass hierarchy and an invisible radion. since the kinetic terms are important for determining the radion mass, the finite quantum corrections from massless conformally coupled fermions are analysed and found to vanish at one loop order.
