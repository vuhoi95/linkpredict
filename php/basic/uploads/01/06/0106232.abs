Title: Noncommutativity in linear dilaton background
Authors: Sandip Bhattacharyya and Alok Kumar and Swapna Mahapatra
Abstract: We consider quantization of open string theories in linear dilaton and constant antisymmetric tensor backgrounds and discuss the noncommutativity of space-time coordinates arising in such theories, including their relationship with light-like noncommutativity as well as backgrounds with null isometries. It is argued that the results can also be understood using space-time equations of motion of the string modes. We then present N= 2 supersymmetric generalization of these theories and the associated noncommutativity structure.
