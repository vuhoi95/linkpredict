Title: Dynamics and Properties of Chiral Cosmic Strings
Authors: M. Pickles and A. C. Davis
Abstract: Chiral cosmic strings naturally arise in many particle physics models, in particular in supersymmetric theories with a D-term. These strings have a single fermion zero mode in the core. We derive the general equation of motion for such strings. In Minkowski space we give the self-intersections for an arbitary varying current on the loop, showing that the self-intersection probability is dominated by the fraction of loop with maximal charge. We show how to relate the charge to the fermion condensation temperature, arguing that strings which become current carrying at formation will automatically have a maximal charge. Any daughter loops produced are likely to have the same charge as the parent loop. Possible models for chiral cosmic strings are also discussed and consequences for D-term inflation mentioned.
