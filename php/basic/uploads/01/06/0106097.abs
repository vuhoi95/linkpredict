Title: A thermal instability for positive brane cosmological constant in the  Randall-Sundrum cosmologies
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Yi Ling and Lee Smolin
Abstract: We describe a novel dynamical mechanism to radiate away a positive four dimensional cosmological constant, in the Randall-Sundrum cosmological scenario. We show that there are modes of the bulk gravitational field for which the brane is effectively a mirror. This will generally give rise to an emission of thermal radiation from the brane into the bulk. The temperature turns out to be nonvanishing only if the effective four dimensional cosmological constant is positive. In any theory where the four dimensional vacuum energy is a function of physical degrees of freedom, there is then a mechanism that radiates away any positive four dimensional cosmological constant.
