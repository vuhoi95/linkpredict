Title: Coupling integrable field theories to mechanical systems at the boundary
Authors: P. Baseilhac and G. W. Delius
Abstract: We present an integrable Hamiltonian which describes the sinh-Gordon model on the half line coupled to a non-linear oscillator at the boundary. We explain how we apply Sklyanin's formalism to a dynamical reflection matrix to obtain this model. This method can be applied to couple other integrable field theories to dynamical systems at the boundary. We also show how to find the dynamical solution of the quantum reflection equation corresponding to our particular example.
