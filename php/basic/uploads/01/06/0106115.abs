Title: Classical and Quantum Behavior of Genaralized Oscillators - action  variable, angle variable and quantum phase -
Authors: M. Omote and S. Sakoda and S. Kamefuchi
Abstract: The relation that exists in quantum mechanics among action variables, angle variables and the phases of quantum states is clarified, by referring to the system of a generalized oscillator. As a by-product, quantum-mechanical meaning of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation and related matters is clarified, where a new picture of quantum mechanics is introduced, to be called the Hamilton-Jacobi picture.
