Title: On the Masses of the Leptons, Bosons and Quarks
Authors: Roger C. Millikan and Dennis C. Richman
Abstract: A previously developed lepton mass equation is extended to include the massive bosons and quarks of all three generations. The particles are modeled as closed, string-like, light front solitons whose key quantum numbers are their node number n and their winding number omega. The simplicity and form of the mass equation suggests that the dominant mass effect comes from how the particles embed themselves in spacetime.
