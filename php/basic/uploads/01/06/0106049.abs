Abstract: We consider diquark condensation in external chromomagnetic fields at non--zero temperature. The general features of this process are investigated for various field configurations in relation to their symmetry properties and the form of the quark spectrum. According to the fields, there arises dimensional reduction by one or two units. In all cases there exists diquark condensation even at arbitrary weak quark attraction, confirming the idea about universality of this mechanism in a chromomagnetic field. Possible influence of a nonzero chemical potential on the results obtained is also discussed.
