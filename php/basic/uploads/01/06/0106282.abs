Title: The evolution and persistence of dumbbells
Authors: Jon Urrestilla and Ana Achucarro and Julian Borrill and Andrew R. Liddle
Abstract: We use large-scale numerical simulations to study the formation and evolution of non-topological defects in a generalized electroweak phase transition described by the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model without fermions. Such defects include dumbbells, comprising a pair of monopoles joined by a segment of electroweak string. These exhibit complex dynamics, with some shrinking under the string tension and others growing due to the monopole-antimonopole attractions between near neighbours. We estimate the range of parameters where the network of dumbbells persists, and show that this region is narrower than the region within which infinite straight electroweak strings are perturbatively stable.
