Title: Spacetime torsion and parity violation: a gauge invariant formulation
Authors: Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya and Soumitra SenGupta and Saurabh Sur
Abstract: The possibility of parity violation through spacetime torsion has been explored in a scenario containing fields with different spins. Taking the Kalb-Ramond field as the source of torsion, an explicitly parity violating $U(1)_{EM}$ gauge invariant theory has been constructed by extending the KR field with a Chern-Simons term.
