Title: Quantized hermitian superfields
Authors: Florin Constantinescu and Markus Gut and Gunter Scharf
Abstract: We analyse the algebras generated by free component quantum fields together with the susy generators $Q,\bar Q$. Restricting to hermitian fields we first construct the scalar field algebra from which various scalar superfields can be obtained by exponentiation. Then we study the vector algebra and use it to construct the vector superfield. Surprisingly enough, the result is totally different from the vector multiplet in the literature. It contains two hermitian four-vector components instead of one and a spin-3/2 field similar to the gravitino in supergravity.
