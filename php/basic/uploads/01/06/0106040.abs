Title: Open/Closed String Dualities and Seiberg Duality from Geometric  Transitions in M-theory
Authors: Keshav Dasgupta and Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We propose a general method to study open/closed string dualities from transitions in M theory which is valid for a large class of geometrical configurations. By T-duality we can transform geometrically engineered configurations into N = 1 brane configurations and study the transitions of the corresponding branes by lifting the configurations to M-theory. We describe the transformed degenerated M5 branes and extract the field theory information on gluino condensation by factorization of the Seiberg-Witten curve. We also include massive flavors and orientifolds and discuss Seiberg duality which appears in this case as a birational flop. After the transition, the Seiberg duality becomes an abelian electric-magnetic duality.
