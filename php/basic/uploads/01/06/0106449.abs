Title: Comments on "A Supernova Brane Scan"
Authors: C. Deffayet and G. Dvali and G. Gabadadze
Abstract: Recently we proposed that the acceleration of the Universe could be due to gravity leaking to extra dimensions. This scenario gives an alternative to the cosmological constant or quintessence. In [astro-ph/0106274] the authors claimed that this proposal is strongly disfavored if not ruled out by the existing data on Supernovae, Cosmic Microwave Background and clusters. We show that the work [astro-ph/0106274] contains incorrect statements in the theoretical part, and, moreover, we argue that the main conclusions of the work concerning the comparison with the data are premature.
