Title: Brane-skyrmions and wrapped states
Authors: J. A. R. Cembranos and A. Dobado and A. L. Maroto
Abstract: In the context of a brane world and including an induced curvature term in the brane action, we obtain the effective lagrangian for the Goldstone bosons (branons) associated with the spontaneous breaking of the translational invariance in the bulk. In addition to the branons, this effective action has Skyrmion-like solitonic states which can be understood as holes in the brane. We study their main properties such as mass and size, the Skyrmion-branon interaction and their possible fermionic quantization. We also consider states where the brane is wrapped around the extra dimensions and their relation with the brane-skyrmions. Finally, we extend our results to higher-dimensional branes, such as those appearing in M-theory, where brane-skyrmions could also be present.
