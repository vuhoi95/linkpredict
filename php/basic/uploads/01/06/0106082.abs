Title: Lorentzian 3d Gravity with Wormholes via Matrix Models
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll and G. Vernizzi
Abstract: We uncover a surprising correspondence between a non-perturbative formulation of three-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity and a hermitian two-matrix model with ABAB-interaction. The gravitational transfer matrix can be expressed as the logarithm of a two-matrix integral, and we deduce from the known structure of the latter that the model has two phases. In the phase of weak gravity, well-defined two-dimensional universes propagate in proper time, whereas in the strong-coupling phase the spatial hypersurfaces disintegrate into many components connected by wormholes.
