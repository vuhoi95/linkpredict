Title: Anholonomic Frames and Thermodynamic Geometry of 3D Black Holes
Authors: Sergiu I. Vacaru and Panayiotis Stavrinos and Denis Gontsa
Abstract: We study new classes three dimensional black hole solutions of Einstein equations written in two holonomic and one anholonomic variables with respect to anholonomic frames Thermodynamic properties of such (2+1)-black holes with generic local anisotropy (having elliptitic horizons) are studied by applying geometric methods. The corresponding thermodynamic systems are three dimensional with entropy S being a hypersurface function on mass M, anisotropy angle $\theta$ and eccentricity of elliptic deformations $\epsilon >.$ Two-dimensional curved thermodynamic geometries for locally anistropic deformed black holes are constructed after integration on anisotropic parameter $\theta$. Two approaches, the first one based on two-dimensional hypersurface parametric geometry and the second one developed in a Ruppeiner-Mrugala-Janyszek fashion, are analyzed. The thermodynamic curvatures are computed and the critical points of curvature vanishing are defined.
