Title: Spin Clustering of Accreting X-ray Neutron Stars as Possible Evidence of  Quark Matter
Authors: Norman K. Glendenning and F. Weber
Abstract: A neutron star in binary orbit with a low-mass non-degenerate companion becomes a source of x-rays with millisecond variability when mass accretion spins it up. Centrifugally driven changes in density profile may initiate a phase transition in a growing region of the core parallel to what may take place in an isolated millisecond pulsar, but in reverse. Such a star will spend a longer time in the spin frequency range over which the transition occurs than elsewhere because the change of phase, paced by the spinup rate, is accompanied by a growth in the moment of inertia. The population of accreters will exhibit a clustering in the critical frequency range. A phase change triggered by changing spin and the accompanying adjustment of moment of inertia has its analogue in rotating nuclei.
