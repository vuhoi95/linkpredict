Title: Chiral exponents in frustrated spin models with noncollinear ordering
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Paolo Rossi and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We compute the chiral critical exponents for the chiral transition in frustrated two- and three-component spin systems with noncollinear order, such as stacked triangular antiferromagnets (STA). For this purpose, we calculate and analyze the six-loop field-theoretical expansion of the renormalization-group function associated with the chiral operator. The results are in satisfactory agreement with those obtained in the recent experiment on the XY STA CsMnBr_3 reported by V. P. Plakhty et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 3942 (2000), providing further support for the continuous nature of the chiral transition.
