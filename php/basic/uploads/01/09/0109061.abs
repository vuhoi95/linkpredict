Title: Spectral Structure of Quantum Line with a Defect
Authors: Taksu Cheon and Tamas Fulop and Izumi Tsutsui
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of one-dimensional quantum wire with a single defect. We reveal the existence of the non-trivial topological structures in the spectral space of the system, which are behind the exotic quantum phenomena that have lately been found in the system.
