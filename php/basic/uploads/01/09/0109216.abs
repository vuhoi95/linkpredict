Title: $Z_N$ orbifold compactifications in $AdS_6$ with Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We present a general setup for junctions of semi-infinite 4-branes in $AdS_6$ with the Gauss-Bonnet term. The 3-brane tension at the junction of 4-branes can be nonzero. Using the brane junctions as the origin of the $Z_N$ discrete rotation symmetry, we identify 3-brane tensions at three fixed points of the orbifold $T^2/Z_3$ in terms of the 4-brane tensions. As a result, the three 3-brane tensions can be simultaneously positive, which enables us to explain the mass hierarchy by taking one of two branes apart from the hidden brane as the visible brane, and hence does not introduce a severe cosmological problem.
