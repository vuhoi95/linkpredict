Title: {\cal N}=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory on Orbifold-$T^4/{\bf Z}_2$:  Higher Rank Case
Authors: Masao Jinzenji and Toru Sasaki
Abstract: We derive the partition function of {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on orbifold-T^4/{\bf Z}_2 for gauge group SU(N). We generalize the method of our previous work for the SU(2) case to the SU(N) case. The resulting partition function is represented as the sum of the product of G\"ottche formula of singular quotient space $T^4/{\bf Z}_2 $ and of blow-up formulas including A_{N-1} theta series with level N.
