Title: Inverse dualisation and non-local dualities between Einstein gravity and  supergravities
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and Dmitri V. Gal'tsov and Sergei A. Sharakin
Abstract: We investigate non-local dualities between suitably compactified higher-dimensional Einstein gravity and supergravities which can be revealed if one reinterprets the dualised Kaluza-Klein two-forms in $D>4$ as antisymmetric forms belonging to supergravities. We find several examples of such a correspondence including one between the six-dimensional Einstein gravity and the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory (truncated N=4 supergravity), and others between the compactified eleven and ten-dimensional supergravities and the eight or ten-dimensional pure gravity. The Killing spinor equation of the D=11 supergravity is shown to be equivalent to the geometric Killing spinor equation in the dual gravity. We give several examples of using new dualities for solution generation and demonstrate how $p$-branes can be interpreted as non-local duals of pure gravity solutions. New supersymmetric solutions are presented including $M2\subset 5$-brane with two rotation parameters.
