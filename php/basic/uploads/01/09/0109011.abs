Title: Spherically symmetric solutions of the 6th order SU(N) Skyrme models
Authors: I. Floratos and B. M. A. G. Piette
Abstract: We use the generalised rational map ansatz introduced by Ioannidou et al. to construct analytically some topologically non-trivial solutions of the generalised SU(3) Skyrme model defined by adding a sixth order term to the usual Lagrangian. These solutions are radially symmetric and some of them can be interpreted as bound states of Skyrmions. The same ansatz is used to construct low-energy configuration of the SU(N) Skyrme model.
