Title: Division Algebras and Extended N=2,4,8 SuperKdVs
Authors: H. L. Carrion and M. Rojas and F. Toppan
Abstract: The first example of an N=8 supersymmetric extension of the KdV equation is here explicitly constructed. It involves 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic fields. It corresponds to the unique N=8 solution based on a generalized hamiltonian dynamics with (generalized) Poisson brackets given by the Non-associative N=8 Superconformal Algebra. The complete list of inequivalent classes of parametric-dependent N=3 and N=4 superKdVs obtained from the ``Non-associative N=8 SCA" is also furnished. Furthermore, a fundamental domain characterizing the class of inequivalent N=4 superKdVs based on the "minimal N=4 SCA" is given.
