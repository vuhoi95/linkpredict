Title: Three Family N=1 SUSY Models from Z_n Orbifolded AdS/CFT
Authors: Thomas W. Kephart and Heinrich PÃ¤s
Abstract: We present an analysis of compactifications of the type IIB superstring on AdS_5 x S^5 / \Gamma, where \Gamma is an abelian cyclic group. Every \Gamma =Z_n of order n<= 12 is considered. This results in 60 chiral models, and a systematic analysis with n<8 yields four containing the minimal SUSY standard model with three families. One of these models extends to an infinite sequence of three-family MSSMs. We also give a lower bound on the number of chiral models for all values of n.
