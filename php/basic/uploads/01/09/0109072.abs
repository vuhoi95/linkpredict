Title: Super self-duality for Yang-Mills fields in dimensions greater than four
Authors: Chandrashekar Devchand and Jean Nuyts
Abstract: Self-duality equations for Yang-Mills fields in d-dimensional Euclidean spaces consist of linear algebraic relations amongst the components of the curvature tensor which imply the Yang-Mills equations. For the extension to superspace gauge fields, the super self-duality equations are investigated, namely, systems of linear algebraic relations on the components of the supercurvature, which imply the self-duality equations on the even part of superspace. A group theory based algorithm for finding such systems is developed. Representative examples in various dimensions are provided, including the Spin(7) and G(2) invariant systems in d=8 and 7, respectively.
