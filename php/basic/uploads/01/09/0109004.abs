Title: On the Spectrum of Fluctuations in an Effective Field Theory of the  Ekpyrotic Universe
Authors: R. Brandenberger and F. Finelli
Abstract: We consider the four-dimensional effective field theory which has been used in previous studies of perturbations in the Ekpyrotic Universe, and discuss the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations induced on large scales by quantum fluctuations of the bulk brane. By matching cosmological fluctuations on a constant energy density hypersurface we show that the growing mode during the very slow collapsing pre-impact phase couples only to the decaying mode in the expanding post-impact phase, and that hence no scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations is generated. Note that our conclusions may not apply to improved toy models for the Ekpyrotic scenario.
