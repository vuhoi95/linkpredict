Title: Noncommutative N=2 Supersymmetric Theories in Harmonic Superspace
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and I. B. Samsonov
Abstract: We discuss a formulation of harmonic superspace approach for noncommuative N=2 supersymmetric field theories paying main attention on new features arising because of noncommutativity. We begin with the known notions of the harmonic superfield models and results obtained and consider how these notions and results are modified in the noncommutative case. The actions of basic N=2 models, like hypermultiplet and N=2 vector multiplet, are given in terms of unconstrained off-shell superfields on noncommutative harmonic superspace. We calculate the low-energy contributions to the effective actions of these models. The background field method in noncommutative harmonic superspace is developed and it is applied to study the 1-loop effective action in general noncommutative N=2 model and N=4 SYM theory.
