Title: Finite group discretization of Yang-Mills and Einstein actions
Authors: Leonardo Castellani and Chiara Pagani
Abstract: Discrete versions of the Yang-Mills and Einstein actions are proposed for any finite group. These actions are invariant respectively under local gauge transformations, and under the analogues of Lorentz and general coordinate transformations. The case Z_n \times Z_n \times...\times Z_n is treated in some detail, recovering the Wilson action for Yang-Mills theories, and a new discretized action for gravity.
