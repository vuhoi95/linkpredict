Title: Non-unitary observables in the 2d critical Ising model
Authors: Louis-Pierre Arguin and Yvan Saint-Aubin
Abstract: We introduce three non-local observables for the two-dimensional Ising model. At criticality, conformal field theory may be used to obtain theoretical predictions for their behavior. These formulae are explicit enough to show that their asymptotics are described by highest weights $h_{pq}$ from the Kac table for c=1/2 distinct from those of the three unitary representations (0, 1/16 and 1/2).
