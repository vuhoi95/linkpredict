Title: N-fold Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics - Analyses of Particular  Models -
Authors: Masatoshi Sato and Toshiaki Tanaka
Abstract: We investigate particular models which can be N-fold supersymmetric at specific values of a parameter in the Hamiltonians. The models to be investigated are a periodic potential and a parity-symmetric sextic triple-well potential. Through the quantitative analyses on the non-perturbative contributions to the spectra by the use of the valley method, we show how the characteristic features of N-fold supersymmetry which have been previously reported by the authors can be observed. We also clarify the difference between quasi-exactly solvable and quasi-perturbatively solvable case in view of the dynamical property, that is, dynamical N-fold supersymmetry breaking.
