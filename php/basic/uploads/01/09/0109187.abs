Title: On One-Loop Approximation to Tachyon Potentials
Authors: Oleg Andreev and Tassilo Ott
Abstract: We compute the one-loop corrections to the tachyon potentials in both, bosonic and supersymmetric, cases by worldsheet methods. In the process, we also get some insight on tachyon condensation from the viewpoint of closed string modes and show that there is an instability due to the closed string tachyon in the bosonic case.
