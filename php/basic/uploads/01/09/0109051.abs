Title: Operator product expansion and confinement
Authors: V. Shevchenko and Yu. Simonov
Abstract: Operator product expansion technique is analyzed in abelian and nonabelian nonsupersymmetric field theoretical models with confinement. Special attention is paid to the regimes where nonzero virtuality of vacuum fields is felt by external currents. It is stressed that despite physics of confinement is sometimes considered as being caused by "soft" vacuum gluon fields, it can exhibit pronounced "hard" effects in OPE both in coordinate and momentum spaces.
