Title: Noncommutative QED and Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment
Authors: Xiao-Jun Wang and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: The muon anomalous $g$ value, $a_\mu=(g-2)/2$, is calculated up to one-loop level in noncommutative QED. We argue that relativistic muon in E821 experiment nearly always stays at the lowest Landau level. So that spatial coordinates of muon do not commute each other. Using parameters of E821 experiment, $B=14.5$KG and muon energy 3.09GeV/c, we obtain the noncommutativity correction to $a_\mu$ is about $1.57\times 10^{-9}$, which significantly makes standard model prediction close to experiment.
