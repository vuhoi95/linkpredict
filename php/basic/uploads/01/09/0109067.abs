Title: Lagrangian formulation of the massless higher integer spin fields in the  AdS background
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and A. Pashnev and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: We construct the Lagrangian description of arbitrary integer higher spin massless fields on the background of the D-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The operator constraints in auxiliary Fock space corresponding to subsidiary conditions for irreducible unitary massless representations of the D-dimensional anti-de Sitter group are formulated. Unlike flat space, the algebra of the constraints turns out to be nonlinear and analogous to the $W_3$ algebra. We construct the nilpotent BRST charge for this nonlinear algebra and derive on its basis the correct field content and gauge invariant action describing the consistent arbitrary integer spin field dynamics in $AdS$ space.
