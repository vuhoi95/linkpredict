Title: The Josephson current in Luttinger liquid-superconductor junctions
Authors: J. -S. Caux and H. Saleur and F. Siano
Abstract: We study the Josephson current through a Luttinger liquid in contact with two superconductors. We show that it can be deduced from the Casimir energy in a two-boundary version of the sine-Gordon model. We develop a new thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, which, combined with a subtle analytic continuation procedure, allows us to calculate this energy in closed form, and obtain the complete current-crossover function from the case of complete normal to complete Andreev reflection.
