Title: Summing the derivative expansion of the effective action
Authors: Eduard Masso and Francesc Rota
Abstract: The derivative expansion of the effective action is a perturbative development in derivatives of the fields. The expansion breaks down when some of the derivatives are too large. We show how to sum exactly the first and second derivatives and treat perturbatively derivatives higher than second.
