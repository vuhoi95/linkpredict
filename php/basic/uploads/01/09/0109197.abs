Title: Novel Type I Compactifications
Authors: David R. Morrison and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We argue that there are two distinct classes of type I compactification to four dimensions on any space. These two classes are distinguished in a mysterious way by the presence (or absence) of a discrete 6-form potential. In simple examples, duality suggests that the new class of compactifications have reduced numbers of moduli. We also point out analogous discrete choices in M, F and type II compactifications, including some with $G_2$ holonomy. These choices often result in spaces with frozen singularities.
