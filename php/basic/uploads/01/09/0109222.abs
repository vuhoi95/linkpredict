Title: The Three-Dimensional Noncommutative Nonlinear Sigma Model in Superspace
Authors: H. O. Girotti and M. Gomes and A. Yu. Petrov and V. O. Rivelles and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We study the superspace formulation of the noncommutative nonlinear supersymmetric O(N) invariant sigma-model in 2+1 dimensions. We prove that the model is renormalizable to all orders of 1/N and explicitly verify that the model is asymptotically free.
