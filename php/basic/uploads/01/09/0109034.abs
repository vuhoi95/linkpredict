Abstract: The solitons of the SO(3) gauged Skyrme model with no pion-mass potential were studied in Refs. {nl,jmp}. Here, the effects of the inclusion of this potential are studied. In contrast with the (ungauged) Skyrme model, where the effect of this potential on the solitons is marginal, here it turns out to be decisive, resulting in very different dependence of the energy as a function of the Skyrme coupling constant.
