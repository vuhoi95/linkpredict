Title: Aspects of Higher Order Gravity and Holography
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and L. Alejandro Correa-Borbonet
Abstract: Some thermodynamical properties of Lovelock gravity are discussed in several space-time dimensions, the holographic principle being one of the ingredients of the discussion. As it turns out, the area law and the brickwall method, though correct for the Einstein-Hilbert theory, may fail to work in general.
