Title: Rest masses of elementary particles as effective masses at zero  temperature
Authors: Carlos Quimbay and John Morales
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to generate dinamically the masses of elementary particles in the $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ Standard Model without Higgs Sector (SMWHS). We start from the assumption that rest masses correspond to the effective masses of particles in an elementary quantum fluid at zero temperature. These effective masses are obtained through radiative corrections, at one-loop order, in the context of the real time formalism of quantum field theory at finite temperature and density. The quantum fluid is described in structure and dynamics by the SMWHS and it is characterized by non-vanishing chemical potentials associated to the different fermion flavour species. Starting from the experimental mass values for quarks and leptons, taking the top quark mass as $m_t = 172.916$ GeV, we can compute, as an evidence of the consistency of our approach, the experimental central mass values for the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ gauge bosons. Subsequently we introduce in the SMWHS a massless scalar field leading to Yukawa coupling terms in the Lagrangian density. For this case we can also compute the experimental mass central values of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ gauge bosons using a top quark mass value in the range 169.2 GeV $< m_{t} < 178.6$ GeV; this range for the top quark mass implies that the scalar boson mass must be in the range $0 < M_{H} < 152$ GeV.
