Title: Three-Point Functions of Quarter BPS Operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and Anton V. Ryzhov
Abstract: In a recent paper hep-th/0109064, quarter-BPS chiral primaries were constructed in the fully interacting four dimensional N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). These operators are annihilated by four supercharges, and at order g^2 have protected scaling dimension and normalization. Here, we compute three-point functions involving these quarter-BPS operators along with half-BPS operators. The combinatorics of the problem is rather involved, and we consider the following special cases: (1) correlators < half half BPS > of two half-BPS primaries with an arbitrary chiral primary; (2) certain classes of < half quarter quarter > and < quarter quarter quarter > three-point functions; (3) three-point functions involving the Delta < 8 operators found in hep-th/0109064; (4) < half quarter quarter> correlators with the special quarter-BPS operator made of single and double trace operators only. The analysis in cases (1)-(3) is valid for general N, while (4) is a large N approximation. Order g^2 corrections to all three-point functions considered in this paper are found to vanish. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, quarter-BPS chiral primaries are dual to threshold bound states of elementary supergravity excitations. We present a supergravity discussion of two- and three-point correlators involving these bound states.
