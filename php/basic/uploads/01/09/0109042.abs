Title: On structure of superon-graviton model(SGM)
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: The fundamental action of superon-graviton model(SGM) for space-time and matter is written down explicitly in terms of the fields of the graviton and superons by using the affine and the spin connection formalisms, alternatively. Some characteristic structures including some hidden symmetries of the gravitational coupling of superons are manifested (in two dimensional space-time) with some details of the calculations. SGM cosmology is discussed briefly.
