Title: Monte-Carlo Simulation of Domain-Wall Network in Two-dimensional  Extended Supersymmetric Theory
Authors: Nobuyuki Motoyui and Shogo Tominaga and Mitsuru Yamada
Abstract: We will show that 2-dimensional N=2-extended supersymmetric theory can have solitonic solution using the Hamilton-Jacobi method of classical mechanics. Then it is shown that the Bogomol'nyi mass bound is saturated by these solutions and triangular mass inequality is satisfied. At the end, we will mention domain-wall structure in 3-dimensional spacetime.
