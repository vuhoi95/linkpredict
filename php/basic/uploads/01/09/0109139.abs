Title: Classical electromagnetic field theory in the presence of magnetic  sources
Authors: Wen-Jun Chen and Kang Li and Carlos Na√≥n
Abstract: Using two new well defined 4-dimensional potential vectors, we formulate the classical Maxwell's field theory in a form which has manifest Lorentz covariance and SO(2) duality symmetry in the presence of magnetic sources. We set up a consistent Lagrangian for the theory. Then from the action principle we get both Maxwell's equation and the equation of motion of a dyon moving in the electro-magnetic field.
