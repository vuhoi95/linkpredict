Title: Short Distance Physics and the Consistency Relation for Scalar and  Tensor Fluctuations in the Inflationary Universe
Authors: Lam Hui and William H. Kinney
Abstract: Recent discussions suggest the possibility that short distance physics can significantly modify the behavior of quantum fluctuations in the inflationary universe, and alter the standard large scale structure predictions. Such modifications can be viewed as due to a different choice of the vacuum state. We show that such changes generally lead to violations of the well-known consistency relation between the scalar to tensor ratio and the tensor spectral index. Vacuum effects can introduce an observable modulation to the usual predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra.
