Title: Brane Gas Inflation
Authors: M. F. Parry and D. A. Steer
Abstract: We consider the brane gas picture of the early universe. At later stages, when there are no winding modes and the background is free to expand, we show that a moving 3-brane, which we identify with our universe, can inflate even though it is radiation-dominated. The crucial ingredients for successful inflation are the coupling to the dilaton and the equation of state of the bulk. If we suppose the brane initially forms in a collision of higher-dimensional branes, then the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations naturally has a thermal origin.
