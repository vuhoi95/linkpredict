Title: Off-Diagonal Metrics and Anisotropic Brane Inflation
Authors: Sergiu I. Vacaru and Denis Gontsa
Abstract: We study anisotropic reheating (entropy production) on 3D brane from a decaying bulk scalar field in the brane-world picture of the Universe by considering off-diagonal metrics and anholonomic frames. We show that a significant amount of, in general, anisotropic dark radiation is produced in this process unless only the modes which satisfy a specific relation are excited. We conclude that subsequent entropy production within the brane is required in general before primordial nucleosynthesis and that the presence of off-diagonal components (like in the Salam, Strathee and Petracci works) of the bulk metric modifies the processes of entropy production which could substantially change the brane-world picture of the Universe.
