Title: Magnetic Brane-worlds
Authors: John D. Barrow and Sigbjorn Hervik
Abstract: We investigate brane-worlds with a pure magnetic field and a perfect fluid. We extend earlier work to brane-worlds, and find new properties of the Bianchi type I brane-world. We find new asymptotic behaviours on approach to the singularity and classify the critical points of the dynamical phase space. It is known that the Einstein equations for the magnetic Bianchi type I models are in general oscillatory and are believed to be chaotic, but in the brane-world model this chaotic behaviour does not seem to be possible.
