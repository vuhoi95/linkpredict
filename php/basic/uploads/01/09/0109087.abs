Title: SUSY Breaking by Stable non-BPS Walls
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai and Yutaka Sakamura and Ryo Sugisaka
Abstract: A new simple mechanism for SUSY breaking is proposed due to the coexistence of BPS domain walls. It is assumed that our world is on a BPS domain wall and that the other BPS wall breaks the SUSY preserved by our wall. This mechanism requires no messenger fields nor complicated SUSY breaking sector on any of the walls. We obtain an ${\cal N}=1$ model in four dimensions which has an exact solution of a stable non-BPS configuration of two walls. We propose that the overlap of the wave functions of the N-G fermion and those of physical fields provides a practical method to evaluate SUSY breaking mass splitting on our wall thanks to a low-energy theorem. This is based on our recent works hep-th/0009023 and hep-th/0107204.
