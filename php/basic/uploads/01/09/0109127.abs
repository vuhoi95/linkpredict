Title: Semi-classical States in the Context of Constrained Systems
Authors: G. Date and Parampreet Singh
Abstract: Algebraic quantization scheme has been proposed as an extension of the Dirac quantization scheme for constrained systems. Semi-classical states for constrained systems is also an independent and important issue, particularly in the context of quantum geometry. In this work we explore this issue within the framework of algebraic quantization scheme by means of simple explicit examples. We obtain semi-classical states as suitable coherent states a la Perelomov. Remarks on possible generalizations are also included.
