Title: Hamiltonian formulation of nonAbelian noncommutative gauge theories
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Franz A. Farias
Abstract: We implement the Hamiltonian treatment of a nonAbelian noncommutative gauge theory, considering with some detail the algebraic structure of the noncommutative symmetry group. The first class constraints and Hamiltonian are obtained and their algebra derived, as well as the form of the gauge invariance they impose on the first order action.
