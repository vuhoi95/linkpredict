Title: Implication of Brane fluctuations to indirect collider signals
Authors: Seong Chan Park and Hee Sung Song
Abstract: We study the effect of brane fluctuation on the indirect signals of high energy colliders. Brane fluctuation could act as a regulator of divergent expression of infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein graviton effects. The phenomenological parameter $\lambda$, introduced by Hewett, is shown to be determined in our setting, and its dramatic behaviors depending on the $D=4+\delta$ dimensional gravitation scale $M_D$, `softening parameter' $\Delta$, and $\sqrt{s}$ of collider are presented. The present exclusion bounds from the processes $e^+e^-\to \gamma\gamma$ and $p\bar{p}\to e^+ e^-, \gamma\gamma(\gamma)$ are considered within the parameter space $(M_D, \Delta)$ with respect to the number of extra dimensions.
