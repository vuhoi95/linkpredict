Title: Charges and Currents in the Noncommutative Chern-Simons Theory of the  QHE
Authors: T. H. Hansson and A. Karlhede
Abstract: We couple the noncommutative Chern-Simons theory describing the fractional quantum Hall effect to external magnetic and electric potentials, and derive expressions for charge and current densities. To lowest non-trivial order the density operator satisfies the commutator algebra characteristic of the lowest Landau level. We take this as a strong indication that the theory correctly describes point particles in a strong magnetic field. We also obtain the correct QH response to a constant electric field, and density modulations in response to a weak variable magnetic field.
