Title: Classical self-forces in a space with a dispiration
Authors: V. A. De Lorenci and E. S. Moreira Jr
Abstract: We derive the gravitational and electrostatic self-energies of a particle at rest in the background of a cosmic dispiration (topological defect), finding that the particle may experience potential steps, well potentials or potential barriers depending on the nature of the interaction and also on certain properties of the defect. The results may turn out to be useful in cosmology and condensed matter physics.
