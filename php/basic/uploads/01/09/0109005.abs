Title: The Minimal Unitary Representation of E_8(8)
Authors: M. Gunaydin and K. Koepsell and H. Nicolai
Abstract: We give a new construction of the minimal unitary representation of the exceptional group E_8(8) on a Hilbert space of complex functions in 29 variables. Due to their manifest covariance with respect to the E_7(7) subgroup of E_8(8) our formulas are simpler than previous realizations, and thus well suited for applications in superstring and M theory.
