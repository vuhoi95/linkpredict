Title: Mother Moose: Generating Extra Dimensions from Simple Groups at Large N
Authors: Ira Rothstein and Witold Skiba
Abstract: We show that there exists a correspondence between four dimensional gauge theories with simple groups and higher dimensional gauge theories at large N. As an example, we show that a four dimensional {N}=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory, on the Higgs branch, has the same correlators as a five dimensional SU(N) gauge theory in the limit of large N provided the couplings are appropriately rescaled. We show that our results can be applied to the AdS/CFT correspondence to derive correlators of five or more dimensional gauge theories from solutions of five dimensional supergravity in the large t'Hooft coupling limit.
