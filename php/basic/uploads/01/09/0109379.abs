Title: Decelerating universes older than their Hubble times
Authors: J. C. Jackson and Marina Dodgson
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that Hubble's constant is large, and hence that the Universe appears to be younger than some of its constituents. The traditional escape route, which assumes that the expansion is accelerating, appears to be blocked by observations of Type 1a supernovae, which suggest(ed) that the Universe is decelerating. These observations are reconciled in a model in which the Universe has experienced an inflationary phase in the recent past, driven by an ultra-light inflaton whose Compton wavelength is of the same order as the Hubble radius.
