Title: Supersymmetric Polytropic Gas Dynamics
Authors: Ashok Das and Ziemowit Popowicz
Abstract: We construct the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the polytropic gas dynamics. We give both the Lagrangian as well as the Hamiltonian description of this system. We construct the infinite set of "Eulerian'' conserved charges associated with this system and show that they are in involution, thereby proving complete integrability of this system. We construct the SUSY -B extension of this system as well and comment on the similarities and differences between this system and an earlier construction of the supersymmetric Chaplygin gas. We also derive the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the elastic medium equations, which, however, do not appear to be integrable.
