Title: Perturbation Calculation of the Axial Anomaly of a Ginsparg-Wilson  lattice Dirac operator
Authors: Ting-Wai Chiu and Tung-Han Hsieh
Abstract: A recent proposal suggests that even if a Ginsparg-Wilson lattice Dirac operator does not possess any topological zero modes in topologically-nontrivial gauge backgrounds, it can reproduce correct axial anomaly for sufficiently smooth gauge configurations, provided that it is exponentially-local, doublers-free, and has correct continuum behavior. In this paper, we calculate the axial anomaly of this lattice Dirac operator in weak coupling perturbation theory, and show that it recovers the topological charge density in the continuum limit.
