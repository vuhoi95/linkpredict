Title: Non-minimal coupling for spin 3/2 fields
Authors: Victor M. Villanueva and Juan A. Nieto and and Octavio Obregon
Abstract: The problem of the electromagnetic coupling for spin 3/2 fields is discussed. Following supergravity and some recent works in the field of classical supersymmetric particles, we find that the electromagnetic coupling must not obey a minimal coupling in the sense that one needs to consider not only the electromagnetic potential but also the coupling of the electromagnetic field strenght. This coupling coincides with the one found by Ferrara {\it et al} by requiring that the gyromagnetic ratio be 2. Coupling with non-Abelian Yang-Mills fields is also discussed.
