Title: Total Variation and Variational Symplectic-Energy-Momentum integrators
Authors: Jing-Bo Chen and Han-Ying Guo and Ke Wu
Abstract: A discrete total variation calculus with variable time steps is presented in this letter. Using this discrete variation calculus, we generalize Lee's discrete mechanics and derive variational symplectic-energy-momentum integrators by Kane, Marsden and Ortiz. The relationship among discrete total variation, Lee's discrete mechanics and Kane-Marsden-Ortiz's integrators is explored.
