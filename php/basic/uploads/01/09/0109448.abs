Title: Stable Skyrmions in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Richard A. Battye and N. R. Cooper and Paul M. Sutcliffe
Abstract: We show that stable Skyrmions exist in two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, in the regime of phase separation. Using full three-dimensional simulations we find the stable Skyrmions with topological charges Q=1 and 2, and compute their properties. With reference to these computations we suggest the salient features of an experimental setup in which they might realized.
