Title: Vortices in Theories with Flat Directions
Authors: A. Achucarro and A. C. Davis and M. Pickles and J. Urrestilla
Abstract: In theories with flat directions containing vortices, such as supersymmetric QED, there is a vacuum selection effect in the allowed asymptotic configurations. We explain the role played by gauge fields in this effect and give a simple criterion for determining what vacua will be chosen, namely those that minimise the vector mass. We then consider the effect of vacuum selection on stable (BPS) non-topological vortices in a simple Abelian model with N=2 supersymmetry which occurs as a low energy limit of Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II superstrings. In this case the magnetic flux spreads over an arbitrarily large area. We discuss the implications for cosmology and for superstring inspired magnetic confinement scenarios.
