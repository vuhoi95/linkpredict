Title: The Fuzzy Kaehler Coset Space with the Darboux Coordinates
Authors: Shogo Aoyama and Takahiro Masuda
Abstract: The Fedosov deformation quantization of the symplectic manifold is determined by a 1-form differential r. We identify a class of r for which the $\star$ product becomes the Moyal product by taking appropriate Darboux coordinates, but invariant by canonically transforming the coordinates. This respect of the $\star$ product is explained by studying the fuzzy algebrae of the Kaehler coset space.
