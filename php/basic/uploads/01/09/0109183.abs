Title: Goldstone multiplet for partially broken superconformal symmetry
Authors: S. M. Kuzenko and I. N. McArthur
Abstract: The bosonic parts of D3-brane actions in AdS(5) backgrounds are known to have symmetries which are field-dependent extensions of conformal transformations of the worldvolume coordinates. Using the coset space SU(2,2|1)/SO(4,1), we apply the method of nonlinear realizations to construct a four-dimensional N = 1 off-shell supersymmetric action which has a generalized field-dependent superconformal invariance. The Goldstone fields for broken scale, chiral and S-supersymmetry transformations form a chiral supermultiplet.
