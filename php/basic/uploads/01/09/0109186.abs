Title: Particle-vortex dynamics in noncommutative space
Authors: D. H. Correa and G. S. Lozano and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study the problem of a charged particle in the presence of a uniform magnetic field plus a vortex in noncommutative planar space considering the two possible non-commutative extensions of the corresponding Hamiltonian, namely the ``fundamental'' and the ``antifundamental'' representations. Using a Fock space formalism we construct eigenfunctions and eigenvalues finding in each case half of the states existing in the ordinary space case. In the limit of $\theta \to 0$ we recover the two classes of states found in ordinary space, relevant for the study of anyon physics.
