Title: Gravitational Condensate Stars: An Alternative to Black Holes
Authors: Pawel O. Mazur and Emil Mottola
Abstract: A new solution for the endpoint of gravitational collapse is proposed. By extending the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation to gravitational systems, a cold, compact object with an interior de Sitter condensate phase and an exterior Schwarzschild geometry of arbitrary total mass M is constructed. These are separated by a phase boundary with a small but finite thickness of fluid with eq. of state p=+\rho, replacing both the Schwarzschild and de Sitter classical horizons. The new solution has no singularities, no event horizons, and a global time. Its entropy is maximized under small fluctuations and is given by the standard hydrodynamic entropy of the thin shell, instead of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Unlike black holes, a collapsed star of this kind is thermodynamically stable and has no information paradox.
