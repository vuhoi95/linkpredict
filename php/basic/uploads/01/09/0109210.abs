Title: A conformally invariant differential operator on Weyl tensor densities
Authors: Thomas Branson and A. Rod Gover
Abstract: We derive a tensorial formula for a fourth-order conformally invariant differential operator on conformal 4-manifolds. This operator is applied to algebraic Weyl tensor densities of a certain conformal weight, and takes its values in algebraic Weyl tensor densities of another weight. For oriented manifolds, this operator reverses duality: For example in the Riemannian case, it takes self-dual to anti-self-dual tensors and vice versa. We also examine the place that this operator occupies in known results on the classification of conformally invariant operators, and we examine some related operators.
