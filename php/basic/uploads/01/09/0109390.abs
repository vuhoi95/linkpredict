Title: Duality Between the Weak and Strong Interaction Limits for Randomly  Interacting Fermions
Authors: Philippe Jacquod and Imre Varga
Abstract: We establish the existence of a duality transformation for generic models of interacting fermions with two-body interactions. The eigenstates at weak and strong interaction U possess similar statistical properties when expressed in the U=0 and U=infinity eigenstates bases respectively. This implies the existence of a duality point U_d where the eigenstates have the same spreading in both bases. U_d is surrounded by an interval of finite width which is characterized by a non Lorentzian spreading of the strength function in both bases. Scaling arguments predict the survival of this intermediate regime as the number of particles is increased.
