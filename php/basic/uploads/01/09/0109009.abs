Authors: Xiang-Mao Ding and Mark D. Gould and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: Motivated by applications of twisted current algebras in description of the entropy of $Ads_3$ black hole, we investigate the simplest twisted current algebra $sl(3,{\bf C})^{(2)}_k$. Free field representation of the twisted algebra and the corresponding twisted Sugawara energy-momentum tensor are obtained by using three $(\beta,\gamma)$ pairs and two scalar fields. Primary fields and two screening currents of the first kind are presented.
