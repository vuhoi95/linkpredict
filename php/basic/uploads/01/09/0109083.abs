Title: Integrable Lattice Realizations of N=1 Superconformal Boundary  Conditions
Authors: Christoph Richard and Paul A. Pearce
Abstract: We construct integrable boundary conditions for sl(2) coset models with central charges c=3/2-12/(m(m+2)) and m=3,4,... The associated cylinder partition functions are generating functions for the branching functions but these boundary conditions manifestly break the superconformal symmetry. We show that there are additional integrable boundary conditions, satisfying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation, which respect the superconformal symmetry and lead to generating functions for the superconformal characters in both Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz sectors. We also present general formulas for the cylinder partition functions. This involves an alternative derivation of the superconformal Verlinde formula recently proposed by Nepomechie.
