Title: A Note on Invariants and Entanglements
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: The quantum entanglements are studied in terms of the invariants under local unitary transformations. A generalized formula of concurrence for $N$-dimensional quantum systems is presented. This generalized concurrence has potential applications in studying separability and calculating entanglement of formation for high dimensional mixed quantum states.
