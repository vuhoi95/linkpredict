Title: Separability of Rank Two Quantum States
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei and Debashish Goswami
Abstract: Explicit sufficient and necessary conditions for separability of higher dimensional quantum systems with rank two density matrices are given. A nonseparability inequality is also presented, for the case where one of the eigenvectors corresponding to nonzero eigenvalues is a maximally entangled state.
