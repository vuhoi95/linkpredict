Title: Linear Sigma Models for Open Strings
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Shamit Kachru and Albion Lawrence and John McGreevy
Abstract: We formulate and study a class of massive N=2 supersymmetric gauge field theories coupled to boundary degrees of freedom on the strip. For some values of the parameters, the infrared limits of these theories can be interpreted as open string sigma models describing D-branes in large-radius Calabi-Yau compactifications. For other values of the parameters, these theories flow to CFTs describing branes in more exotic, non-geometric phases of the Calabi-Yau moduli space such as the Landau-Ginzburg orbifold phase. Some simple properties of the branes (like large radius monodromies and spectra of worldvolume excitations) can be computed in our model. We also provide simple worldsheet models of the transitions which occur at loci of marginal stability, and of Higgs-Coulomb transitions.
