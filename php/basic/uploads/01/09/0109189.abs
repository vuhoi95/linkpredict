Title: Finite Temperature Behavior of the 3D Polyakov Model with Massless  Quarks
Authors: Nikita O. Agasian and Dmitri Antonov
Abstract: The (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow (or Polyakov) model with the additional fundamental massless quarks is explored at finite temperature. In the case of vanishing Yukawa coupling, it is demonstrated that the interaction of a monopole and an antimonopole in the molecule via quark zero modes leads to the decrease of the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature when the number of quark flavors is equal to one. If the number of flavors becomes larger, monopoles are shown to exist only in the molecular phase at any temperatures exceeding a certain exponentially small one. This means that for such a number of flavors and at such temperatures, no fundamental matter can be confined by means of the monopole mechanism.
