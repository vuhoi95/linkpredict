Title: Once again: Instanton method vs. WKB
Authors: H. J. W. MÃ¼ller-Kirsten and Jian-zu Zhang and Yunbo Zhang
Abstract: A recent analytic test of the instanton method performed by comparing the exact spectrum of the Lam${\acute e}$ potential (derived from representations of a finite dimensional matrix expressed in terms of $su(2)$ generators) with the results of the tight--binding and instanton approximations as well as the standard WKB approximation is commented upon. It is pointed out that in the case of the Lam${\acute e}$ potential as well as others the WKB--related method of matched asymptotic expansions yields the exact instanton result as a result of boundary conditions imposed on wave functions which are matched in domains of overlap.
