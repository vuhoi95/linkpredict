Title: Metafluid dynamics as a gauge field theory
Authors: A. C. Rodrigues Mendes and W. Oliveira and C. Neves and F. I. Takakura
Abstract: In this paper, the analog of Maxwell electromagnetism for hydrodynamic turbulence, the metafluid dynamics, is extended in order to reformulate the metafluid dynamics as a gauge field theory. That analogy opens up the possibility to investigate this theory as a constrained system. Having this possibility in mind, we propose a Lagrangian to describe this new theory of turbulence and, subsequently, analyze it from the symplectic point of view. From this analysis, a hidden gauge symmetry is revealed, providing a clear interpretation and meaning of the physics behind the metafluid theory. Further, the geometrical interpretation to the gauge symmetries is discussed and the spectrum for 3D turbulence computed.
