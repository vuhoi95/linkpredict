Title: Coherent States and Geometric Phases in Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: Dae-Yup Song and JeongHyeong Park
Abstract: Exact coherent states in the Calogero-Sutherland models (of time-dependent parameters) which describe identical harmonic oscillators interacting through inverse-square potentials are constructed, in terms of the classical solutions of a harmonic oscillator. For quasi-periodic coherent states of the time-periodic systems, geometric phases are evaluated. For the $A_{N-1}$ Calogero-Sutherland model, the phase is calculated for a general coherent state. The phases for other models are also considered.
