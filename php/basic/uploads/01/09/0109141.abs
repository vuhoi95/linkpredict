Title: Hyperkahler Metrics from Periodic Monopoles
Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: Relative moduli spaces of periodic monopoles provide novel examples of Asymptotically Locally Flat hyperkahler manifolds. By considering the interactions between well-separated periodic monopoles, we infer the asymptotic behavior of their metrics. When the monopole moduli space is four-dimensional, this construction yields interesting examples of metrics with self-dual curvature (gravitational instantons). We discuss their topology and complex geometry. An alternative construction of these gravitational instantons using moduli spaces of Hitchin equations is also described.
