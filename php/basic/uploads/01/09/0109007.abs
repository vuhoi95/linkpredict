Title: Weierstrass P-lumps
Authors: RJ Cova and WJ Zakrzewski
Abstract: We present our results of a numerical investigation of the behaviour of a system of two solitons in the (2+1) dimensional $CP^1$ model on a torus. Defined by the elliptic function of Weierstrass, and working in the Skyrme version of the model, the soliton lumps exhibit splitting, scattering at right angles and motion reversal in the various configurations considered. The work is restricted to systems with no initial velocity.
