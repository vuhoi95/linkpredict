Title: Local Casimir Energy For Solitons
Authors: Alfred Scharff Goldhaber and Andrei Litvintsev and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: Direct calculation of the one-loop contributions to the energy density of bosonic and supersymmetric phi-to-the-fourth kinks exhibits: (1) Local mode regularization. Requiring the mode density in the kink and the trivial sectors to be equal at each point in space yields the anomalous part of the energy density. (2) Phase space factorization. A striking position-momentum factorization for reflectionless potentials gives the non-anomalous energy density a simple relation to that for the bound state. For the supersymmetric kink, our expression for the energy density (both the anomalous and non-anomalous parts) agrees with the published central charge density, whose anomalous part we also compute directly by point-splitting regularization. Finally we show that, for a scalar field with arbitrary scalar background potential in one space dimension, point-splitting regularization implies local mode regularization of the Casimir energy density.
