Title: Large Gauged Q Balls

Abstract: We study Q-balls associated with local U(1) symmetries. Such Q-balls are expected to become unstable for large values of their charge because of the repulsion mediated by the gauge force. We consider the possibility that the repulsion is eliminated through the presence in the interior of the Q-ball of fermions with charge opposite to that of the scalar condensate. Another possibility is that two scalar condensates of opposite charge form in the interior. We demonstrate that both these scenaria can lead to the existence of classically stable, large, gauged Q-balls. We present numerical solutions, as well as an analytical treatment of the ``thin-wall'' limit.
