Title: Remarks on A-branes, Mirror Symmetry, and the Fukaya category
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Dmitri Orlov
Abstract: We discuss D-branes of the topological A-model (A-branes), which are believed to be closely related to the Fukaya category. We give string theory arguments which show that A-branes are not necessarily Lagrangian submanifolds in the Calabi-Yau: more general coisotropic branes are also allowed, if the line bundle on the brane is not flat. We show that a coisotropic A-brane has a natural structure of a foliated manifold with a transverse holomorphic structure. We argue that the Fukaya category must be enlarged with such objects for the Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture to be true.
