Title: DLCQ of Fivebranes, Large N Screening, and L^2 Harmonic Forms on Calabi  Manifolds
Authors: Chanju Kim and Kimyeong Lee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We find one explicit L^2 harmonic form for every Calabi manifold. Calabi manifolds are known to arise in low energy dynamics of solitons in Yang-Mills theories, and the L^2 harmonic form corresponds to the supersymmetric ground state. As the normalizable ground state of a single U(N) instanton, it is related to the bound state of a single D0 to multiple coincident D4's in the non-commutative setting, or equivalently a unit Kaluza-Klein mode in DLCQ of fivebrane worldvolume theory. As the ground state of nonabelian massless monopoles realized around a monopole-``anti''-monopole pair, it shows how the long range force between the pair is screened in a manner reminiscent of large N behavior of quark-anti-quark potential found in AdS/CFT correspondence.
