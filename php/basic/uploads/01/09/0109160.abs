Title: Yang-Mills Integrals
Authors: G. M. Cicuta and L. Molinari and G. Vernizzi
Abstract: Two results are presented for reduced Yang-Mills integrals with different symmetry groups and dimensions: the first is a compact integral representation in terms of the relevant variables of the integral, the second is a method to analytically evaluate the integrals in cases of low order. This is exhibited by evaluating a Yang-Mills integral over real symmetric matrices of order 3.
