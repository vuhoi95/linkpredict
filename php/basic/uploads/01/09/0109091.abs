Title: Newtonian Counterparts of Spin 2 Massless Discontinuities
Authors: S. Deser and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: Massive spin 2 theories in flat or cosmological ($\Lambda \ne 0$) backgrounds are subject to discontinuities as the masses tend to zero. We show and explain physically why their Newtonian limits do not inherit this behaviour. On the other hand, conventional ``Newtonian cosmology'', where $\Lambda $ is a constant source of the potential, displays discontinuities: e.g. for any finite range, $\Lambda$ can be totally removed.
