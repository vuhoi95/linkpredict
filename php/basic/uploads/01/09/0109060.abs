Title: Nonlinear sigma models solvable by the Aratyn-Ferreira-Zimerman ansatz
Authors: Minoru Hirayama and Chang-Guang Shi
Abstract: Nonlinear sigma models compatible with the aratyn-Ferreira-Zimerman ansatz are discussed, the latter ansatz automatically leading to configurations with definite values of the Hopf index. These models are allowed to involve a weight factor which is a function of one of the toroidal coordinates. Depending on the choice of the weight factor, the field equation takes various forms. In one model with a special weight factor, the field equation turns out to be the fifth Painleve equation. This model suggests the existence of a knot soliton strictly confined in a finite spatial volume. Some other interesting cases are also discussed.
