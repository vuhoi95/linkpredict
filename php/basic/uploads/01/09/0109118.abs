Title: Conformal Gaussian Approximation
Authors: Aníbal Iucci and Carlos Naón
Abstract: We present an alternative way to determine the unknown parameter associated to a gaussian approximation in a generic two-dimensional model. Instead of the standard variational approach, we propose a procedure based on a quantitative prediction of conformal invariance, valid for systems in the scaling regime, away from criticality. We illustrate our idea by considering, as an example, the sine-Gordon model. Our method gives a good approximation for the soliton mass as function of $\beta$.
