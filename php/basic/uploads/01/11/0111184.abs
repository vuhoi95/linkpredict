Title: A Note on Invariant Measure on the Local Gauge Group
Authors: Wei-Min Sun and Xiang-Song Chen and Fan Wang
Abstract: In this paper we investigated the problem of the existence of invariant meaures on the local gauge group. We prove that it is impossible to define a {\it finite} translationally invariant measure on the local gauge group $C^{\infty}({\bf R}^n,G)$(where $G$ is an arbitrary matrix Lie group).
