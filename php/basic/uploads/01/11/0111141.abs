Title: Clock-Comparison Tests of Lorentz and CPT Symmetry in Space
Authors: Robert Bluhm and Alan Kostelecky and Charles Lane and Neil Russell
Abstract: Clock-comparison experiments conducted in space can provide access to many unmeasured coefficients for Lorentz and CPT violation. The orbital configuration of a satellite platform and the relatively large velocities attainable in a deep-space mission would permit a broad range of tests with Planck-scale sensitivity.
