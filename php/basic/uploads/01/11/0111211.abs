Title: $CP^{1}$ model with Hopf term and fractional spin statistics
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Bum-Hoon Lee and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We reconsider the $CP^{1}$ model with the Hopf term by using the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) scheme, which is an improved version of the Dirac quantization method. We also perform a semi-classical quantization of the topological charge Q sector by exploiting the collective coordinates to explicitly show the fractional spin statistics.
