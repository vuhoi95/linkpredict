Title: Interacting Dipoles from Matrix Formulation of Noncommutative Gauge  Theories
Authors: Li Jiang and Eric Nicholson
Abstract: We study the IR behavior of noncommutative gauge theory in the matrix formulation. We find that in this approach, the nature of the UV/IR mixing is easily understood, which allows us to perform a reliable calculation of the quantum effective action for the long wavelength modes of the noncommutative gauge field. At one loop, we find that our description is weakly coupled only in the supersymmetric theory. At two loops, we find non-trivial interaction terms suggestive of dipole degrees of freedom. These dipoles exhibit a channel duality reminiscent of string theory.
