Title: New analytic running coupling in QCD: higher loop levels
Authors: A. V. Nesterenko and I. L. Solovtsov
Abstract: The properties of the new analytic running coupling are investigated at the higher loop levels. The expression for this invariant charge, independent of the normalization point, is obtained by invoking the asymptotic freedom condition. It is shown that at any loop level the relevant $\beta$ function has the universal behaviors at small and large values of the invariant charge. Due to this feature the new analytic running coupling possesses the universal asymptotics both in the ultraviolet and infrared regions irrespective of the loop level. The consistency of the model considered with the general definition of the QCD invariant charge is shown.
