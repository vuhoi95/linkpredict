Title: Cosmological Constraints on Lorentz Violation in Electrodynamics
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Matthew Mewes
Abstract: Infrared, optical, and ultraviolet spectropolarimetry of cosmological sources is used to constrain the pure electromagnetic sector of a general Lorentz-violating standard-model extension. The coefficients for Lorentz violation are bounded to less than 3x10^{-32}.
