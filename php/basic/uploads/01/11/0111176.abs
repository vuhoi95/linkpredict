Title: Loop Quantum Gravity Corrections and Cosmic Ray Decays
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Gonzalo Palma
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity effective theories are reviewed in the context of the observed GZK limit anomaly and related processes. This is accomplished through a kinematical analysis of the modified threshold conditions for the involved decay reactions, arising from the theory. Specially interesting is the possibility of an helicity dependant violation of the limit, whose primary effect would be the observation of favoured helicity states for highly energetic particles.
