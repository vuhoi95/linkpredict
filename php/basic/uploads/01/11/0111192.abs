Title: On the Invariance of Residues of Feynman Graphs
Authors: Isabella Bierenbaum and Richard Kreckel and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: We use simple iterated one-loop graphs in massless Yukawa theory and QED to pose the following question: what are the symmetries of the residues of a graph under a permutation of places to insert subdivergences. The investigation confirms partial invariance of the residue under such permutations: the highest weight transcendental is invariant under such a permutation. For QED this result is gauge invariant, ie the permutation invariance holds for any gauge. Computations are done making use of the Hopf algebra structure of graphs and employing GiNaC to automate the calculations.
