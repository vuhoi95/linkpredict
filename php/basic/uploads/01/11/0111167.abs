Title: Gravitational field around a screwed superconducting cosmic string in  scalar-tensor theories
Authors: V. B. Bezerra and C. N. Ferreira
Abstract: We obtain the solution that corresponds to a screwed superconducting cosmic string (SSCS) in the framework of a general scalar-tensor theory including torsion. We investigate the metric of the SSCS in Brans-Dicke theory with torsion and analyze the case without torsion. We show that in the case with torsion the space-time background presents other properties different from that in which torsion is absent. When the spin vanish, this torsion is a $\phi$-gradient and then it propagates outside of the string. We investigate the effect of torsion on the gravitational force and on the geodesics of a test-particle moving around the SSCS. The accretion of matter by wakes formation when a SSCS moves with speed $v $ is investigated. We compare our results with those obtained for cosmic strings in the framework of scalar-tensor theory.
