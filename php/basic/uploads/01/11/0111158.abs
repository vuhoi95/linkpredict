Title: Duality and Integrability of Two Dimensional String Effective Action
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Maharana and A. Melikyan
Abstract: We present a prescription for constructing the monodromy matrix, $\hat{\cal M}(\omega)$, for $O(d,d)$ invariant string effective actions and derive its transformation properties under the $T$-duality group. This allows us to construct $\hat{\cal M}(\omega)$ for new backgrounds, starting from known ones, which are related by $T$-duality. As an application, we derive the monodromy matrix for the exactly solvable Nappi-Witten model, both when B=0 and $B\neq 0$.
