Title: Quantum Effects of an Extra Compact Dimension on the Wave Function of  the Universe
Authors: Guowen Peng and Hongya Liu and Qiuyang Zhang
Abstract: We extend the direct quantum approach of the standard FRW cosmology from 4D to 5D and obtain a Hamiltonian formulation for a wave-like 5D FRW cosmology. Using a late-time approximation we isolate out a y-part from the full wave function of the 5D Universe. Then we find that the compactness of the fifth dimension y yields a quantized spectrum for the momentum $P_{5}$ along the fifth dimension, and we show that the whole space-part of the wave function of the 5D Universe satisfies a two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation.
