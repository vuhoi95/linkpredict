Title: Closed-form two-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in a self-dual  background
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Christian Schubert
Abstract: We show that the two-loop Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian for scalar QED in a constant Euclidean self-dual background has a simple explicit closed form expression in terms of the digamma function. This result leads to a simple analysis of the weak- and strong-field expansions, the two-loop scalar QED beta function, and the analytic continuation properties of the effective Lagrangian and its imaginary part.
