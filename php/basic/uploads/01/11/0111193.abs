Title: Renormalization of Self-consistent Approximation schemes Finite  Temperature II: Applications to the Sunset Diagram
Authors: H. van Hees and J. Knoll
Abstract: The theoretical concepts for the renormalization of self-consistent Dyson resummations, deviced in the first paper of this series, are applied to first example cases for the $\phi^4$-theory. Besides the tadpole (Hartree) approximation as a novel part the numerical solutions are presented which includes the sunset self-energy diagram into the self-consistent scheme based on the $\Phi$-derivable approximation or 2PI effective action concept.
