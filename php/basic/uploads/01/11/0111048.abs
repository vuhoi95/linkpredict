Title: Superconformal Field Theories for Compact Manifolds with Spin(7)  Holonomy
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Volker Braun
Abstract: We present a construction of superconformal field theories for manifolds with Spin(7) holonomy. Geometrically these models correspond to the realization of Spin(7) manifolds as anti-holomorphic quotients of Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Describing the fourfolds as Gepner models and requiring anomaly cancellation we determine the resulting Betti numbers of the Spin(7) superconformal field theory. As in the G_2 case, we find that the Gepner model and the geometric result disagree.
