Title: Area Potentials and Deformation Quantization
Authors: Thomas L Curtright and Alexios P Polychronakos and Cosmas K Zachos
Abstract: Systems built out of N-body interactions, beyond 2-body interactions, are formulated on the plane, and investigated classically and quantum mechanically (in phase space). Their Wigner Functions--the density matrices in phase-space quantization--are given and analyzed.
