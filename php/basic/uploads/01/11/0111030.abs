Title: A Cyclic Model of the Universe
Authors: Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok
Abstract: We propose a cosmological model in which the universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs each beginning with a `bang' and ending in a `crunch.' The temperature and density are finite at each transition from crunch to bang. Instead of having an inflationary epoch, each cycle includes a period of slow accelerated expansion (as recently observed) followed by slow contraction. The combination produces the homogeneity, flatness, density fluctuations and energy needed to begin the next cycle.
