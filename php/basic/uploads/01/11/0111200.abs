Title: Landau Levels in the noncommutative $AdS_2$
Authors: R. Iengo and R. Ramachandran
Abstract: We formulate the Landau problem in the context of the noncommutative analog of a surface of constant negative curvature, that is $AdS_2$ surface, and obtain the spectrum and contrast the same with the Landau levels one finds in the case of the commutative $AdS_2$ space.
