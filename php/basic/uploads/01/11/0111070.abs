Title: Quantum Creation of the Randall-Sundrum Bubble
Authors: H. Ochiai and D. Ida and T. Shiromizu
Abstract: We investigate the semiclassical instability of the Randall-Sundrum brane world. We carefully analyze the bubble solution with the Randall-Sundrum background, which expresses the decay of the brane world. We evaluate the decay probability following the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity. Since a bubble rapidly expands after the nucleation, the entire spacetime will be occupied by such bubbles.
