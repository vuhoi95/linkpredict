Title: Application of symbol-operator technique for effective action  computation
Authors: A. T. Banin and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: In the present talk we briefly demonstrate an elegant and effective technique for calculation of the trace expansion in the derivatives of background fields. One of main advantages of the technique is manifestly (super)symmetrical and gauge invariant form of expressions on all stages of calculations. Other advantage is the universality of the calculation method. Some particular examples and results are presented.
