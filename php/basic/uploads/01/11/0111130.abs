Title: Supersymmetry of Massive D=9 Supergravity
Authors: J. Gheerardyn and P. Meessen
Abstract: By applying generalized dimensional reduction on the type IIB supersymmetry variations, we derive the supersymmetry variations for the massive 9-dimensional supergravity. We use these variations and the ones for massive type IIA to derive the supersymmetry transformation of the gravitino for the proposed massive 11-dimensional supergravity.
