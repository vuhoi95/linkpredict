Abstract: Supersymmetric (SUSY) Ward identities are considered for the N=1 SU(2) SUSY Yang Mills theory discretized on the lattice with Wilson fermions (gluinos). They are used in order to compute non-perturbatively a subtracted gluino mass and the mixing coefficient of the SUSY current. The computations were performed at gauge coupling $\beta$=2.3 and hopping parameter $\kappa$=0.1925, 0.194, 0.1955 using the two-step multi-bosonic dynamical-fermion algorithm. Our results are consistent with a scenario where the Ward identities are satisfied up to O(a) effects. The vanishing of the gluino mass occurs at a value of the hopping parameter which is not fully consistent with the estimate based on the chiral phase transition. This suggests that, although SUSY restoration appears to occur close to the continuum limit of the lattice theory, the results are still affected by significant systematic effects.
