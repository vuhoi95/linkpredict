Title: Wigner quantum systems (Lie superalgebraic approach)
Authors: T. D. Palev and N. I. Stoilova
Abstract: We present three groups of examples of Wigner Quantum Systems related to the Lie superalgebras $osp(1/6n)$, $sl(1/3n)$ and $sl(n/3)$ and discuss shortly their physical features. In the case of $sl(1/3n)$ we indicate that the underlying geometry is noncommutative.
