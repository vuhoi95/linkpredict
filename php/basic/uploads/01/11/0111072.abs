Title: New black holes in the brane-world?
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Alessandro Fabbri and Lorenzo Mazzacurati
Abstract: It is known that the Einstein field equations in five dimensions admit more general spherically symmetric black holes on the brane than four-dimensional general relativity. We propose two families of analytic solutions (with g_tt\not=-1/g_rr), parameterized by the ADM mass and the PPN parameter beta, which reduce to Schwarzschild for beta=1. Agreement with observations requires |\beta-1| |\eta|<<1. The sign of eta plays a key role in the global causal structure, separating metrics which behave like Schwarzschild (eta<0) from those similar to Reissner-Nordstroem (eta>0). In the latter case, we find a family of black hole space-times completely regular.
