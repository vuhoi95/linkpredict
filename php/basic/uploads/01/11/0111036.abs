Title: Kappa-symmetric higher derivative terms in brane actions
Authors: P. S. Howe and U. Lindstr√∂m
Abstract: Using the superembedding formalism we construct supermembrane actions with higher derivative terms which can be viewed as possible higher order terms in effective actions. In particular, we provide the first example of an action for an extended supersymmetric object with fully $\kappa$-symmetric extrinsic curvature terms.
