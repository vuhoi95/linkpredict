Title: Nonvanishing Cosmological Constant of Flat Universe in Brane-World  Scenario
Authors: D. K. Park and Hungsoo Kim and S. Tamaryan
Abstract: The finite temperature effect is examined in Randall-Sundrum brane-world scenario with inclusion of the matter fields on the brane. At zero temperature it is found that the theory on the brane is conformally invariant, which guarantees $AdS$/CFT. At 4d effective action we derived a temperature-dependent nonvanishing cosmological constant at the flat spacetime limit of brane worldvolume. At the cosmological temperature $3 {\bf K}$ the cosmological constant is roughly $(0.0004 eV)^4$ which is within the upper bound of the recent experimental value $(0.01 eV)^4$
