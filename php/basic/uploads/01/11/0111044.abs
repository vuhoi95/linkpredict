Title: On the Discrete Spectrum of a Pseudo-Relativistic Two-Body Pair Operator
Authors: Semjon Vugalter and Timo Weidl
Abstract: We prove Cwikel-Lieb-Rosenbljum and Lieb-Thirring type bounds on the discrete spectrum of a two-body pair operator and calculate spectral asymptotics for the eigenvalue moments and the local spectral density in the pseudo-relativistic limit.
