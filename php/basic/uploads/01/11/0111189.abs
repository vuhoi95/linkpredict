Title: D-Branes in Coset Models
Authors: Stefan Fredenhagen and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: The analysis of D-branes in coset models G/H provides a natural extension of recent studies on branes in WZW-theory and it has various interesting applications to physically relevant models. In this work we develop a reduction procedure that allows to construct the non-commutative gauge theories which govern the dynamics of branes in G/H. We obtain a large class of solutions and interprete the associated condensation processes geometrically. The latter are used to propose conservation laws for the dynamics of branes in coset models at large level k. In super-symmetric theories, conserved charges are argued to take their values in the representation ring of the denominator theory. Finally, we apply the general results to study boundary fixed points in two examples, namely for parafermions and minimal models.
