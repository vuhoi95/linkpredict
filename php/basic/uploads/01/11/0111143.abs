Title: Quaternionic potentials in non-relativistic quantum mechanics
Authors: S. De Leo and C. G. Ducati and Celso C. Nishi
Abstract: We discuss the Schrodinger equation in presence of quaternionic potentials. The study is performed analytically as long as it proves possible, when not, we resort to numerical calculations. The results obtained could be useful to investigate an underlying quaternionic quantum dynamics in particle physics. Experimental tests and proposals to observe quaternionic quantum effects by neutron interferometry are briefly reviewed.
