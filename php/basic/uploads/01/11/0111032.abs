Title: Adiabatic Quantum Computation and Deutsch's Algorithm
Authors: Saurya Das and Randy Kobes and Gabor Kunstatter
Abstract: We show that by a suitable choice of a time dependent Hamiltonian, Deutsch's algorithm can be implemented by an adiabatic quantum computer. We extend our analysis to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem and estimate the required running time for both global and local adiabatic evolutions.
