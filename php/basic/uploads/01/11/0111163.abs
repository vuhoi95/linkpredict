Title: Giant Gravitons and a Correspondence Principle
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Asad Naqvi
Abstract: We propose a correspondence between the physics of certain small charge black holes in AdS_k x S^l and large charge black holes in AdS_l x S^k. The curvature singularities of these solutions arise, following Myers and Tafjord, from a condensate of giant gravitons. When the number of condensed giants N_g is much greater than the number of background branes N, we propose that the system has an equivalent description in terms of N giant gravitons condensed in a background created by N_g branes. Our primary evidence is an exact correspondence between gravitational entropy formulae of small and large charge solutions in different dimensions.
