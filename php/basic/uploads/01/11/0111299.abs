Title: Possible astrophysical signatures of heavy stable neutral relics in  supergravity models
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Kari Enqvist and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We consider heavy stable neutral particles in the context of supergravity and show that a gravitationally suppressed inflaton decay can produce such particles in cosmologically interesting abundances within a wide mass range $10^3 {\rm GeV} \leq m_X \leq 10^{11} {\rm GeV}$. In gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking models, a heavy particle can decay into its superpartner and a photon-photino pair or a gravitino. Such decays only change the identity of a possible dark matter candidate. However, for $10^3 {\rm GeV} \leq m_X \leq 10^7 {\rm GeV}$, astrophysical bounds from gamma-ray background and photodissociation of light elements can be more stringent than the overclosure bound, thus ruling out the particle as a dark matter candidate.
