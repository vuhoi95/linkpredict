Title: Almost contact manifolds, connections with torsion and parallel spinors
Authors: Thomas Friedrich and Stefan Ivanov
Abstract: We classify locally homogeneous quasi-Sasakian manifolds in dimension five that admit a parallel spinor $\psi$ of algebraic type $F \cdot \psi = 0$ with respect to the unique connection $\nabla$ preserving the quasi-Sasakian structure and with totally skew-symmetric torsion. We introduce a certain conformal transformation of almost contact metric manifolds and discuss a link between them and the dilation function in 5-dimensional string theory. We find natural conditions implying conformal invariances of parallel spinors. We present topological obstructions to the existence of parallel spinors in the compact case.
