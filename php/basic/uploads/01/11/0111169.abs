Title: Dyons, K-theory and M-theory
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Juan Jose Manjarin
Abstract: We study the dyonic charge of type IIA D6-branes interpreted as M-theory Kaluza-Klein monopoles. The connection between the dyonic properties of type IIA D6-branes and the existence of eleven dimensions is discussed. We also study dyonic properties of non-commutative monopoles. Variations of the external antisymmetric B-field generate the electric charge of non-commutative dyons.
