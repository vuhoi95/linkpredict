Title: Matrix Integrals and Feynman Diagrams in the Kontsevich Model
Authors: Domenico Fiorenza and Riccardo Murri
Abstract: We review some relations occurring between the combinatorial intersection theory on the moduli spaces of stable curves and the asymptotic behavior of the 't Hooft-Kontsevich matrix integrals. In particular, we give an alternative proof of the Witten-Di Francesco-Itzykson-Zuber theorem --which expresses derivatives of the partition function of intersection numbers as matrix integrals-- using techniques based on diagrammatic calculus and combinatorial relations among intersection numbers. These techniques extend to a more general interaction potential.
