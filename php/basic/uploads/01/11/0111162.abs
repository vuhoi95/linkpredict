Title: Canonical approach to 2D supersymmetric WZNW model coupled to  supergravity
Authors: O. Miskovic and B. Sazdovic
Abstract: Starting from the known representation of the Kac-Moody algebra in terms of the coordinates and momenta, we extend it to the representation of the super Kac-Moody and super Virasoro algebras. Then we use general canonical method to construct an action invariant under local gauge symmetries, where components of the super energy-momentum tensor $L_\pm$ and $G_\pm$ play the role of the diffeomorphisms and supersymmetries generators respectively. We obtain covariant extension of WZNW theory with respect to local supersymmetry as well as explicit expressions for gauge transformations.
