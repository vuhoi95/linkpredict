Title: D-brane Standard Model
Authors: I. Antoniadis and E. Kiritsis and T. Tomaras
Abstract: The minimal embedding of the Standard Model in type I string theory is described. The SU(3) color and SU(2) weak interactions arise from two different collections of branes. The correct prediction of the weak angle is obtained for a string scale of 6-8 TeV. Two Higgs doublets are necessary and proton stability is guaranteed. It predicts two massive vector bosons with masses at the TeV scale, as well as a new superweak interaction.
