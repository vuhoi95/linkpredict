Abstract: As an alternative to Chevalley generators, we introduce Jacobson generators for the quantum superalgebra $U_q[sl(n+1|m)]$. The expressions of all Cartan-Weyl elements of $U_q[sl(n+1|m)]$ in terms of these Jacobson generators become very simple. We determine and prove certain triple relations between the Jacobson generators, necessary for a complete set of supercommutation relations between the Cartan-Weyl elements. Fock representations are defined, and a substantial part of this paper is devoted to the computation of the action of Jacobson generators on basis vectors of these Fock spaces. It is also determined when these Fock representations are unitary. Finally, Dyson and Holstein-Primakoff realizations are given, not only for the Jacobson generators, but for all Cartan-Weyl elements of $U_q[sl(n+1|m)]$.
