Abstract: We consider a five-dimensional supergravity model with SU(5) gauge symmetry and the minimal field content. Studying the arising scalar potential we find that the gauging of the $U(1)_R$ symmetry of the five-dimensional supergravity causes instabilities. Lifting the instabilities the vacua are of Anti-de-Sitter type and SU(5) is broken along with supersymmetry. Keeping the $U(1)_R$ ungauged the potential has flat directions along which supersymmetry is unbroken.
