Title: On interpretations and constructions of classical dynamical r-matrices
Authors: L. Feher and A. Gabor
Abstract: In this note we complement recent results on the exchange $r$-matrices appearing in the chiral WZNW model by providing a direct, purely finite-dimensional description of the relationship between the monodromy dependent 2-form that enters the chiral WZNW symplectic form and the exchange $r$-matrix that governs the corresponding Poisson brackets. We also develop the special case in which the exchange $r$-matrix becomes the `canonical' solution of the classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation on an arbitrary self-dual Lie algebra.
