Title: Relativistic Massive Vector Condensation
Authors: Francesco Sannino and Wolfgang Sch√§fer
Abstract: At sufficiently high chemical potential massive relativistic spin one fields condense. This phenomenon leads to the spontaneous breaking of rotational invariance while linking it to the breaking of internal symmetries. We study the relevant features of the phase transition and the properties of the generated Goldstone excitations. The interplay between the internal symmetry of the vector fields and their Lorentz properties is studied. We predict that new phases set in when vectors condense in Quantum Chromodynamics like theories.
