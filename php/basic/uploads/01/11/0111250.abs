Title: Parity Doubling, Zitterbewegung, and Rest Mass for Spin 1
Authors: Geoffrey F. Chew and Henry P. Stapp
Abstract: A 6-component "wave function" (not field, but S-matrix interpretable) for a massive spin-1 particle parallels the Dirac "chirality-doubled" 4-component wave function for a spin-1/2 particle, by pairing two wave functions for same spin but opposite "handedness". The correlated "opposite-parity" pair of complex 3-vectors defines a fluctuating spin-correlated lightlike ``internal velocity" as well as an independent "external rapidity". Extension from fermions to vector bosons of the velocity-fluctuation ("zitterbewegung") interpretation of rest mass weakens theoretical motivation for elementary scalar bosons.
