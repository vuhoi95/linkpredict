Title: Polyakov conjecture and 2+1 dimensional gravity coupled to particles
Authors: L. Cantini and P. Menotti and D. Seminara
Abstract: A proof is given of Polyakov conjecture about the auxiliary parameters of the SU(1,1) Riemann-Hilbert problem for general elliptic singularities. Such a result is related to the uniformization of the the sphere punctured by n conical defects. Its relevance to the hamiltonian structure of 2+1 dimensional gravity in the maximally slicing gauge is stressed.
