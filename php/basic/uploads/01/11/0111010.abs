Title: Nonperturbative bound on high multiplicity cross sections in phi^4_3  from lattice simulation
Authors: Y. Y. Charng and R. S. Willey
Abstract: We have looked for evidence of large cross sections at large multiplicities in weakly coupled scalar field theory in three dimensions. We use spectral function sum rules to derive bounds on total cross sections where the sum can be expresed in terms of a quantity which can be measured by Monte Carlo simulation in Euclidean space. We find that high multiplicity cross sections remain small for energies and multiplicities for which large effects had been suggested.
