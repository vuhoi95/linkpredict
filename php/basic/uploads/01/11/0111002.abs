Title: Orientifolds of the 3-sphere
Authors: Constantin Bachas and Nicolas Couchoud and Paul Windey
Abstract: We study the geometry of orientifolds in the SU(2) WZW model. They correspond to the two inequivalent, orientation-reversing involutions of $S^3$, whose fixed-point sets are: the north and south poles (O0), or the equator two-sphere (O2). We show how the geometric action of these involutions leads unambiguously to the previously obtained algebraic results for the Klein bottle and Moebius amplitudes. We give a semiclassical derivation of the selection rules and signs in the crosscap couplings, paying particular attention to discrete B-fluxes. A novel observation, which does not follow from consistency of the one-loop vacuum diagrams, is that in the case of the O0 orientifolds only integer- or only half-integer-spin Cardy states may coexist.
