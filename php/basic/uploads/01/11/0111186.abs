Title: Dynamical Zero Modes and Criticality in Continuous Light Cone  Quantization of Phi^{4}_{1+1}
Authors: P. Grange and S. Salmons and E. Werner
Abstract: Critical behaviour of the 2D scalar field theory in the LC framework is reviewed. The notion of dynamical zero modes is introduced and shown to lead to a non trivial covariant dispersion relation only for Continuous LC Quantization (CLCQ). The critical exponent $\eta$ is found to be governed by the behaviour of the infinite volume limit under conformal transformations properties preserving the local LC structure. The $\beta$-function is calculated exactly and found non-analytic, with a critical exponent $\omega=2$, in agreement with the conformal field theory analysis of Calabrese et al.
