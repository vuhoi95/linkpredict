Abstract: We investigate homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions supported by the SU(2) gauge field governed by the Born-Infeld lagrangian. In the framework of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, with or without cosmological constant $\lambda$, we derive dynamical systems that give rather complete description of the space of solutions. For $\lambda=0$ the effective equation of state $\ve(p)$ is shown to interpolate between $p=-\ve/3$ in the regime of the strong field and $p=\ve/3$ for the weak field. Correspondingly, the Universe starts with zero acceleration and gradually enters the decelerating regime, asymptotically approaching the Tolman solution.
