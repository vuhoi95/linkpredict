Title: Dynamical mass generation by source inversion: Calculating the mass gap  of the Gross-Neveu model
Authors: K. Van Acoleyen and H. Verschelde
Abstract: We probe the U(N) Gross-Neveu model with a source-term $J\bar{\Psi}\Psi$. We find an expression for the renormalization scheme and scale invariant source $\hat{J}$, as a function of the generated mass gap. The expansion of this function is organized in such a way that all scheme and scale dependence is reduced to one single parameter d. We get a non-perturbative mass gap as the solution of $\hat{J}=0$. In one loop we find that any physical choice for d gives good results for high values of N. In two loops we can determine d self-consistently by the principle of minimal sensitivity and find remarkably accurate results for N>2.
