Title: Exact Solution of the Harmonic Oscillator in Arbitrary Dimensions with  Minimal Length Uncertainty Relations
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Djordje Minic and Naotoshi Okamura and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We determine the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator where the coordinates and momenta are assumed to obey the modified commutation relations [x_i,p_j]=i hbar[(1+ beta p^2) delta_{ij} + beta' p_i p_j]. These commutation relations are motivated by the fact they lead to the minimal length uncertainty relations which appear in perturbative string theory. Our solutions illustrate how certain features of string theory may manifest themselves in simple quantum mechanical systems through the modification of the canonical commutation relations. We discuss whether such effects are observable in precision measurements on electrons trapped in strong magnetic fields.
