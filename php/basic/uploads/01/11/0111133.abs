Title: Tilting the Noncommutative Bion
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Curtis G. Callan
Abstract: In this note, we extend the noncommutative bion core solution of Constable, Myers and Tafjord (hep-th/9911136) to include the effects of a nonzero NS-NS two-form B. The result is a `tilted bion' in which the core expands out to a single D3-brane at an angle to the D1-brane core. Its properties agree perfectly with an analysis of the dual situation, that of a magnetic charge on an abelian D3-brane in a background worldvolume magnetic field. We also demonstrate that this agreement extends beyond geometry to include the field strength on the D3-brane. We make a proposal for including possible worldvolume gauge fields when mapping a noncommutative geometrical brane solution onto a corresponding commutative brane description.
