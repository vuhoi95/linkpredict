Title: Dynamics of Walls: Fermion Scattering in Magnetic Field
Authors: L. Campanelli and P. Cea and G. L. Fogli and L. Tedesco
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of fermions off walls in the presence of a magnetic field. We consider both the bubble wall and the kink domain wall. By solving the Dirac equation for fermions in the presence of a domain wall in an external magnetic field, we investigate the dependence on the magnetic field of the transmission and reflection coefficients. In the case of kink domain wall, we also consider the solutions localized on the wall. The possibile role of the ferromagnetic domain walls in the dynamics of the early Universe is also discussed.
