Title: Note on Holographic RG Flow in String Cosmology
Authors: Miao Li and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We propose a new holographic C-function for the accelerating universe defined in the stringy frame motivated mainly by the fact that the number of degrees of freedom should be infinite for a physical system of infinite size. This is the generalization of Strominger's recent proposal of the holographic C-function to the asymptotically non-de Sitter universe. We find that the corresponding C-theorem holds true if the universe accelerates toward the weak coupling regime driven by the exponential dilaton potential. It also holds in other simple cases.
