Title: R^4 corrections to conifolds and G_2 holonomy metrics
Authors: S. Frolov and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: Motivated by examples that appeared in the context of string theory - gauge theory duality, we consider corrections to supergravity backgrounds induced by higher derivative R^4+... terms in superstring effective action. We argue that supersymmetric solutions that solve BPS conditions at the leading (supergravity) order continue to satisfy a 1-st order ``RG-type'' system of equations with extra source terms encoding string (or M-theory) corrections. We illustrate this explicitly on the examples of R^4 corrections to the generalized resolved and deformed 6-d conifolds and to a class of non-compact 7-d spaces with G_2 holonomy. Both types of backgrounds get non-trivial modifications which we study in detail, stressing analogies between the two cases.
