Title: Dynamical Generation of Four-Dimensional Space-Time in the IIB Matrix  Model
Authors: Jun Nishimura and Fumihiko Sugino
Abstract: We study the spontaneous breakdown of SO(10) symmetry in the IIB matrix model, a conjectured nonperturbative definition of type IIB superstring theory in ten dimensions. Our analysis is based on a Gaussian expansion technique, which was originally proposed by Kabat-Lifschytz and applied successfully to the strong coupling dynamics of the Matrix Theory. We propose a prescription for including higher order corrections, which yields a rapid convergence in a simple example. This prescription is then applied to the IIB matrix model up to the third order. We find that the `self-consistency equations' allow various symmetry breaking solutions. Among them, the solution preserving SO(4) symmetry is found to have the smallest free energy. The value of the free energy comes closer to the analytic formula obtained by Krauth-Nicolai-Staudacher as we increase the order. The extent of the space-time in the 4 directions is larger than the remaining 6 directions, and the ratio increases with the order. These results provide the first analytical evidence that four-dimensional space-time is generated dynamically in the IIB matrix model.
