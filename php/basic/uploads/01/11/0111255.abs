Title: Towards a General Theory of Quantized Fields on the Anti-de Sitter  Space-Time
Authors: Jacques Bros and Henri Epstein and Ugo Moschella
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying quantum field theory on the anti-de-Sitter space-time, based on the assumption of positivity of the spectrum of the possible energy operators. In this framework we show that the n-point functions are analytic in suitable domains of the complex AdS manifold, that it is possible to Wick rotate to the Euclidean manifold and come back, and that it is meaningful to restrict AdS quantum fields to Poincare' branes. We give also a complete characterization of two-point functions which are the simplest example of our theory. Finally we prove the existence of the AdS-Unruh effect for uniformly accelerated observers on trajectories crossing the boundary of AdS at infinity, while that effect does not exist for all the other uniformly accelerated trajectories.
