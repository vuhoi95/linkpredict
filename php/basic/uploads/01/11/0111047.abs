Title: Hilbert schemes and W algebras
Authors: Wei-Ping Li and Zhenbo Qin and Weiqiang Wang
Abstract: We construct geometrically the generating fields of a W algebra which acts irreducibly on the direct sum of the cohomology rings of the Hilbert schemes of n points on a projective surface for all n. We compute explicitly the commutators among a set of linear basis elements of the W algebra, and identify this algebra with a $W_{1+\infty}$-type algebra. A precise formula of certain Chern character operators, which is essential for the construction of the W algebra, is established in terms of the Heisenberg algebra generators. In addition, these Chern character operators are proved to be the zero-modes of vertex operators.
