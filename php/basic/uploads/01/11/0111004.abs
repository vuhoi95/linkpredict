Title: Spectral Function of Quarks in Quark Matter
Authors: Frank Froemel and Stefan Leupold and Ulrich Mosel
Abstract: We investigate the spectral function of light quarks in infinite quark matter using a simple, albeit self-consistent model. The interactions between the quarks are described by the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Currently mean field effects are neglected and all calculations are performed in the chirally restored phase at zero temperature. Relations between correlation functions and collision rates are used to calculate the spectral function in an iterative process.
