Title: Relativistic Quantum Newton's Law For A Spinless Particle
Authors: A. Bouda and F. Hammad
Abstract: For a one-dimensional stationary system, we derive a third order equation of motion representing a first integral of the relativistic quantum Newton's law. We then integrate this equation in the constant potential case and calculate the time spent by a particle tunneling through a potential barrier.
