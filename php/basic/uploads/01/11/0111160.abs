Title: Perturbative Approach to Higher Derivative and Nonlocal Theories
Authors: Tai-Chung Cheng and Pei-Ming Ho and Mao-Chuang Yeh
Abstract: We review a perturbative approach to deal with Lagrangians with higher or infinite order time derivatives. It enables us to construct a consistent Poisson structure and Hamiltonian with only first time derivatives order by order in coupling. To the lowest order, the Hamiltonian is bounded from below whenever the potential is. We consider spacetime noncommutative field theory as an example.
