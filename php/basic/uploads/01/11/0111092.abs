Title: Observables of String Field Theory
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and N. Itzhaki
Abstract: We study gauge invariant operators of open string field theory and find a precise correspondence with on-shell closed strings. We provide a detailed proof of the gauge invariance of the operators and a heuristic interpretation of their correlation functions in terms of on-shell scattering amplitudes of closed strings. We also comment on the implications of these operators to vacuum string field theory.
