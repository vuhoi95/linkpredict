Title: Spacetime Dependent Lagrangians and Weak-Strong Duality : Sine Gordon  and Massive Thirring Models
Authors: Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Debashis Gangopadhyay
Abstract: The formalism of spacetime dependent lagrangians developed in Ref.1 is applied to the Sine Gordon and massive Thirring models.It is shown that the well-known equivalence of these models (in the context of weak-strong duality) can be understood in this approach from the same considerations as described in [1] for electromagnetic duality. A further new result is that all these can be naturally linked to the fact that the holographic principle has analogues at length scales much larger than quantum gravity. There is also the possibility of {\it noncommuting coodinates} residing on the boundaries. PACS: 11.15.-q: 11.10/Ef
