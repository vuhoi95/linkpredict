Title: Black-brane solution for C_2 algebra
Authors: M. A. Grebeniuk and V. D. Ivashchuk and S. -W. Kim
Abstract: Black p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersection rules and Ricci-flat ``internal'' spaces are considered. They are defined up to moduli functions H_s obeying non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. A new solution with intersections corresponding to the Lie algebra C_2 is obtained. The functions H_1 and H_2 for this solution are polynomials of degree 3 and 4.
