Title: Breakdown of the Action Method in Gauge Theories
Authors: Christian Fleischhack and Jerzy Lewandowski
Abstract: It is shown that the definition of physical integration measures via ``exponential of minus the action times kinematical integration measure'' typically contradicts properties of physical models. In particular, theories with uncountably many non-vanishing Wilson-loop expectation values cannot be gained this way. The results are rigorous within the Ashtekar approach to gauge field theories.
