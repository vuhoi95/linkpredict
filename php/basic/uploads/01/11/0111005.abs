Title: Boundary Poisson structure and quantization
Authors: Liu Zhao and Wenli He
Abstract: A new approach for treating boundary Poisson structures based on causality and locality analysis is proposed for a single scalar field with boundary interaction. For the case of linear boundary condition, it is shown that the usual canonical quantization can be applied systematically.
