Title: tt* Geometry and Closed String Tachyon Potential
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We propose a closed string tachyon action including kinetic and potential terms for non-supersymmetric orbifolds. The action is given in terms of solutions to $tt^*$ equations which captures the geometry of vacua of the corresponding N=2 worldsheet theory. In certain cases the solutions are well studied. In case of tachyons of ${\bf C}/Z_n$, solutions to affine toda equations determine the action. We study the particular case of ${\bf C}/Z_3\to {\bf C}$ in detail and find that the Tachyon action is determined in terms of a solution to Painleve III equation.
