Title: Integrable Structure behind WDVV Equations
Authors: Henrik Aratyn and Johan van de Leur
Abstract: An integrable structure behind Witten--Dijkgraaf--Verlinde--Verlinde (WDVV) equations is identified with reduction of a Riemann-Hilbert problem for a homogeneous GL(N, C) loop group. Reduction requires the dressing matrices to be fixed points of a loop group automorphism of order two resulting in a sub-hierarchy of gl(N,C) hierarchy containing only odd symmetry flows. The model possesses Virasoro symmetry and imposing Virasoro constraints ensures homogeneity property of the Darboux-Egoroff structure. Dressing matrices of the reduced model provide solutions of the WDVV equations.
