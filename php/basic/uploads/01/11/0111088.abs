Title: From Poincare to affine invariance: How does the Dirac equation  generalize?
Authors: Ingo Kirsch and Djordje Sijacki
Abstract: A generalization of the Dirac equation to the case of affine symmetry, with SL(4,R) replacing SO(1,3), is considered. A detailed analysis of a Dirac-type Poincare-covariant equation for any spin j is carried out, and the related general interlocking scheme fulfilling all physical requirements is established. Embedding of the corresponding Lorentz fields into infinite-component SL(4,R) fermionic fields, the constraints on the SL(4,R) vector-operator generalizing Dirac's gamma matrices, as well as the minimal coupling to (Metric-)Affine gravity are studied. Finally, a symmetry breaking scenario for SA(4,R) is presented which preserves the Poincare symmetry.
