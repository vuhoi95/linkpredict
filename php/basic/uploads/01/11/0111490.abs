Abstract: The behavior of an ideal $D$-dimensional boson gas in the presence of a uniform gravitational field is analyzed. It is explicitly shown that, contrarily to an old standing folklore, the three-dimensional gas does not undergo Bose-Einstein condensation at finite temperature. On the other hand, Bose-Einstein condensation occurs at $T\neq 0$ for $D=1,2,3$ if there is a point-like impurity at the bottom of the vessel containing the gas.
