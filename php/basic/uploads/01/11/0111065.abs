Title: Symmetry aspects of fermions coupled to torsion and electromagnetic  fields
Authors: J. L. Boldo and C. A. G. Sasaki
Abstract: We study and explore the symmetry properties of fermions coupled to dynamical torsion and electromagnetic fields. The stability of the theory upon radiative corrections as well as the presence of anomalies are investigated.
