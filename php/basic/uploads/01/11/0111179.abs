Title: Chiral Type II Orientifold Constructions as M Theory on G_2 holonomy  spaces
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Gary Shiu and Angel M. Uranga
Abstract: We summarize some recent progress in constructing four-dimensional supersymmetric chiral models from Type II orientifolds. We present the construction a supersymmetric Standard-like Model and a supersymmetric GUT model to illustrate the new features of this approach and its connection to M theory on compact, singular G_2 holonomy spaces. The Standard-like model presented is the first example of a three-family supersymmetic orientifold model with the Standard Model as part of the gauge structure. We also discuss the connection of how chiral fermions arise in this class of models with recent results of M theory compactified on G_2 holonomy spaces.
