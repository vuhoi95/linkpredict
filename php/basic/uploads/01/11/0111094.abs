Title: Elliptic Algebra and Integrable Models for Solitons on Noncummutative  Torus ${\cal T}$
Authors: Bo-Yu Hou and Dan-Tao Peng
Abstract: We study the algebra ${\cal A}_n$ and the basis of the Hilbert space ${\cal H}_n$ in terms of the $\theta$ functions of the positions of $n$ solitons. Then we embed the Heisenberg group as the quantum operator factors in the representation of the transfer matrice of various integrable models. Finally we generalize our result to the generic $\theta$ case.
