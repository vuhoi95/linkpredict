Title: On the symmetries of BF models and their relation with gravity
Authors: C. P. Constantinidis and F. Gieres and O. Piguet and M. S. Sarandy
Abstract: The perturbative finiteness of various topological models (e.g. BF models) has its origin in an extra symmetry of the gauge-fixed action, the so-called vector supersymmetry. Since an invariance of this type also exists for gravity and since gravity is closely related to certain BF models, vector supersymmetry should also be useful for tackling various aspects of quantum gravity. With this motivation and goal in mind, we first extend vector supersymmetry of BF models to generic manifolds by incorporating it into the BRST symmetry within the Batalin-Vilkovisky framework. Thereafter, we address the relationship between gravity and BF models, in particular for three-dimensional space-time.
