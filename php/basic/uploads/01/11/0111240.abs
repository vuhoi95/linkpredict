Title: A New Type of String Field Theory
Authors: Holger B. Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya
Abstract: We propose a new way of second quantizing string theory. The method is based on considering the Fock space of strings described by constituents which make up the $X^\mu_R$ and the $X^\mu_L$ i.e. the right and left mover modes separately. A state with any number of strings get represented by the Cartesian product of two free particle Fock spaces, one for right mover degrees of freedom, and one for left. The resulting string field theory is a free theory.
