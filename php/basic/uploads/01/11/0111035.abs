Title: Energy-Momentum Tensor of Field Fluctuations in Massive Chaotic  Inflation

Abstract: We study the renormalized energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the inflaton fluctuations in rigid space-times during the slow-rollover regime for chaotic inflation with a mass term. We use dimensional regularization with adiabatic subtraction and introduce a novel analytic approximation for the inflaton fluctuations which is valid during the slow-rollover regime. Using this approximation we find a scale invariant spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations in a rigid space-time, and we confirm this result by numerical methods. The resulting renormalized EMT is covariantly conserved and agrees with the Allen-Folacci result in the de Sitter limit, when the expansion is exactly linearly exponential in time. We analytically show that the EMT tensor of the inflaton fluctuations grows initially in time, but saturates to the value H^2 H(0)^2, where H is the Hubble parameter and H(0) is its value when inflation has started. This result also implies that the quantum production of light scalar fields (with mass smaller or equal to the inflaton mass) in this model of chaotic inflation depends on the duration of inflation and is larger than the usual result extrapolated from the de Sitter result.
