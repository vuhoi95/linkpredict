Title: Solution of the multi-reggeon compound state problem in multi-colour QCD
Authors: G. P. Korchemsky and J. Kotanski and A. N. Manashov
Abstract: We study the properties of the colour-singlet compound states of reggeized gluons in multi-colour QCD using their relation with noncompact Heisenberg spin magnets. Applying the methods of integrable models, we calculate their spectrum and discuss the application of the obtained results to high-energy asymptotics of the scattering amplitudes in perturbative QCD.
