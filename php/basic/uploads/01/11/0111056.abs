Title: Cohomogeneity-one G2-structures
Authors: Richard Cleyton and Andrew Swann
Abstract: G2-manifolds with a cohomogeneity-one action of a compact Lie group G are studied. For G simple, all solutions with holonomy G2 and weak holonomy G2 are classified. The holonomy G2 solutions are necessarily Ricci-flat and there is a one-parameter family with SU(3)-symmetry. The weak holonomy G2 solutions are Einstein of positive scalar curvature and are uniquely determined by the simple symmetry group. During the proof the equations for G2-symplectic and G2-cosymplectic structures are studied and the topological types of the manifolds admitting such structures are determined. New examples of compact G2-cosymplectic manifolds and complete G2-symplectic structures are found.
