Title: Comments on duality-symmetric theories
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Sorin Cucu
Abstract: We briefly review the basics of electric-magnetic duality symmetry and their geometric interpretation in the M-theory context. Then we recall some no-go theorems that prevent a simple extension of the duality symmetry to non-Abelian gauge theories.
