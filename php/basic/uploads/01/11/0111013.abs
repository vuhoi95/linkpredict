Title: Conservation laws for collisions of branes (or shells) in general  relativity
Authors: David Langlois and Kei-ichi Maeda and David Wands
Abstract: We consider the collision of self-gravitating n-branes in a (n+2)-dimensional spacetime. We show that there is a geometrical constraint which can be expressed as a simple sum rule for angles characterizing Lorentz boosts between branes and the intervening spacetime regions. This constraint can then be re-interpreted as either energy or momentum conservation at the collision.
