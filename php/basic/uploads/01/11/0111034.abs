Title: Observables as Twist Anomaly in Vacuum String Field Theory
Authors: Hiroyuki Hata and Sanefumi Moriyama
Abstract: We reveal a novel mathematical structure in physical observables, the mass of tachyon fluctuation mode and the energy density, associated with a classical solution of vacuum string field theory constructed previously [hep-th/0108150]. We find that they are expressed in terms of quantities which apparently vanish identically due to twist even-odd degeneracy of eigenvalues of a Neumann coefficient matrix defining the three-string interactions. However, they can give non-vanishing values because of the breakdown of the degeneracy at the edge of the eigenvalue distribution. We also present a general prescription of correctly simplifying the expressions of these observables. Numerical calculation of the energy density following our prescription indicates that the present classical solution represents the configuration of two D25-branes.
