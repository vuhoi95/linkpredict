Title: Y-systems and generalized associahedra
Authors: Sergey Fomin and Andrei Zelevinsky
Abstract: We prove, for an arbitrary finite root system, the periodicity conjecture of Al.B.Zamolodchikov concerning Y-systems, a particular class of functional relations arising in the theory of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Algebraically, Y-systems can be viewed as families of rational functions defined by certain birational recurrences formulated in terms of the underlying root system. In the course of proving periodicity, we obtain explicit formulas for all these rational functions, which turn out to always be Laurent polynomials. In a closely related development, we introduce and study a family of simplicial complexes that can be associated to arbitrary root systems. In type A, our construction produces Stasheff's associahedron, whereas in type B, it gives the Bott-Taubes polytope, or cyclohedron. We enumerate the faces of these complexes, prove that their geometric realization is always a sphere, and describe them in concrete combinatorial terms for the classical types ABCD.
