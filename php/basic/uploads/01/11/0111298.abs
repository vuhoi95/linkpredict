Title: Alternative Signature of TeV Strings
Authors: Kin-ya Oda and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: In string theory, it is well known that any hard scattering amplitude inevitably suffers exponential suppression. We demonstrate that, if the string scale is M_s < 2TeV, this intrinsically stringy behavior leads to a dramatic reduction in the QCD jet production rate with very high transverse momenta p_T > 2TeV at LHC. This suppression is sufficient to be observed in the first year of low-luminosity running. Our prediction is based on the universal behavior of string theory, and therefore is qualitatively model-independent. This signature is alternative and complementary to conventional ones such as Regge resonance (or string ball/black hole) production.
