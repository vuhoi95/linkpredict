Title: Linearized Analysis of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Brane Model
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: We solve the Einstein equations in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model with a static, spherically symmetric matter distribution on the physical brane and obtain an exact expression for the gravitational field outside the source to the first order in the gravitational coupling. Although when confined on the physical brane this expression reproduces the correct 4D Newtonian potential for distances r_s << r << {\lambda}, where {\lambda} is a characteristic length scale of the model, it does not coincide with the standard linearized form of the 4D Schwarzschild metric. The solution reproduces the 5D Schwarzschild metric in the linearized approximation for r >> {\lambda}.
