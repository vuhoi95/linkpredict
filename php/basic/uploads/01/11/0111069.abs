Title: The singular geometry of the sliver
Authors: Gregory Moore and Washington Taylor
Abstract: We consider "sliver" states which act as projection operators in the matter star product of Witten's cubic string field theory. These sliver states, which might be associated with Dirichlet p-branes, are not finite norm states in the matter string Hilbert space. We describe the singularities of these states, and demonstrate that the sliver states are composed of strings having singular geometric features. These singularities take a particularly simple form in the zero slope limit alpha' -> 0, where the star algebra factorizes into a product of the algebra of functions on space-time and the noncommutative star product of fields associated with higher string modes. An analogy to the sliver geometry suggests a natural mechanism for describing closed string states in open string field theory.
