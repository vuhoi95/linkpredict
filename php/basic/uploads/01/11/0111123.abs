Title: One-Loop Renormalization of Lorentz-Violating Electrodynamics
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Charles Lane and Austin Pickering
Abstract: We show that the general Lorentz- and CPT-violating extension of quantum electrodynamics is one-loop renormalizable. The one-loop Lorentz-violating beta functions are obtained, and the running of the coefficients for Lorentz and CPT violation is determined. Some implications for theory and experiment are discussed.
