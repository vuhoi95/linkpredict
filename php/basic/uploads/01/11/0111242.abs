Title: Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball at zero and finite  temperature
Authors: V. V. Nesterenko and G. Lambiase and G. Scarpetta
Abstract: The basic results in calculations of the thermodynamic functions of electromagnetic field in the background of a dilute dielectric ball at zero and finite temperature are presented. Summation over the angular momentum values is accomplished in a closed form by making use of the addition theorem for the relevant Bessel functions. The behavior of the thermodynamic characteristics in the low and high temperature limits is investigated. The $T^3$-term in the low temperature expansion of the free energy is recovered (this term has been lost in our previous calculations).
