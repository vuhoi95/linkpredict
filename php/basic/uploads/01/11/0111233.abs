Abstract: We apply to the XYZ model the technique of construction of integrable models with staggered parameters, presented recently for the XXZ case. The solution of modified Yang-Baxter equations is found and the corresponding integrable zig-zag ladder Hamiltonian is calculated. The result is coinciding with the XXZ case in the appropriate limit.
