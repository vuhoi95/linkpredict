Abstract: Following a previous work on Abelian (2,0)-gauge theories, one reassesses here the task of coupling (2,0) relaxed Yang-Mills superpotentials to a (2,0)- nonlinear $\sigma$-model, by gauging the isotropy or the isometry group of the latter. One pays special attention to the extra ``chiral-like'' component-field gauge potential that comes out from the relaxation of superspace constraints.
