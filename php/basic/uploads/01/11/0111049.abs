Title: On the Space-Time Symmetries of Non-Commutative Gauge Theories
Authors: A. Iorio and T. Sykora
Abstract: We study the space-time symmetries and transformation properties of the non-commutative U(1) gauge theory, by using Noether charges. We carry out our analysis by keeping an open view on the possible ways $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ could transform. We conclude that $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ cannot transform under any space-time transformation since the theory is not invariant under the conformal transformations, with the only exception of space-time translations. The same analysis applies to other gauge groups.
