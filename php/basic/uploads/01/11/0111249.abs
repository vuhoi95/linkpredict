Title: Spectrum of Schroedinger field in a noncommutative magnetic monopole
Authors: D. Karabali and V. P. Nair and A. P. Polychronakos
Abstract: The energy spectrum of a nonrelativistic particle on a noncommutative sphere in the presence of a magnetic monopole field is calculated. The system is treated in the field theory language, in which the one-particle sector of a charged Schroedinger field coupled to a noncommutative U(1) gauge field is identified. It is shown that the Hamiltonian is essentially the angular momentum squared of the particle, but with a nontrivial scaling factor appearing, in agreement with the first-quantized canonical treatment of the problem. Monopole quantization is recovered and identified as the quantization of a commutative Seiberg-Witten mapped monopole field.
