Title: Warped compactification on Abelian vortex in six dimensions
Authors: M. Giovannini and H. Meyer and M. Shaposhnikov
Abstract: We consider the possibility of localizing gravity on a Nielsen-Olesen vortex in the context of the Abelian Higgs model. The vortex lives in a six-dimensional space-time with negative bulk cosmological constant. In this model we find a region of the parameter space leading, simultaneously, to warped compactification and to regular space-time geometry. A thin defect limit is studied. Regular solutions describing warped compactifications in the case of higher winding number are also presented.
