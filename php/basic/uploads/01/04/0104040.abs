Title: Scalar perturbations in a primordial inflationary scenario
Authors: Julio C. Fabris and Philippe Spindel
Abstract: We compute the spectral index for scalar perturbations generated in a primordial inflationary model. In this model, the transition of the inflationary phase to the radiative era is achieved through the decay of the cosmological term leading a second order phase transition and the characteristics of the model allow to implement a set of initial conditions where the perturbations display a thermal spectrum when they emerge from the horizon. The obtained value for the spectral index is equal to 2, a result that depends very weakly on the various parameters of the model and on the initial conditions used.
