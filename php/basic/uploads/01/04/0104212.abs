Title: Vacuum Bubbles Nucleation and Dark Matter Production through Gauge  Symmetry Rearrangement
Authors: S. Ansoldi and A. Aurilia and E. Spallucci
Abstract: Modern particle physics and cosmology support the idea that a background of invisible material pervades the whole universe, and identify in the cosmic vacuum the ultimate source of matter-energy, both seen and unseen. Within the framework of the theory of fundamental relativistic membranes, we suggest a self-consistent, vacuum energy-driven mechanism for dark matter creation through gauge symmetry rearrangement.
