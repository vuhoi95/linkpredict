Title: On the Eleven-Dimensional Origins of Polarized D0-branes
Authors: D. Brecher and A. Chamblin
Abstract: The worldvolume theory of a D0-brane contains a multiplet of fermions which can couple to background spacetime fields. This coupling implies that a D0-brane may possess multipole moments with respect to the various type IIA supergravity fields. Different such polarization states of the D0-brane will thus generate different long-range supergravity fields, and the corresponding semi-classical supergravity solutions will have different geometries. In this paper, we reconsider such solutions from an eleven-dimensional perspective. We thus begin by deriving the ``superpartners'' of the eleven-dimensional graviton. These superpartners are obtained by acting on the purely bosonic solution with broken supersymmetries and, in theory, one can obtain the full BPS supermultiplet of states. When we dimensionally reduce a polarized supergraviton along its direction of motion, we recover a metric which describes a polarized D0-brane. On the other hand, if we compactify along the retarded null direction we obtain the short distance, or ``near-horizon'', geometry of a polarized D0-brane, which is related to finite $N$ Matrix theory. The various dipole moments in this case can only be defined once the eleven-dimensional metric is ``regularized'' and, even then, they are formally infinite. We argue, however, that this is to be expected in such a non-asymptotically flat spacetime. Moreover, we find that the superpartners of the D0-brane, in this $r \ra 0$ limit, possess neither spin nor D2-brane dipole moments.
