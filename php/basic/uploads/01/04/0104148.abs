Title: On a CFT prediction in the sine-Gordon model
Authors: Carlos Na√≥n and Mariano Salvay
Abstract: A quantitative prediction of Conformal Field Theory (CFT), which relates the second moment of the energy-density correlator away from criticality to the value of the central charge, is verified in the sine-Gordon model. By exploiting the boson-fermion duality of two-dimensional field theories, this result also allows to show the validity of the prediction in the strong coupling regime of the Thirring model.
