Abstract: A soliton model for proton conductivity in Langmuir films is presented. The model contains three real scalar fields describing the hydrogen involved in the conduction, the hydrophilic head of the Langmuir film, and the water. Soliton solutions that describe proton motion along the hydrogen bonds are found. Under compression of the film, the distance between the minima of the proton potential and the strength of the hydrogen bonds between the film molecule and the water are changed. Such changes increase the probability of soliton creation. The model presented allows proton conductivity data in Langmuir films to be explained.
