Title: The Landau problem and noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: J. Gamboa and M. Loewe and F. Mendez and J. C. Rojas
Abstract: The conditions under which noncommutative quantum mechanics and the Landau problem are equivalent theories is explored. If the potential in noncommutative quantum mechanics is chosen as $V= \Omega \aleph$ with $\aleph$ defined in the text, then for the value ${\tilde \theta} = 0.22 \times 10^{-11} cm^2$ (that measures the noncommutative effects of the space), the Landau problem and noncommutative quantum mechanics are equivalent theories in the lowest Landau level. For other systems one can find differents values for ${\tilde \theta}$ and, therefore, the possible bounds for ${\tilde \theta}$ should be searched in a physical independent scenario. This last fact could explain the differents bounds for $\tilde \theta$ found in the literature.
