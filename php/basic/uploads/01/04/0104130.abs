Title: Superconformal Tensor Calculus in Five Dimensions
Authors: Tomoyuki Fujita and Keisuke Ohashi
Abstract: We present a full superconformal tensor calculus in five spacetime dimensions in which the Weyl multiplet has 32 Bose plus 32 Fermi degrees of freedom. It is derived by the dimensional reduction from the 6D superconformal tensor calculus. We present two types of 32+32 Weyl multiplets, vector multiplet, linear multiplet, hypermultiplet and nonlinear multiplet. Their superconformal transformation laws and the embedding and invariant action formulas are given.
