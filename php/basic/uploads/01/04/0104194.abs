Abstract: The masses of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the color superconducting phase of dense QCD with two light flavors are estimated by making use of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action. Parametrically, the masses of the doublet and antidoublet bosons are suppressed by a power of the coupling constant as compared to the value of the superconducting gap. This is qualitatively different from the mass expression for the singlet pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, resulting from non-perturbative effects. It is argued that the (anti-) doublet pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons form colorless [with respect to the unbroken SU(2)_{c}] charmonium-like bound states. The corresponding binding energy is also estimated.
