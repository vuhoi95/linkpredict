Title: Orientifold, Geometric Transition and Large N Duality for SO/Sp Gauge  Theories
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Kyungho Oh and Radu Tatar
Abstract: We extend the large N duality of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with additional chiral fields and arbitrary superpotential recently proposed by Cachazo, Intriligator and Vafa to the case of SO/Sp gauge groups. By orientifolding the geometric transition, we investigate a large N duality between N=1, SO/Sp supersymmetric theories with arbitrary superpotential and an Abelian N=2 theory with supersymmetry broken to N=1 by electric and magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.
