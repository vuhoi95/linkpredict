Title: The Acceleration of the Universe, a Challenge for String Theory
Authors: W. Fischler and A. Kashani-Poor and R. McNees and S. Paban
Abstract: Recent astronomical observations indicate that the universe is accelerating. We argue that generic quintessence models that accommodate the present day acceleration tend to accelerate eternally. As a consequence the resulting spacetimes exhibit event horizons. Hence, quintessence poses the same problems for string theory as asymptotic de Sitter spaces.
