Title: A note on the decay of noncommutative solitons
Authors: Ciprian Acatrinei and Corneliu Sochichiu
Abstract: We propose an ansatz for the equations of motion of the noncommutative model of a tachyonic scalar field interacting with a gauge field, which allows one to find time-dependent solutions describing decaying solitons. These correspond to the collapse of lower dimensional branes obtained through tachyon condensation of unstable brane systems in string theory.
