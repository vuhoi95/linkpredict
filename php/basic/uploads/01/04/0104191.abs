Title: Supersymmetric Moyal-Lax Representations
Authors: Ashok Das and Ziemowit Popowicz
Abstract: The super Moyal-Lax representation and the super Moyal momentum algebra are introduced and the properties of simple and extended supersymmetric integrable models are systematically investigated. It is shown that, much like in the bosonic cases, the super Moyal-Lax equation can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian equation and can be derived from an action. Similarly, we show that the parameter of non-commutativity, in this case, is related to the central charge of the second Hamiltonian structure of the system. The super Moyal-Lax description allows us to go to the dispersionless limit of these models in a singular limit and we discuss some of the properties of such systems.
