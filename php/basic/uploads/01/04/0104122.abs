Title: Rotating Brane World Black Holes
Authors: Moninder Singh Modgil and Sukanta Panda and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: A five dimensional rotating black string in a Randall-Sundrum brane world is considered. The black string intercepts the three brane in a four dimensional rotating black hole. The geodesic equations and the asymptotics in this background are discussed.
