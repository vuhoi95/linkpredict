Title: Solutions of the WDVV Equations and Integrable Hierarchies of KP type
Authors: H. Aratyn and J. van de Leur
Abstract: We show that reductions of KP hierarchies related to the loop algebra of $SL_n$ with homogeneous gradation give solutions of the Darboux-Egoroff system of PDE's. Using explicit dressing matrices of the Riemann-Hilbert problem generalized to include a set of commuting additional symmetries, we construct solutions of the Witten--Dijkgraaf--E. Verlinde--H. Verlinde equations.
