Title: Properties of the quasistationary universe in context of the Big-bang  cosmology problems
Authors: V. E. Kuzmichev and V. V. Kuzmichev
Abstract: Old and new puzzles of cosmology are reexamined from the point of view of quantum theory of the universe developed here. It is shown that in proposed approach the difficulties of the standard cosmology do not arise. The theory predicts the observed dimensions of the nonhomogeneities of matter density and the amplitude of the fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation temperature in the Universe and points to a new quantum mechanism of their origin. It allows to obtain the value of the deceleration parameter which is in good agreement with the recent SNe Ia measurements. The theory explains the large value of entropy of the Universe and describes other parameters.
