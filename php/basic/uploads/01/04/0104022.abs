Title: The structure of radiatively induced Lorentz and CPT violation in QED at  finite temperature
Authors: L. Cervi and L. Griguolo and D. Seminara
Abstract: We obtain the induced Lorentz- and CPT-violating term in QED at finite temperature using imaginary-time formalism and dimensional regularization. Its form resembles a Chern-Simons-like structure, but, unexpectedly, it does not depend on the temporal component of the fixed $b_\mu$ constant vector that is coupled to the axial current. Nevertheless Ward identities are respected and its coefficient vanishes at T=0, consistently with previous computations with the same regularization procedure, and it is a non-trivial function of temperature. We argue that at finite $T$ a Chern-Simons-like Lorentz- and CPT-violating term is generically present, the value of its coefficient being unambiguously determined up to a $T-$independent constant, related to the zero-temperature renormalization conditions.
