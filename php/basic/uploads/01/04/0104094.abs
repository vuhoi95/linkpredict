Title: Correlators in 2D string theory with vortex condensation
Authors: Sergei Alexandrov and Vladimir Kazakov
Abstract: We calculate one- and two-point correlators of winding operators in the matrix model of 2D string theory compactified on a circle, recently proposed for the description of string dynamics on the 2D black hole background.
