Title: 4D, N=1 Born-Infeld supergravity
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Sergei V. Ketov
Abstract: We propose the 4D, N=1 supergravitational analogues (avatars) of the 4D, N=1 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action in four dimensions for the first time, by using superspace. In particular, a new Born-Infeld type generalization of the Weyl supergravity action is given. A natural new Born-Infeld type generalization of the Einstein supergravity is found as well. We also brielfy discuss a construction of the four-dimensional Born-Infeld-Einstein supergravity from the AdS supergravity in five dimensions, which seems to be very natural in our approach.
