Title: Gaussian Effective Potential and the Coleman's normal-ordering  Prescription : the Functional Integral Formalism
Authors: Wen-Fa Lu and Chul Koo Kim
Abstract: For a class of system, the potential of whose Bosonic Hamiltonian has a Fourier representation in the sense of tempered distributions, we calculate the Gaussian effective potential within the framework of functional integral formalism. We show that the Coleman's normal-ordering prescription can be formally generalized to the functional integral formalism.
