Title: A universe in a global monopole
Authors: Katherine Benson and Inyong Cho
Abstract: We investigate brane physics in a universe with an extra dimensional global monopole and negative bulk cosmological constant. The graviton zero mode is naturally divergent; we thus invoke a physical cut-off to induce four dimensional gravity on a brane at the monopole core. Independently, the massive Kaluza-Klein modes have naturally compactified extra dimensions, inducing a discrete spectrum. This spectrum remains consistent with four dimensional gravity on the brane, even for small mass gap. Extra dimensional matter fields also induce four dimensional matter fields on the brane, with the same Kaluza-Klein spectrum of excited states. We choose parameters to solve the hierarchy problem; that is, to induce the observed hierarchy between particle and Planck scales in the effective four dimensional universe.
