Title: Interaction between gravitational waves and domain walls
Authors: Luis Bento and Jose P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of thick domain walls. The refraction index and spin properties of the solutions interior to the wall are analyzed in detail. It is shown that the gravitational waves suffer a refraction process by domain walls. The reflection and transmission coefficients are derived in the thin wall limit. In relation to the spin content, it is shown that the ``$\times$'' helicity 2 gravitational wave mode maintains in the domain wall the same polarization state as in vacuum. On the contrary, the ``+'' mode, of pure helicity 2 in vacuum, is contaminated inside the wall with a spin 0 state, as well as with spin 2, helicity 0 and 1 states.
