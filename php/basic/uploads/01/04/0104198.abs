Title: Unruh Radiation, Holography and Boundary Cosmology
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Andrei Zelnikov
Abstract: A uniformly acclerated observer in anti-deSitter space-time is known to detect thermal radiation when the acceleration exceeds a critical value. We investigate the holographic interpretation of this phenomenon. For uniformly accelerated trajectories transverse to the boundary of the AdS space, the hologram is a blob which expands along the boundary. Observers on the boundary co-moving with the hologram become observers in cosmological space-times. For supercritical accelerations one gets a Milne universe when the holographic screen is the boundary in Poincare coordinates, while for the boundary in hyperspherical coordinates one gets deSitter spacetimes. The presence or absence of thermality is then interpreted in terms of specific classes of observers in these cosmologies.
