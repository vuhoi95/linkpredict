Title: An action for supergravity interacting with super-p-brane sources
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Jose A. de Azcarraga and Jose M. Izquierdo and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We describe the coupled system of supergravity and a superbrane source by the sum of the group manifold action for D--dimensional supergravity and the action for a super--$p$--brane. We derive the generalized Einstein equation with the source and discuss the local fermionic symmetries of the coupled action. Our scheme could be especially relevant in $D=11, 10$, in which the superfield actions for supergravity are not known.
