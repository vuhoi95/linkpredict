Title: Duality of the Fermionic 2d Black Hole and N=2 Liouville Theory as  Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Kentaro Hori and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of the SL(2,R)/U(1) Kazama-Suzuki model, which is a fermionic generalization of the 2d Black Hole, and N=2 Liouville theory. We show that this duality is an example of mirror symmetry. The essential part of the derivation is to realize the fermionic 2d Black Hole as the low energy limit of a gauged linear sigma-model. Liouville theory is obtained by dualizing the charged scalar fields and taking into account the vortex-instanton effects, as proposed recently in non-dilatonic models. The gauged linear sigma-model we study has many useful generalizations which we briefly discuss. In particular, we show how to construct a variety of dilatonic superstring backgrounds which generalize the fermionic 2d Black Hole and admit a mirror description in terms of Toda-like theories.
