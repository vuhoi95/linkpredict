Title: Vacuum Polarisation Tensors in Constant Electromagnetic Fields: Part III
Authors: Holger Gies and Christian Schubert
Abstract: The string-inspired technique is used for a first calculation of the one-loop axialvector vacuum polarisation in a general constant electromagnetic field. A compact result is reached for the difference between this tensor and the corresponding vector vacuum polarisation. This result is confirmed by a Feynman diagram calculation. Its physical relevance is briefly discussed.
