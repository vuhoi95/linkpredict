Abstract: Recently, we presented the first non-Abelian flat directions that produce from a heterotic string model solely the three-generation MSSM states as the massless spectrum in the observable sector of the low energy effective field theory. In this paper we continue to develop the systematic techniques for the analysis of nonrenormalizable superpotential terms and non-Abelian flat direction in realistic string models. Some of our non-Abelian directions were F-flat to all finite orders in the superpotential. We study for the same string model the varying phenomenologies resulting from a large set of such all-order flat directions. We focus on the quark, charged lepton, and Higgs doublet mass matrices resulting for our phenomenologically superior non-Abelian flat direction. We review and apply a string-related method for generating large mass hierarchies between MSSM generations, first discussed in string-derived flipped SU(5) models, when all generational mass terms are of renormalizable or very low non-renormalizable order.
