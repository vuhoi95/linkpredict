Title: Loop symmetry of integrable vertex models at roots of unity
Authors: Christian Korff and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: It has been recently discovered in the context of the six vertex or XXZ model in the fundamental representation that new symmetries arise when the anisotropy parameter $(q+q^{-1})/2$ is evaluated at roots of unity $q^{N}=1$. These new symmetries have been linked to an $U(A^{(1)}_1)$ invariance of the transfer matrix and the corresponding spin-chain Hamiltonian.In this paper these results are generalized for odd primitive roots of unity to all vertex models associated with trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation by invoking representation independent methods which only take the algebraic structure of the underlying quantum groups $U_q(\hat g)$ into account. Here $\hat g$ is an arbitrary Kac-Moody algebra. Employing the notion of the boost operator it is then found that the Hamiltonian and the transfer matrix of the integrable model are invariant under the action of $U(\hat{g})$. For the simplest case $\hat g=A_1^{(1)}$ the discussion is also extended to even primitive roots of unity.
