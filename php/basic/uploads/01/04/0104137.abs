Title: Semiclassical Gauge Theories
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Pedro Labra√±a
Abstract: We study the properties of a non-abelian gauge theory subjected to a gauge invariant constraint given by the classical equations of motion. The constraint is not imposed by hand, but appears naturally when we study a particular type of local gauge transformations. In this way, all standard techniques to treat gauge theories are available. We will show that this theory lives at one-loop. Also this model retains some quantum characteristic of the usual non-abelian gauge theories as asymptotic freedom.
