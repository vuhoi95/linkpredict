Title: Bulk Physics at a Graviton Factory
Authors: Hooman Davoudiasl and Thomas G. Rizzo
Abstract: A general prediction of the 5-d Randall-Sundrum (RS) hierarchy model is the emergence of spin-2 Kaluza Klein (KK) gravitons with weak scale masses and couplings. The lowest order effective theory of the RS model is given by 5-d Einstein gravity which uniquely fixes the self-interactions of gravitons. We demonstrate that large numbers of light KK resonances could be produced at a future lepton-collider-based ``Graviton Factory''. Measuring the self-interactions of these KK gravitons will probe the accuracy of the 5-d Einstein gravity picture and, in addition, yield indirect information on the as yet untested self-coupling of the 4-d graviton. The self-interactions of the gravitons can be studied by measuring the decays of the heavier states to the lighter ones. Using the AdS/CFT picture, these can be interpretted as the decays of heavier resonances to lighter ones, in a strongly coupled 4-d CFT. We show that these decays have sufficient rates to be studied at future colliders and that they are also, in principle, sensitive to higher derivative operators, such as the Gauss-Bonnet term. In a generalized RS model, with non-universal 5-d fermion masses, FCNC's will be induced. We show that precise measurements of the rare decays of KK graviton/gauge states into flavor non-diagonal final states at a Graviton Factory can be used to map the 5-d fermion mass matrix.
