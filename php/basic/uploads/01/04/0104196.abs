Title: Linear and nonlinear realizations of superbranes
Authors: A. Kapustnikov and A. Shcherbakov
Abstract: The coordinate transformations which establish the direct relationship between the actions of linear and nonlinear realizations of supermembranes are proposed. It is shown that the Rocek-Tseytlin constraint known in the framework of the linear realization of the theory is simply equivalent to a limit of a "pure" nonlinear realization in which the field describing the massive mode of the supermembrane puts to zero.
