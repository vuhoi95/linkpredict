Title: A Note on Unitarity of Non-Relativistic Non-Commutative Theories
Authors: Toni Mateos and Alex Moreno
Abstract: We analyze the unitarity of a non-relativistic non-commutative scalar field theory. We show that electric backgrounds spoil unitarity while magnetic ones do not. Furthermore, unlike its relativistic counterparts, unitarity can not be restored (at least at the level of one-to-one scattering amplitude) by adding new states to the theory. This is a signal that the model cannot be embedded in a natural way in string theory.
