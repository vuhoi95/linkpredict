Title: Instability of Non-Commutative SYM Theories at Finite Temperature
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Esperanza Lopez and Michel H. G. Tytgat
Abstract: We extend our previous work on the quasi-particle excitations in N=4 non-commutative U(1) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. We show that above some critical temperature there is a tachyon in the spectrum of excitations. It is a collective transverse photon mode polarized in the non-commutative plane. Thus the theory seems to undergo a phase transition at high temperature. Furthermore we find that the group velocity of quasi-particles generically exceeds the speed of light at low momentum.
