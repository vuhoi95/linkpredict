Title: Extensions of Instantons
Authors: C. Anghel and N. Manolache
Abstract: In this paper, using the Atiyah-Ward equivalence and a theorem of Hitchin, one makes to correspond to certain bundles on the projective space, which are extensions of instanton bundles (in particular, these new bundles may have the first Chern class not congruent to 0 modulo the rank), bundles on the grassmanian Gr(2,4) or on the sphere S4, equiped with certain connections constructed from data associated to the bundle. Monads for these extensions are described.
