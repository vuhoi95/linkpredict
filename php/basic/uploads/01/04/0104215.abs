Title: Gauging Isometries on Hyperkahler Cones and Quaternion-Kahler Manifolds
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Martin Rocek and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We extend our previous results on the relation between quaternion-Kahler manifolds and hyperkahler cones and we describe how isometries, moment maps and scalar potentials descend from the cone to the quaternion-Kahler space. As an example of the general construction, we discuss the gauging and the corresponding scalar potential of hypermultiplets with the unitary Wolf spaces as target spaces. This class includes the universal hypermultiplet.
