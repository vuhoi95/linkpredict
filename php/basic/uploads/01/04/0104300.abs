Title: Cross Sections and Lorentz Violation
Authors: Don Colladay and Alan Kostelecky
Abstract: The derivation of cross sections and decay rates in the Lorentz-violating standard-model extension is discussed. General features of the physics are described, and some conceptual and calculational issues are addressed. As an illustrative example, the cross section for the specific process of electron-positron pair annihilation into two photons is obtained.
