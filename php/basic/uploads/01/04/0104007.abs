Title: Gravity on branes
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Joseph Katz
Abstract: We consider the four dimensional discontinuity generated by two identical pieces of a five dimensional space pasted along their edge (that is a "brane" in a "$Z_2$-symmetric" "bulk"). Using a four plus one decomposition of the Riemann tensor we write the equations for gravity on the brane and recover in a simple manner a number of known "brane world" scenarios. We study under which conditions these equations reduce, exactly or approximately, to the four dimensional Einstein equations. We conclude that if the bulk is imposed to be only an Einstein space near the brane, Einstein's equations can be recovered approximately on the brane, but if it is imposed to be strictly anti-de Sitter space then the Einstein equations cannot hold, even approximately, on a quasi-Minkowskian brane, unless matter obeys a very contrived equation of state.
