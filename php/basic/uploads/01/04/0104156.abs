Title: Curved BPS domain wall solutions in five-dimensional gauged supergravity
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Gianguido Dall'Agata and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of constructing supersymmetric curved domain wall solutions in five-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity, which are supported by non-constant scalar fields belonging either to vector multiplets only or to vector and hypermultiplets. We show that the BPS equations for the warp factor and for the vector scalars are modified by the presence of a four-dimensional cosmological constant on the domain wall, in agreement with earlier results by DeWolfe, Freedman, Gubser and Karch. We also show that the cosmological constant on the domain wall is anti-de Sitter like and that it constitutes an independent quantity, not related to any of the objects appearing in the context of very special geometry.
