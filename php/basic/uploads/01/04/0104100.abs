Title: Linear sigma model toolshed for D-brane physics
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and John McGreevy
Abstract: Building on earlier work, we construct linear sigma models for strings on curved spaces in the presence of branes. Our models include an extremely general class of brane-worldvolume gauge field configurations. We explain in an accessible manner the mathematical ideas which suggest appropriate worldsheet interactions for generating a given open string background. This construction provides an explanation for the appearance of the derived category in D-brane physics complementary to that of recent work of Douglas.
