Title: Remarks on Screening in a Gauge-Invariant Formalism
Authors: Patricio Gaete and Iv√°n Schmidt
Abstract: In this paper we display a direct and physically attractive derivation of the screening contribution to the interaction potential in the Chiral Schwinger model and generalized Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory. It is shown that these results emerge naturally when a correct separation between gauge-invariant and gauge degrees of freedom is made. Explicit expressions for gauge-invariant fields are found.
