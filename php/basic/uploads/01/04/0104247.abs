Title: Three loop gauge beta-function for the most general single  gauge-coupling theory
Authors: A. G. M. Pickering and J. A. Gracey and D. R. T. Jones
Abstract: We calculate the three loop contribution to the beta-function of the gauge coupling constant in a general, anomaly-free, renormalisable gauge field theory involving a single gauge coupling using the background field method in the MSbar scheme.
