Title: Gravitational field of a rotating gravitational dyon
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Z. Ya. Turakulov
Abstract: We have obtained the most general solution of the Einstein vacuum equation for the axially symmetric stationary metric in which both the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for particle motion and the Klein - Gordon equation are separable. It can be interpreted to describe the gravitational field of a rotating dyon, a particle endowed with both gravoelectric (mass) and gravomagnetic (NUT parameter) charge. Further, there also exists a duality relation between the two charges and the radial and the polar angle coordinates which keeps the solution invariant. The solution can however be transformed into the known Kerr - NUT solution indicating its uniqueness under the separability of equations of motion.
