Title: Finite Energy Sum Rules in Potential Scattering
Authors: N. Graham and R. L. Jaffe and M. Quandt and H. Weigel
Abstract: We study scattering theory identities previously obtained as consistency conditions in the context of one-loop quantum field theory calculations. We prove the identities using Jost function techniques and study applications.
