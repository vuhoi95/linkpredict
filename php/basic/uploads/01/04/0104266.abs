Title: On U(1)-charged domain walls
Authors: V. A. Lensky and V. A. Gani and A. E. Kudryavtsev
Abstract: A classical field system of two interacting fields -- a real Higgs field and a complex scalar field -- is considered. It is shown that in such field system a non-trivial solution exists, which is U(1) charged topological kink. Some questions of stability of the obtained solution are discussed. An improved variational procedure for searching of topological U(1) charged solutions is given.
