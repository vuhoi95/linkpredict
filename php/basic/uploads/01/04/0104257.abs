Title: Massive 3+1 Aharonov-Bohm fermions in an MIT cylinder
Authors: Marcelo De Francia and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: We study the effect of a background flux string on the vacuum energy of massive Dirac fermions in 3+1 dimensions confined to a finite spatial region through MIT boundary conditions. We treat two admissible self-adjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian. The external sector is also studied and unambiguous results for the Casimir energy of massive fermions in the whole space are obtained.
