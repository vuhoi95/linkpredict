Title: The Standard Model in the Latticized Bulk
Authors: Hsin-Chia Cheng and Christopher T. Hill and Stefan Pokorski and Jing Wang
Abstract: We construct the manifestly gauge invariant effective Lagrangian in 3+1 dimensions describing the Standard Model in 4+1 dimensions, following the transverse lattice technique. We incorporate split generation fermions and we explore naturalness for two Higgs configurations: a universal Higgs VEV, common to each transverse brane, and a local Higgs VEV centered on a single brane with discrete exponential attenuation to other branes, emulating the split-generation model. Extra dimensions, with explicit Higgs, do not ameliorate the naturalness problem.
