Title: Comments on the Energy-Momentum Tensor in Non-Commutative Field Theories
Authors: Mohab Abou-Zeid and Harald Dorn
Abstract: In a non-commutative field theory, the energy-momentum tensor obtained from the Noether method needs not be symmetric; in a massless theory, it needs not be traceless either. In a non-commutative scalar field theory, the method yields a locally conserved yet non-symmetric energy-momentum tensor whose trace does not vanish for massless fields. A non-symmetric tensor also governs the response of the action to a general coordinate transformation. In non-commutative gauge theory, if translations are suitably combined with gauge transformations, the method yields a covariantly constant tensor which is symmetric but only gauge covariant. Using suitable Wilson functionals, this can be improved to yield a locally conserved and gauge invariant, albeit non-symmetric, energy-momentum tensor.
