Title: Nested braneworlds and strong brane gravity
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Antonio Padilla
Abstract: We find the gravitational field of a `nested' domain wall living entirely within a brane-universe, or, a localised vortex within a wall. For a vortex living on a critical Randall-Sundrum brane universe, we show that the induced gravitational field on the brane is identical to that of an (n-1)-dimensional vacuum domain wall. We also describe how to set-up a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario using a flat critical vortex living on a subcritical (adS) brane universe.
