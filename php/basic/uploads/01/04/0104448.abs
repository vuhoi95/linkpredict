Title: Interlayer Exchange Interactions, SU(4) Soft Waves and Skyrmions in  Bilayer Quantum Hall Ferromagnets
Authors: Z. F. Ezawa and K. Hasebe
Abstract: The Coulomb exchange interaction is the driving force for quantum coherence in quantum Hall systems. We construct a microscopic Landau-site Hamiltonian for the exchange interaction in bilayer quantum Hall ferromagnets, which is characterized by the SU(4) isospin structure. By taking a continuous limit, the Hamiltonian gives rise to the SU(4) nonlinear sigma model in the von-Neumann-lattice formulation. The ground-state energy is evaluated at filling factors $\nu =1,2,3,4$. It is shown at $\nu =1$ that there are 3 independent soft waves, where only one soft wave is responsible for the coherent tunneling of electrons between the two layers. It is also shown at $\nu =1$ that there are 3 independent skyrmion states apart from the translational degree of freedom. They are CP$^{3}$ skyrmions enjoying the spin-charge entanglement confined within the \LLL.
