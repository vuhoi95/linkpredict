Title: Quaternionic Extension of the Double Taub-NUT Metric
Authors: Pierre-Yves Casteill and Evgeny Ivanov and Galliano Valent
Abstract: Starting from the generic harmonic superspace action of the quaternion-K\"ahler sigma models and using the quotient approach we present, in an explicit form, a quaternion-K\"ahler extension of the double Taub-NUT metric. It possesses $U(1)\times U(1)$ isometry and supplies a new example of non-homogeneous Einstein metric with self-dual Weyl tensor.
