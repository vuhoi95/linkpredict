Title: X-ray dichroism and orbital anapoles
Authors: Paolo Carra and Andres Jerez and Ivan Marri
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of photo-absorption spectroscopies in noncentrosymmetric systems, covering both x-ray and optical regions. Integrated dichroic spectra are interpreted using microscopic effective operators, which are obtained by coupling the orbital angular momentum to the orbital anapole. Symmetry arguments afford a classification of valence-electron states in the presence of parity nonconserving hybridisation. Enantiomorphism is identified by a two-particle chiral operator.
