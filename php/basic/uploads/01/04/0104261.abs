Title: Possible confinement mechanisms for nonrelativistic particles on a line
Authors: P. C. Stichel and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: The gauge model of nonrelativistic particles on a line interacting with nonstandard gravitational fields [5] is supplemented by the addition of a (non)-Abelian gauge interaction. Solving for the gauge fields we obtain equations, in closed form, for a classical two particle system. The corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger equation, obtained by the Moyal quantization procedure, is solved analytically. Its solutions exhibit two different confinement mechanisms - dependent on the sign of the coupling $\lambda$ to the nonstandard gravitational fields. For $\lambda>0$ confinement is due to a rising potential whereas for $\lambda<0$ it is due to to the dynamical (geometric) bag formation. Numerical results for the corresponding energy spectra are given. For a particular relation between two coupling constants the model fits into the scheme of supersymmetrical quantum mechanics.
