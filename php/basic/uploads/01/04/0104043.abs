Title: Barrett-Crane spin foam model from generalized BF-type action for  gravity
Authors: Richard E. Livine and Daniele Oriti
Abstract: We study a generalized action for gravity as a constrained BF theory, and its relationship with the Plebanski action. We analyse the discretization of the constraints and the spin foam quantization of the theory, showing that it leads naturally to the Barrett-Crane spin foam model for quantum gravity. Our analysis holds true in both the Euclidean and Lorentzian formulation.
