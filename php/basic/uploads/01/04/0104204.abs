Title: Duality and Enhanced Gauge Symmetry in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Taichi Itoh and Phillial Oh and Cheol Ryou
Abstract: We investigate the enlarged CP(N) model in 2+1 dimensions. This is a hybrid of two CP(N) models coupled with each other in a dual symmetric fashion, and it exhibits the gauge symmetry enhancement and radiative induction of the finite off-diagonal gauge boson mass as in the 1+1 dimensional case. We solve the mass gap equations and study the fixed point structure in the large-N limit. We find an interacting ultraviolet fixed point which is in contrast with the 1+1 dimensional case. We also compute the large-N effective gauge action explicitly.
