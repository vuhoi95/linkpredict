Title: Gravitating monopoles in SU(3) gauge theory
Authors: Y. Brihaye and B. M. A. G Piette
Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations for an SU(3) gauge group in a spherically symmetric ansatz. Several properties of the gravitating monopole solutions are obtained an compared with their SU(2) counterpart.
