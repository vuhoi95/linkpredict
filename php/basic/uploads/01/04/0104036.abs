Title: An Exact Solution to Seiberg-Witten Equation of Noncommutative Gauge  Theory
Authors: Yuji Okawa and Hirosi Ooguri
Abstract: We derive an exact expression for the Seiberg-Witten map of noncommutative gauge theory. It is found by studying the coupling of the gauge field to the Ramond-Ramond potentials in string theory. Our result also proves the earlier conjecture by Liu.
