Title: Kink Dynamics in a Lattice Model with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: T. Ioannidou and J. Pouget and E. Aifantis
Abstract: This paper proposes a one-dimensional lattice model with long-range interactions which, in the continuum, keeps its nonlocal behaviour. In fact, the long-time evolution of the localized waves is governed by an asymptotic equation of the Benjamin-Ono type and allows the explicit construction of moving kinks on the lattice. The long-range particle interaction coefficients on the lattice are determined by the Benjamin-Ono equation.
