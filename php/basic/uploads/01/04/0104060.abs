Title: A Note on Symplectic, Multisymplectic Scheme in Finite Element Method
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Xiao-mei Ji and Yu-Qi Li and Ke Wu
Abstract: We find that with uniform mesh, the numerical schemes derived from finite element method can keep a preserved symplectic structure in one-dimensional case and a preserved multisymplectic structure in two-dimentional case in certain discrete version respectively. These results are in fact the intrinsic reason that the numerical experiments indicate that such finite element algorithms are accurate in practice.
