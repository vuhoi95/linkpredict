Abstract: The possibility that non-supersymmetric conformal field theories softly broken below 100 TeV may provide an alternative to conventional grand unification is explored. We consider a low energy theory presumed to be of this type arising from the Type IIB superstring compactified on a $AdS_5 \times S_5/\Gamma$ space whose gauge group and the particle content are severely restricted by the compactification process. We present an example of a resulting $SU(4)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ with three generations, which leads to coupling unification and a prediction for $sin^2\theta_W\simeq .227$ and other phenomenology generally consistent with observations.
