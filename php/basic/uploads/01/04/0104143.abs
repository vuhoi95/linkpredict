Title: Exact Tachyon Condensation on Noncommutative Torus
Authors: Hiroshige Kajiura and Yutaka Matsuo and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We construct the exact noncommutative solutions on tori. This gives an exact description of tachyon condensation on bosonic D-branes, non-BPS D-branes and brane-antibrane systems. We obtain various bound states of D-branes after the tachyon condensation. Our results show that these solutions can be generated by applying the gauge Morita equivalence between the constant curvature projective modules. We argue that there is a general framework of the noncommutative geometry based on the notion of Morita equivalence which underlies this specific example.
