Abstract: We study the holographic principle in the brane cosmology. Especially we describe how to accommodate the 5D anti de Sitter Schwarzschild (AdSS$_5$) black hole in the Binetruy-Deffayet-Langlois (BDL) approach of brane cosmology. It is easy to make a connection between a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black hole and a conformal field theory (CFT)-radiation dominated universe on the brane in the moving domain wall approach. But this is not established in the BDL approach. In this case we use two parameters $C_1, C_2$ in the Friedmann equation. These arise from integration and are really related to the choice of initial bulk matter. If one chooses a bulk energy density $\rho_B$ to account for a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black hole and the static fifth dimension, a CFT-radiation term with $\rho_{CFT} \sim M/a^{4}$ comes out from the bulk matter without introducing a localized matter distribution on the brane. This means that the holographic principle can be established in the BDL brane cosmology.
