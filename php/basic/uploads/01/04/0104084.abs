Title: From Q-walls to Q-balls
Authors: R. B. MacKenzie and M. B. Paranjape
Abstract: We study $Q$-ball type solitons in arbitrary spatial dimensions in the setting recently described by Kusenko, where the scalar field potential has a flat direction which rises much slower than $\phi^2$. We find that the general formula for energy as a function of the charge is, $E_d\sim Q_d^{(d/d+1)}$ in spatial dimension $d$. We show that the Hamiltonian governing the stability analysis of certain $Q$-wall configurations, which are one dimensional $Q$-ball solutions extended to planar, wall-like configurations in three dimensions, can be related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. $Q$-wall and $Q$-string (the corresponding extensions of 2 dimensional $Q$-balls in 3 spatial dimensions) configurations are seen to be unstable, and will tend to bead and form planar or linear arrays of 3 dimensional $Q$-balls. The lifetime of these wall-like and string-like configurations is, however, arbitrarily large and hence they could be of relevance to cosmological density fluctuations and structure formation in the early Universe.
