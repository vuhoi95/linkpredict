Abstract: We consider scalar and spinor particles in the spacetime of a domain wall in the context of low energy effective string theories, such as the generalized scalar-tensor gravity theories. This class of theories allows for an arbitrary coupling of the wall and the (gravitational) scalar field. First, we derive the metric of a wall in the weak-field approximation and we show that it depends on the wall's surface energy density and on two post-Newtonian parameters. Then, we solve the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations in this spacetime. We obtain the spectrum of energy eigenvalues and the current density in the scalar and spinor cases, respectively. We show that these quantities, except in the case of the energy spectrum for a massless spinor particle, depend on the parameters that characterize the scalar-tensor domain wall.
