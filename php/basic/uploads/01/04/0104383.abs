Title: Critical and Multicritical Semi-Random (1+d)-Dimensional Lattices and  Hard Objects in d Dimensions
Authors: Philippe Di Francesco and Emmanuel Guitter
Abstract: We investigate models of (1+d)-D Lorentzian semi-random lattices with one random (space-like) direction and d regular (time-like) ones. We prove a general inversion formula expressing the partition function of these models as the inverse of that of hard objects in d dimensions. This allows for an exact solution of a variety of new models including critical and multicritical generalized (1+1)-D Lorentzian surfaces, with fractal dimensions $d_F=k+1$, k=1,2,3,..., as well as a new model of (1+2)-D critical tetrahedral complexes, with fractal dimension $d_F=12/5$. Critical exponents and universal scaling functions follow from this solution. We finally establish a general connection between (1+d)-D Lorentzian lattices and directed-site lattice animals in (1+d) dimensions.
