Title: Hamiltonian vs Lagrangian Embedding of a Massive Spin-one Theory  Involving 2-form Field
Authors: E. Harikumar and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian embedding of a first-order, massive spin-one, gauge non-invariant theory involving anti-symmetric tensor field. We apply the BFV-BRST generalised canonical approach to convert the model to a first class system and construct nil-potent BFV-BRST charge and an unitarising Hamiltonian. The canonical analysis of the St\"uckelberg formulation of this model is presented. We bring out the contrasting feature in the constraint structure, specifically with respect to the reducibility aspect, of the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian embedded model. We show that to obtain manifestly covariant St\"uckelberg Lagrangian from the BFV embedded Hamiltonian, phase space has to be further enlarged and show how the reducible gauge structure emerges in the embedded model.
