Abstract: We formulate noncommutative three-dimensional (3d) gravity by making use of its connection with 3d Chern-Simons theory. In the Euclidean sector, we consider the particular example of topology $T^2 \times R$ and show that the 3d black hole solves the noncommutative equations. We then consider the black hole on a constant U(1) background and show that the black hole charges (mass and angular momentum) are modified by the presence of this background.
