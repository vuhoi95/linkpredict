Title: Construction of non-Abelian gauge theories on noncommutative spaces
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Lutz MÃ¶ller and Stefan Schraml and Peter Schupp and Julius Wess
Abstract: We present a formalism to explicitly construct non-Abelian gauge theories on noncommutative spaces (induced via a star product with aconstant Poisson tensor) from a consistency relation. This results in an expansion of the gauge parameter, the noncommutative gauge potential and fields in the fundamental representation, in powers of a parameter of the noncommutativity. This allows the explicit construction of actions for these gauge theories.
