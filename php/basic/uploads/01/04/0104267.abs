Title: A new exactly solvable Eckart-type potential
Authors: Elso Drigo Filho and Regina Maria Ricotta
Abstract: A new exact analytically solvable Eckart-type potential is presented, a generalisation of the Hulthen potential. The study through Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics is presented together with the hierarchy of Hamiltonians and the shape invariance property.
