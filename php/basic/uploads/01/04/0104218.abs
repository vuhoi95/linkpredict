Title: On Higher Derivative Terms in Tachyon Effective Actions
Authors: N. D. Lambert and I. Sachs
Abstract: We reconstruct the tachyon effective action for unstable D-branes in superstring theory by examining its behaviour near exactly marginal deformations, where the ambigous higher derivative terms can be eliminated. We then compare this action with that obtained in boundary string field theory and find remarkable agreement. In particular, the tension for lower dimensional branes and the BI-action for the centre of mass motion are reprodued exactly. We also comment on the action for tachyons on the kink in a D-brane/anti-D-brane system and on bosonic string theory.
