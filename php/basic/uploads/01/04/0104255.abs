Title: Background field method in the Wilson formulation
Authors: M. Bonini and E. Tricarico
Abstract: A cutoff regularization for a pure Yang-Mills theory is implemented within the background field method keeping explicit the gauge invariance of the effective action. The method has been applied to compute the beta function at one loop order.
