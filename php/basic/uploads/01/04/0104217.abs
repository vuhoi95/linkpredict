Title: Wilsonian Renormalization Group and the Non-Commutative IR/UV Connection
Authors: Luca Griguolo and Massimo Pietroni
Abstract: We study the IR/UV connection of the four-dimensional non-commutative phi^4 theory by using the Wilsonian Renormalization Group equation. Extending the usual formulation to the non-commutative case we are able to prove UV renormalizability to all orders in perturbation theory. The full RG equations are finite in the IR, but perturbative approximations of them are plagued by IR divergences. The latter can be systematically resummed in a way analogous to what is done in finite temperature field theory. As an application, next-to-leading order corrections to the two-point function are explicitly computed. The usual Wilsonian picture, i.e. the insensitivity of the IR regime to the UV, does not hold in the non-commutative case. Nevertheless it can be partially recovered by a matching procedure, in which a high-energy theory, defined in the deep non-commutative regime, is connected at some intermediate scale to a commutative low-energy theory. The latter knows about non-commutativity only through the boundary conditions for two would-be irrelevant couplings.
