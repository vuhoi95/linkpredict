Title: Quantization of spinning particle in arbitrary background
Authors: S. P. Gavrilov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: The article is a natural continuation of the papers by Gavrilov and Gitman (Class.Quant.Grav. {\bf 17} (2000) L133; Int. J. Mod. Phys. A15 (2000) 4499) devoted to relativistic particle quantization. Here we generalize the problem, considering the quantization of a spinning particle in arbitrary gravitational background. The nontriviality of such a generalization is related to the neccessity of solving complicated ordering problems. Similar to the flat space-time case, we show in the course of the canonical quantization how a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics of spinning particle in gravitational and electromagnetic backgrounds can be constructed.
