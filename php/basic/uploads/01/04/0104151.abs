Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Xiao-mei Ji and Yu-Qi Li and Ke Wu
Abstract: By the simple finite element method, we study the symplectic, multisymplectic structures and relevant preserving properties in some semi-linear elliptic boundary value problem in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces respectively. We find that with uniform mesh, the numerical schemes derived from finite element method can keep a preserved symplectic structure in one-dimensional case and a preserved multisymplectic structure in two-dimentional case respectively. These results are in fact the intrinsic reason that the numerical experiments indicate that such finite element schemes are accurate in practice.
