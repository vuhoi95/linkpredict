Title: Comment on `Renormalization-Group Calculation of the Dependence on  Gravity of the Surface Tension and Bending Rigidity of a Fluid Interface'
Authors: H. W. Diehl and R. K. Zia
Abstract: It is shown that the interface model introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 2369 (2001) violates fundamental symmetry requirements for vanishing gravitational acceleration $g$, so that its results cannot be applied to critical properties of interfaces for $g\to 0$.
