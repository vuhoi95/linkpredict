Title: Connes' Distance of One-Dimensional Lattices: General Cases
Authors: Jian Dai and Xing-Chang Song
Abstract: Connes' distance formula is applied to endow linear metric to three 1D lattices of different topology, with a generalization of lattice Dirac operator written down by Dimakis et al to contain a non-unitary link-variable. Geometric interpretation of this link-variable is lattice spacing and parallel transport.
