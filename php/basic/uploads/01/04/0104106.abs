Title: Comments on the renormalizability of the Broken Phase in Noncommutative  Scalar Field Theory
Authors: S. Sarkar and B. Sathiapalan
Abstract: We study the noncommutative $\phi^4$ theory with spontaneously broken global O(2) symmetry in 4 dimensions. We demonstrate the renormalizability at one loop. This does not require any choice of ordering of the fields in the interaction terms. It involves regulating the ultraviolet and infrared divergences in a manner consistent with the Ward identities.
