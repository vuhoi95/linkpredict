Title: Gauge-Invariant Couplings of Noncommutative Branes to Ramond-Ramond  Backgrounds
Authors: Sunil Mukhi and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We derive the couplings of noncommutative D-branes to spatially varying Ramond-Ramond fields, extending our earlier results in hep-th/0009101. These couplings are expressed in terms of *n products of operators involving open Wilson lines. Equivalence of the noncommutative to the commutative couplings implies interesting identities as well as an expression for the Seiberg-Witten map that was previously conjectured. We generalise our couplings to include transverse scalars, thereby obtaining a Seiberg-Witten map relating commutative and noncommutative descriptions of these scalars. RR couplings for unstable non-BPS branes are also proposed.
