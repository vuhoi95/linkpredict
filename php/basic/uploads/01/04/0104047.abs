Title: Deconfinement at N>2: SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Ian. I Kogan and Alex Kovner and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We analyse the deconfining phase transition in the SU(N) Georgi-Glashow model in 2+1 dimensions. We show that the phase transition is second order for any N, and the universality class is different from the Z(N) invariant Villain model. At large N the conformal theory describing the fixed point is a deformed SU(N)_1 WZNW model which has N-1 massless fields. It is therefore likely that its self-dual infrared fixed point is described by the Fateev-Zamolodchikov theory of Z(N) parafermions.
