Title: Algebraic renormalization of twisted N=2 supersymmetry with Z=2 central  extension
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Dietmar MÃ¼lsch
Abstract: We study the renormalizability of (massive) topological QCD based on the algebraic BRST technique by adopting a non-covariant Landau type gauge and making use of the full topological superalgebra. The most general local counter terms are determined and it is shown that in the presence of central charges the BRST cohomology remains trivial. By imposing an additional set of stability constraints it is proven that the matter action of topological QCD is perturbatively finite.
