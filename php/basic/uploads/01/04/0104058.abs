Title: Effective Lagrangian with valence gluons in extended SU(2) QCD model
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Haewon Lee and D. G. Pak
Abstract: The effective action with homogeneous valence (off-diagonal) gluons as background fields in the extended SU(2) model of QCD is obtained in one-loop approximation. We keep the manifest gauge and Lorentz invariance during whole calculation by using a special gauge-fixing recipe and taking into account the quartic interaction terms in the original Lagrangian as well. It has been shown that the effective Lagrangian gains a positive imaginary part.
