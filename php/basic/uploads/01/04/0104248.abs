Title: Gravitational couplings of charged leptons in a medium
Authors: Indrajit Mitra and Jose F. Nieves and Palash B. Pal
Abstract: We calculate the leading order matter-induced corrections to the gravitational interactions of charged leptons and their antiparticles in a medium that contains electrons but not the other charged leptons, such as normal matter. The gravitational coupling, which is universal at the tree level, is found to be flavor-dependent, and also different for the corresponding antiparticles, when the corrections of $O(\alpha)$ are taken into account. General expressions are obtained for the matter-induced corrections to the gravitational mass in a generic matter background, and explicit formulas for those corrections are given in terms of the macroscopic parameters of the medium for particular conditions of the background gases.
