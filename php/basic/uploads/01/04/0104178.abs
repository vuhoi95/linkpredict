Title: Uniform Twistor-Like Formulation of Massive and Massless Superparticles  with Tensorial Central Charges
Authors: S. Fedoruk and V. G. Zima
Abstract: We construct the manifestly Lorentz-invariant twistorial formulation of N=1 D=4 superparticle with tensorial central charges which describes massive and massless cases in a uniform manner. The tensorial central charges are realized in terms of even spinor variables and central charge coordinates. The full analysis of the number of conserved supersymmetries has been carried out. In the massive case the superparticle preserves 1/4 or 1/2 of target-space supersymmetries whereas the massless superparticle preserves two or three supersymmetries.
