Title: Unconstrained Variables of Non-Commutative Open Strings
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and M. A. Santos and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: The boundary conditions of the bosonic string theory in non-zero $B$-field background are equivalent to the second class constraints of a discretized version of the theory. By projecting the original canonical coordinates onto the constraint surface we derive a set of coordinates of string that are unconstrained.These coordinates represent a natural framework for the quantization of the theory.
