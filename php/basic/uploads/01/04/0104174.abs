Title: Non-conformally flat bulk spacetime and the 3-brane world
Authors: Parampreet Singh and Naresh Dadhich
Abstract: We show that for non-conformally flat bulk spacetime, there exist no bound modes for zero mass graviton on the 3-brane. The brane world model is therefore unstable for the bulk spacetime being different from the conformally flat anti - de Sitter space.
