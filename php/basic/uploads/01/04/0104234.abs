Title: A proposal on the possibility of detecting D-particles
Authors: Elias Gravanis and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: In a previous study we showed that D0-branes (particles) can operate as sources of very-high-energy radiation, as a result of an unstable spacetime distortion that follows a D0-particle/closed string state scattering. The effect can happen only if the energy of the incident particle/closed string state exceeds a certain threshold, which is of order of the subsequently radiated energy. In this letter we speculate on the possibility of detection of the D-particles due to this phenomenon. The energies of the emitted radiation range in a narrow window of size less than one order of magnitude. Observation-wise, this radiation will appear as an excess of photons in a narrow band in the spectrum of high energy cosmic rays. From their energy we can then read off the value of the product of the string mass scale times the string coupling. We speculate on the possibility that high energy neutrinos from GRB's play the r\^ole of the necessary high energy flux that triggers the effect, by striking D-particles lying inside the mean free path of the photons as measured from Earth. The possibilty of this effect operating as a mechanism of GZK cutoff violation is also pointed out.
