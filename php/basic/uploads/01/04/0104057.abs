Title: Localized Gravity and Large Hierarchy from String Theory ?
Authors: P. Berglund and T. Hubsch and D. Minic
Abstract: Within a $D$-dimensional superstring spacetime, we construct a non-supersymmetric brane-world with localized gravity and large hierarchy between the scale in the bulk, $M_D$, and the scale on the brane, $M_{D-2}$. The localization of gravity and the large hierarchy are both guaranteed by the presence of non-trivial stringy moduli, such as the axion-dilaton system for the Type-IIB string theory.
