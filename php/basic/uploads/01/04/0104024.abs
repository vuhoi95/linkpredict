Title: Large-n Critical Behavior of O(n)xO(m) Spin Models
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Paolo Rossi and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We consider the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with O(n)x O(m) symmetry and compute the critical exponents at all fixed points to O(n^{-2}) and to O(\epsilon^3) in a \epsilon=4-d expansion. We also consider the corresponding non-linear sigma model and determine the fixed points and the critical exponents to O(\tilde{\epsilon}^2) in the \tilde{\epsilon}=d-2 expansion. Using these results, we draw quite general conclusions on the fixed-point structure of models with O(n)xO(m) symmetry for n large and all 2 < d < 4.
