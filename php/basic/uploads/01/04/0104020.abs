Title: On Stability Of The Crystal Universe Models
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Xinmin Zhang and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We generalize the Goldberger-Wise mechanism and study the stability of the Crystal Universe models. We show that the model can be stabilized, however for configurations of Crystal Universe in the absence of fine-tuning, brane crystals are not equidistant, i.e. a $"-+"$ pair is far away from adjacent $"-+"$ pair, except for the fixed points of the orbifold, which differs from the assumptions taken in the literature.
