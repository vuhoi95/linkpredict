Title: Exact Results in Noncommutative ${\cal N}=2$ Supersymmetric Gauge  Theories
Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and Valentin V. Khoze and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of noncommutative $\N=2$ supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theories in the Coulomb phase. Exact results are derived for the leading terms in the derivative expansion of the Wilsonian effective action. We find that in the infrared regime the U(1) subgroup decouples, and the remaining SU(N) is described by the ordinary commutative Seiberg-Witten solution. IR/UV mixing is present in the U(1), but not in SU(N). Our analysis is based on explicit perturbative and multi-instanton calculations.
