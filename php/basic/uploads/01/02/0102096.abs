Title: N-loop Treatment of Overlapping Diagrams by the Implicit Regularization  Technique
Authors: S. R. Gobira and M. C. Nemes
Abstract: We show how the Implicit Regularization Technique (IRT) can be used for the perturbative renormalization of a simple field theoretical model, generally used as a test theory for new techniques. While IRT has been applied successfully in many problems involving symmetry breaking anomalies and nonabelian gauge groups, all at one loop level, this is the first attempt to a generalization of the technique for perturbative renormalization. We show that the overlapping divergent loops can be given a completely algebraic treatment. We display the connection between renormalization and counterterms in the Lagrangian. The algebraic advantages make IRT worth studying for perturbative renormalization of gauge theories.
