Title: Scalar Field Dark Matter
Authors: T. Matos and F. S. Guzman and L. A. Urena-Lopez and D. Nunez
Abstract: This work is a review of the last results of research on the Scalar Field Dark Matter model of the Universe at cosmological and at galactic level. We present the complete solution to the scalar field cosmological scenario in which the dark matter is modeled by a scalar field $\Phi$ with the scalar potential $V(\Phi)=V_{0}(cosh {(\lambda \sqrt{\kappa_{0}}\Phi)}-1)$ and the dark energy is modeled by a scalar field $\Psi$, endowed with the scalar potential $\tilde{V}(\Psi)= \tilde{V_{0}}(\sinh{(\alpha \sqrt{\kappa_{0}}\Psi)})^{\beta}$, which together compose the 95% of the total matter energy in the Universe. The model presents successfully deals with the up to date cosmological observations, and is a good candidate to treat the dark matter problem at the galactic level.
