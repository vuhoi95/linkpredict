Title: Supergravity Unification
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and R. Arnowitt and Pran Nath
Abstract: A review is given of the historical developments of 1982 that lead to the supergravity unified model (SUGRA)with gravity mediated breaking of supersymmetry. Further developments and applications of the model in the period 1982-85 are also discussed. The supergravity unified model and its minimal version (mSUGRA) are currently among the leading candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model. A brief note on the developments from the present vantage point is included.
