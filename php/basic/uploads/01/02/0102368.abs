Title: Renormalization group and nonlinear susceptibilities of cubic  ferromagnets at criticality
Authors: D. V. Pakhnin and A. I. Sokolov
Abstract: For the three-dimensional cubic model, the nonlinear susceptibilities of the fourth, sixth, and eighth orders are analyzed and the parameters \delta^(i) characterizing their reduced anisotropy are evaluated at the cubic fixed point. In the course of this study, the renormalized sextic coupling constants entering the small-field equation of state are calculated in the four-loop approximation and the universal values of these couplings are estimated by means of the Pade-Borel-Leroy resummation of the series obtained. The anisotropy parameters are found to be: \delta^(4) = 0.054 +/- 0.012, \delta^(6) = 0.102 +/- 0.02, and \delta^(8) = 0.144 +/- 0.04, indicating that the anisotropic (cubic) critical behavior predicted by the advanced higher-order renormalization-group analysis should be, in principle, visible in physical and computer experiments.
