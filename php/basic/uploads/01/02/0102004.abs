Title: Bianchi VIII Empty Futures
Authors: John D. Barrow and Yves Gaspar
Abstract: Using a qualitative analysis based on the Hamiltonian formalism and the orthonormal frame representation we investigate whether the chaotic behaviour which occurs close to the initial singularity is still present in the far future of Bianchi VIII models. We describe some features of the vacuum Bianchi VIII models at late times which might be relevant for studying the nature of the future asymptote of the general vacuum inhomogeneous solution to the Einstein field equations.
