Title: Deformed QED via Seiberg-Witten Map
Authors: A. A. Bichl and J. M. Grimstrup and L. Popp and M. Schweda and R. Wulkenhaar
Abstract: With the help of the Seiberg-Witten map for photons and fermions we define a theta-deformed QED at the classical level. Two possibilities of gauge-fixing are discussed. A possible non-Abelian extension for a pure theta-deformed Yang-Mills theory is also presented.
