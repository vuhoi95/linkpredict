Title: On the topology and area of higher dimensional black holes
Authors: Mingliang Cai and Gregory J. Galloway
Abstract: Over the past decade there has been an increasing interest in the study of black holes, and related objects, in higher (and lower) dimensions, motivated to a large extent by developments in string theory. The aim of the present paper is to obtain higher dimensional analogues of some well known results for black holes in 3+1 dimensions. More precisely, we obtain extensions to higher dimensions of Hawking's black hole topology theorem for asymptotically flat ($\Lambda=0$) black hole spacetimes, and Gibbons' and Woolgar's genus dependent, lower entropy bound for topological black holes in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter ($\Lambda<0$) spacetimes. In higher dimensions the genus is replaced by the so-called $\sigma$-constant, or Yamabe invariant, which is a fundamental topological invariant of smooth compact manifolds.
