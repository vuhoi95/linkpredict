Title: Supersymmetric new brane-world
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The quantum-induced dilatonic brane world (New Brane World) is created by brane CFT quantum effects (giving effective brane tension) in accordance with AdS/CFT set-up which also defines surface term. Considering the bosonic sector of 5d gauged supergravity with single scalar and taking the boundary action as predicted by supersymmetry, the possibility to supersymmetrize dilatonic New Brane World is discussed. It is demonstrated that for a number of superpotentials the flat SUSY dilatonic brane-world (with dynamically induced brane dilaton) or quantum-induced de Sitter dilatonic brane-world (not Anti-de Sitter one) where SUSY is broken by the quantum effects occurs. The analysis of graviton perturbations indicates that gravity is localized on such branes.
