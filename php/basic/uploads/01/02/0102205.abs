Title: A condition on the chiral symmetry breaking solution of the  Dyson-Schwinger equation in three-dimensional QED
Authors: Guo-Zhu Liu and G. Cheng
Abstract: In three-dimensional QED, which is analyzed in the 1/$N$ expansion, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for a nontrivial solution of the Dyson-Schwinger equation to be chiral symmetry breaking solution. In the derivation, a normalization condition of the Goldstone bound state is used. It is showed that the existent analytical solutions satisfy this condition.
