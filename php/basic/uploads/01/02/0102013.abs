Title: Topologically Massive Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: Constraints and  Deformations
Authors: E. Harikumar and Amitabha Lahiri and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: We study the relationship between three non-Abelian topologically massive gauge theories, viz. the naive non-Abelian generalization of the Abelian model, Freedman-Townsend model and the dynamical 2-form theory, in the canonical framework. Hamiltonian formulation of the naive non-Abelian theory is presented first. The other two non-Abelian models are obtained by deforming the constraints of this model. We study the role of the auxiliary vector field in the dynamical 2-form theory in the canonical framework and show that the dynamical 2-form theory cannot be considered as the embedded version of naive non-Abelian model. The reducibility aspect and gauge algebra of the latter models are also discussed.
