Title: Solitons in 2+1 Dimensional Non-Commutative Maxwell Chern-Simons Higgs  Theories
Authors: Avinash Khare and M. B. Paranjape
Abstract: We find soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional non-commutative Maxwell Chern-Simons Higgs theories. In the limit of the Chern-Simons coefficient going to zero, these solutions go over to the previously found solutions in the non-commutative Maxwell Higgs theories. The new solutions may have relevance in the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect and possibly in string vacua corresponding to open strings terminating on D2 branes in the presence of D0 branes.
