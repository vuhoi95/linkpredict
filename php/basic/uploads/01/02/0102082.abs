Title: Quantum stabilization of thermal brane-worlds in M-theory
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Sachiko Ogushi
Abstract: Low-energy effective M-theory (11d supergravity or 11d SUSY theory) is considered in 11d flat or AdS background. After orbifold compactification of eleventh dimension one gets flat 10d brane at non-zero temperature. Quantum effective potential (free energy at low-temperature approximation) is calculated on such brane with account of only lowest mass from Kaluza-Klein modes. Such effective potential may stabilize the radius of 11th dimension (radion stabilization) as it is demonstrated explicitly.
