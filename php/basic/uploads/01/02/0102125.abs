Title: Brane-Bulk Duality and Non-conformal Gauge Theories
Authors: Zurab Kakushadze and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We discuss non-conformal gauge theories from type IIB D3-branes embedded in orbifolded space-times. Such theories can be obtained by allowing some non-vanishing logarithmic twisted tadpoles. In certain cases with N=0,1 supersymmetry correlation functions in the planar limit are the same as in the parent N=2 supersymmetric theories. In particular, the effective action in such theories perturbatively is not renormalized beyond one loop in the planar limit. In the N=2 as well as such N=0,1 theories quantum corrections in the D3-brane gauge theories are encoded in the corresponding classical higher dimensional field theories whose actions contain the twisted fields with non-vanishing tadpoles. We argue that this duality can be extended to the non-perturbative level in the N=2 theories. We give some evidence that this might also be the case for N=0,1 theories as well.
