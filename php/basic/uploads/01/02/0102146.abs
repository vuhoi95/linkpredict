Title: Supersymmetry and the Anomalous Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Muon
Authors: Jonathan L. Feng and Konstantin T. Matchev
Abstract: The recently reported measurement of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment differs from the standard model prediction by 2.6 standard deviations. We examine the implications of this discrepancy for supersymmetry. Deviations of the reported magnitude are generic in supersymmetric theories. Based on the new result, we derive model-independent upper bounds on the masses of observable supersymmetric particles. We also examine several model frameworks. The sign of the reported deviation is as predicted in many simple models, but disfavors anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking.
