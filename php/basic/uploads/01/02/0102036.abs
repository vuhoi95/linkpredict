Title: The Dn Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
Authors: Kai Chen and Bo-yu Hou
Abstract: The Lax pair of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with interaction potential of trigonometric type based on Dn Lie algebra is presented. We give a general form for the Lax pair and prove partial results for small n. Liouville integrability of the corresponding system follows a series of involutive Hamiltonians generated by the characteristic polynomial of the Lax matrix. The rational case appears as a natural degeneration and the nonrelativistic limit exactly leads to the well-known Calogero-Moser system associated with Dn Lie algebra.
