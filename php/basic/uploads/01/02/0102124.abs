Title: Supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the variational method and a new shape  invariant potential
Authors: Elso Drigo filho and Regina Maria Ricotta
Abstract: The association of the variational method with supersymmetric quantum mechanics through an ansatz for the superpotential is reviewed and the approximate energy spectra of non-exactly solvable potentials, such like the Hulthen, the Morse and the screened Coulomb potentials, in 3 dimensions, are presented. A sketch of a new exactly shape invariant potential is also presented.
