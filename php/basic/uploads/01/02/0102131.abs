Title: Interacting fermions and domain wall defects in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: L. Da Rold and C. D. Fosco and A. Lopez
Abstract: We consider a Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions with a domain wall like defect in its mass, minimally coupled to a dynamical Abelian vector field. The mass of the fermionic field is assumed to have just one linear domain wall, which is externally fixed and unaffected by the dynamics. We show that, under some general conditions on the parameters, the localized zero modes predicted by the Callan and Harvey mechanism are stable under the electromagnetic interaction of the fermions.
