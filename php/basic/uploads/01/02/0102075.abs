Title: Supersymmetry with a Ghost Time
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Marc Bellon
Abstract: The progress brought to the study of chiral fermions and gauge theories by quantization methods with a bulk time suggests their usefulness in supersymmetric theories. Using superspace methods, we show how an explicitly supersymmetric version of such quantization methods may be given.
