Title: Nonlocal Regularization and Spontaneously Broken Abelian Gauge Theories  for an Arbitrary Gauge Parameter
Authors: A. Basu and S. D. Joglekar
Abstract: We study the non-local regularization for the case of a spontaneously broken abelian gauge theory in the R_xi gauge with an arbitrary gauge parameter xi. We consider a simple abelian-Higgs model with chiral couplings as an example. We show that if we apply the nonlocal regularization procedure [to construct a nonlocal theory with finite mass parameter ] to the spontaneously broken R_xi gauge Lagrangian, using the quadratic forms as appearing in this Lagrangian, we find that a physical observable in this model, an analogue of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, evaluated to order O[g^{2}] does indeed show xi-dependence.We then apply the modified form of nonlocal regularization that was recently advanced and studied for the unbroken non-abelian gauge theories and discuss the resulting WT identities and xi-independence of the S-matrix elements.
