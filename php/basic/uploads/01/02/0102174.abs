Title: A dynamical stabilization of the radion potential
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: Large extra dimensional theories attempt to solve the hierarchy problem by assuming that the fundamental scale of the theory is at the electroweak scale. This requires the size of the extra dimensions to be stabilized at a scale which is determined by the effective four dimensional Planck mass and the number of extra dimensions. In this paper we concentrate upon the dynamical reasons to stabilize them by providing a running mass to the radion field. We show that it is possible to maintain the size of the extra dimensions once it is stabilized throughout the dynamics of inflation.
