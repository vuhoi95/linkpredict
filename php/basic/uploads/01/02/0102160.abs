Title: Noncommutative Q-balls
Authors: Youngjai Kiem and Chanju Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We obtain Q-ball solutions in noncommutative scalar field theory with a global U(1) invariance. The Q-ball solutions are shown to be classically and quantum mechanically stable. We also find that "excited Q-ball" states exist for some class of scalar potentials, which are classically stable in the large noncommutativity limit.
