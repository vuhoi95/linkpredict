Title: Condition on the symmetry-breaking solution of the Schwinger-Dyson  equation
Authors: G. Cheng and T. K. Kuo
Abstract: We derive a condition for a nontrivial solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation to be accompanied by a Goldstone bound state. It implies that, for quenched planar QED, although chiral symmetry breaking occurs when there is a cutoff, the continuum limit fails to exist.
