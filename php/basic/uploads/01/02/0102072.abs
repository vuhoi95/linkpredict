Title: The Effective Potential for Composite Operator in the Scalar Model at  Finite Temperature
Authors: G. N. J. Ananos and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: We discuss the $\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ theory defined in a flat $D$-dimensional space-time. We assume that the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature $\beta^{-1}$. To obtain non-perturbative result, the $ 1/N $ expansion is used. The method of the composite operator (CJT) for summing a large set of Feynman graphs, is developed for the finite temperature system. The ressumed effective potential and the analysis of the D=3 and D=4 cases are given.
