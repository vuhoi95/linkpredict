Title: Composite fields, generalized hypergeometric functions and the $U(1)_Y$  symmetry in the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: L. Hoffmann and T. Leonhardt and L. Mesref and W. Ruhl
Abstract: We discuss the concept of composite fields in flat CFT as well as in the context of AdS/CFT. Furthermore we show how to represent Green functions using generalized hypergeometric functions and apply these techniques to four-point functions. Finally we prove an identity of $U(1)_Y$ symmetry for four-point functions.
