Title: Gravitational Collapse of a Radiating Shell
Authors: G. L. Alberghi and R. Casadio and G. P. Vacca and G. Venturi
Abstract: We study the collapse of a self-gravitating and radiating shell. Matter constituting the shell is quantized and the construction is viewed as a semiclassical model of possible black hole formation. It is shown that the shell internal degrees of freedom are excited by the quantum non-adiabaticity of the collapse and, consequently, on coupling them to a massless scalar field, the collapsing matter emits a burst of coherent (thermal) radiation.
