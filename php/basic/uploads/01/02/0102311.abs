Title: Observational constraints on inflation models with nonminimal scalar  field
Authors: H. Noh and J. Hwang
Abstract: We present the power spectra of the scalar- and tensor-type structures generated in an inflation model based on the nonminimally coupled scalar field with a self coupling. By comparing the contributions of these structures to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the four year COBE DMR data we derive strong constraints on model parameters and the inflation model.
