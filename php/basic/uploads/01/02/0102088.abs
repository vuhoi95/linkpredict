Title: Generalized parity transformations in the regularized Chern-Simons  theory
Authors: C. D. Fosco and A. Lopez
Abstract: We study renormalization effects in the Abelian Chern-Simons (CS) action. These effects can be non-trivial when the gauge field is coupled to dynamical matter, since the regularization of the UV divergences in the model forces the introduction of a parity even piece in the gauge field action. This changes the classical (odd) transformation properties of the pure CS action. This effect, already discussed for the case of a lattice regularization by F. Berruto, M.C. Diamantini and P. Sodano in hep-th/0004203, is also present when the theory is defined in the continuum and, indeed, it is a manifestation of a more general `anomalous' effect, since it happens for every regularization scheme. We explore the physical consequences of this anomaly. We also show that generalized, nonlocal parity transformations can be defined in such a way that the regularized theory is odd, and that those transformations tend to the usual ones when the cutoff is removed. These generalized transformations play a role that is tantamount to the deformed symmetry corresponding to Ginsparg-Wilson fermions [2] (in an even number of spacetime dimensions).
