Title: Anti-de Sitter no-hair, AdS/CFT and the brane-world
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Daisuke Ida
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the bulk spacetimes with the negative cosmological constant in the context of the brane-world scenario. We show that, in Euclidean bulk, or in Lorentzian static bulk, some sequences of hypersurfaces with the positive Ricci scalar evolve to the warped geometries like the anti-de Sitter spacetime. Based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we discuss that the positivity of the Ricci scalar is related to the stability of CFT on the brane. In addition, the brane-world is described from the holographic point of view. The asymptotic local structure of the conformal infinity is also investigated.
