Title: On Level Quantization for the Noncommutative Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: V. P. Nair and A. P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We show that the coefficient of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons action on the noncommutative plane must be quantized. Similar considerations apply in other dimensions as well.
