Title: Upper Limits on Sparticle Masses from g-2 and the Possibility for  Discovery of Supersymmetry at Colliders and in Dark Matter Searches
Authors: Utpal Chattopadhyay and Pran Nath
Abstract: We analyze the implications of the new physics effect seen in the $g-2$ Brookhaven measurement and show that if the effect arises from supersymmetry, then the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$ is determined to be positive in the standard sign convention. Further, analyses within the minimal supergravity model show that the Brookhaven result leads to upper limits on the universal gaugino and scalar masses of $m_{1/2}\leq 800$ GeV and $m_0\leq 1.5$ TeV for $\tan\beta\leq 55$. Our analysis strongly suggests that supersymmetry via production of sparticles must be found at the Large Hadron Collider. Further, sign($\mu$) positive is favorable for the discovery of supersymmetric cold dark matter.
