Title: Form factors of soliton-creating operators in the sine-Gordon model
Authors: S. Lukyanov and A. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We propose explicit expressions for the form factors, including their normalization constants, of topologically charged (or soliton-creating) operators in the sine-Gordon model. The normalization constants, which constitute the main content of our proposal, allow one to find exact relations between the short- and long-distance asymptotics of the correlation functions. We make predictions concerning asymptotics of fermion correlation functions in the massive Thirring model, SU(2)-Thirring model with anisotropy, and in the half-filled Hubbard chain.
