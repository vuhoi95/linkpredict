Title: Quantum mechanics on Riemannian Manifold in Schwinger's Quantization  Approach I
Authors: N. Chepilko and A. Romanenko
Abstract: Schwinger's quantization scheme is extended in order to solve the problem of the formulation of quantum mechanics on a space with a group structure. The importance of Killing vectors in a quantization scheme is showed. Usage of these vectors provides algebraic properties of operators to be consistent with the geometrical structure of a manifold. The procedure of the definition of the quantum Lagrangian of a free particle and the norm of velocity (momentum) operators is given. These constructions are invariant under a general coordinate transformation. The unified procedure for constructing the quantum theory on a space with a group structure is developed. Using it quantum mechanics on a Riemannian manifold with a simply transitive group acting on it is investigated.
