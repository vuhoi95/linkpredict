Title: Hamiltonian BRST interactions in Abelian theories
Authors: C. Bizdadea and M. T. Miauta and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: Consistent couplings between an Abelian gauge field and three types of matter fields are investigated by means of the Hamiltonian BRST deformation theory based on cohomological techniques. In this manner, scalar electrodynamics, the Stuckelberg theory for Abelian zero- and one-forms, respectively, spinor electrodynamics, are inferred.
