Title: Massive Type IIA Theory on K3
Authors: Michael Haack and Jan Louis and Harvendra Singh
Abstract: In this paper we study K3 compactification of ten-dimensional massive type IIA theory with all possible Ramond-Ramond background fluxes turned on. The resulting six-dimensional theory is a new massive (gauged) supergravity with an action that is manifestly invariant under an O(4,20) / (O(4) times O(20)) duality symmetry. We discover that this six-dimensional theory interpolates between vacua of ten-dimensional massive IIA supergravity and vacua of massless IIA supergravity with appropriate background fluxes turned on. This in turn suggests a new 11-dimensional interpretation for the massive type IIA theory.
