Title: Exact Results for the BTZ Black Hole
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Ivo Sachs and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: In this review, we summarize exact results for the three-dimensional BTZ black hole. We use rigorous mathematical results to clarify the general structure and properties of this black hole spacetime and its microscopic description. In particular, we study the formation of the black hole by point particle collisions, leading to an exact analytic determination of the Choptuik scaling parameter. We also show that a `No Hair Theorem' follows immediately from a mathematical theorem of hyperbolic geometry, due to Sullivan. A microscopic understanding of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and decay rate for massless scalars, is shown to follow from standard results of conformal field theory.
