Title: Strings on Orbifold Lines
Authors: Oren Bergman and Eric Gimon and Barak Kol
Abstract: The orbifold lines IIA/I_8 and IIB/$I_8 (-1)^{F_L} possess BPS discrete torsion variants which carry fundamental string (NSNS) charge. We show that these variants are actually classified by an integral electric field F from the twisted RR sector, and compute their tension and NSNS charge as a function of F. The analysis employs equivariant K-theory and the string creation phenomenon. The K-theory results demonstrate the corrections to cohomology in the case of torsion; it is found that 8 units of F are invisible at transverse infinity for IIA, and correspondingly 16 units for IIB.
