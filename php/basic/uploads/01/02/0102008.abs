Title: Linear equations of motion for massless particles of any spin in any  even dimensional spaces
Authors: Bojan Gornik and N. Mankoc Borstnik
Abstract: It is proven that the Poincare symmetry determines equations of motion, which are for massless particles of any spin in d-dimensional spaces linear in the momentum. The proof is made only for even d and for fields with no gauge symmetry. We comment on a few examples. We pay attention only to spin degrees of freedom.
