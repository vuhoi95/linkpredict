Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in the Space-time of an Arbitrary  Dimension
Authors: Je-An Gu and W-Y. P. Hwang
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to implement spontaneous symmetry breaking in the space-time of an arbitrary dimension (D>2) by introducing the non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and the gravity. In this scenario, the usage of the familiar lambda Phi ^4 term, which is non-renormalizable for D >= 5, can be avoided altogether.
