Title: On the Embedding of Space-Time Symmetries into Simple Superalgebras
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: We explore the embedding of Spin groups of arbitrary dimension and signature into simple superalgebras in the case of extended supersymmetry. The R-symmetry, which generically is not compact, can be chosen compact for all the cases that are congruent mod 8 to the physical conformal algebra so($D-2$,2), $D\geq 3$. An $\rm{so}(1,1)$ grading of the superalgebra is found in all cases. Central extensions of super translation algebras are studied in this framework.
