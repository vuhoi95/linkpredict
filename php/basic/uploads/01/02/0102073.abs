Title: BF gravity and the Immirzi parameter
Authors: R. Capovilla and M. Montesinos and V. A. Prieto and E. Rojas
Abstract: We propose a novel BF-type formulation of real four-dimensional gravity, which generalizes previous models. In particular, it allows for an arbitrary Immirzi parameter. We also construct the analogue of the Urbantke metric for this model.
