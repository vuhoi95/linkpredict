Title: Algebraic description of spacetime foam
Authors: Ioannis Raptis and Roman R. Zapatrin
Abstract: A mathematical formalism for treating spacetime topology as a quantum observable is provided. We describe spacetime foam entirely in algebraic terms. To implement the correspondence principle we express the classical spacetime manifold of general relativity and the commutative coordinates of its events by means of appropriate limit constructions.
