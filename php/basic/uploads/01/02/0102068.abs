Title: Stability of bound states in the light-front Yukawa model
Authors: M. Mangin-Brinet and J. Carbonell and V. A. Karmanov
Abstract: We show that in the system of two fermions interacting by scalar exchange, the solutions for J$^{\pi}$=$0^+$ bound states are stable without any cutoff regularization for coupling constant below some critical value.
