Title: Supermatrix Models
Authors: Takehiro Azuma and Satoshi Iso and Hikaru Kawai and Yuhi Ohwashi
Abstract: We investigate several matrix models based on super Lie algebras, osp(1|32,R), u(1|16,16) and gl(1|32,R). They are natural generalizations of IIB matrix model and were first proposed by Smolin. In particular, we study the supersymmetry structures of these models and discuss possible reductions to IIB matrix model. We also point out that diffeomorphism invariance is hidden in gauge theories on noncommutative space which are derived from matrix models. This symmetry is independent of the global SO(9,1) invariance in IIB matrix model and we report our trial to extend the global Lorentz invariance to local symmetry by introducing u(1|16,16) or gl(1|32,R) super Lie algebras.
