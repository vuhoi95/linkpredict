Title: CFT and Entropy on the Brane
Authors: Ivo Savonije and Erik Verlinde
Abstract: We consider a brane-universe in the background of an Anti-de Sitter/ Schwarschild geometry. We show that the induced geometry of the brane is exactly given by that of a standard radiation dominated FRW-universe. The radiation is represented by a strongly coupled CFT with an AdS-dual description. We show that when the brane crosses the horizon of the AdS-black hole the entropy and temperature are simply expressed in the Hubble constant and its time derivative. We present formulas for the entropy of the CFT which are generally valid, and which at the horizon coincide with the FRW equations. These results shed new light on recently proposed entropy bounds in the context of cosmology.
