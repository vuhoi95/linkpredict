Title: Deformations of Closed Strings and Topological Open Membranes
Authors: C. M. Hofman and W. K. Ma
Abstract: We study deformations of topological closed strings. A well-known example is the perturbation of a topological closed string by itself, where the associative OPE product is deformed, and which is governed by the WDVV equations. Our main interest will be closed strings that arise as the boundary theory for topological open membranes, where the boundary string is deformed by the bulk membrane operators. The main example is the topological open membrane theory with a nonzero 3-form field in the bulk. In this case the Lie bracket of the current algebra is deformed, leading in general to a correction of the Jacobi identity. We identify these deformations in terms of deformation theory. To this end we describe the deformation of the algebraic structure of the closed string, given by the BRST operator, the associative product and the Lie bracket. Quite remarkably, we find that there are three classes of deformations for the closed string, two of which are exemplified by the WDVV theory and the topological open membrane. The third class remains largely mysterious, as we have no explicit example.
