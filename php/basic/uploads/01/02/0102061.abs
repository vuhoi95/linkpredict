Title: Quantum Mechanics of Charged Black Holes
Authors: Andrei Barvinsky and Saurya Das and Gabor Kunstatter
Abstract: We quantize the spherically symmetric sector of generic charged black holes. Thermal properties are encorporated by imposing periodicity in Euclidean time, with period equal to the inverse Hawking temperature of the black hole. This leads to an exact quantization of the area (A) and charge (Q) operators. For the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, $A=4\pi G \hbar (2n+p+1)$ and $Q=me$, for integers $n,p,m$. Consistency requires the fine structure constant to be quantized: $e^2/\hbar=p/m^2$. Remarkably, vacuum fluctuations exclude extremal black holes from the spectrum, while near extremal black holes are highly quantum objects. We also prove that horizon area is an adiabatic invariant.
