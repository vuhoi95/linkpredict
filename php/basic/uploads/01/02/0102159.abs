Title: de Sitter space from M-theory?
Authors: Andrew Chamblin and Neil D. Lambert
Abstract: In this note we study a massive IIA supergravity theory obtained in hep-th/9707139 by compactification of M-theory. We point out that de Sitter space in arbitrary dimensions arises naturally as the vacuum of this theory. This explicitly shows how de Sitter space can be embedded into eleven-dimensional supergravity. In addition we discuss the novel way in which this theory avoids various `no-go theorems' which assert that de Sitter space is not a consistent vacua of eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. We also point out that the eight-branes of this theory, which couple electrically to the ten-form, can sweep out de Sitter world-volumes.
