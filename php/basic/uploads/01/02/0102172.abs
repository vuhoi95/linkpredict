Title: Restoration of Chiral Symmetry: A Supergravity Perspective

Abstract: The supergravity dual of $N$ regular and $M$ fractional D3-branes on the conifold has a naked singularity in the infrared. Supersymmetric resolution of this singularity requires deforming the conifold: this is the supergravity dual of chiral symmetry breaking. Buchel suggested that at sufficiently high temperature there is no need to deform the conifold: the singularity may be cloaked by a horizon. This would be the supergravity manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration. In previous work [hep-th/0102105] the ansatz and the system of second-order radial differential equations necessary to find such a solution were written down. In this paper we find smooth solutions to this system in a perturbation theory that is valid when the Hawking temperature of the horizon is very high.
