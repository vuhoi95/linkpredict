Title: New Tests of Lorentz Invariance Following from Observations of the  Highest Energy Cosmic Gamma Rays
Authors: F. W. Stecker and Sheldon L. Glashow
Abstract: We use the recent reanalysis of multi-TeV gamma-ray observations of Mrk 501 to constrain the Lorentz invariance breaking parameter involving the maximum electron velocity. Our limit is two orders of magnitude better than that obtained from the maximum observed cosmic-ray electron energy.
