Title: Domain Walls in Supersymmetric QCD
Authors: B. de Carlos and M. B. Hindmarsh and N. McNair and J. M. Moreno
Abstract: In this talk we construct BPS-saturated domain walls in supersymmetric QCD, for any values of the masses of the chiral matter superfields. We compare our results to those already obtained in the literature and we also discuss their range of applicability, as well as future directions that would be desirable to explore in order to achieve a complete understanding of supersymmetric gluodynamics as a step in improving our knowledge of how QCD works.
