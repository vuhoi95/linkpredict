Title: Structure and Representation Theory for Double Group of Four-Dimensional  Cubic Group
Authors: Jian Dai and Xing-Chang Song
Abstract: Hypercubic groups in any dimension are defined and their conjugate classifications and representation theories are derived. Double group and spinor representation are introduced. A detailed calculation is carried out on the structures of four-dimensional cubic group $O_4$ and its double group, as well as all inequivalent single-valued representations and spinor representations of $O_4$. All representations are derived adopting Clifford theory of decomposition of induced representations. Based on these results, single-valued and spinor representations of the orientation-preserved subgroup of $O_4$ are calculated.
