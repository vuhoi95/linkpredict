Title: Tachyon Condensation and the Emergence of Fermionic Strings from the  Bosonic String
Authors: Francois Englert and Laurent Houart and Anne Taormina
Abstract: The results conjectured here are based on tachyon condensation in compactified bosonic strings. They can in fact be proven from compactification alone, but this step was not treated consistently here. The proof is given in a new version of the paper: hep-th/0106235
