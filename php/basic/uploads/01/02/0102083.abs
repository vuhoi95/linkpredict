Title: Dynamical algebra and Dirac quantum modes in Taub-NUT background
Authors: Ion I. CotÄƒescu and Mihai Visinescu
Abstract: The SO(4,1) gauge-invariant theory of the Dirac fermions in the external field of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is investigated. It is shown that the discrete quantum modes are governed by reducible representations of the o(4) dynamical algebra generated by the components of the angular momentum operator and those of the Runge-Lenz operator of the Dirac theory in Taub-NUT background. The consequence is that there exist central and axial discrete modes whose spinors have no separated variables.
