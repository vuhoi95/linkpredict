Title: Quantum mechanics on non-commutative plane
Authors: Michal Demetrian and Denis Kochan
Abstract: One of the simplest example of non-commutative (NC) spaces is the NC plane. In this article we investigate the consequences of the non-commutativity to the quantum mechanics on a plane. We derive corrections to the standard (commutative) Hamiltonian spectrum for hydrogen-like atom and isotropic linear harmonic oscillator (LHO) and formulate the problem of the potential scattering on the NC plane. In the case of LHO we consider the noncommutativity of the momentum operators, too.
