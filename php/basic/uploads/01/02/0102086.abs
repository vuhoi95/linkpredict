Title: Scalar-Scalar Bound State in Non-commutative Space
Authors: M. Haghighat and F. Loran
Abstract: Bethe-Salpeter equation in the non-commutative space for a scalar-scalar bound state is considered. It is shown that in the non-relativistic limit, the effect of spatial non-commutativity appears as if there exist a magnetic dipole moment coupled to each particle.
