Title: Magnetic Cosmic Strings of N=1, D=4 Supergravity with Cosmological  Constant
Authors: J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We find a new class of cosmic string solutions with non-vanishing magnetic flux of $\cN=1$, D=4 supergravity with a cosmological constant and coupled to any number of Maxwell and scalar multiplets. We show that these magnetic cosmic string solutions preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. We give an explicit example of such a solution for which the complex scalars are constant and the spacetime is smooth with topology $R^{1,1}\times S^2$. Two more examples are explored for which a complex scalar field takes values in $\bC P^1$ and in $SL(2,\bR)/U(1)$.
