Title: Possible contractions of quantum orthogonal groups
Authors: N. A. Gromov and I. V. Kostyakov and V. V. Kuratov
Abstract: Possible contractions of quantum orthogonal groups which correspond to different choices of primitive elements of Hopf algebra are considered and all allowed contractions in Cayley--Klein scheme are obtained. Quantum deformations of kinematical groups have been investigated and have shown that quantum analog of (complex) Galilei group G(1,3) do not exist in our scheme.
