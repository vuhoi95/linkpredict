Title: Gravitational fields with a non Abelian bidimensional Lie algebra of  symmetries
Authors: G. Sparano and G. Vilasi and A. M. Vinogradov
Abstract: Vacuum gravitational fields invariant for a bidimensional non Abelian Lie algebra of Killing fields, are explicitly described. They are parameterized either by solutions of a transcendental equation (the tortoise equation) or by solutions of a linear second order differential equation on the plane. Gravitational fields determined via the tortoise equation, are invariant for a 3-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing fields with bidimensional leaves. Global gravitational fields out of local ones are also constructed.
