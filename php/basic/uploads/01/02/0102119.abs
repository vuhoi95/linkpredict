Title: On the Breit Equation
Authors: Hikoya Kasari and Yoshio Yamaguchi
Abstract: Contrary to the conventional belief, it was shown that the Breit equation has the eigenvalues for bound states of two oppositely charged Dirac particles interacting through the (static) Coulomb potential. All eigenvalues reduced to those of the Sch\"odinger case in the non-relativistic limit.
