Title: Continuous Time-Dependent Measurements: Quantum Anti-Zeno Paradox with  Applications
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and S. M. Roy
Abstract: We derive differential equations for the modified Feynman propagator and for the density operator describing time-dependent measurements or histories continuous in time. We obtain an exact series solution and discuss its applications. Suppose the system is initially in a state with density operator $\rho(0)$ and the projection operator $E(t) = U(t) E U^\dagger(t)$ is measured continuously from $t = 0$ to $T$, where $E$ is a projector obeying $E\rho(0) E = \rho(0)$ and $U(t)$ a unitary operator obeying $U(0) = 1$ and some smoothness conditions in $t$. Then the probability of always finding $E(t) = 1$ from $t = 0$ to $T$ is unity. Generically $E(T) \neq E$ and the watched system is sure to change its state, which is the anti-Zeno paradox noted by us recently. Our results valid for projectors of arbitrary rank generalize those obtained by Anandan and Aharonov for projectors of unit rank.
