Title: Closed-Time Path Integral Formalism and Medium Effects of  Non-Equilibrium QCD Matter
Authors: Chung-Wen Kao and Gouranga C. Nayak and Walter Greiner
Abstract: We apply the closed-time path integral formalism to study the medium effects of non-equilibrium gluon matter. We derive the medium modified resummed gluon propagator to the one loop level in non-equilibrium in the covariant gauge. The gluon propagator we derive can be used to remove the infrared divergences in the secondary parton collisions to study thermalization of minijet parton plasma at RHIC and LHC.
