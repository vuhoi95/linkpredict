Title: Holography and Stiff-matter on the Brane
Authors: Anindya K. Biswas and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: Recently, Verlinde noted a surprising similarity between Friedmann equation governing radiation dominated universe and Cardy's entropy formula in conformal field theory. In this note, we study a brane-universe filled with radiation and stiff-matter. We analyze Friedmann equation in this context and compare our results with Cardy's entropy formula.
