Title: The Form Factors and Quantum Equation of Motion in the sine-Gordon Model
Authors: H. Babujian and M. Karowski
Abstract: Using the methods of the 'form factor program' exact expressions of all matrix elements are obtained for several operators of the quantum sine-Gordon model alias the massive Thirring model. A general formula is presented which provides form factors in terms of an integral representation. In particular charge-less operators as for example the current of the topological charge, the energy momentum tensor and all higher currents are considered. In the breather sector it is found the quantum sine-Gordon field equation holds with an exact relation between the 'bare' mass and the normalized mass. Also a relation for the trace of the energy momentum is obtained. All results are compared with Feynman graph expansion and full agreement is found.
