Title: Massless particles of any spin obey linear equations of motion
Authors: Bojan Gornik and Norma Mankoc Borstnik
Abstract: The proof is presented that the Poincare symmetry determines the equations of motion for massless particles of any spin in 2n-dimensional spaces, which are linear in the momentum.
