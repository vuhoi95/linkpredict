Title: The Power of Brane-Induced Gravity
Authors: Gia Dvali and Gregory Gabadadze and Marko Kolanovic and Francesco Nitti
Abstract: We study the role of the brane-induced graviton kinetic term in theories with large extra dimensions. In five dimensions we construct a model with a TeV-scale fundamental Planck mass and a {\it flat} extra dimension the size of which can be astronomically large. 4D gravity on the brane is mediated by a massless zero-mode, whereas the couplings of the heavy Kaluza-Klein modes to ordinary matter are suppressed. The model can manifest itself through the predicted deviations from Einstein theory in long distance precision measurements of the planetary orbits. The bulk states can be a rather exotic form of dark matter, which at sub-solar distances interact via strong 5D gravitational force. We show that the induced term changes dramatically the phenomenology of sub-millimeter extra dimensions. For instance, high-energy constraints from star cooling or cosmology can be substantially relaxed.
