Title: Nonthermal production of gravitinos and inflatinos
Authors: H. P. Nilles and M. Peloso and L. Sorbo
Abstract: We explicitly calculate nonthermal gravitino production during the preheating period in the inflationary Universe. Contrary to earlier investigations, we consider a two--field model to separate the mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking and inflation. We show that the superpartner of the inflaton is significantly generated, while the gravitino production is considerably smaller. Nonthermal production of gravitinos seems thus less worrisome than recently claimed.
