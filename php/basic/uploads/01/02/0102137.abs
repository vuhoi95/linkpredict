Title: Noncommutative Chern-Simons Solitons
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Sung Ku Kim and Kwang-Sup Soh and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: The Chern-Simons theories on a noncommutative plane, which is shown to be describing the quantum Hall liquid, is considered. We introduce matter fields fundamentally coupled to the noncommutative Chern-Simons field. Exploiting BPS equations for the nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory, we find the exact solutions of multi vortices that are closely packed and exponentially localized. We determine the position, the size and the angular momentum explicitly. We then construct the solutions of two spatially separated vortices and determine the moduli dependence of the size and the angular momentum. We also consider the relativistic Chern-Simons theory and find nontopological solutions whose properties are similar to the nonrelativistic counterpart. However, unlike the nonrelativistic case, there are two branches of solutions for a given magnetic field and they cease to exist below certain noncommutativity scale.
