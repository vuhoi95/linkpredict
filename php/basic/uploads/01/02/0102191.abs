Title: Wigner's little group, gauge transformations and dimensional descent
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Biswajit Chakraborty
Abstract: We propose a technique called dimensional descent to show that Wigner's little group for massless particles, which acts as a generator of gauge transformation for usual Maxwell theory, has an identical role even for topologically massive gauge theories. The examples of $B\wedge F$ theory and Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory are analyzed in details.
