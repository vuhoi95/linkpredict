Title: Irreducible Hamiltonian BRST-anti-BRST symmetry for reducible systems
Authors: C. Bizdadea and E. M. Cioroianu and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: An irreducible Hamiltonian BRST-anti-BRST treatment of reducible first-class systems based on homological arguments is proposed. The general formalism is exemplified on the Freedman-Townsend model.
