Abstract: A new family of A_N-type Dunkl operators preserving a polynomial subspace of finite dimension is constructed. Using a general quadratic combination of these operators and the usual Dunkl operators, several new families of exactly and quasi-exactly solvable quantum spin Calogero-Sutherland models are obtained. These include, in particular, three families of quasi-exactly solvable elliptic spin Hamiltonians.
