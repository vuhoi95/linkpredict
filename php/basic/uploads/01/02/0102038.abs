Title: Coherent States for Canonical Quantum General Relativity and the  Infinite Tensor Product Extension
Authors: H. Sahlmann and T. Thiemann and O. Winkler
Abstract: We summarize a recently proposed concrete programme for investigating the (semi)classical limit of canonical, Lorentzian, continuum quantum general relativity in four spacetime dimensions. The analysis is based on a novel set of coherent states labelled by graphs. These fit neatly together with an Infinite Tensor Product (ITP) extension of the currently used Hilbert space. The ITP construction enables us to give rigorous meaning to the infinite volume (thermodynamic) limit of the theory which has been out of reach so far.
