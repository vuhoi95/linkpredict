Title: Replica Treatment of the Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: Dimitry M. Gangardt and Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Employing Forrester-Ha method of Jack polynomials, we derive an integral identity connecting certain N-fold coordinate average of the Calogero-Sutherland model with the n-fold replica integral. Subsequent analytical continuation to non-integer n leads to asymptotic expressions for the (static and dynamic) density-density correlation function of the model as well as the Green's function for an arbitrary coupling constant $\lambda$.
