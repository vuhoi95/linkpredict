Title: Boundary K-matrices for the XYZ, XXZ AND XXX spin chains
Authors: H. J. de Vega and A. Gonz√°lez--Ruiz
Abstract: The general solutions for the factorization equations of the reflection matrices $K^{\pm}(\theta)$ for the eight vertex and six vertex models (XYZ, XXZ and XXX chains) are found. The associated integrable magnetic Hamiltonians are explicitly derived, finding families dependig on several continuous as well as discrete parameters.
