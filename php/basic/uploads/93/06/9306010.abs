Title: Heisenberg realization for U_q(sln) on the flag manifold
Authors: H. Awata and M. Noumi and S. Odake
Abstract: We give the Heisenberg realization for the quantum algebra $U_q(sl_n)$, which is written by the $q$-difference operator on the flag manifold. We construct it from the action of $U_q(sl_n)$ on the $q$-symmetric algebra $A_q(Mat_n)$ by the Borel-Weil like approach. Our realization is applicable to the construction of the free field realization for the $U_q(\widehat{sl_n})$ [AOS].
