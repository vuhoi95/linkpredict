Title: Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials
Authors: Sergey Fomin and Anatol N. Kirillov
Abstract: Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials and corresponding symmetric functions are constructed from an exponential solution of the $B_n$-Yang-Baxter equation that involves the nilCoxeter algebra of the hyperoctahedral group.
