Title: Construction of KP Hierarchies in Terms of Finite Number of Fields and  their Abelianization
Authors: H. Aratyn and E. Nissimov and S. Pacheva
Abstract: The $2M$-boson representations of KP hierarchy are constructed in terms of $M$ mutually independent two-boson KP representations for arbitrary number $M$. Our construction establishes the multi-boson representations of KP hierarchy as consistent Poisson reductions of standard KP hierarchy within the $R$-matrix scheme. As a byproduct we obtain a complete description of any finitely-many-field formulation of KP hierarchy in terms of Darboux coordinates with respect to the first Hamiltonian structure. This results in a series of representations of $\Win1\,$ algebra made out of arbitrary even number of boson fields.
