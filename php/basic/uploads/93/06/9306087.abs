Title: Causality Constraints on Nonlocal Quantum Measurements
Authors: Sandu Popescu and Lev Vaidman
Abstract: Consequences of relativistic causality for measurements of nonlocal characteristics of composite quantum systems are investigated. It is proved that verification measurements of entangled states necessarily erase local information. A complete analysis of measurability of nondegenerate spin operators of a system of two spin-1/2 particles is presented. It is shown that measurability of certain projection operators which play an important role in axiomatic quantum theory contradicts the causality principle.
