Title: Solutions to Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with coefficients in  non-bounded modules
Authors: Kenji Iohara and Feodor Malikov
Abstract: We explicitly write dowm integral formulas for solutions to Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with coefficients in non-bounded -- neither highest nor lowest weight -- $\gtsl_{n+1}$-modules. The formulas are closely related to WZNW model at a rational level.
