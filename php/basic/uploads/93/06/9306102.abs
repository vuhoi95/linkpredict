Title: Construction of the classical $R$-matrices for the Toda and Calogero  models
Authors: J. Avan and O. Babelon and M. Talon
Abstract: We use the definition of the Calogero-Moser models as Hamiltonian reductions of geodesic motions on a group manifold to construct their $R$-matrices. In the Toda case, the analogous construction yields constant $R$-matrices. By contrast, for Calogero-Moser models they are dynamical objects.
