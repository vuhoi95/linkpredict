Title: Regularisation of non-local actions in two-dimensional field theories
Authors: A. Sevrin and R. Siebelink and W. Troost
Abstract: Taking the induced action for gauge fields coupled to affine currents as an example, we show how loop calculations in non-local two-dimensional field theories can be regulated. Our regularisation method for one loop is based on the method of Pauli and Villars. We use it to calculate the renormalisation factors for the corresponding effective actions, clearing up some discrepancies in the literature. In particular, it will be shown explicitly that vector gauge transformation invariance and Haar invariance of functional integral measures impose different requirements, but they are related by a counterterm (which is local in terms of group variables). For higher loops, we use the method of covariant derivatives combined with Pauli-Villars to argue that the one loop result remains unaltered.
