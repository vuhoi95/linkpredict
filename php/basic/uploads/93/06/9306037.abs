Title: Correlators of the Kazakov-Migdal Model
Authors: M. I. Dobroliubov and Yu. Makeenko and G. W. Semenoff
Abstract: We derive loop equations for the one-link correlators of gauge and scalar fields in the Kazakov-Migdal model. These equations determine the solution of the model in the large N limit and are similar to analogous equations for the Hermitean two-matrix model. We give an explicit solution of the equations for the case of a Gaussian, quadratic potential. We also show how similar calculations in a non-Gaussian case reduce to purely algebraic equations.
