Title: Chiral Defect Fermions and the Layered Phase
Authors: C. P. Korthals-Altes and S. Nicolis and J. Prades
Abstract: Chiral defect fermions on the lattice in 4+1 dimensions are analyzed using mean field theory. The fermion propagator has a localized chiral mode in weak coupling but loses it when the coupling in the unphysical fifth direction becomes too large. A layered phase \`a la Fu-Nielsen appears where the theory is vector-like in every layer.
