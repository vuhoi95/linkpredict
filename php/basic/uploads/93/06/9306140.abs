Title: $N=2$ Super-Weyl Symmetry, Super-Liouville Theory and Super-Riemannian  Surfaces
Authors: Sergei V. Ketov and Sven-Olaf Moch
Abstract: The finite form of the $N=2$ super-Weyl transformations in the chiral and twisted-chiral irreducible formulations of the two-dimensional $N=2$ superfield supergravity are found in $N=2$ superspace. The super-Weyl anomaly of the $N=2$ extended fermionic string theory is computed in terms of the $N=2$ superfields, by using a short time expansion of the $N=2$ chiral heat kernel. The super-Weyl invariant $N=2$ superconformal structure is introduced, and a new definition of the $N=2$ super-Riemannian surfaces is proposed.
