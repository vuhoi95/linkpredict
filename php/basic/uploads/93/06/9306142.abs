Title: The Canonical Symmetry and Hamiltonian Formalism. II. Hamiltonian  Operators
Authors: A. N. Leznov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: It is shown how the canonical symmetry is used to look for the hierarchy of the Hamiltonian operators relevant to the system under consideration. It appears that only the invariance condition can be used to solve the problem.
