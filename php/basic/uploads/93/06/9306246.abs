Title: Vector Particle Interactions In the Quasipotential Approach
Authors: Valeri V. Dvoeglazov and Sergei V. Khudyakov
Abstract: The composite system, formed by two $S=1$ particles, is considered. The field operators of constituents are transformed on the $(1,0)\oplus (0,1)$ representation of the Lorentz group. The problem of interaction of $S=1$ particle with the electromagnetic field is also discussed.
