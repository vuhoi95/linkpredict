Title: On time and the quantum-to-classical transition in Jordan-Brans-Dicke  quantum gravity
Authors: Claus Kiefer and Erik A. Martinez
Abstract: Any quantum theory of gravity which treats the gravitational constant as a dynamical variable has to address the issue of superpositions of states corresponding to different eigenvalues. We show how the unobservability of such superpositions can be explained through the interaction with other gravitational degrees of freedom (decoherence). The formal framework is canonically quantized Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We discuss the concepts of intrinsic time and semiclassical time as well as the possibility of tunneling into regions corresponding to a negative gravitational constant. We calculate the reduced density matrix of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke field and show that the off-diagonal elements can be sufficiently suppressed to be consistent with experiments. The possible relevance of this mechanism for structure formation in extended inflation is briefly discussed.
