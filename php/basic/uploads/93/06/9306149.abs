Abstract: Explicit expressions for the generators of the quantum superalgebra $U_q[gl(n/m)]$ acting on a class of irreducible representations are given. The class under consideration consists of all essentially typical representations: for these a Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is known. The verification of the quantum superalgebra relations to be satisfied is shown to reduce to a set of $q$-number identities.
