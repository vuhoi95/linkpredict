Title: Thirring Model with Non-conserved Chiral Charge
Authors: D. C. Cabra and E. F. Moreno and C. M. Na√≥n
Abstract: We study the Abelian Thirring Model when the fermionic fields have non-conserved chiral charge: $\Delta {\cal Q}_5 =N$. One of the main features we find for this model is the dependence of the Virasoro central charge on both the Thirring coupling constant and $N$. We show how to evaluate correlation functions and in particular we compute the conformal dimensions for fermions and fermionic bilinears, which depend on the fermionic chiral charge. Finally we build primary fields with arbitrary conformal weight.
