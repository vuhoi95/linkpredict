Title: Moduli Space of Topological 2-form Gravity
Authors: Mitsuko Abe and A. Nakamichi and T. Ueno
Abstract: We propose a topological version of four-dimensional (Euclidean) Einstein gravity, in which anti-self-dual 2-forms and an SU(2) connection are used as fundamental fields. The theory describes the moduli space of conformally self-dual Einstein manifolds. In the presence of a cosmological constant, we evaluate the index of the elliptic complex associated with the moduli space.
