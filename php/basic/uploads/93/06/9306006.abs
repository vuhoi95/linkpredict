Title: Non-abelian vortices and non-abelian statistics
Authors: Hoi-Kwong Lo and John Preskill
Abstract: We study the interactions of non-abelian vortices in two spatial dimensions. These interactions have novel features, because the Aharonov-Bohm effect enables a pair of vortices to exchange quantum numbers. The cross section for vortex-vortex scattering is typically a multi-valued function of the scattering angle. There can be an exchange contribution to the vortex-vortex scattering amplitude that adds coherently with the direct amplitude, even if the two vortices have distinct quantum numbers. Thus two vortices can be ``indistinguishable'' even though they are not the same.
