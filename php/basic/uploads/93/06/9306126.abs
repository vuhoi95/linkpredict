Title: $SL(n,R)$ KDV Hierarchy and its Nonpolynomial Realization Through  Kac-Moody Currents
Authors: Sasanka Ghosh and Samir K. Paul
Abstract: It is shown that $SL(n,R)$ KdV hierarchy can be expressed as definite nonpolynomials in Kac Moody currents and their derivatives by the action of Borel subgroup of $SL(n,R)$ on the phase space of centrally extended $sl(n,R)$ Kac Moody currents. Construction of Lax pair is shown, confirming Drinfeld Sokolov type Hamiltonian reduction. This suggests an example of a moduli space with symplectic structure corresponding to extended conformal symmetries.
