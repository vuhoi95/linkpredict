Abstract: The Mellin-Barnes representation for the free energy of the genus-$g$ string is constructed. It is shown that the interactions of the open bosonic string do not modify the critical (Hagedorn) temperature. However,for the sectors having a spinor structure, the critical temperature exists also for all $g$ and depends on the windings. The appearance of a periodic structure is briefly discussed.
