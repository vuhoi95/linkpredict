Title: Squeezed Thermal Vacuum and the Maximum Scale for Inflation
Authors: M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We consider the stimulated emission of gravitons from an initial state of thermal equilibrium, under the action of the cosmic gravitational background field. We find that the low-energy graviton spectrum is enhanced if compared with spontaneous creation from the vacuum; as a consequence, the scale of inflation must be lowered, in order not to exceed the observed CMB quadrupole anisotropy. This effect is particularly important for models based on a symmetry-breaking transition which require, as initial condition, a state of thermal equilibrium at temperatures of the order of the inflation scale.
