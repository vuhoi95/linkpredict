Title: Surface Magnetization of Aperiodic Ising Quantum Chains
Authors: L. Turban and B. Berche
Abstract: We study the surface magnetization of aperiodic Ising quantum chains. Using fermion techniques, exact results are obtained in the critical region for quasiperiodic sequences generated through an irrational number as well as for the automatic binary Thue-Morse sequence and its generalizations modulo p. The surface magnetization exponent keeps its Ising value, beta_s=1/2, for all the sequences studied. The critical amplitude of the surface magnetization depends on the strength of the modulation and also on the starting point of the chain along the aperiodic sequence.
