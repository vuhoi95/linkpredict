Title: Comment on ``Savvidy Ferromagnetic Vacuum in Three-Dimensional Latice  Gauge Theory''
Authors: P. Cea and L. Cosmai
Abstract: We analyze SU(2) gauge theory in a constant chromomagnetic field in three dimensions. Our analysis instead of supporting the existence of a non-trivial minimum in the effective potential, corroborates the evidence of the unstable modes on the lattice.
