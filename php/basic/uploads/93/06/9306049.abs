Title: The class of universality of integrable and isotropic GL(N) mixed  magnets
Authors: S. R. Aladim and M. J. Martins
Abstract: We discuss a class of transfer matrix built by a particular combination of isomorphic and non-isomorphic GL(N) invariant vertex operators. We construct a conformally invariant magnet co nstituted of an alternating mixture of GL(N) ``spins'' operators at different order of represent ation. The corresponding central charge is calculated by analysing the low temperature beha viour of the associated free energy. We also comment on possible extensions of our results for more general classes of mixed systems.
