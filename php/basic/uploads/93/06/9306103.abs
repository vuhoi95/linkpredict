Title: Mapping between the Sinh-Gordon and Ising Models
Authors: C. Ahn and G. Delfino and G. Mussardo
Abstract: The $S$-matrix of the Ising Model can be obtained as particular limit of the roaming trajectories associated to of the $S$-matrix of the Sinh-Gordon model. Using the form factors of the Sinh-Gordon, we analyse the correspondence between the operators of the two theories.
