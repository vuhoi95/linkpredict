Title: Five-Brane Effective Field Theory on Calabi-Yau Threefolds
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. Villasante
Abstract: We consider the compactification of the dual form of $N=1$ $D=10$ supergravity on a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. An $N=1$ off-shell supergravity effective Lagrangian in four dimensions can be constructed in a dual version of the gravitational sector (new-minimal supergravity form). Superspace duality has a simple interpretation in terms of Poincar\'{e} duality of two-form cohomology. The resulting $4D$ Lagrangian may describe the low-energy point-field limit of a five-brane theory, dual to string theory, provided Calabi-Yau spaces are consistent vacua of such dual theory.
