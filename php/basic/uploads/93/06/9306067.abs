Title: Anomaly through Gauge Invariant Regularization with Infinite Number of  Pauli-Villars Fields
Authors: S. Aoki and Y. Kikukawa
Abstract: Abelian anomaly is examined by means of the recently proposed gauge invariant regularization for SO(10) chiral gauge theory and its generalization for a theory of arbitrary gauge group with anomaly-free chiral fermion contents. For both cases it is shown that the anomaly with correct normalization can be obtained in a gauge invariant form without any counterterms.
