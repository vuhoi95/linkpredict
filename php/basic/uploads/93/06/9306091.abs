Title: The Master Field of QCD$_2$ and the 'T Hooft Equation
Authors: M. Cavicchi and P. Di Vecchia and I. Pesando
Abstract: We rewrite the action for $QCD_2$ in the light cone gauge only in terms of a bilocal mesonic field. In this formalism the $1/N$ expansion can be done in a straightforward way by a saddle point technique that determines the master field to be identified with the vacuum expectation value of the bilocal field. Finally we show that the equation of motion for the fluctuations around the master field is identical with the 't Hooft meson equation.
