Title: Helicity in Classical Electrodynamics and Turbulence
Authors: Aleksej V. Chechkin and Dmitrij P. Sorokin and Vladimir V. Yanovsky
Abstract: For the electromagnetic fields, hydrodynamic media and turbulent flows we consider the relationship between a topological characteristic of vector fields known as helicity and the angular momentum of the medium, and discuss, in this respect, the problem of helicity and angular momentum transfer from the electromagnetic field to a medium.
