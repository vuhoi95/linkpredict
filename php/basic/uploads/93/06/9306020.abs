Title: String Quantum Symmetries From Picard-Fuchs Equations And Their  Monodromy
Authors: R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: Local and global properties of the moduli space of Calabi--Yau type compactifications determine the low energy parameters of the string effective action. We show that the moduli space geometry is entirely encoded in the Picard--Fuchs equations for the periods of the Calabi--Yau $H^{(3)}$--cohomology.
