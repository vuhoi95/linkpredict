Authors: L. Martina and O. K. Pashaev and G. Soliani
Abstract: A Chern-Simons gauged Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation is derived from the continuous Heisenberg model in 2+1 dimensions. The corresponding planar magnets can be analyzed whithin the anyon theory. Thus, we show that static magnetic vortices correspond to the self-dual Chern - Simons solitons and are described by the Liouville equation. The related magnetic topological charge is associated with the electric charge of anyons. Furthermore, vortex - antivortex configurations are described by the sinh-Gordon equation and its conformally invariant extension. Physical consequences of these results are discussed.
