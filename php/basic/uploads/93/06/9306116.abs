Title: Reaction-Diffusion Processes as Physical Realizations of Hecke Algebras
Authors: F. C. Alcaraz and V. Rittenberg
Abstract: We show that the master equation governing the dynamics of simple diffusion and certain chemical reaction processes in one dimension give time evolution operators (Hamiltonians) which are realizations of Hecke algebras. In the case of simple diffusion one obtains, after similarity transformations, reducible hermitian representations while in the other cases they are non-hermitian and correspond to supersymmetric quotients of Hecke algebras.
