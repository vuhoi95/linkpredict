Title: SUSY Soft Breaking Terms from String Scenarios
Authors: B. de Carlos and J. A. Casas and C. Munoz
Abstract: The general SUSY soft breaking terms for a large class of phenomenologically relevant string scenarios (symmetric orbifolds) are given. They show a certain lack of universality, but not dangerous for flavor changing neutral currents. To get more quantitative results a specific SUSY breaking mechanism has to be considered, namely gaugino condensation in the hidden sector. Then, it turns out that squark and slepton masses tend to be much larger than scalar masses ($m_{\phi} > 10 M_a$), which probably is a quite general fact. Experimental bounds and the requirement of a successful electroweak breaking without fine tuning impose further restrictions on the soft breaking terms. As a consequence the gluino and chargino masses should be quite close to their present experimental limits, whereas squark and slepton masses should be much higher (> 1 TeV).
