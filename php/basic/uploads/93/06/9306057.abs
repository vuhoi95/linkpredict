Title: Spacetime Variable Superstring Vacua
Authors: Paul S. Green and Tristan Hubsch
Abstract: In a general superstring vacuum configuration, the `internal' space (sector) varies in spacetime. When this variation is non-trivial only in two space-like dimensions, the vacuum contains static cosmic strings with finite energy per unit length and which is, up to interactions with matter, an easily computed topological invariant. The total spacetime is smooth although the `internal' space is singular at the center of each cosmic string. In a similar analysis of the Wick-rotated Euclidean model, these cosmic strings acquire expected self-interactions. Also, a possibility emerges to define a global time in order to rotate back to the Lorentzian case.
