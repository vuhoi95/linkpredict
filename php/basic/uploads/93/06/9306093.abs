Title: Universal exponential solution of the Yang-Baxter equation
Authors: Sergey Fomin and Anatol N. Kirillov
Abstract: Exponential solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation give rise to generalized Schubert polynomials and corresponding symmetric functions. We provide several descriptions of the local stationary algebra defined by this equation. This allows to construct various exponential solutions of the YBE. The $B_n$ and $G_2$ cases are also treated.
