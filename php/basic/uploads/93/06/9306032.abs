Title: Black Hole with Non-Commutative Hair
Authors: C. Klimcik and P. Kolnik and A. Pompos
Abstract: The specific nonlinear vector $\sigma$-model coupled to Einstein gravity is investigated. The model arises in the studies of the gravitating matter in non-commutative geometry. The static spherically symmetric spacetimes are identified by direct solving of the field equations. The asymptotically flat black hole with the ``non-commutative'' vector hair appears for the special choice of the integration constants, giving thus another counterexample to the famous ``no-hair'' theorem.
