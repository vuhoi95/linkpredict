Title: The Integrable Mapping as the Discrete Group of Inner Symmetry of  Integrable Systems
Authors: D. B. Fairlie and A. N. Leznov
Abstract: It is shown that each integrable mapping is connected with a hierarchical completely integrable sytem of equations of evolution type which are invariant with respect to the transformation described by this mapping.
