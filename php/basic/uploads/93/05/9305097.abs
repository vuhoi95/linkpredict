Title: Two-dimensional Yang-Mills Theories Are String Theories
Authors: S. G. Naculich and H. A. Riggs and H. J. Schnitzer
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional SO(N) and Sp(N) Yang-Mills theories without fermions can be interpreted as closed string theories. The terms in the 1/N expansion of the partition function on an orientable or nonorientable manifold M can be associated with maps from a string worldsheet onto M. These maps are unbranched and branched covers of M with an arbitrary number of infinitesimal worldsheet cross-caps mapped to points in M. These string theories differ from SU(N) Yang-Mills string theory in that they involve odd powers of 1/N and require both orientable and nonorientable worldsheets.
