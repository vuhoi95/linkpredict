Title: The Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism on Fermionic Kaehler Manifolds
Authors: S. Aoyama and S. Vandoren
Abstract: We show that the Kaehler structure can be naturally incorporated in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. The phase space of the BV formalism becomes a fermionic Kaehler manifold. By introducing an isometry we explicitly construct the fermionic irreducible hermitian symmetric space. We then give some solutions of the master equation in the BV formalism.
