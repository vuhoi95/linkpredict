Title: Non-abelian Harmonic Oscillators and Chiral Theories
Authors: Z. Hasiewicz and P. Siemion
Abstract: We show that a large class of physical theories which has been under intensive investigation recently, share the same geometric features in their Hamiltonian formulation. These dynamical systems range from harmonic oscillations to WZW-like models and to the KdV dynamics on $Diff_oS^1$. To the same class belong also the Hamiltonian systems on groups of maps. The common feature of these models are the 'chiral' equations of motion allowing for so-called chiral decomposition of the phase space.
