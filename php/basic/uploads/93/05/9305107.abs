Title: Dilatonic black holes in theories with moduli fields
Authors: M. Cadoni and S. Mignemi
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy effective string theory when moduli of the compactified manifold are present. Assuming a nontrivial coupling of the moduli to the Maxwell tensor, we find a class of regular black hole solutions. Both the thermodynamical and the geometrical structure of these solutions are discussed
