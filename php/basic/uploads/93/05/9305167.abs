Title: Unified Constrained Dynamics
Authors: I. A. Batalin and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: The unified constrained dynamics is formulated without making use of the Dirac splitting of constraint classes. The strengthened, completely--closed, version of the unified constraint algebra generating equations is given. The fundamental phase variable supercommutators are included into the unified algebra as well. The truncated generating operator is defined to be nilpotent in terms of which the Unitarizing Hamiltonian is constructed.
