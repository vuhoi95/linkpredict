Title: On Quantum Integrability and the Lefschetz Number
Authors: A. J. Niemi and K. Palo
Abstract: Certain phase space path integrals can be evaluated exactly using equivariant cohomology and localization in the canonical loop space. Here we extend this to a general class of models. We consider hamiltonians which are {\it a priori} arbitrary functions of the Cartan subalgebra generators of a Lie group which is defined on the phase space. We evaluate the corresponding path integral and find that it is closely related to the infinitesimal Lefschetz number of a Dirac operator on the phase space. Our results indicate that equivariant characteristic classes could provide a natural geometric framework for understanding quantum integrability.
