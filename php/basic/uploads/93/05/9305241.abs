Title: High Temperature Response Functions and the Non-Abelian Kubo Formula
Authors: R. Jackiw and V. P. Nair
Abstract: We describe the relationship between time-ordered and retarded response functions in a plasma. We obtain an expression, including the proper $i\epsilon$-prescription, for the induced current due to hard thermal loops in a non-Abelian theory, thus giving the non-Abelian generalization of the Kubo formula. The result is closely related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons theory and is relevant for a gauge-invariant description of Landau damping in the quark-gluon plasma at high temperature.
