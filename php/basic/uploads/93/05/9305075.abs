Title: Measurements, errors, and negative kinetic energy
Authors: Y. Aharonov and S. Popescu and D. Rohrlich and L. Vaidman
Abstract: An analysis of errors in measurement yields new insight into the penetration of quantum particles into classically forbidden regions. In addition to ``physical" values, realistic measurements yield ``unphysical" values which, we show, can form a consistent pattern. An experiment to isolate a particle in a classically forbidden region obtains negative values for its kinetic energy. These values realize the concept of a {\it weak value}, discussed in previous works.
