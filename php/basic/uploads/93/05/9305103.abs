Title: Classification of (2,2) Compactification in Fermionic Strings
Authors: S. A. Abel and C. M. A. Scheich
Abstract: Replaced with revised (uncorrupted) version We present a general scheme for generating (2,2) symmetric fermionic string models and classify the models in D=8 and D=6 space time dimensions. We discuss the relationship to other compactification schemes.
