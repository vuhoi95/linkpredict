Title: Singularity-free cosmological solutions of the superstring effective  action
Authors: I. Antoniadis and J. Rizos and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We study the cosmological solutions of the one loop corrected superstring effective action, in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, and in the presence of the dilaton and modulus fields. A particularly interesting class of solutions is found which avoid the initial singularity and are consistent with the perturbative treatment of the effective action.
