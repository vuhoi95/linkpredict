Title: Lattice Analogue of W-infinity Algebra and Discrete KP-Hierarchy
Authors: Alexander A. Belov and Karen D. Chaltikian
Abstract: In development of the started activity on lattice analogues of $W$-algebras, we define the notion of lattice $W_{\infty}$-algebra, accociated with lattice integrable system with infinite set of fields. Various kinds of reduction to lattice $W_N$-algebras, related to discrete $N$-KdV hierarchies are described. We also discuss the connection of our results with those obtained in the papers of Xiong [13] and Bonora [14].
