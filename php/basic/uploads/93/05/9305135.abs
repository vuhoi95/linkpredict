Title: Quantum Loop Modules and Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: D. Altschuler and B. Davies
Abstract: We construct level-0 modules of the quantum affine algebra $\Uq$, as the $q$-deformed version of the Lie algebra loop module construction. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the modules to be irreducible. We construct the crystal base for some of these modules and find significant differences from the case of highest weight modules. We also consider the role of loop modules in the recent scheme for diagonalising certain quantum spin chains using their $\Uq$ symmetry.
