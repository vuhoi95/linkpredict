Title: Quantum Coherence in Two Dimensions
Authors: S. W. Hawking and J. D. Hayward
Abstract: The formation and evaporation of two dimensional black holes are discussed. It is shown that if the radiation in minimal scalars has positive energy, there must be a global event horizon or a naked singularity. The former would imply loss of quantum coherence while the latter would lead to an even worse breakdown of predictability. CPT invariance would suggest that there ought to be past horizons as well. A way in which this could happen with wormholes is described.
