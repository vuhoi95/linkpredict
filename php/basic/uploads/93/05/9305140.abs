Title: A symplectic structure for the space of quantum field theories
Authors: E. Ramos and O. A. Soloviev
Abstract: We use the formal Lie algebraic structure in the ``space'' of hamiltonians provided by equal time commutators to define a Kirillov-Konstant symplectic structure in the coadjoint orbits of the associated formal group. The dual is defined via the natural pairing between operators and states in a Hilbert space.
