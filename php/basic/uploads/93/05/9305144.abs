Title: Generalized Yang-Baxter Equation
Authors: R. M. Kashaev and Yu. G. Stroganov
Abstract: A generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation is proposed. It enables to construct integrable two-dimensional lattice models with commuting two-layer transfer matrices, while single-layer ones are not necessarily commutative. Explicit solutions to the generalized equations are found. They are related with Botzmann weights of the $sl(3)$ chiral Potts model.
