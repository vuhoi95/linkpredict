Title: The N to Infinity Limit of the Chiral Potts Model
Authors: Helen Au-Yang and Jacques H. H. Perk
Abstract: We consider the N to infinity limits of the N-state chiral Potts model. We find new weights that satisfy the star-triangle relations with spin variables either taking all the integer values or having values from a continous interval. The models provide chiral generalizations of Zamolodchikov's Fishnet Model. (For the more complete version, see math.QA/9906029, where the misprints in eq. (12) are also corrected.)
