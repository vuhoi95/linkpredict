Title: Towards Three-Dimensional Bethe Ansatz
Authors: M. Bellon and S. Boukraa and J-M. Maillard and C-M. Viallet
Abstract: We introduce a ``pre-Bethe-Ansatz'' system of equations for three dimensional vertex models. We bring to the light various algebraic curves of high genus and discuss some situations where these curves simplify. As a result we describe remarkable subvarieties of the space of parameters.
