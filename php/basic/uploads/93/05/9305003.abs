Title: q-Supersymmetric Generalization of von Neumann's Theorem
Authors: M. Chaichian and R. Gonzalez Felipe and P. Presnajder
Abstract: Assuming that there exist operators which form an irreducible representation of the q-superoscillator algebra, it is proved that any two such representations are equivalent, related by a uniquely determined superunitary transformation. This provides with a q-supersymmetric generalization of the well-known uniqueness theorem of von Neumann for any finite number of degrees of freedom.
