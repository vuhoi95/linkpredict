Title: Quantum Mechanical Interaction-Free Measurements
Authors: Avshalom C. Elitzur and Lev Vaidman
Abstract: A novel manifestation of nonlocality of quantum mechanics is presented. It is shown that it is possible to ascertain the existence of an object in a given region of space without interacting with it. The method might have practical applications for delicate quantum experiments.
