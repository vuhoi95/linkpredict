Title: Charged Stringy Black Holes With Non-Abelian Hair
Authors: E. E. Donets and D. V. Gal'tsov
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat charged black hole solutions are constructed within the magnetic SU(3) sector of the 4-dimensional heterotic string effective action. They possess non-abelian hair in addition to the Coulomb magnetic field and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Mills colored SU(3) black holes except for the extremal case. In the extremality limit the horizon shrinks and the resulting geometry around the origin coincides with that of an extremal abelian dilatonic black hole with magnetic charge. Non-abelian hair exibits then typical sphaleron structure.
