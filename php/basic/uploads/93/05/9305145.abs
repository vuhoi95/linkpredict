Title: Elliptic solution for modified tetrahedron equations
Authors: V. V. Mangazeev and Yu. G. Stroganov
Abstract: As is known, tetrahedron equations lead to the commuting family of transfer-matrices and provide the integrability of corresponding three-dimensional lattice models. We present the modified version of these equations which give the commuting family of more complicated two-layer transfer-matrices. In the static limit we have succeeded in constructing the solution of these equations in terms of elliptic functions.
