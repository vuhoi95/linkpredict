Title: Renormalization in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: K. S. Gupta and S. G. Rajeev
Abstract: We implement the concept of Wilson renormalization in the context of simple quantum mechanical systems. The attractive inverse square potential leads to a $\b$ function with a nontrivial ultraviolet stable fixed point and the Hulthen potential exhibits the crossover phenomenon. We also discuss the implementation of the Wilson scheme in the broader context of one dimensional potential problems. The possibility of an analogue of Zamolodchikov's $C$ function in these systems is also discussed.
