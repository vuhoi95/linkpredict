Title: Free Boson Representation of $U_q(\widehat{sl}_3)$
Authors: H. Awata and S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Abstract: A representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_{q}(\widehat{sl}_3)$ of an arbitrary level $k$ is constructed in the Fock module of eight boson fields. This realization reduces the Wakimoto representation in the $q \rightarrow 1$ limit. The analogues of the screening currents are also obtained. They commute with the action of $U_{q}(\widehat{sl}_3)$ modulo total differences of some fields.
