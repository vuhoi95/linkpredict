Title: BRST Analysis of Physical States in Two-Dimensional Black Hole
Authors: Katsumi Itoh and Hiroshi Kunitomo and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: We study the BRST cohomology for $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model, which describes an exact string black hole solution. It is shown that the physical spectrum could contain not only the extra discrete states corresponding to those in $c=1$ two-dimensional gravity but also many additional new states with ghost number $N_{FP}= -1 \sim 2$. We also discuss characters for nonunitary representations and the relation of our results to other approaches.
