Title: Gutzwiller-Jastrow Wavefunctions for the $1/r$ Hubbard Model
Authors: D. F. Wang Joseph Henry and Q. F. Zhong and P. Coleman Serin
Abstract: In this work, we study the wavefunctions of the one dimensional $1/r$ Hubbard model in the strong interaction limit $U =\infty$. A set of Gutzwiller-Jastorw wavefunctions are shown to be eigen-functions of the Hamiltonian. The entire excitation spectrum and the thermodynamics are also studied in terms of more generalized Jastrow wavefunctions. For the wavefunctions and integrability conditions at finite on-site energy, further investigations are needed.
