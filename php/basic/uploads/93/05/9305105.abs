Title: Batalin-Vilkoviski master equation and absence of anomalies in string  field theory
Authors: Jose Gaite and Ram Brustein
Abstract: We study the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation for both open and closed string field theory with special attention to anomalies. Open string field theory is anomaly free once the minimal coupling to closed strings induced by loop amplitudes is considered. In closed string field theory the full-fledged master equation has to be solved order by order in perturbation theory. The existence of a solution implies the absence of anomaly. We briefly discuss the relation of the iterative process of solution to methods used in the first quantized formalism and comment on some possible non-perturbative corrections.
