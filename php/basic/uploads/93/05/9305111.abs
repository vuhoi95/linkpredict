Title: A Nonsingular Two Dimensional Black Hole
Authors: M. Trodden and V. Mukhanov and R. Brandenberger
Abstract: We construct a model of gravity in 1+1 spacetime dimensions in which the solutions approach the Schwarzschild metric at large $r$ and de Sitter space far inside the horizon. Our model may be viewed as a two dimensional application of the `Limiting Curvature Construction' recently proposed by two of the authors.
