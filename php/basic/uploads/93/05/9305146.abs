Title: Free Boson Realization of $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$
Authors: H. Awata and S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Abstract: We construct a realization of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ of an arbitrary level $k$ in terms of free boson fields. In the $q\!\rightarrow\! 1$ limit this realization becomes the Wakimoto realization of $\widehat{sl_N}$. The screening currents and the vertex operators(primary fields) are also constructed; the former commutes with $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ modulo total difference, and the latter creates the $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ highest weight state from the vacuum state of the boson Fock space.
