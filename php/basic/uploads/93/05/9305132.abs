Authors: A. Brandhuber and S. Emery and M. Langer and O. Piguet and M. Schweda and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: The Green functions of the Chern-Simons theory quantized in the axial gauge are shown to be calculable as the unique, exact solution of the Ward identities which express the invariance of the theory under the topological supersymmetry of Delduc, Gieres and Sorella.
