Title: Variations on Kaluza-Klein Cosmology
Authors: M. A. R. Osorio and M. A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological consequences of having quantum fields living in a space with compactified dimensions. We will show that the equation of state is not modified by topological effects and so the dynamics of the universe remains as it is in the infinite volume limit. On the contrary the thermal history of the universe depends on terms that are associated with having non-trivial topology. In the conclusions we discuss some issues about the relationship between the $c=1$ non-critical string-inspired cosmology and the result obtained with matter given by a hot massless field in $S^{1}\times \mbox{\bf R}$.
