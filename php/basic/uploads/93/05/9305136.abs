Abstract: For generic $q$ we give expressions for the transformations of all essentially typical finite-dimensional modules of the Hopf superalgebra $U_q[gl(3/2)]$. The latter is a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra $gl(3/2)$. The basis within each module is similar to the Gel'fand-Zetlin basis for $gl(5)$. We write down expressions for the transformations of the basis under the action of the Chevalley generators.
