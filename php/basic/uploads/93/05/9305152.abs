Title: $W_{\infty}$--Geometry and Associated Continuous Toda System
Authors: Mikhail V. Saveliev and Svetlana A. Savelieva
Abstract: We discuss an infinite--dimensional k\"ahlerian manifold associated with the area--preserving diffeomorphisms on two--dimensional torus, and, correspondingly, with a continuous limit of the $A_r$--Toda system. In particular, a continuous limit of the $A_r$--Grassmannians and a related Pl\"ucker type formula are introduced as relevant notions for $W_{\infty}$--geometry of the self--dual Einstein space with the rotational Killing vector.
