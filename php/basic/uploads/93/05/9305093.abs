Title: Central Charge Reduction and Spacetime Statistics in the Fractional  Superstring
Authors: Philip C. Argyres and Keith R. Dienes
Abstract: Fractional superstrings in the tensor-product formulation experience ``internal projections'' which reduce their effective central charges. Simple expressions for the characters of the resulting effective worldsheet theory are found. All states in the effective theory can be consistently assigned definite spacetime statistics. The projection to the effective theory is shown to be described by the action of a dimension-three current in the original tensor-product theory.
