Title: Half-String Approach to Closed String Field Theory
Authors: F. Anton and A. Abdurrahman and J. Bordes
Abstract: In this letter we present an operator formalism for Closed String Field Theory based on closed half-strings. Our results indicate that the restricted polyhedra of the classical non-polynomial string field theory, can be represented as traces of infinite matrices, with operator insertions that reparametrise the half-strings.
