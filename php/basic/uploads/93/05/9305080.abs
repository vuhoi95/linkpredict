Title: Structure of Topological Lattice Field Theories in Three Dimensions
Authors: Stephen-wei Chung and Masafumi Fukuma and Alfred Shapere
Abstract: We construct and classify topological lattice field theories in three dimensions. After defining a general class of local lattice field theories, we impose invariance under arbitrary topology-preserving deformations of the underlying lattice, which are generated by two new local lattice moves. Invariant solutions are in one--to--one correspondence with Hopf algebras satisfying a certain constraint. As an example, we study in detail the topological lattice field theory corresponding to the Hopf algebra based on the group ring $\C[G]$, and show that it is equivalent to lattice gauge theory at zero coupling, and to the Ponzano--Regge theory for $G=$SU(2).
