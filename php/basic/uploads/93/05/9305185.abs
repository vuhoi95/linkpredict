Title: Duality Symmetries of 4D Heterotic Strings
Authors: John H. Schwarz and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: Target space duality (T duality), which interchanges Kaluza--Klein and winding-mode excitations of the compactified heterotic string, is realized as a symmetry of a world-sheet action. Axion-dilaton duality (S duality), a conjectured nonperturbative SL(2,Z) symmetry of the same theory, plays an analogous role for five-branes. We describe a soliton spectrum possessing both duality symmetries and argue that the theory has an infinite number of dual string descriptions.
