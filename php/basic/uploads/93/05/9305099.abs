Title: Supersymmetric Bianchi class A models
Authors: Masako Asano and Masayuki Tanimoto and Noriaki Yoshino
Abstract: The canonical theory of $N=1$ supergravity is applied to Bianchi class A spatially homogeneous cosmologies. The full set of quantum constraints are then solved with the possible ordering ambiguity taken into account by introducing a free parameter. The wave functions are explicitly given for all the Bianchi class A models in a unified way. Some comments are made on the Bianchi type IX cases.
