Title: Four-Dimensional String/String Duality
Authors: M. J. Duff and Ramzi R. Khuri
Abstract: We present supersymmetric soliton solutions of the four-dimensional heterotic string corresponding to monopoles, strings and domain walls. These solutions admit the $D=10$ interpretation of a fivebrane wrapped around $5$, $4$ or $3$ of the $6$ toroidally compactified dimensions and are arguably exact to all orders in $\alpha'$. The solitonic string solution exhibits an $SL(2,Z)$ {\it strong/weak coupling} duality which however corresponds to an $SL(2,Z)$ {\it target space} duality of the fundamental string.
