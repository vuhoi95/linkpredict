Title: Anomalous Fermion Production in Gravitational Collapse
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and Alan R. Steif
Abstract: The Dirac equation is solved in the Einstein-Yang-Mills background found by Bartnik and McKinnon. We find a normalizable zero-energy fermion mode in the $s$-wave sector. As shown recently, their solution corresponds to a gravitational sphaleron which mediates transitions between topologically distinct vacua. Since the Bartnik-McKinnon solution is unstable, it will either collapse to form a black hole or radiate away its energy. In either case, as the Chern-Simons number of the configuration changes, there will be an accompanying anomalous change in fermion number.
