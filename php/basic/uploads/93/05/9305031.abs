Title: Non Perturbative Solutions and Scaling Properties of Vector,  Axial--Vector Electrodynamics in $1+1$ Dimensions
Authors: A. Bassetto and L. Griguolo and P. Zanca
Abstract: We study by non perturbative techniques a vector, axial--vector theory characterized by a parameter which interpolates between pure vector and chiral Schwinger models. Main results are two windows in the space of parameters which exhibit acceptable solutions. In the first window we find a free massive and a free massless bosonic excitations and interacting left--right fermions endowed with asymptotic \hbox{states}, which feel however a long range interaction. In the second window the massless bosonic excitation is a negative norm state which can be consistently expunged from the ``physical" Hilbert space; fermions are confined. An intriguing feature of our model occurs in the first window where we find that fermionic correlators scale at both short and long distances, but with different critical exponents. The infrared limit in the fermionic sector is nothing but a dynamically generated massless Thirring model.
