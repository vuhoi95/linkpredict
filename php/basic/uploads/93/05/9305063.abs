Title: \bf A Borel-Weil-Bott approach to representations of $\slq$
Authors: Davide Franco and Cesare Reina
Abstract: We use a quite concrete and simple realization of $\slq$ involving finite difference operators. We interpret them as derivations (in the non-commutative sense) on a suitable graded algebra, which gives rise to the double of the projective line as the non commutative version of the standard homogeneous space.
