Title: The Canonical Symmetry and Hamiltonian Formalism. I. Conservation Laws
Authors: A. N. Leznov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: The properties of the canonical symmetry of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are investigated. The densities of the local conservation laws for this system are shown to change under the action of the canonical symmetry by total space derivatives.
