Title: Initial conditions and unitarity in unimodular quantum cosmology
Authors: Alan Daughton and Jorma Louko and Rafael D. Sorkin
Abstract: We consider quantization of the positive curvature Friedmann cosmology in the unimodular modification of Einstein's theory, in which the spacetime four-volume appears as an explicit time variable. The Hamiltonian admits self-adjoint extensions that give unitary evolution in the Hilbert space associated with the Schr\"odinger equation. The semiclassical estimate to the no-boundary wave function of Hartle and Hawking is found. If this estimate is accurate, there is a continuous flux of probability into the configuration space from vanishing three-volume, and the no-boundary wave function evolves nonunitarily. Generalizations of these results hold in a class of anisotropic cosmologies.
