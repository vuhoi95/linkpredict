Title: Phenomenological Implications of Supersymmetry Breaking by the Dilaton
Authors: R. Barbieri and J. Louis and M. Moretti
Abstract: We investigate the low energy properties of string vacua with spontaneously broken $N=1$ supersymmetry by a dilaton $F$-term. As a consequence of the universal couplings of the dilaton, the supersymmetric mass spectrum is determined in terms of only three independent parameters and more constrained than in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. For a $\mu$-term induced by the \K\ potential the parameter space becomes two-dimensional; in the allowed regions of this parameter space we find that most supersymmetric particles are determined solely by the gluino mass. The Higgs is rather light and the top-quark mass always lower than 180 GeV.
