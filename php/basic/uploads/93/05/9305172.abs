Title: Average Effective Potential for the Conformal Factor
Authors: R. Floreanini and R. Percacci
Abstract: In a four dimensional theory of gravity with lagrangian quadratic in curvature and torsion, we compute the effective action for metrics of the form $g_{\mu\nu}=\rho^2\delta_{\mu\nu}$, with $\rho$ constant. Using standard field-theoretic methods we find that one loop quantum effects produce a nontrivial effective potential for $\rho$. We explain this unexpected result by showing how our regularization procedure differs from the one that is usually adopted in Quantum Gravity. Using the method of the average effective potential, we compute the scale dependence of the v.e.v. of the conformal factor.
