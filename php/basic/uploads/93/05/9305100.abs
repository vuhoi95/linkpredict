Abstract: We formulate the basic properties of q-vertex operators in the context of the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester (ABF) series, as an example of face-interaction models, derive the q-difference equations satisfied by their correlation functions, and establish their connection with representation theory. We also discuss the q-difference equations of the Kashiwara-Miwa (KM) series, as an example of edge-interaction models. Next, the Ising model--the simplest special case of both ABF and KM series--is studied in more detail using the Jordan-Wigner fermions. In particular, all matrix elements of vertex operators are calculated.
