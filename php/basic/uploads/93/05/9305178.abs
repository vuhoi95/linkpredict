Title: The energy of the high-temperature quark-gluon plasma
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel and J. C. Taylor
Abstract: For the quark-gluon plasma, an energy-momentum tensor is found corresponding to the high-temperature Braaten-Pisarski effective action. The tensor is found by considering the interaction of the plasma with a weak gravitational field and the positivity of the energy is studied. In addition, the complete effective action in curved spacetime is written down.
