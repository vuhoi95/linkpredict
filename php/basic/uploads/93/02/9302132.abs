Title: Unrecognizable Black Holes in Two Dimensions
Authors: T. Fujiwara and Y. Igarashi and J. Kubo
Abstract: The classical 2D cosmological model of Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger possesses a global symmetry that is responsible for decoupling of matter fields. The model is quantized on the basis of the extended phase space method to allow an exhaustive, algebraic analysis to find potential anomalies. Under a certain set of reasonable assumptions we show that neither the BRST symmetry of the theory nor the global symmetry suffers from an anomaly. From this we conclude that there is nothing to recognize the existence of black hole and therefore nothing to radiate in their cosmological model.
