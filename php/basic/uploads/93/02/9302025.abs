Title: The Crumpling Transition of Dynamically Triangulated Random Surfaces
Authors: Christian MÃ¼nkel and Dieter W. Heermann
Abstract: We present the crumpling transition in three-dimensional Euclidian space of dynamically triangulated random surfaces with edge extrinsic curvature and fixed topology of a sphere as well as simulations of a dynamically triangulated torus. We used longer runs than previous simulations and give new and more accurate estimates of critical exponents. Our data indicate a cusp singularity in the specific heat. The transition temperature, as well as the exponents are topology dependent.
