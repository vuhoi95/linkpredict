Title: Multiple Chern-Simons Fields on a Torus
Authors: D. Wesolowski and Y. Hosotani and C. -L. Ho
Abstract: Intertwined multiple Chern-Simons gauge fields induce matrix statistics among particles. We analyse this theory on a torus, focusing on the vacuum structure and the Hilbert space. The theory can be mimicked, although not completely, by an effective theory with one Chern-Simons gauge field. The correspondence between the Wilson line integrals, vacuum degeneracy and wave functions for these two theories are discussed. Further, it is obtained in both of these cases that the two total momenta and Hamiltonian commute only in the physical Hilbert space.
