Title: Static Quark Potential from the Polyakov Sum over Surfaces
Authors: Zbigniew Jaskolski and Krzysztof A. Meissner
Abstract: Using the Polyakov string ansatz for the rectangular Wilson loop we calculate the static potential in the semiclassical approximation. Our results lead to a well defined sum over surfaces in the range $1<d<25$.
