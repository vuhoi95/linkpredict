Title: Master Equations for Extended Lagrangian BRST Symmetries
Authors: P. H. Damgaard and F. De Jonghe
Abstract: Starting from the requirement that a Lagrangian field theory be invariant under both Schwinger-Dyson BRST and Schwinger-Dyson anti-BRST symmetry, we derive the BRST--anti-BRST analogue of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. This is done through standard Lagrangian gauge fixing respecting the extended BRST symmetry. The solutions of the resulting Master Equation and the gauge-fixing procedure for the quantum action can be brought into forms that coincide with those obtained earlier on algebraic grounds by Batalin, Lavrov and Tyutin.
