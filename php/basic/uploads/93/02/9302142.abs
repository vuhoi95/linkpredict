Title: Wave Functional of Quantum Black Holes in Two Dimensions
Authors: Takayuki Hori and Masaru Kamata
Abstract: The wheeler-DeWitt method is applied to the quantization of the 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton gravity coupled with the conformal matter fields. Exact solutions to the WD equations are found, which are interpreted as right(left)-moving black holes.
