Title: Quantum Theory of Black Holes
Authors: J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: A solvable 2-dimensional conformally invariant midi-superspace model for black holes is obtained by imposing spherical symmetry in 4-dimensional conformally invariant Einstein gravity. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the theory is solved exactly to obtain the unique quantum wave functional for an isolated black hole with fixed mass. By suitably relaxing the boundary conditions, a non-perturbative ansatz is obtained for the wave functional of a black hole interacting with its surroundings.
