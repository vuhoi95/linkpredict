Title: Algebras in Higher Dimensional Statistical Mechanics - the Exceptional  Partition (MEAN Field) Algebras
Authors: Paul Martin and Hubert Saleur
Abstract: We determine the structure of the partition algebra $P_n(Q)$ (a generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra) for specific values of $Q \in \C$, focusing on the quotient which gives rise to the partition function of $n$ site $Q$-state Potts models (in the continuous $Q$ formulation) in arbitrarily high lattice dimensions (the mean field case). The algebra is non-semi-simple iff $Q$ is a non-negative integer less than $n$. We determine the dimension of the key irreducible representation in every specialization.
