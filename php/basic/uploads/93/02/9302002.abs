Abstract: We discuss the infinite dimensional algebras appearing in integrable perturbations of conformally invariant theories, with special emphasis in the structure of the consequent non-abelian infinite dimensional algebra generalizing $W_\infty$ to the case of a non abelian group. We prove that the pure left-symmetry as well as the pure right-sector of the thus obtained algebra coincides with the conformally invariant case. The mixed sector is more involved, although the general structure seems to be near to be unraveled. We also find some subalgebras that correspond to Kac-Moody algebras. The constraints imposed by the algebras are very strong, and in the case of the massive deformation of a non-abelian fermionic model, the symmetry alone is enough to fix the 2- and 3-point functions of the theory.
