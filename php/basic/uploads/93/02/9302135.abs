Title: Subdivision Invariant Models in Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: D. Birmingham and M. Rakowski
Abstract: A class of lattice gauge theories is presented which exhibits novel topological properties. The construction is in terms of compact Wilson variables defined on a simplicial complex which models a four dimensional manifold with boundary. The case of Z2 and Z3 gauge groups is considered in detail, and we prove that at certain discrete values of the coupling parameter, the partition function in these models remains invariant under subdivision of the underlying simplicial complex. A variety of extensions is also presented.
