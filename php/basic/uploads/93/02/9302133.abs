Title: Transfer Matrix Formalism for Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity and  Fractal Structures of Space-time
Authors: H. Kawai and N. Kawamoto and T. Mogami and Y. Watabiki
Abstract: We develop a transfer matrix formalism for two-dimensional pure gravity. By taking the continuum limit, we obtain a "Hamiltonian formalism'' in which the geodesic distance plays the role of time. Applying this formalism, we obtain a universal function which describes the fractal structures of two dimensional quantum gravity in the continuum limit.
