Title: The Hidden Quantum Group of the 8-vertex Free Fermion Model: q-Clifford  Algebras
Authors: R. Cuerno and C. Gomez and E. Lopez and G. Sierra
Abstract: We prove in this paper that the elliptic $R$--matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model is the intertwiner $R$--matrix of a quantum deformed Clifford--Hopf algebra. This algebra is constructed by affinization of a quantum Hopf deformation of the Clifford algebra.
