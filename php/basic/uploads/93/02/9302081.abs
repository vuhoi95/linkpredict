Title: Threefold Family of Charged Spin-1/2 Dirac Bubbles
Authors: Aharon Davidson and Uzi Paz
Abstract: We extend Dirac's `extensible model of the electron' to include spin and family. $U(1)_{e.m.}$ charge conservation on the bubble is translated into a secondary $U(1)_{g}$ world-manifold gauge principle. Reflecting the secondary magnetic monopole configuration on spatial $S^2$, the harmonic excitations may furnish half integer $SU(2)_{spin}\otimes U(1)_{g}$ representations. Our spin--$1/2$ `electron' is described by four world-manifold scalar fields. Its three varieties are associated with different minima of the (6th--order) surface-tension scalar potential.
