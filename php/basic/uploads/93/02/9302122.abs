Title: On the finiteness of the BRS modulo-d cocycles
Authors: Olivier Piguet and Silvio P. Sorella
Abstract: Ladders of field polynomial differential forms obeying systems of descent equations and corresponding to observables and anomalies of gauge theories are renormalized. They obey renormalized descent equations. Moreover they are shown to have vanishing anomalous dimensions. As an application a simple proof of the nonrenormalization theorem for the nonabelian gauge anomaly is given.
