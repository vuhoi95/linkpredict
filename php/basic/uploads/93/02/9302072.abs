Title: Instantons and the Ground State of the Massive Schwinger Model
Authors: M. B. Paranjape and Robin Ross
Abstract: We study the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics of massive, Dirac fermions, in 1+1 dimensions; with space compactified to a circle. In the limit that transitions to fermion--anti-fermion pairs can be neglected, we study the full ground state. We focus on the effect of instantons which mediate tunnelling transitions in the induced potential for the dynamical degree of freedom in the gauge field.
