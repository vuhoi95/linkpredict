Title: c=1 String Theory as a Topological G/G Model
Authors: O. Aharony and O. Ganor and J. Sonnenschein and S. Yankielowicz
Abstract: The physical states on the free field Fock space of the ${SL(2,R)\over SL(2,R)$ model at any level are computed. Using a similarity transformation on $Q_{BRST}$, the cohomology of the latter is mapped into a direct sum of simpler cohomologies. We show a one to one correspondence between the states of the $k=-1$ model and those of the $c=1$ string model. A full equivalence between the ${SL(2,R)\over SL(2,R)$ and ${SL(2,R)\over U(1)$ models at the level of their Fock space cohomologies is found.
