Title: Parameter restrictions in a non-commutative geometry model do not  survive standard quantum corrections

Abstract: We have investigated the standard one-loop quantum corrections for a particularly simple non-commutative geometry model containing fermions interacting with a unique abelian gauge field and a unique scalar through Yukawa couplings. In this model there are certain relations among the different coupling constants quite similar to the ones appearing in the Connes-Lott version of the standard model. We find that it is not possible to implement those relations in a renormalization-group invariant way.
