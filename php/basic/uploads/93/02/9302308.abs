Title: Heterotic Pomeron: A Unified Treatment of High Energy Hadronic  Collisions in QCD
Authors: Genya Levin and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: A unified treatment of high energy collisions in QCD is presented. Using a probabilistic approach, we incorporate both perturbative (hard) and non-perturbative (soft) components in a consistent fashion, leading to a ``Heterotic Pomeron". As a Regge trajectory, it is nonlinear, approaching 1 in the limit $t\rightarrow -\infty$.
