Title: One-loop effective potential on hyperbolic manifolds
Authors: Guido Cognola and Klaus Kirsten and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The one-loop effective potential for a scalar field defined on an ultrastatic space-time whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolic manifold, is studied using zeta-function regularization for the one-loop effective action. Other possible regularizations are discussed in detail. The renormalization group equations are derived and their connection with the conformal anomaly is pointed out. The symmetry breaking and the topological mass generation are also discussed.
