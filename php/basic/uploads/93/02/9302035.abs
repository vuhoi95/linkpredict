Title: A Pictorial History of Some Gravitational Instantons
Authors: Dieter Brill and Kay-Thomas Pirk
Abstract: Four-dimensional Euclidean spaces that solve Einstein's equations are interpreted as WKB approximations to wavefunctionals of quantum geometry. These spaces are represented graphically by suppressing inessential dimensions and drawing the resulting figures in perspective representation of three-dimensional space, some of them stereoscopically. The figures are also related to the physical interpretation of the corresponding quantum processes.
