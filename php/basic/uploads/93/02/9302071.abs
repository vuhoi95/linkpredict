Title: Aspects of Fractional Superstrings
Authors: Gerald B. Cleaver and Philip J. Rosenthal
Abstract: We investigate some issues relating to recently proposed fractional superstring theories with $D_{\rm critical}<10$. Using the factorization approach of Gepner and Qiu, we systematically rederive the partition functions of the $K=4,\, 8,$ and $16$ theories and examine their spacetime supersymmetry. Generalized GSO projection operators for the $K=4$ model are found. Uniqueness of the twist field, $\phi^{K/4}_{K/4}$, as source of spacetime fermions is demonstrated. Last, we derive a linear (rather than quadratic) relationship between the required conformal anomaly and the conformal dimension of the supercurrent ghost.
