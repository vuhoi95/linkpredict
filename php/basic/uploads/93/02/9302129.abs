Title: The Spectrum of Topologically Massive Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Mikhail I. Dobroliubov and David Eliezer and Ian I. Kogan and Gordon W. Semenoff and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We discuss the possibility for the spectrum of topologically massive quantum electrodynamics with spinor matter fields to contain unexpected and unusual stable particle excitations for certain values of the topological photon mass. The new field theoretical phenomena arising from this novel spectral structure are briefly discussed.
