Title: Finite-Temperature Scalar Field Theory in Static de Sitter Space
Authors: D. V. Fursaev and G. Miele
Abstract: The finite-temperature one-loop effective potential for a scalar field in the static de Sitter space-time is obtained. Within this framework, by using zeta-function regularization, one can get, in the conformally invariant case, the explicit expression for the stress tensor anomaly. Its value turns out to depend on the thermal state of the system. This conclusion is different from the one derived by other authors, who considered thermal properties of ultraviolet divergences in static spaces ignoring the effects of horizons. The behaviour of the effective potential in the ground state and in de Sitter-invariant state is also studied, showing the role played by the curvature on the minima.
