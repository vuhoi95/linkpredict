Title: q-deformed superconformal algebra on quantum superspace
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Tsuneo Uematsu
Abstract: A quantum deformation of 4-dimensional superconformal algebra realized on quantum superspace is investigated. We study the differential calculus and the action of the quantum generators corresponding to $sl_q(1|4)$ which act on the quantum superspace. We derive deformed $su(1|2,2)$ algebras from the deformed $sl(1|4)$ algebra. Through a contraction procedure we obtain a deformed super-Poincar{\'e} algebra.
