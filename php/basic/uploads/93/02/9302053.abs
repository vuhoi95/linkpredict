Title: Classification of Solvable Feynman Path Integrals
Authors: Christian Grosche and Frank Steiner
Abstract: A systematic classification of Feynman path integrals in quantum mechanics is presented and a table of solvable path integrals is given which reflects the progress made during the last ten years or so, including, of course, the main contributions since the invention of the path integral by Feynman in 1942. An outline of the general theory is given. Explicit formul\ae\ for the so-called basic path integrals are presented on which our general scheme to classify and calculate path integrals in quantum mechanics is based.
