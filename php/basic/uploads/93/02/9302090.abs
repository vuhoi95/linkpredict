Title: Quantum Group Gauge Theories and Covariant Quantum Algebras
Authors: A. P. Isaev and Z. Popowicz
Abstract: The algebraic formulation of the quantum group gauge models in the framework of the $R$-matrix approach to the theory of quantum groups is given. We consider gauge groups taking values in the quantum groups and noncommutative gauge fields transformed as comodules under the coaction of the gauge quantum group $ G_{q}$. Using this approach we construct the quantum deformations of the topological Chern-Simons models, non-abelian gauge theories and the Einstein gravity. The noncommutative fields in these models generate $ G_{q}$-covariant quantum algebras.
