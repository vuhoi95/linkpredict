Title: WZW-Toda Reduction using the Casimir Operator
Authors: I. Jack and J. Panvel
Abstract: We construct a quantum Hamiltonian operator for the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in terms of the Casimir operator. This facilitates the discussion of the reduction of the WZW model to Toda field theory at the quantum level and provides a very straightforward derivation of the quantum central charge for the Toda field theory.
