Title: Aharonov-Bohm Scattering, Contact Interactions and Scale Invariance
Authors: O. Bergman and G. Lozano
Abstract: We perform a perturbative analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm problem to one loop in a field-theoretic formulation, and show that contact interactions are necessary for renormalizability. In general, the classical scale invariance of this problem is broken quantum mechanically. There exists however a critical point for which this anomaly disappears.
