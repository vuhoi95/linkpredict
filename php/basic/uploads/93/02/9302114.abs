Title: The covariant scattering and cohomology of $W_3$ strings
Authors: Michael Freeman and Peter West
Abstract: A general formalism for covariant $W_3$ string scattering is given. It is found necessary to use screening charges that are constructed from the $W_3$ fields including ghosts. The scattering amplitudes so constructed contain within them Ising model correlation functions and agree with those found previously by the authors. Using the screening charge and a picture changing operator, an infinite number of states in the cohomology of Q are generated from only three states. We conjecture that, apart from discrete states, these are all the states in the cohomology of Q.
