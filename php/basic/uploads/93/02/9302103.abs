Title: Holomorphic Anomalies in Topological Field Theories
Authors: M. Bershadsky and S. Cecotti and H. Ooguri and C. Vafa and S. Katz
Abstract: We study the stringy genus one partition function of $N=2$ SCFT's. It is shown how to compute this using an anomaly in decoupling of BRST trivial states from the partition function. A particular limit of this partition function yields the partition function of topological theory coupled to topological gravity. As an application we compute the number of holomorphic elliptic curves over certain Calabi-Yau manifolds including the quintic threefold. This may be viewed as the first application of mirror symmetry at the string quantum level.
