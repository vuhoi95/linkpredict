Title: Quantum Particle on a Quantum Circle
Authors: T. Brzezinski and J. Rembielinski and K. A. Smolinski
Abstract: We describe a $q$-deformed dynamical system corresponding to the quantum free particle moving along the circle. The algebra of observables is constructed and discussed. We construct and classify irreducible representations of the system.
