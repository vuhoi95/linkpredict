Title: Topological Strings, Flat Coordinates and Gravitational Descendants
Authors: T. Eguchi and H. Kanno and Y. Yamada and S. -K. Yang
Abstract: We discuss physical spectra and correlation functions of topological minimal models coupled to topological gravity. We first study the BRST formalism of these theories and show that their BRST operator $Q=Q_s+Q_v$ can be brought to $Q_s$ by a certain homotopy operator $U$, $UQU^{-1}=Q_s$ ($Q_s$ and $Q_v$ are the $N=2$ and diffeomorphism BRST operators, respectively). The reparametrization (anti)-ghost $b$ mixes with the supercharge operator $G$ under this transformation. Existence of this transformation enables us to use matter fields to represent cohomology classes of the operator $Q$. We explicitly construct gravitational descendants and show that they generate the higher-order KdV flows. We also evaluate genus-zero correlation functions and rederive basic recursion relations of two-dimensional topological gravity.
