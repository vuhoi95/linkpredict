Authors: T. Fujiwara and T. Tabei and Y. Igarashi and K. Maeda and J. Kubo
Abstract: The extended phase space method of Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky is applied to formulate two dimensional gravity in a general class of gauges. A BRST formulation of the light-cone gauge is presented to reveal the relationship between the BRST symmetry and the origin of $SL(2,R)$ current algebra. From the same principle we derive the conformal gauge action suggested by David, Distler and Kawai.
