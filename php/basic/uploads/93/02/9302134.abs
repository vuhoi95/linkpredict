Title: Solitons in Two--Dimensional Topological Field Theories
Authors: S. Penati and M. Pernici and D. Zanon
Abstract: We consider a class of $N=2$ supersymmetric non--unitary theories in two--dimensional Minkowski spacetime which admit classical solitonic solutions. We show how these models can be twisted into a topological sector whose energy--momentum tensor is a BRST commutator. There is an infinite number of degrees of freedom associated to the zero modes of the solitons. As explicit realizations of such models we discuss the BRST quantization of a system of free fields, while in the interacting case we study $N=2$ complexified twisted Toda theories.
