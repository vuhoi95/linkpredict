Title: Quantum Chains with U_q(SL(2)) Symmetry and Unrestricted Representations
Authors: Daniel Arnaudon and Vladimir Rittenberg
Abstract: We consider two-state (q^2=-1) and three-state (q^3=1) one-dimensional quantum spin chains with U_q(SL(2)) symmetry. Taking unrestricted representations (periodic, semi-periodic and nilpotent), we show which are the necessary conditions to obtain a Hermitian Hamiltonian.
