Title: Anyonic Realization of $SU_q(N)$ Quantum Algebra
Authors: Raffaele Caracciolo and Marco A. R-Monteiro
Abstract: By considering a set of $N$ anyonic oscillators ( non-local, intrinsic two-dimensional objects interpolating between fermionic and bosonic oscillators) on a two-dimensional lattice, we realize the $SU_q(N)$ quantum algebra by means of a generalized Schwinger construction. We find that the deformation parameter $q$ of the algebra is related to the anyonic statistical parameter $\nu$ by $q=exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$.
