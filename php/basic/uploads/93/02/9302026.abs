Title: Poincar√© Gauge Theory for Gravitational Forces in (1+1) Dimensions
Authors: Daniel Cangemi and Roman Jackiw
Abstract: We discuss in detail how string-inspired lineal gravity can be formulated as a gauge theory based on the centrally extended Poincar\'e group in $(1+1)$ dimensions. Matter couplings are constructed in a gauge invariant fashion, both for point particles and Fermi fields. A covariant tensor notation is developed in which gauge invariance of the formalism is manifest.
