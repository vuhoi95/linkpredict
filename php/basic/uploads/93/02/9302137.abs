Title: Harmonic BRST Quantization of Systems with Irreducible Holomorphic Boson  and Fermion Constraints
Authors: Theodore J. Allen and Dennis B. Crossley
Abstract: We show that the harmonic Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin method of quantizing bosonic systems with second-class constraints or first-class holomorphic constraints extends to systems having both bosonic and fermionic second-class or first-class holomorphic constraints. Using a limit argument, we show that the harmonic BRST modified path integral reproduces the correct Senjanovic measure.
