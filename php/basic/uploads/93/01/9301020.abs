Title: On the Mass of Two Dimensional Quantum Black Hole
Authors: Tsukasa TADA and Shozo UEHARA
Abstract: For the two dimensional dilaton-coupled quantum gravity model, we give the local black hole mass, which is an analogue of what was first introduced by Fischler, Morgan and Polchinski in the four dimensional gravitational systems. We analyze the original CGHS model with this local mass and find that the local mass is decreasing in the future direction on the matter shock-wave line, while it stays constant at past null infinity.
