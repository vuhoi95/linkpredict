Title: Is 2d Turbulence a Conformal Turbulence?
Authors: Gregory Falkovich and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: A critical analysis of the conformal approach to the theory of 2d turbulence is delivered. It is shown, in particular, that conformal minimal models cannot give a general turbulent solution, which should provide for constant fluxes of all vorticity integrals of motion.
