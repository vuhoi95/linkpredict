Title: Solvable lattice models labelled by Dynkin diagrams
Authors: Ole Warnaar and Bernard Nienhuis
Abstract: An equivalence between generalised restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models, associated with sets of graphs, and multi-colour loop models is established. As an application we consider solvable loop models and in this way obtain new solvable families of critical RSOS models. These families can all be classified by the Dynkin diagrams of the simply-laced Lie algebras. For one of the RSOS models, labelled by the Lie algebra pair (A$_L$,A$_L$) and related to the C$_2^{(1)}$ vertex model, we give an off-critical extension, which breaks the Z$_2$ symmetry of the Dynkin diagrams.
