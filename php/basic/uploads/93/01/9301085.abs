Title: On the Symmetry Algebra of the Discrete States in $d<2$ Closed String  Theory
Authors: Sudhakar Panda and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: The Symmetry charges associated with the Lian-Zuckerman states for $d<2$ closed string theory are constructed. Unlike in the open string case, it is shown here that the symmetry charges commute among themselves and act trivially on all the physical states.
