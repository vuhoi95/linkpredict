Title: Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles, elementary couplings and fusion rules
Authors: L. Begin and Anatol N. Kirillov and P. Mathieu and M. A. Walton
Abstract: We present a general scheme for describing su(N)_k fusion rules in terms of elementary couplings, using Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles. A fusion coupling is characterized by its corresponding tensor product coupling (i.e. its Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangle) and the threshold level at which it first appears. We show that a closed expression for this threshold level is encoded in the Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangle and an explicit method to calculate it is presented. In this way a complete solution of su(4)_k fusion rules is obtained.
