Authors: T. R. Govindarajan and R. Shankar and N. Shaji and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: Following our earlier work we argue in detail for the equivalence of the nonlinear $\sigma$ model with Hopf term at~$\theta=\pi/2s$ ~and an interacting spin-s theory. We give an ansatz for spin-s operators in the $\sigma$ model and show the equivalence of the correlation functions.We also show the relation between topological and Noether currents. We obtain the Lorentz and discrete transformation properties of the spin-s operator from the fields of the $\sigma$ model. We also explore the connection of this model with Quantum Hall Fluids.
