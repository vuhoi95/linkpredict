Title: Second Order Formalism for fermions: Anomalies and Species doubling on  the Laticce
Authors: J. L. Cortés and J. Gamboa and L. Velázquez
Abstract: A new formulation for fermions on the lattice based on a discretization of a second order formalism is proposed. A comparison with the first order formalism in connection with the $U(1)$ anomaly and the doubling problem is presented. The new formulation allows to eliminate half of the degrees of freedom, which can be important in non-perturbative calculations, and it can new possibities to the formulation of chiral gauge theories.
