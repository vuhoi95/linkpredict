Title: Entropy Production in the Cosmological Amplification of the Vacuum  Fluctuations
Authors: M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini
Abstract: We estimate the entropy associated to a background of squeezed cosmic gravitons, and we argue that the process of cosmological pair production from the vacuum may explain the large amount of entropy of our present universe.
