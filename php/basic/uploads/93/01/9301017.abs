Abstract: On simple cubic lattices, we compute low temperature series expansions for the energy, magnetization and susceptibility of the three-state Potts model in D=2 and D=3 to 45 and 39 excited bonds respectively, and the eight-state Potts model in D=2 to 25 excited bonds. We use a recursive procedure which enumerates states explicitly. We analyze the series using Dlog Pade analysis and inhomogeneous differential approximants.
