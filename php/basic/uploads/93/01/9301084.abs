Title: Yang-Baxter equation in spin chains with long range interactions
Authors: D. Bernard and M. Gaudin and F. D. M. Haldane and V. Pasquier
Abstract: We consider the $ su(n) $ spin chains with long range interactions and the spin generalization of the Calogero-Sutherland models. We show that their properties derive from a transfer matrix obeying the Yang-Baxter equation. We obtain the expression of the conserved quantities and we diagonalize them.
