Title: Integrability and Fusion Algebra for Quantum Mappings
Authors: F. W. Nijhoff and H. W. Capel
Abstract: We apply the fusion procedure to a quantum Yang-Baxter algebra associated with time-discrete integrable systems, notably integrable quantum mappings. We present a general construction of higher-order quantum invariants for these systems. As an important class of examples, we present the Yang-Baxter structure of the Gel'fand-Dikii mapping hierarchy, that we have introduced in previous papers, together with the corresponding explicit commuting family of quantum invariants.
