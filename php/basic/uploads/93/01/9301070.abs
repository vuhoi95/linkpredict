Title: Quasi-classical limit of Toda hierarchy and W-infinity symmetries
Authors: Kanehisa Takasaki and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: Previous results on quasi-classical limit of the KP hierarchy and its W-infinity symmetries are extended to the Toda hierarchy. The Planck constant $\hbar$ now emerges as the spacing unit of difference operators in the Lax formalism. Basic notions, such as dressing operators, Baker-Akhiezer functions and tau function, are redefined. $W_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the Toda hierarchy are realized by suitable rescaling of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiara-Miwa vertex operators. These symmetries are contracted to $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the dispersionless hierarchy through their action on the tau function. (A few errors in the earlier version is corrected.)
