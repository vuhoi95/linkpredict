Title: Exact Finite Size Results on the Ising Model in 2D Curved Space
Authors: J. Gonzalez and M. A. Martin-Delgado
Abstract: We propose an approach to statistical systems on lattices with sphere-like topology. Focusing on the Ising model, we consider the thermodynamic limit along a sequence of lattices which preserve the {\em fixed} large scale geometry. The hypothesis of scaling appears to hold at criticality, pointing at a sensible definition of the continuum limit of the model in the curved space.
