Title: Cabibbo Mixing in Superstring Derived Standard--like Models
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Edi Halyo
Abstract: We examine the problem of generation mixing in realistic superstring derived standard--like models, constructed in the free fermionic formulation. We study the possible sources of family mixing in these models . In a specific model we estimate the Cabibbo angle. We argue that a Cabibbo angle of the correct order of magnitude can be obtained in these models.
