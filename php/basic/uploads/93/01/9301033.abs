Title: String loop corrections to gauge and Yukawa couplings
Authors: I. Antoniadis and T. R. Taylor
Abstract: We report on the recent progress in computing the effective supergravity action from superstring scattering amplitudes beyond the tree approximation. We discuss the moduli-dependent string loop corrections to gauge, gravitational and Yukawa couplings.
