Title: Hiding Anomalies
Authors: F. De Jonghe and R. Siebelink and W. Troost
Abstract: Anomalies can be anticipated at the classical level without changing the classical cohomology, by introducing extra degrees of freedom. In the process, the anomaly does not quite disappear. We show that, in fact, it is shifted to new symmetries that come with the extra fields.
