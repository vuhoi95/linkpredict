Title: Integrable Supersymmetry Breaking Perturbations of N=1,2 Superconformal  Minimal Models
Authors: D. Depireux and P. Mathieu
Abstract: We display a new integrable perturbation for both N=1 and N=2 superconformal minimal models. These perturbations break supersymmetry explicitly. Their existence was expected on the basis of the classification of integrable perturbations of conformal field theories in terms of distinct classical KdV type hierarchies sharing a common second Hamiltonian structure.
