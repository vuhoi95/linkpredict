Title: A Positive Mass Theorem Based on the Focusing and Retardation of Null  Geodesics
Authors: R. Penrose and R. D. Sorkin and E. Woolgar
Abstract: A positive mass theorem for General Relativity Theory is proved. The proof is 4-dimensional in nature, and relies completely on arguments pertaining to causal structure, the basic idea being that positive energy-density focuses null geodesics, and correspondingly retards them, whereas a negative total mass would advance them. Because it is not concerned with what lies behind horizons, this new theorem applies in some situations not covered by previous positivity theorems. Also, because geodesic focusing is a global condition, the proof might allow a generalisation to semi-classical gravity, even though quantum violations of local energy conditions can occur there.
