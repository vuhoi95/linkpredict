Title: Topological 2-Dimensional Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Alain Dasnieres de Veigy and Stephane Ouvry
Abstract: We define a Chern- Simons Lagrangian for a system of planar particles topologically interacting at a distance. The anyon model appears as a particular case where all the particles are identical. We propose exact N-body eigenstates, set up a perturbative algorithm, discuss the case where some particles are fixed on a lattice, and also consider curved manifolds.
