Title: Braiding in Conformal Field Theory and Solvable Lattice Models
Authors: Doron Gepner and Jurgen Fuchs
Abstract: Braiding matrices in rational conformal field theory are considered. The braiding matrices for any two block four point function are computed, in general, using the holomorphic properties of the blocks and the holomorphic properties of rational conformal field theory. The braidings of $SU(N)_k$ with the fundamental are evaluated and are used as examples. Solvable interaction round the face lattice models are constructed from these braiding matrices, and their Boltzmann weights are given. This allows, in particular, for the derivation of the Boltzmann weights of such solvable height models.
