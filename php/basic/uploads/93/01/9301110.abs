Title: Neutron Acceleration in Uniform Electromagnetic Fields
Authors: J. Anandan and C. R. Hagen
Abstract: The question as to whether neutron acceleration can occur in uniform electromagnetic fields is examined. Although such an effect has been predicted using the canonical equations of motion some doubt has been raised recently as to whether it is in principle observable for a spin 1/2 particle. To resolve this issue a gedanken experiment is proposed and analyzed using a wave packet construction for the neutron beam. By allowing arbitrary orientation for the neutron spin as well as for the electric and magnetic fields a non vanishing acceleration of the center of the neutron wave packet is found which confirms the predictions of the canonical formalism.
