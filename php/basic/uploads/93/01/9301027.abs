Title: Physical States in Two-Dimensional Topological Gauge Theories
Authors: Yoshiaki Tanii and Masakazu Yamashita
Abstract: Physical states of two-dimensional topological gauge theories are studied using the BRST formalism in the light-cone gauge. All physical states are obtained for the abelian theory. There are an infinite number of physical states with different ghost numbers. Simple examples of physical states in a non-abelian theory are also given.
