Title: Nonlocal conservation laws in N=1,2 Supersymetric KdV equation
Authors: P. Dargis and P. Mathieu
Abstract: The \nl \cls for the N=1 supersymmetric KdV equation are shown to be related in a simple way to powers of the fourth root of its Lax operator. This provides a direct link between the supersymmetry invariance and the existence of \nl conservation laws. It is also shown that nonlocal conservation laws exist for the two integrable N=2 supersymmetric KdV equations whose recursion operator is known.
