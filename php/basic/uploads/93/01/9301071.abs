Title: Second Order Formalism for Fermions
Authors: J. L. Cortés and J. Gamboa and L. Velázquez
Abstract: A new formulation of fermions based on a second order action is proposed. An analysis of the $U(1)$ anomaly allows us to test the validity of the formalism at the quantum level. This formulation gives a new perpective to the introduction of parity non-invariant interactions.
