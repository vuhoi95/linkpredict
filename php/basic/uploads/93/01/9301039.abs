Title: Coinvariants of nilpotent subalgebras of the Virasoro algebra and  partition identities
Authors: Boris Feigin and Edward Frenkel
Abstract: We prove that the dimensions of coinvariants of certain nilpotent subalgebras of the Virasoro algebra do not change under deformation in the case of irreducible representations of (2,2r+1) minimal models. We derive a combinatorial description of these representations and the Gordon identities from this result.
