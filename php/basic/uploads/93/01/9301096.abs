Title: Quantum double of Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, its universal R-matrix and  their representations
Authors: Chang-Pu Sun and Mo-Lin Ge
Abstract: In this paper a new quasi-triangular Hopf algebra as the quantum double of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is presented.Its universal R-matrix is built and the corresponding representation theory are studied with the explict construction for the representations of this quantum double. \newpage
