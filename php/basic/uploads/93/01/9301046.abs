Title: Fermionic Sum Representations for Conformal Field Theory Characters
Authors: R. Kedem and T. R. Klassen and B. M. McCoy and E. Melzer
Abstract: We present sum representations for all characters of the unitary Virasoro minimal models. They can be viewed as fermionic companions of the Rocha-Caridi sum representations, the latter related to the (bosonic) Feigin-Fuchs-Felder construction. We also give fermionic representations for certain characters of the general $(G^{(1)})_k \times (G^{(1)})_l \over (G^{(1)})_{k+l}}$ coset conformal field theories, the non-unitary minimal models ${\cal M}(p,p+2)$ and ${\cal M}(p,kp+1)$, the $N$=2 superconformal series, and the $\ZZ_N$-parafermion theories, and relate the $q\to 1$ behaviour of all these fermionic sum representations to the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.
