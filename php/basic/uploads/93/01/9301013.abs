Title: "Are Black Holes in Brans-Dicke Theory precisely the same as in General  Relativity?"
Authors: M. Campanelli and C. O. Lousto
Abstract: We study a three-parameters family of solutions of the Brans-Dicke field equations. They are static and spherically symmetric. We find the range of parameters for which this solution represents a black hole different from the Schwarzschild one. We find a subfamily of solutions which agrees with experiments and observations in the solar system. We discuss some astrophysical applications and the consequences on the "no hair" theorems for black holes.
