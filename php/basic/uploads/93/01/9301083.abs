Title: Two dimensional black-hole as a topological coset model of c=1 string  theory
Authors: S. Mukhi and C. Vafa and E. Frenkel
Abstract: We show that a special superconformal coset (with $\hat c =3$) is equivalent to $c=1$ matter coupled to two dimensional gravity. This identification allows a direct computation of the correlation functions of the $c=1$ non-critical string to all genus, and at nonzero cosmological constant, directly from the continuum approach. The results agree with those of the matrix model. Moreover we connect our coset with a twisted version of a Euclidean two dimensional black hole, in which the ghost and matter systems are mixed.
