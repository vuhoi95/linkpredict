Title: String inspired effective Lagrangian and Inflationary Universe
Authors: E. Abdalla and A. C. V. V. de Siqueira
Abstract: We consider a string inspired effective Lagrangian for the graviton and dilaton, containing Einstein gravity at the zero slope limit. The numerical solution of the problem shows asymptotically an inflationary universe. The time is measured by the dilaton, as one expects. The result is independent of the introduction of ad-hoc self interactions for the dilaton field.
