Title: Off-critical $W_\infty$ and Virasoro Algebras As Dynamical Symmetries Of  the Integrable Models
Authors: Galen Sotkov and Marian Stanishkov
Abstract: We find an infinite set of new noncommuting conserved charges in a specific class of perturbed CFT's and present a criterion for their existence.They appear to be higher momenta of the already known commuting conserved currents.The algebra they close consists of two noncommuting$W_\infty$ algebras.We find various Virasoro subalgebras of the full symmetry algebra. It is shown on the examples of the perturbed Ising and Potts models that one of them plays an essencial role in the computation of the correlation functions of the fields of the theory.
