Title: A Solvable Model for Intersecting Loops
Authors: Bernard Nienhuis and Ronald Rietman
Abstract: We show that some models with non-local (and non-localizable) interactions have a property, called quasi-locality, which allows for the definition of a transfer matrix. We give the Yang-Baxter equation as a sufficient condition for the existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices and solve them for a loop model with intersections. This solvable model is then analyzed in some detail and its applications to a Lorentz gas are briefly discussed.
