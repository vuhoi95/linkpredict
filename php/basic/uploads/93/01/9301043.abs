Title: Multiple Mirror Manifolds and Topology Change in String Theory
Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Brian R. Greene and David R. Morrison
Abstract: We use mirror symmetry to establish the first concrete arena of spacetime topology change in string theory. In particular, we establish that the {\it quantum theories} based on certain nonlinear sigma models with topologically distinct target spaces can be smoothly connected even though classically a physical singularity would be encountered. We accomplish this by rephrasing the description of these nonlinear sigma models in terms of their mirror manifold partners--a description in which the full quantum theory can be described exactly using lowest order geometrical methods. We establish that, for the known class of mirror manifolds, the moduli space of the corresponding conformal field theory requires not just two but {\it numerous} topologically distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds for its geometric interpretation. A {\it single} family of continuously connected conformal theories thereby probes a host of topologically distinct geometrical spaces giving rise to {\it multiple mirror manifolds}.
