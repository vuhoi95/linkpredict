Title: On the Black Hole Background of Two-Dimensional String Theory
Authors: S. Chaudhuri and D. Minic
Abstract: The classical black hole background of two-dimensional string theory is examined after including the effect of the tachyon field. Keeping all terms upto $O(T^2)$, and making no other approximations, the only consistent classical solution to the resulting dilaton-graviton theory is found to be flat spacetime with a nontrivial dilaton.
