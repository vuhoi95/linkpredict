Title: Symmetry Aspects and Finite-Size Scaling of Quantum Hall Fluids
Authors: A. Cappelli and G. V. Dunne and C. A. Trugenberger and G. R. Zemba
Abstract: The exactness and universality observed in the quantum Hall effect suggests the existence of a symmetry principle underlying Laughlin's theory. We review the role played by the infinite $W_{\infty }$ and conformal algebras as dynamical symmetries of incompressible quantum fluids and show how they predict universal finite-size effects in the excitation spectrum.
