Title: Scaling behavior of quantum four-geometries
Authors: I. Antoniadis and P. O. Mazur and E. Mottola
Abstract: We propose that large quantum fluctuations of the conformal factor drastically modify classical general relativity at cosmological distance scales, resulting in a scale invariant phase of quantum gravity in the far infrared. We derive scaling relations for the partition function and physical observables in this conformal phase, and suggest quantitative tests of these relations in numerical simulations of simplicial four geometries with $S^4$ topology. In particular, we predict the form of the critical curve in the coupling constant plane, and determine the scaling of the Newtonian coupling with volume which permits a sensible continuum limit. The existing numerical results already provide some evidence of this new conformal invariant phase of quantum gravity.
