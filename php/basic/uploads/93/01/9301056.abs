Title: Quantum Groups, Correlation Functions and Infrared Divergences
Authors: Haye Hinrichsen and Vladimir Rittenberg
Abstract: We show in two simple examples that for one-dimensional quantum chains with quantum group symmetries, the correlation functions of local operators are, in general, infrared divergent. If one considers, however, correlation functions invariant under the quantum group, the divergences cancel out.
