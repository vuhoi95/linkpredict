Title: Path Spaces and W-Fusion in Minimal Models
Authors: J. Kellendonk and M. RÃ¶sgen and R. Varnhagen
Abstract: Product forms of characters of Virasoro minimal models are obtained which factorize into $(2,\odd)\times(3,\even)$ characters. These are related by generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities to sum forms allowing for a quasiparticle interpretation. The corresponding dilogarithm identities are given and the factorization is used to analyse the related path space structure as well as the fusion of the maximally extended chiral algebra.
