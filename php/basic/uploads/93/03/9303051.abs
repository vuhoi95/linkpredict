Title: On the BRST Operator of $W$-Strings
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and H. J. Boonstra and M. de Roo and S. Panda and A. Sevrin
Abstract: We discuss the conditions under which the BRST operator of a $W$-string can be written as the sum of two operators that are separately nilpotent and anticommute with each other. We illustrate our results with the example of the non-critical $W_3$-string. Furthermore, we apply our results to make a conjecture about a relationship between the spectrum of a non-critical $W_n$-string and a $W_{n-1}$-string.
