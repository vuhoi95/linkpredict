Title: Induced Chiral Supergravities in 2D
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Ulf Lindstrom
Abstract: We analyze actions for 2D supergravities induced by chiral conformal supermatter. The latter may be thought as described at the classical level by superspace actions invariant under super-reparametrization, super-Weyl and super-Lorentz transformations. Upon quantization various anomalies appear which characterize the non-trivial induced actions for the supergravitational sector. We derive these induced actions using a chiral boson to represent the chiral inducing matter. We show that they can be defined in a super-reparametrization invariant way, but with super-Weyl and super-Lorentz anomalies. We consider the case of $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ supergravities by working in their respective superspace formulations and investigate their quantization in the conformal gauge. The actions we consider arise naturally in off-critical heterotic and spinning strings. In the conformal gauge, they correspond to chiral extensions of the super-Liouville theory.
