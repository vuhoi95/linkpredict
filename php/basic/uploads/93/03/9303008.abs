Title: Correlation functions of quantum q-oscillators
Authors: V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and S. Solimeno and F. Zaccaria
Abstract: Nonlinearity of electromagnetic field vibrations described by q-oscillators is shown to produce essential dependence of second correlation functions on intensity and deformation of Planck distribution. Experimental tests of such nonlinearity are suggested.
