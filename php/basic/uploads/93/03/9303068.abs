Title: Supersymmetry and a Time-Dependent Landau System
Authors: V. Alan Kosteleck√Ω and V. I. Man'ko and Michael Martin Nieto and D. Rodney Truax
Abstract: A general technique is outlined for investigating supersymmetry properties of a charged spin-$\half$ quantum particle in time-varying electromagnetic fields. The case of a time-varying uniform magnetic induction is examined and shown to provide a physical realization of a supersymmetric quantum-mechanical system. Group-theoretic methods are used to factorize the relevant Schr\"odinger equations and obtain eigensolutions. The supercoherent states for this system are constructed.
