Authors: M. I. Polikarpov and U. -J. Wiese and M. A. Zubkov
Abstract: The partition function of the $4D$ lattice Abelian Higgs theory is represented as the sum over world sheets of Nielsen--Olesen strings. The creation and annihilation operators of the strings are constructed. The topological long--range interaction of the strings and charged particles is shown to exist; it is proportional to the linking number of the string world sheet and particle world trajectory.
