Title: Self-interacting scalar fields on spacetime with compact hyperbolic  spatial part
Authors: Andrei Bytsenko and Klaus Kirsten and Sergei Odintsov
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop effective potential of a self-interacting scalar field on the spacetime of the form $\reals^2\times H^2/\Gamma$. The Selberg trace formula associated with a co-compact discrete group $\Gamma$ in $PSL(2,\reals )$ (hyperbolic and elliptic elements only) is used. The closed form for the one-loop unrenormalized and renormalized effective potentials is given. The influence of non-trivial topology on curvature induced phase transitions is also discussed.
