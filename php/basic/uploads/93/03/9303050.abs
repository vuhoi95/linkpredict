Title: Conformal Turbulence with Boundary
Authors: B. K. Chung and Soonkeon Nam and Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: Based upon the formalism of conformal field theory with a boundary, we give a description of the boundary effect on fully developed two dimensional turbulence. Exact one and two point velocity correlation functions and energy power spectrum confined in the upper half plane are obtained using the image method. This result enables us to address the infrared problem of the theory of conformal turbulence.
