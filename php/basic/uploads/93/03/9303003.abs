Title: Unstable Modes in Three-Dimensional SU(2) Gauge Theory
Authors: P. Cea and L. Cosmai
Abstract: We investigate SU(2) gauge theory in a constant chromomagnetic field in three dimensions both in the continuum and on the lattice. Using a variational method to stabilize the unstable modes, we evaluate the vacuum energy density in the one-loop approximation. We compare our theoretical results with the outcomes of the numerical simulations.
