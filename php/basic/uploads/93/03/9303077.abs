Title: Abelian Anomalies in Nonlocal Regularization
Authors: M. A. Clayton and L. Demopoulos and J. W. Moffat
Abstract: Nonlocal regularization of QED is shown to possess an axial anomaly of the same form as other regularization schemes. The Noether current is explicitly constructed and the symmetries are shown to be violated, whereas the identities constructed when one properly considers the contribution from the path integral measure are respected. We also discuss the barrier to quantizing the fully gauged chiral invariant theory, and consequences.
