Title: Form Factors of the Elementary Field in the Bullough-Dodd Model
Authors: A. Fring and G. Mussardo and P. Simonetti
Abstract: We derive the recursive equations for the form factors of the local hermitian operators in the Bullough-Dodd model. At the self-dual point of the theory, the form factors of the fundamental field of the Bullough-Dodd model are equal to those of the fundamental field of the Sinh-Gordon model at a specific value of the coupling constant.
