Title: Equivalent models for gauged WZW theory
Authors: Haruhiko Terao and Kiyonori Yamada
Abstract: We modify the $SL(2,{\bf R})/U(1)$ WZW theory, which was shown to describe strings in a 2D black hole, to be invariant under chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry by introducing a Steukelberg field. We impose several interesting gauge conditions for the chiral $U(1)$ symmetry. In a paticular gauge the theory is found to be reduced to the Liouville theory coupled to the $c=1$ matter perturbed by the so-called black hole mass operator. Also we discuss the physical states in the models briefly.
