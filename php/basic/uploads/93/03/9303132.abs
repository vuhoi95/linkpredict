Title: Study of Quommutators of Quantum Variables and Generalized Derivatives
Authors: D. B. Fairlie and J. Nuyts
Abstract: A general deformation of the Heisenberg algebra is introduced with two deformed operators instead of just one. This is generalised to many variables, and permits the simultaneous existence of coherent states, and the transposition of creation operators.
