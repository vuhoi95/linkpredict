Title: Symplectic structures associated to Lie-Poisson groups
Authors: A. Yu. Alekseev and A. Z. Malkin
Abstract: The Lie-Poisson analogues of the cotangent bundle and coadjoint orbits of a Lie group are considered. For the natural Poisson brackets the symplectic leaves in these manifolds are classified and the corresponding symplectic forms are described. Thus the construction of the Kirillov symplectic form is generalized for Lie-Poisson groups.
