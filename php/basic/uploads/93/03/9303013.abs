Abstract: We review recent results concerning the representation of conformal field theory characters in terms of fermionic quasi-particle excitations, and describe in detail their construction in the case of the integrable three-state Potts chain. These fermionic representations are $q$-series which are generalizations of the sums occurring in the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
