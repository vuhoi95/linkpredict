Title: Amplitude Zeroes in Collinear Processes or What Is Left from a  Factorizable 2d Model in Higher Dimensions
Authors: G. Gat and B. Rosenstein
Abstract: We show that for collinear processes, i.e. processes where the incoming and outgoing momenta are aligned along the same line, the S-matrix of the tree level 2+1 dimensional Thirring model factorizes: any S - matrix element is a product of $2\rightarrow 2$ elements. In particular this means nullification of all collinear $2 \rightarrow n$ amplitudes for $n > 2$.
