Title: Systematic Differential Renormalization to All Orders
Authors: J. I. Latorre and C. Manuel and X. Vilasis-Cardona
Abstract: We present a systematic implementation of differential renormalization to all orders in perturbation theory. The method is applied to individual Feynamn graphs written in coordinate space. After isolating every singularity. which appears in a bare diagram, we define a subtraction procedure which consists in replacing the core of the singularity by its renormalized form givenby a differential formula. The organizationof subtractions in subgraphs relies in Bogoliubov's formula, fulfilling the requirements of locality, unitarity and Lorentz invariance. Our method bypasses the use of an intermediate regularization andautomatically delivers renormalized amplitudes which obey renormalization group equations.
