Title: A Four-Reggeon Vertex for ${\bf Z}_3$ Twisted Fermionic Fields
Authors: Niclas Engberg and Bengt E. W. Nilsson
Abstract: Using operator sewing techniques we construct the Reggeon vertex involving four external ${\bf Z}_3$-twisted complex fermionic fields. Generalizing a procedure recently applied to the ordinary Ramond four-vertex, we deduce the closed form of the ${\bf Z}_3$ vertex by demanding it to reproduce the results obtained by sewing.
