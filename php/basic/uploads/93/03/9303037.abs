Abstract: We obtain some new results on classical solutions of two dimensional Euclidean sigma models. From earlier work of Din-Zakrzewski, Glaser-Stora, and numerous differential geometers, one knows explicit solutions in the case of the $S^n$-model, the $CP^n$-model, and the $U(n)$-model. However, very little is known about the "moduli space" of solutions itself. In this paper we study the connected components of these spaces. In a subsequent paper (with M. Furuta and M. Kotani), we compute the fundamental group, in the case of the $S^n$-model.
