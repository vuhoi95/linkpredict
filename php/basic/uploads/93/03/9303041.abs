Title: Observing 4D Baby Universes in Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and S. Jain and J. Jurkiewicz and C. F. Kristjansen
Abstract: We measure the fractal structure of four dimensional simplicial quantum gravity by identifying so-called baby universes. This allows an easy determination of the critical exponent $\g$ connected to the entropy of four-dimensional manifolds.
