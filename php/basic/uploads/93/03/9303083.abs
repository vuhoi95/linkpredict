Title: On the Dirac Quantization of two Dimensional Gravity
Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and F. P. Devecchi and E. Abdalla
Abstract: We discuss the Dirac quantization of two dimensional gravity with bosonic matter fields. After defining the extended Hamiltonian it is possible to fix the gauge completely. The commutators can all be obtained in closed form; nevertheless, the results are not particularly simple.
