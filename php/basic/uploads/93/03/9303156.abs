Title: Twistor--like Formulation of the Supermembrane in D=11 $^*$
Authors: P. Pasti and M. Tonin
Abstract: We propose a new formulation of the D=11 supermembrane theory that involves commuting spinors (twistor--like variables) and exhibits a manifest $n$--extended world volume supersymmetry $(1\leq n\leq 8)$. This supersymmetry replaces $n$ components of the usual $\kappa$--symmetry. We show that this formulation is classically equivalent to the standard one.
