Title: Large N Limit in the Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: A. Cappelli and C. A. Trugenberger and G. R. Zemba
Abstract: The Laughlin states for $N$ interacting electrons at the plateaus of the fractional Hall effect are studied in the thermodynamic limit of large $N$. It is shown that this limit leads to the semiclassical regime for these states, thereby relating their stability to their semiclassical nature. The equivalent problem of two-dimensional plasmas is solved analytically, to leading order for $N\to\infty$, by the saddle point approximation - a two-dimensional extension of the method used in random matrix models of quantum gravity and gauge theories. To leading order, the Laughlin states describe classical droplets of fluids with uniform density and sharp boundaries, as expected from the Laughlin ``plasma analogy''. In this limit, the dynamical $W_\infty$-symmetry of the quantum Hall states expresses the kinematics of the area-preserving deformations of incompressible liquid droplets.
