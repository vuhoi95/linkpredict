Title: Quantum gauging from classical gauging of nonlinear algebras
Authors: A. Sevrin and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We extend the theory of the gauging of classical quadratically nonlinear algebras without a central charge but with a coset structure, to the quantum level. Inserting the minimal anomalies into the classical transformation rules of the currents introduces further quantum corrections to the classical transformation rules of the gauge fields and currents which additively renormalize the structure constants. The corresponding Ward identities are the c -> infinity limit of the full quantum Ward identities, and reveal that the c -> infinity limit of the quantum gauge algebra closes on fields and currents. Two examples are given.
