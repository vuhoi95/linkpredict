Title: Lattice analogues of W-algebras and Classical Integrable Equations
Authors: Alexander A. Belov and Karen D. Chaltikian
Abstract: We propose a regular way to construct lattice versions of $W$-algebras, both for quantum and classical cases. In the classical case we write the algebra explicitly and derive the lattice analogue of Boussinesq equation from the Hamiltonian equations of motion. Connection between the lattice Faddeev-Takhtadjan-Volkov algebra [1] and q-deformed Virasoro is also discussed.
