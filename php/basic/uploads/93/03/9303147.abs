Title: Energy Momentum Tensor of the Evaporating Black Hole and Local  Bogoljubov Transformations
Authors: S. Massar and R. Parentani and R. Brout
Abstract: The method of Hawking to obtain black hole evaporation through Bogoljubov transformation between asymptotic modes (in and out) is generalized. The construction is local in that the in modes (of say positive frequency) are decomposed by Bogoljubov transformation into positive and negative frequency local inertial modes (i.e. those which are solutions of the d'Alembertian in terms of the local normal coordinates). From this follows an interesting reexpression of the local energy momentum tensor, more particularly of the outgoing energy flux. One finds that even in the local description there exists a partial thermal character parametrized by a local temperature. There exists quantum interference effects as well. These become negligible at large distance from the black hole.
