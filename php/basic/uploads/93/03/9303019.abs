Title: Honeycomb lattice solvable models
Authors: Kyung-Hoon Kwon and Doochul Kim
Abstract: We construct solvable models on the honeycomb lattice by combining three faces of the square lattice solvable models into a hexagon face. These models contain two independent, anisotropy controlling, spectral parameters and their transfer matrices with different spectral parameters commute with each other. At the critical point, the finite-size scaling of the transfer matrix spectrum for the honeycomb lattice models is written in terms of the quantities obtained from the finite-size scaling of the square lattice solvable models. We study in detail the phase transition properties of two models based on the interacting hard square model and the magnetic hard square model, respectively. The models, in general, can be extended to the IRF version of the Z-invariant models of Baxter.
