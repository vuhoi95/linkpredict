Title: Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Taejin Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We propose a classical model for the non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to $N$ point-like sources and quantize the system using the BRST technique. The resulting quantum mechanics provides a unified framework for fractional spin, braid statistics and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation.
