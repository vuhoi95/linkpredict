Title: Charge screening in the Higgs phase of Chern-Simons electrodynamics
Authors: F. Alexander Bais and A. Morozov and M. de Wild Propitius
Abstract: Though screened at large distances, a point-like electric charge can still participate in a long-range electromagnetic interaction in the Higgs phase, namely that with the Aharonov-Bohm field produced by a localized magnetic flux. We show that this follows from the fact that the screening charge, induced in the presence of a Higgs condensate, does not interact with the Aharonov-Bohm field. The same phenomenon occurs, if a Chern-Simons term is incorporated in the action. This observation provides a physical basis for the recently proposed classification of the superselection sectors of this model in terms of a quasi-Hopf algebra.
