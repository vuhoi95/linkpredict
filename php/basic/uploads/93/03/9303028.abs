Title: The trace of the heat kernel on a compact hyperbolic 3-orbifold
Authors: Guido Cognola and Luciano Vanzo
Abstract: The heat coefficients related to the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the hyperbolic compact manifold $H^3/\Ga$ are evaluated in the case in which the discrete group $\Ga$ contains elliptic and hyperbolic elements. It is shown that while hyperbolic elements give only exponentially vanishing corrections to the trace of the heat kernel, elliptic elements modify all coefficients of the asymptotic expansion, but the Weyl term, which remains unchanged. Some physical consequences are briefly discussed in the examples.
