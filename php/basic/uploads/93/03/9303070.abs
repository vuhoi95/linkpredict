Title: Collective fermionic excitations in systems with a large chemical  potential
Authors: Jean-Paul Blaizot and Jean-Yves Ollitrault
Abstract: We study fermionic excitations in a cold ultrarelativistic plasma. We construct explicitly the quantum states associated with the two branches which develop in the excitation spectrum as the chemical potential is raised. The collective nature of the long wavelength excitations is clearly exhibited. Email contact: ollie@amoco.saclay.cea.fr
