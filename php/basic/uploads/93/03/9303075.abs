Title: The free energy of the Potts model: from the continuous to the  first-order transition region
Authors: T. Bhattacharya and R. Lacaze and A. Morel
Abstract: We present a large $q$ expansion of the 2d $q$-states Potts model free energies up to order 9 in $1/\sqrt{q}$. Its analysis leads us to an ansatz which, in the first-order region, incorporates properties inferred from the known critical regime at $q=4$, and predicts, for $q>4$, the $n^{\rm th}$ energy cumulant scales as the power $(3 n /2-2)$ of the correlation length. The parameter-free energy distributions reproduce accurately, without reference to any interface effect, the numerical data obtained in a simulation for $q=10$ with lattices of linear dimensions up to L=50. The pure phase specific heats are predicted to be much larger, at $q\leq10$, than the values extracted from current finite size scaling analysis of extrema. Implications for safe numerical determinations of interface tensions are discussed.
