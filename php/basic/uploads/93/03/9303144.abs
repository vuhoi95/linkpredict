Title: A Candidate for Exact Continuum Dual Theory for Scalar QED$_3$
Authors: A. Kovner and P. Kurzepa and B. Rosenstein
Abstract: We discuss a possible exact equivalence of the Abelian Higgs model and a scalar theory of a magnetic vortex field in 2+1 dimensions. The vortex model has a current - current interaction and can be viewed as a strong coupling limit of a massive vector theory. The fixed point structure of the theory is discussed and mapped into fixed points of the Higgs model.
