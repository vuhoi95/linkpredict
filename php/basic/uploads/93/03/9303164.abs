Title: On the BRST structure of W_3 gravity coupled to c=2 matter
Authors: P. Bouwknegt and J. McCarthy and K. Pilch
Abstract: We present some explicit results on the structure of singular vectors in $c=2$ Verma modules of the $\cW_3$ algebra. Using the embedding patterns of those vectors we construct resolutions for the $c=2$ irreducible modules, and thus are able to compute some of the BRST cohomology of $\cW_3$ gravity coupled to $c=2$ matter. In particular, we determine the states in the ground ring of the theory. (To appear in the proceedings of the AMS Special Session on "Geometry and Physics", USC, Los Angeles, November 5-6, 1992)
