Title: Higher-Derivative Supersymmetry and the Witten Index
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and M. V. Ioffe and V. P. Spiridonov
Abstract: Higher-derivative generalization of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics is proposed. It is formally based on the standard superalgebra but supercharges involve differential operators of the order $n$. As a result, their anticommutator entails polynomial of a Hamiltonian. The Witten index does not characterize spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in such models.
