Title: 2D Dilaton-Maxwell Gravity as a Fixed Point of the Renormalization Group
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. Naftulin and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: A general model of dialton-Maxwell gravity in two dimensions is investigated. The corresponding one-loop effective action and the generalized $\beta$-functions are obtained. A set of models that are fixed points of the renormalization group equations are presented.
