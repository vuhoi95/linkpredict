Title: On the relation between integrability and infinite-dimensional algebras
Authors: M. D. Freeman and P. West
Abstract: We review our work on the relation between integrability and infinite-dimensional algebras. We first consider the question of what sets of commuting charges can be constructed from the current of a \mbox{\sf U}(1) Kac-Moody algebra. It emerges that there exists a set $S_n$ of such charges for each positive integer $n>1$; the corresponding value of the central charge in the Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is $c=13-6n-6/n$. The charges in each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional \W-algebra. We show that the \W-algebras that arise in this way are symmetries of Liouville theory for special values of the coupling. We then exhibit a relationship between the \nls equation and the KP hierarchy. From this it follows that there is a relationship between the \nls equation and the algebra \Wi. These examples provide evidence for our conjecture that the phenomenon of integrability is intimately linked with properties of infinite dimensional algebras.
