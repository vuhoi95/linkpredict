Title: Quantum properties of the polytopic action in some simple geometries
Authors: E. Alvarez and J. Cespedes and E. Verdaguer
Abstract: The partition function corresponding to the "polytopic" action, a new action for the gravitational interaction which we have proposed recently, is computed in the simplest two-dimensional geometries of genus zero and one. The functional integral over the Liouville field is approximated by an ordinary integral over the constant zero mode. We study the dependence on both the coupling constant and the cosmological constant, and compare with recent scaling results in standard 2D quantum gravity.
