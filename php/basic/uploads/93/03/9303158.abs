Title: Couplings for Compactifications
Authors: P. Berglund and T. HÃ¼bsch
Abstract: A general formula is obtained for Yukawa couplings in compactification on \LGO{s} and corresponding \CY\ spaces. Up to the kinetic term normalizations, this equates the classical Koszul ring structure with the \LGO\ chiral ring structure and the true super\CFT\ ring structure.
