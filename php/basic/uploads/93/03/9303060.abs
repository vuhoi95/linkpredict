Title: Neutrino Masses in Superstring Derived Standard--like Models
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Edi Halyo
Abstract: We propose a new scenario in a class of superstring derived standard--like models that explains the suppression of the left--handed neutrino masses. Due to nonrenormalizable terms and the breaking of the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ symmetry a generalized see--saw mechanism takes place. Contrary to the traditional see--saw mechanism in GUTs, the see--saw scale and the right--handed neutrino mass scale are suppressed relative to the $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ breaking scale.
