Title: Combinatorial Invariants from Four Dimensional Lattice Models
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Mark Rakowski
Abstract: We study the subdivision properties of certain lattice gauge theories based on the groups $Z_{2}$ and $Z_{3}$, in four dimensions. The Boltzmann weights are shown to be invariant under all type $(k,l)$ subdivision moves, at certain discrete values of the coupling parameter. The partition function then provides a combinatorial invariant of the underlying simplicial complex, at least when there is no boundary. We also show how an extra phase factor arises when comparing Boltzmann weights under the Alexander moves, where the boundary undergoes subdivision.
