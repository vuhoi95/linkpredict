Title: Model-Independent Analysis of Soft Terms in Effective Supergravity and  in String Theory
Authors: Vadim Kaplunovsky and Jan Louis
Abstract: We discuss supersymmetry breakdown in effective supergravities such as emerge in the low-energy limit of superstring theory. Without specifying the precise trigger of the breakdown, we analyse the soft parameters in the Lagrangian of the supersymmetrized Standard Model.
