Title: Thermalisation of Longitudinal Gluons
Authors: P V Landshoff and A Rebhan
Abstract: In the usual real-time finite-temperature gauge theory both the physical and the unphysical degrees of freedom are thermalised. We discuss the alternative approach where only the physical transverse components of the gauge field have bare thermal propagators, whereas the unphysical degrees of freedom are not heated. We show how pinch singularities are avoided: sometimes this requires resummation. If only the hard thermal loop is included in the resummation, the spatially-longitudinal component of the gauge field, which contains an extra collective plasmon mode, becomes fully thermalised, though the Faddeev-Popov ghost and the remaining unphysical component of the gauge field remain frozen.
