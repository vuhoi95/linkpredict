Title: Symmetry and Observables in Induced QCD
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Nathan Weiss
Abstract: We review some of the basic features of the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD. We emphasize the role of $Z_N$ symmetry in determining the observable properties of the model and also argue that it can be broken explicitly without ruining the solvability of induced QCD in the infinite $N$ limit. We outline the sort of critical behavior which the master field must have in order that the model is still solvable. We also review some aspects of the $D=1$ version of the model where the partition function can be obtained analytically.
