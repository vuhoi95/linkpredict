Title: Baby universes in 2d quantum gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and S. Jain and G. Thorleifsson
Abstract: We investigate the fractal structure of $2d$ quantum gravity, both for pure gravity and for gravity coupled to multiple gaussian fields and for gravity coupled to Ising spins. The roughness of the surfaces is described in terms of baby universes and using numerical simulations we measure their distribution which is related to the string susceptibility exponent $\g_{string}$.
