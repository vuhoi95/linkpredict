Title: SUSY in the sky
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and R. H. Rietdijk and J. W. van Holten
Abstract: Spinning particles in curved space-time can have fermionic symmetries generated by the square root of bosonic constants of motion other than the Hamiltonian. We present a general analysis of the conditions under which such new supersymmetries appear, and discuss the Poisson-Dirac algebra of the resulting set of charges, including the conditions of closure of the new algebra. An example of a new non-trivial supersymmetry is found in black-hole solutions of the Kerr-Newman type and corresponds to the Killing-Yano tensor, which plays an important role in solving the Dirac equation in these black-hole metrics.
