Title: On pq-duality and explicit solutions in $c \le 1$ $2d$ gravity models
Authors: S. Kharchev and A. Marshakov
Abstract: We study the integral representation for the exact solution to nonperturbative $c le 1$ string theory. A generic solution is determined by two functions $W(x)$ and $Q(x)$ which behaive at infinity like $x^p$ and $x^q$ respectively. The integral model for arbitrary $(p,q)$ models is derived which explicitely demonstrates $p-q$ duality of minimal models coupled to gravity. We discuss also the exact solutions to string equation and reduction condition and present several explicit examples.
