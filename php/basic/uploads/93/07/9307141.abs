Title: Off-Critical Lattice Analogues of $N=2$ Supersymmetric Quantum  Integrable Models
Authors: D. Nemeschansky and N. P. Warner
Abstract: We obtain off-critical (elliptic) Boltzmann weights for lattice models whose continuum limits correspond to massive, $N=2$ supersymmetric, quantum integrable field theories. We also compute the free energies of these models and show that they are analytic in the region of parameter space where we believe that the supersymmetry is unbroken. While the supersymmetry is not directly realized on the lattice, there is still a very close connection between the models described here and topological lattice models. A simple example is discussed in detail and some corner transfer matrix computations are also presented.
