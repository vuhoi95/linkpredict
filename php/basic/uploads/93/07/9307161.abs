Title: The Canonical Symmetry for Integrable Systems
Authors: A. N. Leznov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: The properties of discrete nonlinear symmetries of integrable equations are investigated. These symmetries are shown to be canonical transformations. On the basis of the considered examples, it is concluded, that the densities of the conservation laws are changed under these transformations by spatial divergencies.
