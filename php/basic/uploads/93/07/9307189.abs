Title: Extended Superconformal Algebras and Free Field Realizations from  Hamiltonian Reduction
Authors: K. Ito and J. O. Madsen and J. L. Petersen
Abstract: We develop the method of the hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie superalgebras to obtain explicit and general expressions both for the classical and the quantum extended superconformal algebras. By performing the gauge transformation which connects the diagonal gauge with the Drinfeld-Sokolov gauge and considering the quantum corrections, we get generic expressions for the classical and quantum free field realizations of the algebras.
