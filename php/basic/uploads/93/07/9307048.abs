Title: Abelian Current Algebra and the Virasoro Algebra on the Lattice
Authors: L. Faddeev and A. Yu. Volkov
Abstract: We describe how a natural lattice analogue of the abelian current algebra combined with free discrete time dynamics gives rise to the lattice Virasoro algebra and corresponding hierarchy of conservation laws.
