Title: The vacuum preserving Lie algebra of a classical W-algebra
Authors: L. Feher and L. O'Raifeartaigh and I. Tsutsui
Abstract: We simplify and generalize an argument due to Bowcock and Watts showing that one can associate a finite Lie algebra (the `classical vacuum preserving algebra') containing the M\"obius $sl(2)$ subalgebra to any classical $\W$-algebra. Our construction is based on a kinematical analysis of the Poisson brackets of quasi-primary fields. In the case of the $\W_\S^\G$-algebra constructed through the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction based on an arbitrary $sl(2)$ subalgebra $\S$ of a simple Lie algebra $\G$, we exhibit a natural isomorphism between this finite Lie algebra and $\G$ whereby the M\"obius $sl(2)$ is identified with $\S$.
