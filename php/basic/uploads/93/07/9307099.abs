Title: Quasi Exactly Solvable 2$\times$2 Matrix Equations
Authors: Y. Brihaye and P. Kosinski
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which systems of two differential eigenvalue equations are quasi exactly solvable. These systems reveal a rich set of algebraic structures. Some of them are explicitely described. An exemple of quasi exactly system is studied which provides a direct counterpart of the Lam\'e equation.
