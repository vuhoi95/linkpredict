Title: Fermionic Field Theory and Gauge Interactions on Random Lattices
Authors: C. J. Griffin and T. D. Kieu
Abstract: Random-lattice fermions have been shown to be free of the doubling problem if there are no interactions or interactions of a non-gauge nature. However, gauge interactions impose stringent constraints as expressed by the Ward-Takahashi identities which could revive the free-field suppressed doubler modes in loop diagrams. After introducing a formulation for fermions on a new kind of random lattice, we compare random, naive and Wilson fermions in two dimensional Abelian background gauge theory. We show that the doublers are revived for random lattices in the continuum limit, while demonstrating that gauge invariance plays the critical role in this revival. Some implications of the persistent doubling phenomenon on random lattices are also discussed.
