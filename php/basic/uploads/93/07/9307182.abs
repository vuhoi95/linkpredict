Title: Charge-monopole versus Gravitational Scattering at Planckian Energies
Authors: Saurya Das and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: The amplitude for the scattering of a point magnetic monopole and a point charge, at centre-of-mass energies much larger than the masses of the particles, and in the limit of low momentum transfer, is shown to be proportional to the (integer-valued) monopole strength, assuming the Dirac quantization condition for the monopole-charge system. It is demonstrated that, for small momentum transfer, charge-monopole electromagnetic effects remain comparable to those due to the gravitational interaction between the particles even at Planckian centre-of-mass energies.
