Title: Large-N Collective Field Theory Applied to Anyons in Magnetic Fields
Authors: H. Hiro-Oka and H. Minakata
Abstract: We present a large-$N$ collective field formalism for anyons in external magnetic fields interacting with arbitrary two-body potential. We discuss how the Landau level is reproduced in our framework. We apply it to the soluble model for anyons proposed by Girvin et al., and obtain the dispersion relation of collective modes for arbitrary statistical parameters.
