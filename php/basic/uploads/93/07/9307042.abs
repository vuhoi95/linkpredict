Title: Conjectures on Non-Local Effects in String Black Holes
Authors: B. Harms and Y. Leblanc
Abstract: We consider modifications to general relativity by the non-local (classical and quantum) string effects for the case of a D-dimensional Scwarzschild black hole. The classical non-local effects do not alter the spacetime topology (the horizon remains unshifted, at least perturbatively). We suggest a simple analytic continuation of the perturbative result into the non-perturbative domain, which eliminates the black hole singularity at the origin and yields an ultraviolet-finite theory of quantum gravity. We investigate the quantum non- local effects (including massive modes) and argue that the inclusion of these back reactions resolves the problem of the thermal spectrum in the semi- classical approach of field quantization in a black hole background, through the bootstrap condition. The density of states for both the quantum and thermal interpretation of the WKB formula are finally shown to differ quant- itatively when including the non-local effects.
