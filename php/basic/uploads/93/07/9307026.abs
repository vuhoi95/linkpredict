Title: Quadratic brackets from symplectic forms
Authors: Anton Alekseev and Ivan Todorov
Abstract: We give a physicist oriented survey of Poisson-Lie symmetries of classical systems. We consider finite dimensional geometric actions and the chiral WZNW model as examples for the general construction. An essential point is that quadratic Poisson bracets appear for group--like variables. It is believed that after quantization they lead to quadratic exchange algebras.
