Title: Constraints on discrete symmetries from anomaly cancellation in  compactified superstring theories
Authors: Graham G. Ross and Christoph M. A. Scheich
Abstract: Compactified string theories give rise to discrete symmetries which are essential if they are to provide a realistic low energy theory. We find that in a class of four dimensional string theories these symmetries are constrained by similar conditions to those discrete anomaly cancellation conditions found in the case the discrete symmetry is a residue of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry. Such conditions strongly constrain the allowed form of the low energy effective theory.
