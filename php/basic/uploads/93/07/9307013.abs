Title: Effective Theory of a Chiral Superfluid
Authors: Pietro Donatis and Roberto Iengo
Abstract: We consider an effective Lagrangian describing a fluid living on two-di\-men\-sio\-nal planes. The fluid self-interacts through a Chern-Simons vector potential, whose field strength is proportional to the density fluctuation. This effective Lagrangian can be related to the Anyon mean field, but can also be considered more generally to describe a universality class of superfluids and, when charged, of superconductors. We study the relevant physical properties, including the spectrum, the chirality features appearing in the polarization of scattered EM waves, and the peculiar response under a magnetic field, i.e. a peculiar kind of anisotropic Meissner effect.
