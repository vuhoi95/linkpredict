Title: Recovery of information from black hole radiation by considering  stimulated emission
Authors: R. Mueller and Carlos O. Lousto
Abstract: We deal with the black hole information loss paradox by showing that the stimulated emission component of the black hole radiation contains information about the initial state of the system. The nonlocal behaviour that allows the recovery of information about the matter that falls behind the horizon appears in a natural way. We calculate the expectation value and probability distribution of particles at ${\cal J}^+$ for a non-vacuum initial state. The entropy of the final state is compared to that of a thermal state with the same energy per mode. We find that the information recovered about the initial state increases with the number $r$ of the initially incoming particles, reaching for example over 30\% for $r = 1000$. We point out that recovering information about the initial state, nevertheless, does not automatically imply the purity of the final state.
