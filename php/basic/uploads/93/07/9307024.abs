Title: Quantum Squeezing and Cosmological Entropy Production
Authors: M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini
Abstract: The entropy growth in a cosmological process of pair production is completely determined by the associated squeezing parameter, and is insensitive to the number of particles in the initial state. The total produced entropy may represent a significant fraction of the entropy stored today in the cosmic black-body radiation, provided pair production originates from a change in the background metric at a curvature scale of the Planck order.
