Title: ADE string vacua with discrete torsion
Authors: M. Kreuzer and H. Skarke
Abstract: We complete the classification of (2,2) string vacua that can be constructed by diagonal twists of tensor products of minimal models with ADE invariants. Using the \LG\ framework, we compute all spectra from inequivalent models of this type. The completeness of our results is only possible by systematically avoiding the huge redundancies coming from permutation symmetries of tensor products. We recover the results for (2,2) vacua of an extensive computation of simple current invariants by Schellekens and Yankielowitz, and find 4 additional mirror pairs of spectra that were missed by their stochastic method. For the model $(1)^9$ we observe a relation between redundant spectra and groups that are related in a particular way.
