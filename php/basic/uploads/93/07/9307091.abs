Title: Solutions of Conformal Turbulence on a Half Plane
Authors: B. K. Chung and Soonkeon Nam and Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: Exact solutions of conformal turbulence restricted on a upper half plane are obtained. We show that the inertial range of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with constant enstrophy flux develops in a distant region from the boundary. Thus in the presence of an anisotropic boundary, these exact solutions of turbulence generalize Kolmogorov's solution consistently and differ from the Polyakov's bulk case which requires a fine tunning of coefficients. The simplest solution in our case is given by the minimal model of $p=2, q=33$ and moreover we find a fixed point of solutions when $p,q$ become large.
