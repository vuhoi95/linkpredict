Title: A Coherent Understanding of Solvable Models for Quantum Measurement  Processes
Authors: Hiromichi Nakazato and Saverio Pascazio
Abstract: By making use of Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum, we put forward an interesting connection among three solvable Hamiltonians, widely used for discussions on the quantum measurement problem. This connection implies that a particular macroscopic limit has to be taken for these models to be physically sensible.
