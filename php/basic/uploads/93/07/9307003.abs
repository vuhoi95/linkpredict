Title: Massive Vector Chern-Simons Gravity
Authors: C. Aragone and P. J. Arias and A. Khoudeir
Abstract: We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einstein action augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topological term.This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It is diffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has been spontaneously broken.
