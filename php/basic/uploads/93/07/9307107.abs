Title: Level-Rank Duality of WZW Theories and Isomorphisms of N=2 Coset Models
Authors: J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: Mappings between certain infinite series of N=2 superconformal coset models are constructed. They make use of level-rank dualities for B, C and D type theories. While the WZW level-rank dualities do not constitute isomorphisms of the theories, they lead to level-rank dualities of N=2 coset models that preserve the cft properties in such a manner that the coset models related by duality are expected to be isomorphic as conformal field theories. The construction also gives some further insight in the nature of the resolution of field identification fixed points of coset theories.
