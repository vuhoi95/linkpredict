Title: String Unification and Threshold Corrections
Authors: P. Mayr and H. P. Nilles and S. Stieberger
Abstract: The interpretation of the apparent unification of gauge couplings within supersymmetric theories depends on uncertainties induced through heavy particle thresholds. While in standard grand unified theories these effects can be estimated easily, the corresponding calculations are quite complicated in string unified theories and do exist only in models with unbroken $E_6$. We present results for heavy particle thresholds in more realistic models with gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. Effects of Wilson line background fields as well as the universal part of the (rather mild) threshold corrections indicate a strong model dependence. We discuss the consequences of our results for the idea of string unification without a grand unified gauge group.
