Title: Symplectic Structure of 2D Dilaton Gravity
Authors: A. Mikovic and M. Navarro
Abstract: We analyze the symplectic structure of two-dimensional dilaton gravity by evaluating the symplectic form on the space of classical solutions. The case when the spatial manifold is compact is studied in detail. When the matter is absent we find that the reduced phase space is a two-dimensional cotangent bundle and determine the Hilbert space of the quantum theory. In the non-compact case the symplectic form is not well defined due to an unresolved ambiguity in the choice of the boundary terms.
