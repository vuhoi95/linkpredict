Title: Chiral Hierarchies, Compositeness and the Renormalization Group
Authors: W. A. Bardeen and C. T. Hill and D. -U. Jungnickel
Abstract: A wide class of models involve the fine--tuning of significant hierarchies between a strong--coupling ``compositeness'' scale, and a low energy dynamical symmetry breaking scale. We examine the issue of whether such hierarchies are generally endangered by Coleman--Weinberg instabilities. A careful study using perturbative two--loop renormalization group methods finds that consistent large hierarchies are not generally disallowed.
