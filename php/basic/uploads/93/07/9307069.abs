Title: On the Necessity of Rational Velocities: a Gedankenexperiment
Authors: M. C. Nemes and Saulo C. S. Silva
Abstract: In the present contribution we propose a gedankenexperiment in which the restriction of rational values on the velocities emerges as a necessary condition from Classical Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics. This restriction is shown to be intimately connected to Dirac's electric charge quantization condition.
