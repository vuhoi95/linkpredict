Abstract: Low-harmonic formulas for closed relativistic strings are given. General parametrizations are presented for the addition of second- and third-harmonic waves to the fundamental wave. The method of determination of the parametrizations is based upon a product representation found for the finite Fourier series of string motion in which the constraints are automatically satisfied. The construction of strings with kinks is discussed, including examples. A procedure is laid out for the representation of kinks that arise from self-intersection, and subsequent intercommutation, for harmonically parametrized cosmic strings.
