Title: Cosmic Censorship and the Dilaton
Authors: James H. Horne and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We investigate extremal electrically charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a cosmological constant inspired by string theory. These solutions are not static, and a timelike singularity eventually appears which is not surrounded by an event horizon. This suggests that cosmic censorship may be violated in this theory.
