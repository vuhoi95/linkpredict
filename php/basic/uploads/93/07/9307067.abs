Title: On the Calculability of Observables in Topological Quantum Mechanical  Models
Authors: L. Baulieu and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We consider a superconformal quantum mechanical system which has been chosen on the basis of a local BRST topological invariance. We suggest that it truly leads to topological observables which we compute. The absences of a ground state and of a mass gap are special features of this system.
