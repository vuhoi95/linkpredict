Title: A Closed form for Consistent Anomalies in Gauge Theories
Authors: S. P. Sorella and L. Tataru
Abstract: The new method for solving the descent equations for gauge theories proposed in \cite{s} is shown to be equivalent with that based on the {\em "Russian formula"}. Moreover it allows to obtain in a closed form the expressions of the consistent anomalies in any space-time dimension.
