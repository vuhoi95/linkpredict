Title: Self-Dual Spin-3 And 4 Theories
Authors: C. Aragone and A. Khoudeir
Abstract: We present self-dual spin-3 and 4 actions using relevant dreibein fields. since these actions start with a Chern-Simons like kinetic term (and therefore cannot be obtained through dimensional reduction) one might wonder whether they need the presence of auxiliary ghost-killings fields. It turns out that they must contain, also in this three dimensional case, auxiliary fields. They do not break self-duality: their free actions do not contain kinetic second order terms.
