Title: Computing the Complete Massless Spectrum of a Landau-Ginzburg Orbifold
Authors: Shamit Kachru and Edward Witten
Abstract: We develop techniques to compute the complete the massless spectrum in heterotic string compactification on N=2 supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. This includes not just the familiar charged fields, but also the gauge singlets. The number of gauge singlets can vary in the moduli space of a given compactification and can differ from what it would be in the large radius limit of the corresponding Calabi-Yau. Comparison with exactly soluble Gepner models provides a confirmation of our results at Gepner points. Our methods carry over straightforwardly to $(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg models.
