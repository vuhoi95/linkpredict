Title: Slave Anyons in the $t$-$J$ Model at the Supersymmetric Point
Authors: Alberto Lerda and Stefano Sciuto
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the supersymmetric $t$-$J$ model in the formalism of the slave operators. In particular we introduce a generalized abelian bosonization for the model in two dimensions, and show that holons and spinons can be anyons of arbitrary complementary statistics (slave anyon representation). The braiding properties of these anyonic operators are thoroughly analyzed, and are used to provide an explicit linear realization of the superalgebra $SU(1|2)$. Finally, we prove that the Hamiltonian of the $t$-$J$ model in the slave anyon representation is invariant under $SU(1|2)$ for $J=2\,t$.
