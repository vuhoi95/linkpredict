Title: Topological Representations of $U_q(sl_2)$ on the Torus and the Mapping  Class Group
Authors: M. Crivelli and Giovanni Felder and C. Wieczerkowski
Abstract: We compute the mapping class group action on cycles on the configuration space of the torus with one puncture, with coefficients in a local system arising in conformal field theory. This action commutes with the topological action of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$, and is given in vertex form.
