Authors: Saburo Higuchi and Chigak Itoi and Shinsuke Nishigaki and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: An exact renormalization group equation is derived for the free energy of matrix models. The renormalization group equation turns out to be nonlinear for matrix models, as opposed to linear for vector models. An algorithm for determining the critical coupling constant and the critical exponent is obtained. As concrete examples, one-matrix models with one and two coupling constants are analyzed and the exact values of the critical coupling constant and the associated critical exponent are found.
