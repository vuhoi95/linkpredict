Authors: F. Delduc and L. Frappat and P. Sorba and F. Toppan and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: Factoring out the spin $1$ subalgebra of a $ W $ algebra leads to a new $ W $ structure which can be seen either as a rational finitely generated $ W $ algebra or as a polynomial non-linear $ W_\infty$ realization.
