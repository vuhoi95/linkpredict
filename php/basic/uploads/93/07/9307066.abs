Title: Massive sigma models with (p,q) supersymmetry
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We determine the general scalar potential consistent with (p,q) supersymmetry in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with torsion, generalizing previous results for special cases. We thereby find many new supersymmetric sigma models with potentials, including new (2,2) and (4,4) models.
