Title: Toda and Volterra Lattice Equations from Discrete Symmetries of KP  Hierarchies
Authors: H. Aratyn and L. A. Ferreira and J. F. Gomes and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The discrete models of the Toda and Volterra chains are being constructed out of the continuum two-boson KP hierarchies. The main tool is the discrete symmetry preserving the Hamiltonian structure of the continuum models. The two-boson currents of KP hierarchy are being associated with sites of the corresponding chain by successive actions of discrete symmetry.
