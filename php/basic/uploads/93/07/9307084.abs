Title: Pseudoclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation and the canonical  quantization of the D=2n dimensional spinning particle in the external  electromagnetic field
Authors: G. V. Grigoryan and R. P. Grigoryan
Abstract: The canonical quantization of $D=2n$ dimensional Dirac spinning particle in the external electromagnetic field is carried out in the gauge which allows to describe simultaneously particles and antiparticles (massive and massless) already at the classical level. Pseudoclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is used to obtain canonical (Newton-Wigner) coordinates and in terms of this variables the theory is quantized. The connection of this quantization with the Blount picture of Dirac particle in the external electromagnetic field is discussed.
