Title: Axial Currents in Electrodynamics P.C.R
Authors: Cardoso de Melo and M. C. Nemes and Saulo C. S. Silva
Abstract: In the present work we argue that the usual assumption that magnetic currents possess the vector structure characteristic of electric currents may be the source of several difficulties in the theory of magnetic monopoles. We propose an {\it axial} magnetic current instead and show that such difficulties are solved. Charge quantization is shown to be intimately connected with results of theories of discrete space time.
