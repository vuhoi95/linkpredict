Title: Out of Equilibrium Phase Transitions and a Toy Model for Disoriented  Chiral Condensates
Authors: Paulo Bedaque and Ashok Das
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a second order phase transition in a situation thatmimics a sudden quench to a temperature below the critical temperature in a model with dynamical symmetry breaking. In particular we show that the domains of correlated values of the condensate grow as $\sqrt{t}$ and that this result seems to be largely model independent.
