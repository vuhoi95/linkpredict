Title: Coherent State Quantization of SU(N) Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Particles
Authors: Taejin Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We present a new method of formulating the classical theory of $SU(N+1)$ non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles for arbitrary $N\geq 1$ using the symplectic reduction of $CP(N)$ manifold from $S^{2N+1}$. Quantizing the theory using BRST formulation and coherent state path integral method , we obtain a quantum mechanical model for $SU(N+1)$ NACS particles.
