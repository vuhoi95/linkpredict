Title: Possible Tests of Conformal Turbulence through Boundaries
Authors: B. K. Chung and Soonkeon Nam and Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: We investigate various boundary conditions in two dimensional turbulence systematically in the context of conformal field theory. Keeping the conformal invariance, we can either change the shape of boundaries through finite conformal transformations, or insert boundary operators so as to handle more general cases. Effects of such operations will be reflected in physically measurable quantities such as the energy power spectrum $E(k)$ or the average velocity profiles. We propose that these effects can be used as a possible test of conformal turbulence in an experimental setting. We also study the periodic boundary conditions, i.e. turbulence on a torus geometry. The dependence of moduli parameter $q$ appears explictly in the one point functions in the theory, which can also be tested.
