Title: Discretization of Virasoro Algebra
Authors: Ryuji Kemmoku and Satoru Saito
Abstract: A $q$-discretization of \vi\ algebra is studied which reduces to the ordinary \vi\ algebra in the limit of $q \ra 1$. This is derived starting from the Moyal bracket algebra, hence is a kind of quantum deformation different from the quantum groups. Representation of this new algebra by using $q$-parametrized free fields is also given.
