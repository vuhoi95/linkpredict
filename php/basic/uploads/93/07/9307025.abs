Title: The Geometry and Topology of 3-Manifolds and Gravity
Authors: J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: It is well known that one can parameterize 2-D Riemannian structures by conformal transformations and diffeomorphisms of fiducial constant curvature geometries; and that this construction has a natural setting in general relativity theory in 2-D. I will show that a similar parameterization exists for 3-D Riemannian structures, with the conformal transformations and diffeomorphisms of the 2-D case replaced by a finite dimensional group of gauge transformations. This parameterization emerges from the theory of 3-D gravity coupled to topological matter.
