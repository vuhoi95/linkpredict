Title: Electrically neutral Dirac particles in the presence of external fields:  exact solutions
Authors: German V. Shishkin and Victor M. Villalba
Abstract: In the present article we present exact solutions of the Dirac equation for electric neutral particles with anomalous electric and magnetic moments. Using the algebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation is separated in cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and exact solutions are obtained in terms of special functions.
