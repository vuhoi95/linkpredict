Title: Yukawa Couplings involving Excited Twisted Sector States for ${\bf Z}_N$  and ${\bf Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ Orbifolds
Authors: D. Bailin and A. Love and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We study the Yukawa couplings among excited twist fields which might arise in the low-energy effective field theory obtained by compactifying the heterotic string on ${\bf Z}_N$ and ${\bf Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ orbifolds.
