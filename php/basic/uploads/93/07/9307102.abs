Title: Wigner Quantum Oscillators
Authors: T. D. Palev and N. I. Stoilova
Abstract: We present three groups of noncanonical quantum oscillators. The position and the momentum operators of each of the groups generate basic Lie superalgebras, namely $sl(1/3)$, $osp(1/6)$ and $osp(3/2)$. The $sl(1/3)$-oscillators have finite energy spectrum and finite-dimensions. The $osp(1/6)$-oscillators are related to the para-Bose statistictics. The internal angular momentum $s$ of the $osp(3/2)$-oscillators takes no more than three (half)integer values. In a particular representation $s=1/2$.
