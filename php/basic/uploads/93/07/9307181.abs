Title: Wormhole and Hawking Radiation
Authors: M. Hotta and M. Yoshimura
Abstract: It is shown in a variant of two dimensional dilaton gravity theories that an arbitrary, localized massive source put in an initially regular spacetime gives rise to formation of the wormhole classically, without accompanying the curvature singularity. The semiclassical quantum correction under this wormhole spacetime yields Hawking radiation. It is expected, with the quantum back reaction added to the classical equation, that the information loss paradox may be resolved in this model.
