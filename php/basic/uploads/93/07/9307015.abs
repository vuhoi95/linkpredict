Title: Generalized Sums over Histories for Quantum Gravity I. Smooth Conifolds
Authors: Kristin Schleich and Donald M. Witt
Abstract: This paper proposes to generalize the histories included in Euclidean functional integrals from manifolds to a more general set of compact topological spaces. This new set of spaces, called conifolds, includes nonmanifold stationary points that arise naturally in a semiclasssical evaluation of such integrals; additionally, it can be proven that sequences of approximately Einstein manifolds and sequences of approximately Einstein conifolds both converge to Einstein conifolds. Consequently, generalized Euclidean functional integrals based on these conifold histories yield semiclassical amplitudes for sequences of both manifold and conifold histories that approach a stationary point of the Einstein action. Therefore sums over conifold histories provide a useful and self-consistent starting point for further study of topological effects in quantum gravity.
