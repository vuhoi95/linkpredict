Title: Consistent Interactions between Gauge Fields and Local BRST Cohomology :  The Example of Yang-Mills Models
Authors: G. Barnich and M. Henneaux and R. Tatar
Abstract: Recent results on the cohomological reformulation of the problem of consistent interactions between gauge fields are illustrated in the case of the Yang-Mills models. By evaluating the local BRST cohomology through descent equation techniques, it is shown (i) that there is a unique local, Poincar\'e invariant cubic vertex for free gauge vector fields which preserves the number of gauge symmetries to first order in the coupling constant; and (ii) that consistency to second order in the coupling constant requires the structure constants appearing in the cubic vertex to fulfill the Jacobi identity. The known uniqueness of the Yang-Mills coupling is therefore rederived through cohomological arguments.
