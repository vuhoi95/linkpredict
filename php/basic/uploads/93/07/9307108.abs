Title: Classical and Quantized Tensionless Strings
Authors: J. Isberg and U. Lindstr√∂m and B. Sundborg and G. Theodoridis
Abstract: {}From the ordinary tensile string we derive a geometric action for the tensionless ($T=0$) string and discuss its symmetries and field equations. The Weyl symmetry of the usual string is shown to be replaced by a global space-time conformal symmetry in the $T\to 0$ limit. We present the explicit expressions for the generators of this group in the light-cone gauge. Using these, we quantize the theory in an operator form and require the conformal symmetry to remain a symmetry of the quantum theory. Modulo details concerning zero-modes that are discussed in the paper, this leads to the stringent restriction that the physical states should be singlets under space-time diffeomorphisms, hinting at a topological theory. We present the details of the calculation that leads to this conclusion.
