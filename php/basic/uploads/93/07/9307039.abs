Title: Doubly Supersymmetric Null Strings and String Tension Generation
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Dmitrij P. Sorokin and Mario Tonin and Dmitrij V. Volkov
Abstract: We propose a twistor--like formulation of N=1, D=3,4,6 and 10 null superstrings. The model possesses N=1 target space supersymmetry and n=D-2 local worldsheet supersymmetry, the latter replaces the kappa-symmetry of the conventional approach to the strings. Adding a Wess--Zumino term to a null superstring action we observe a string tension generation mechanism: the induced worldsheet metric becomes non-degenerate and the resulting model turns out to be classically equivalent to the heterotic string.
