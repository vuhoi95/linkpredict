Title: Destabilizing Divergences in Supergravity-Coupled Supersymmetric  Theories
Authors: Jonathan Bagger and Erich Poppitz
Abstract: Nonrenormalizable couplings in supergravity-coupled supersymmetric theories can give rise to power-law divergences that destabilize the weak-scale hierarchy. For the case of the standard-model gauge group, the problem can arise in theories with \321 gauge-singlet chiral superfields. The minimal supersymmetric standard model is free from such destabilizing divergences.
