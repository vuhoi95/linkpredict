Title: A BRST Analysis of $W$-symmetries
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and H. J. Boonstra and S. Panda and M. de Roo
Abstract: We perform a classical BRST analysis of the symmetries corresponding to a generic $w_N$-algebra. An essential feature of our method is that we write the $w_N$-algebra in a special basis such that the algebra manifestly has a ``nested'' set of subalgebras $v_N^N \subset v_N^{N-1} \subset \dots \subset v_N^2 \equiv w_N$ where the subalgebra $v_N^i\ (i=2, \dots ,N)$ consists of generators of spin $s=\{i,i+1,\dots ,N\}$, respectively. In the new basis the BRST charge can be written as a ``nested'' sum of $N-1$ nilpotent BRST charges. In view of potential applications to (critical and/or non-critical) $W$-string theories we discuss the quantum extension of our results. In particular, we present the quantum BRST-operator for the $W_4$-algebra in the new basis. For both critical and non-critical $W$-strings we apply our results to discuss the relation with minimal models.
