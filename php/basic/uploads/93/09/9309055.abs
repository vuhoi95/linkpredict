Title: On the Calculation of Effective Actions by String Methods
Authors: M. G. Schmidt and C. Schubert
Abstract: Strassler's formulation of the string-derived Bern-Kosower formalism is reconsidered with particular emphasis on effective actions and form factors. Two- and three point form factors in the nonabelian effective action are calculated and compared with those obtained in the heat kernel approach of Barvinsky, Vilkovisky et al. We discuss the Fock-Schwinger gauge and propose a manifestly covariant calculational scheme for one-loop effective actions in gauge theory.
