Title: Unitary Continuous Representations of Compact Quantum Groups
Authors: Bernhard Drabant and Wolfgang Weich
Abstract: Generalizing the notion of continuous Hilbert space representations of compact topological groups we define unitary continuous correpresentations of $C^*$-completions of compact quantum group Hopf algebras on arbitrary Hilbert spaces. It is proved that the unitary continuous correpresentations decompose in finite dimensional irreducible correpresentations.
