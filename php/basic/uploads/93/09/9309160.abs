Title: The $q$-deformed Schr√∂dinger Equation of the Harmonic Oscillator on  the Quantum Euclidian Space
Authors: Ursula Carow-Watamura and Satoshi Watamura
Abstract: We consider the $q$-deformed Schr\"odinger equation of the harmonic oscillator on the $N$-dimensional quantum Euclidian space. The creation and annihilation operator are found, which systematically produce all energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger equation. In order to get the $q$-series representation of the eigenfunction, we also give an alternative way to solve the Schr\"odinger equation which is based on the $q$-analysis. We represent the Schr\"odinger equation by the $q$-difference equation and solve it by using $q$-polynomials and $q$-exponential functions.
