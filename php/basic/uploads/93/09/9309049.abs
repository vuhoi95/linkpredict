Title: Abelian Chern-Simons theory as the strong large-mass limit of  topologically massive abelian gauge theory: the Wilson loop
Authors: G. Giavarini and C. P. Martin and F. Ruiz Ruiz
Abstract: We show that the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop for topologically massive abelian gauge theory in $\RR^3$ can be defined so that its large-mass limit be the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop for abelian Chern-Simons theory also in $\RR^3$.
