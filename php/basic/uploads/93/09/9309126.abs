Title: Conformal Invariance and Degrees of Freedom in the QCD String
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Jean-Rene Cudell
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Hagedorn-like growth of the number of observed meson states can be used to constrain the degrees of freedom of the underlying effective QCD string. We find that the temperature relevant for such string theories is not given by the usual Hagedorn value $T_H\approx 160$ MeV, but is considerably higher. This resolves an apparent conflict with the results from a static quark-potential analysis, and suggests that conformal invariance and modular invariance are indeed reflected in the hadronic spectrum. We also find that the $D_\perp=2$ scalar string is in excellent agreement with data.
