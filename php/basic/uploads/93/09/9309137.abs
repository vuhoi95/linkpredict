Title: Functional Relations in Solvable Lattice Models I: Functional Relations  and Representation Theory
Authors: A. Kuniba and T. Nakanishi and J. Suzuki
Abstract: We study a system of functional relations among a commuting family of row-to-row transfer matrices in solvable lattice models. The role of exact sequences of the finite dimensional quantum group modules is clarified. We find a curious phenomenon that the solutions of those functional relations also solve the so-called thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations in the high temperature limit for $sl(r+1)$ models. Based on this observation, we propose possible functional relations for models associated with all the simple Lie algebras. We show that these functional relations certainly fulfill strong constraints coming from the fusion procedure analysis. The application to the calculations of physical quantities will be presented in the subsequent publication.
