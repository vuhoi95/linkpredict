Title: Light-Front Dynamics Of Massive Vector Chern-Simons Gravity
Authors: C. Aragone and P. J. Arias and A. Khoudeir
Abstract: We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einstein action augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topological term. This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It is diffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has been spontaneuosly broken. We perform the light-front (LF) analysis for both the linearized system and the exact curved model. In constrast to the 2+1 canonical analysis, in the quasi LF coordinates the differential constraints can be solved. Its solution is presented here.
