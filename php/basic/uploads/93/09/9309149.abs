Title: Two gravitationally Chern-Simons terms are too many
Authors: C. Aragone and Pio J. Arias and A. Khoudeir
Abstract: It is shown that topological massive gravity augmented by the triadic gravitational Chern-Simons first order term is a curved a pure spin-2 action. This model contains two massive spin-2 excitations. However, since its light-front energy is not semidefinite positive, this double CS-action does not have any physical relevance.In other words, topological massive gravity cannot be spontaneously broken down by the presence of the triadic CS term.
