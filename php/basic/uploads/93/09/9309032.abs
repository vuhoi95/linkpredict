Title: Motion of Wavefunction Zeros in Spin-Boson Systems
Authors: Demosthenes Ellinas and Vassilios Kovanis
Abstract: In the analytic-Bargmann representation associated with the harmonic oscillator and spin coherent states, the wavefunction as entire complex functions can be factorized in terms of their zeros in a unique way. The Schr\"odinger equation of motion for the wavefunction is turned to a system of equations for its zeros. The motion of these zeros as a non-linear flow of points is studied and interpreted for linear and non-linear bosonic and spin Hamiltonians. Attention is given to the study of the zeros of the Jaynes-Cummings model and to its finite analoque. Numerical solutions are derived and discussed.
