Title: Lattice regularization of massive and massless integrable field theories
Authors: N. Yu Reshetikhin and H. Saleur
Abstract: We show that integrable vertex and RSOS models with trigonometric Boltzmann weights and appropriate inhomogeneities provide a convenient lattice regularization for massive field theories and for the recently studied massless field theories that interpolate between two non trivial conformal field theories. Massive and massless S matrices are computed from the lattice Bethe ansatz.
