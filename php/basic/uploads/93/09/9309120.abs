Title: On the Class of Possible Nonlocal Anyon-Like Operators and Quantum  Groups
Authors: M. Chaichian and R. Gonzales Felipe and C. Montonen
Abstract: We find a class of nonlocal operators constructed by attaching a disorder operator to fermionic degrees of freedom, which can be used to generate q-deformed algebras following the Schwinger approach. This class includes the recently proposed anyonic operators defined on a lattice.
