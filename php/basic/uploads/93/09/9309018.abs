Title: Exact Dirac Quantization of All 2-D Dilaton Gravity Theories
Authors: D. Louis- Martinez and J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: The most general dilaton gravity theory in 2 spacetime dimensions is considered. A Hamiltonian analysis is performed and the reduced phase space, which is two dimensional, is explicitly constructed in a suitable parametrization of the fields. The theory is then quantized via the Dirac method in a functional Schrodinger representation. The quantum constraints are solved exactly to yield the (spatial) diffeomorphism invariant quantum wave functional for all theories considered. This wave function depends explicitly on the (single) configuration space coordinate as well as on the imbedding of space into spacetime (i.e. on the choice of time).
