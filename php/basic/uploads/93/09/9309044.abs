Title: Interacting Fermion Systems from Two Dimensional QCD
Authors: Joseph A. Minahan and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We consider two dimensional U(N) QCD on the cylinder with a timelike Wilson line in an arbitrary representation. We show that the theory is equivalent to N fermions with internal degrees of freedom which interact among themselves with a generalized Sutherland-type interaction. By evaluating the expectation value of the Wilson line in the original theory we explicitly find the spectrum and degeneracies of these particle systems.
