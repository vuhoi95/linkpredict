Title: $W_\infty$ coherent states and path-integral derivation of bosonization  of non-relativistic fermions in one dimension
Authors: Avinash Dhar and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We complete the proof of bosonization of noninteracting nonrelativistic fermions in one space dimension by deriving the bosonized action using $W_\infty$ coherent states in the fermion path-integral. This action was earlier derived by us using the method of coadjoint orbits. We also discuss the classical limit of the bosonized theory and indicate the precise nature of the truncation of the full theory that leads to the collective field theory.
