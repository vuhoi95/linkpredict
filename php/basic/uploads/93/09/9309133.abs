Title: Duality Symmetries in Orbifold Models
Authors: D. Bailin and A. Love and W. A. Sabra and S. Thomas
Abstract: We derive the duality symmetries relevant to moduli dependent gauge coupling constant threshold corrections, in Coxeter $ {\bf Z_N} $ orbifolds. We consider those orbifolds for which the point group leaves fixed a 2-dimensional sublattice $\Lambda_2$, of the six dimensional torus lattice $\Lambda_6$, where $\Lambda_6 $ cannot be decomposed as $\Lambda_2 \bigoplus{\Lambda_4}.$
