Title: Affine Toda Field Theory in the Presence of Reflecting Boundaries
Authors: A. Fring and R. KÃ¶berle
Abstract: We show that the ``boundary crossing-unitarity equation" recently proposed by Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov is a consequence of the boundary bootstrap equation for the S-matrix and the wall-bootstrap equation. We solve this set of equations for all affine Toda theories related to simply laced Lie algebras, obtaining explicit formulas for the W-matrix which encodes the scattering of a particle with the boundary in the ground state. For each theory there are two solutions to these equations, related by CDD-ambiguities, each giving rise to different kind of physics.
