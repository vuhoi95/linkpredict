Title: Axial Monopoles, Quantization of Electric Charge and Dynamical  Discreteness of Space-Time
Authors: M. C. Nemes and Saulo C. S. Silva
Abstract: In the present contribution we show that the introduction of axial currents in electrodynamics can explain the quantization of electric charge and introduces a dynamical discreteness of space-time, justifying thus the regularization of Feymman's integrals.
