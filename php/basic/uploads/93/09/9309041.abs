Title: The Complete Cohomology of the W3 String
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and X. J. Wang and K. W. Xu
Abstract: We present a simple procedure for constructing the complete cohomology of the BRST operator of the two-scalar and multi-scalar $W_3$ strings. The method consists of obtaining two level--15 physical operators in the two-scalar $W_3$ string that are invertible, and that can normal order with all other physical operators. They can be used to map all physical operators into non-trivial physical operators whose momenta lie in a fundamental unit cell. By carrying out an exhaustive analysis of physical operators in this cell, the entire cohomology problem is solved.
