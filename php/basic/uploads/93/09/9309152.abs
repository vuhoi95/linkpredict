Title: Hairy Black Holes in String Theory
Authors: S. B. Giddings and J. A. Harvey and Joseph Polchinski and S. H. Shenker and A. Strominger
Abstract: Solutions of bosonic string theory are constructed which correspond to four-dimensional black holes with axionic quantum hair. The basic building blocks are the renormalization group flows of the CP1 model with a theta term and the SU(1,1)/U(1) WZW coset conformal field theory. However the solutions are also found to have negative energy excitations, and are accordingly expected to decay to the vacuum.
