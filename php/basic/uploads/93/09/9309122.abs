Title: Renormalization in Quantum Statistics of Systems with Spontaneous  Symmetry Breaking
Authors: M. Chaichian and J. L. Lucio M. and C. Montonen and H. Perez Rojas and M. Vargas
Abstract: Renormalization in quantum statistics in the presence of a charge associated to a spontaneously broken symmetry is discussed for the scalar field model. In contrast to the case of non-broken symmetry, the renormalization mass counterterm depends on the chemical potential. We argue that this is connected to the ill-defined character of the charge operator.
