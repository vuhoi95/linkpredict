Title: Study of Minimal String Unification in $Z_8$ Orbifold Models
Authors: H. Kawabe and T. Kobayashi and N. Ohtsubo
Abstract: We study the construction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model from the $Z_8$ orbifold models. We use a target-space duality anomaly cancellation and a unification of gauge couplings as constraints. It is shown that some models obtained through a systematical search realize the unification of SU(3) and SU(2) coupling constants.
