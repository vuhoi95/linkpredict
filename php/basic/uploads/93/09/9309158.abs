Title: Transition Amplitudes within the Stochastic Quantization Scheme
Authors: H. HÃ¼ffel and H. Nakazato
Abstract: Quantum mechanical transition amplitudes are calculated within the stochastic quantization scheme for the free nonrelativistic particle, the harmonic oscillator and the nonrelativistic particle in a constant magnetic field; we close with free Grassmann quantum mechanics.
