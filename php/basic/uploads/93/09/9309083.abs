Title: Infinite Symmetry in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Michael Flohr and Raimund Varnhagen
Abstract: We have generalized recent results of Cappelli, Trugenberger and Zemba on the integer quantum Hall effect constructing explicitly a ${\cal W}_{1+\infty}$ for the fractional quantum Hall effect such that the negative modes annihilate the Laughlin wave functions. This generalization has a nice interpretation in Jain's composite fermion theory. Furthermore, for these models we have calculated the wave functions of the edge excitations viewing them as area preserving deformations of an incompressible quantum droplet, and have shown that the ${\cal W}_{1+\infty}$ is the underlying symmetry of the edge excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Finally, we have applied this method to more general wave functions.
