Title: Equivalence of Several Chern-Simons Matter Models
Authors: Wei Chen and Chigak Itoi
Abstract: Not only does Chern-Simons (CS) coupling characterize statistics, but also spin and scaling dimension of matter fields. We demonstrate spin transmutation in relativistic CS matter theory, and moreover show equivalence of several models. We study CS vector model in some details, which provide consistent check to the assertion of the equivalence.
