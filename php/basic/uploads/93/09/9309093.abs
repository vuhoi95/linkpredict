Title: Maverick Examples Of Coset Conformal Field Theories
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Keith G. Joshi
Abstract: We present coset conformal field theories whose spectrum is not determined by the identification current method. In these ``maverick'' cosets there is a larger symmetry identifying primary fields than under the identification current. We find an A-D-E classification of these mavericks. }
