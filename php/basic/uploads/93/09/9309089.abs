Title: On dynamics of cylindrical and spherical relativistic domain walls of  finite thickness
Authors: H. Arodz and A. L. Larsen
Abstract: Dynamics of cylindrical and spherical relativistic domain walls is investigated with the help of a new method based on Taylor expansion of the scalar field in a vicinity of the core of the wall. Internal oscillatory modes for the domain walls are found. These modes are non-analytic in the "width" of the domain wall. Rather non-trivial transformation to a special coordinate system, widely used in investigations of relativistic domain walls, is studied in detail.
