Title: Topological Aspects of the Non-adiabatic Berry Phase
Authors: Ali Mostafazadeh and Arno Bohm
Abstract: The topology of the non-adiabatic parameter space bundle is discussed for evolution of exact cyclic state vectors in Berry's original example of split angular momentum eigenstates. It turns out that the change in topology occurs at a critical frequency. The first Chern number that classifies these bundles is proportional to angular momentum. The non-adiabatic principal bundle over the parameter space is not well-defined at the critical frequency.
