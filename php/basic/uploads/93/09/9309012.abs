Title: Adjoint Fermion Matrix Models
Authors: Yu. Makeenko and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We study fermionic one-matrix, two-matrix and $D$-dimensional gauge invariant matrix models. In all cases we derive loop equations which unambiguously determine the large-$N$ solution. For the one-matrix case the solution is obtained for an arbitrary interaction potential and turns out to be equivalent to the one for the Hermitean one-matrix model with a logarithmic potential and, therefore, belongs to the same universality class. The explicit solutions for the fermionic two-matrix and $D$-dimensional matrix models are obtained at large $N$ (or in the spherical approximation) for the quadratic potential.
