Title: Toroidal Orbifold Models with a Wess-Zumino Term
Authors: J. O. Madsen and M. Sakamoto
Abstract: Closed bosonic string theory on toroidal orbifolds is studied in a Lagrangian path integral formulation. It is shown that a level one twisted WZW action whose field value is restricted to Cartan subgroups of simply-laced Lie groups on a Riemann surface is a natural and nontrivial extension of a first quantized action of string theory on orbifolds with an antisymmetric background field.
