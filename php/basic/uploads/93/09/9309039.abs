Title: Exact calculation of the ground-state dynamical spin correlation  function of a S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with free spinons
Authors: F. D. M. Haldane and M. R. Zirnbauer
Abstract: We calculate the exact dynamical magnetic structure factor S(Q,E) in the ground state of a one-dimensional S=1/2 antiferromagnet with gapless free S=1/2 spinon excitations, the Haldane-Shastry model with inverse-square exchange, which is in the same low-energy universality class as Bethe's nearest-neighbor exchange model. Only two-spinon excited states contribute, and S(Q,E) is found to be a very simple integral over these states.
