Title: Operator product expansion of the energy momentum tensor in 2D conformal  field theories on manifolds with boundary
Authors: H. Dorn and V. Preuss
Abstract: Starting from the well-known expression for the trace anomaly we derive the $T\cdot T$ operator product expansion of the energy-momentum tensor in 2D conformal theories defined in the upper halfplane $without$ making use of the additional condition of no energy-momentum flux across the boundary. The OPE turns out to be the same as in the absence of the boundary. For this result it is crucial that the trace anomaly is proportional to the Gau\ss-Bonnet density. Some relations to the $\sigma$ - model approach for open strings are discussed.
