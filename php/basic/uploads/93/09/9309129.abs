Title: Kac-Moody structure of chiral gravity in the light-cone gauge
Authors: A. Smailagic and Euro Spallucci
Abstract: We study the residual symmetry $SL(2,R)\otimes U(1)$ of the chiral gravity in the light-cone gauge. Quantum gravitational effects renormalize the Kac-Moody central charge and introduce, through the Lorentz anomaly, an arbitrary parameter. Due to the presence of this free parameter the Kac-Moody central charge has no forbidden range of values, and the strong gravity regime is open to investigations.
