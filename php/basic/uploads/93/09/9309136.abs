Title: Intersecting Braids and Intersecting Knot Theory
Authors: Daniel Armand-Ugon and Rodolfo Gambini and Pablo Mora
Abstract: An extension of the Artin Braid Group with new operators that generate double and triple intersections is considered. The extended Alexander theorem, relating intersecting closed braids and intersecting knots is proved for double and triple intersections, and a counter example is given for the case of quadruple intersections. Intersecting knot invariants are constructed via Markov traces defined on intersecting braid algebra representations, and the extended Turaev representation is discussed as an example. Possible applications of the formalism to quantum gravity are discussed.
