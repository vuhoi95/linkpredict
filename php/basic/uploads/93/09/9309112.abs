Title: Strongly Coupled Quantum and Classical Systems and Zeno's Effect
Authors: Ph. Blanchard and A. Jadczyk
Abstract: A model interaction between a two-state quantum system and a classical switching device is analysed and shown to lead to the quantum Zeno effect for large values of the coupling constant k . A minimal piecewise deterministic random process compatible with the Liouville equation is described, and it is shown that 1/k can be interpreted as the jump frequency of the classical device
