Title: Shape-invariant potentials and an associated coherent state
Authors: T. Fukui and N. Aizawa
Abstract: An algebraic treatment of shape-invariant potentials in supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed. By introducing an operator which reparametrizes wave functions, the shape-invariance condition can be related to a oscillator-like algebra. It makes possible to define a coherent state associated with the shape-invariant potentials. For a large class of such potentials, it is shown that the introduced coherent state has the property of resolution of unity.
