Title: Instantons from over-improved cooling
Authors: Margarita Garcia Perez and Antonio Gonzalez-Arroyo and Jeroen Snippe and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: Lattice artefacts are used, through modified lattice actions, as a tool to find the largest instantons in a toroidal geometry [0,L]^3X[0,T] for T to infinity. It is conjectured that the largest instanton is associated with tunnelling through a sphaleron. Existence of instantons with at least 8 parameters can be proven with the help of twisted boundary conditions in the time direction. Numerical results for SU(2) gauge theory obtained by cooling are presented to demonstrate the viability of the method.
