Title: Boundary-Induced Phase Transitions in Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium  Systems
Authors: Malte Henkel and Gunter Sch√ºtz
Abstract: Boundary conditions may change the phase diagram of non-equilibrium statistical systems like the one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without particle number conservation. Using the quantum Hamiltonian approach, the model is mapped onto an XXZ quantum chain and solved using the Bethe ansatz. This system is related to a two-dimensional vertex model in thermal equilibrium. The phase transition caused by a point-like boundary defect in the dynamics of the one-dimensional exclusion model is in the same universality class as a continous (bulk) phase transition of the two-dimensional vertex model caused by a line defect at its boundary.
