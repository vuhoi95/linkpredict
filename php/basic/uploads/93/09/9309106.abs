Title: Gravitational Dressing of Renormalization Group
Authors: I. R. Klebanov and I. I. Kogan and A. M. Polyakov
Abstract: We study the gravitational dressing of renormalizable two-dimensional field theories. Our main result is that the one-loop $\beta$-function is finitely renormalized by the factor ${k+2\over k+1}$, where $k$ is the central charge of the gravitational $SL(2, R)$ current algebra.
