Title: Chiral Quantization on a Group Manifold
Authors: Zbigniew Hasiewicz and Przemys≈Ç{aw} Siemion and Walter Troost
Abstract: The phase space of a particle on a group manifold can be split in left and right sectors, in close analogy with the chiral sectors in Wess Zumino Witten models. We perform a classical analysis of the sectors, and the geometric quantization in the case of $SU(2)$. The quadratic relation, classically identifying $SU(2)$ as the sphere $S^3$, is replaced quantum mechanically by a similar condition on non-commutative operators ('quantum sphere'). The resulting quantum exchange algebra of the chiral group variables is quartic, not quadratic. The fusion of the sectors leads to a Hilbert space that is subtly different from the one obtained by a more direct (un--split) quantization.
