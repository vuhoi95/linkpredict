Title: On the multilevel generalization of the field--antifield formalism
Authors: I. A. Batalin and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: The multilevel geometrically--covariant generalization of the field--antifield BV--formalism is suggested. The structure of quantum generating equations and hypergauge conditions is studied in details. The multilevel formalism is established to be physically--equivalent to the standard BV--version.
