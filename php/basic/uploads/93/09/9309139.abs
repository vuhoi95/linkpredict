Title: On the Nature of Nonperturbative Effects in Stabilized 2D Quantum  Gravity
Authors: Oscar Diego and Jose Gonzalez
Abstract: We remark that the weak coupling regime of the stochastic stabilization of 2D quantum gravity has a unique perturbative vacuum, which does not support instanton configurations. By means of Monte Carlo simulations we show that the nonperturbative vacuum is also confined in one potential well. Nonperturbative effects can be assessed in the loop equation. This can be derived from the Ward identities of the stabilized model and is shown to be modified by nonperturbative terms.
