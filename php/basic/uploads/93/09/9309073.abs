Title: A Non-Principal Value Prescription for the Temporal Gauge
Authors: Kuo-Cheng Lee and Su-Long Nyeo
Abstract: A non-principal value prescription is used to define the spurious singularities of Yang-Mills theory in the temporal gauge. Typical one-loop dimensionally-regularized temporal-gauge integrals in the prescription are explicitly calculated, and a regularization for the spurious gauge divergences is introduced. The divergent part of the one-loop self-energy is shown to be local and has the same form as that in the spatial axial gauge with the principal-value prescription. The renormalization of the theory is also briefly mentioned.
