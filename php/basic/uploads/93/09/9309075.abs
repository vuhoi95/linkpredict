Title: Pair Creation of Dilaton Black Holes
Authors: Fay Dowker and Jerome P. Gauntlett and David A. Kastor and Jennie Traschen
Abstract: We consider dilaton gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions parametrised by a constant $a$, which controls the dilaton coupling, and construct new exact solutions. We first generalise the C-metric of Einstein-Maxwell theory ($a=0$) to solutions corresponding to oppositely charged dilaton black holes undergoing uniform acceleration for general $a$. We next develop a solution generating technique which allows us to ``embed" the dilaton C-metrics in magnetic dilaton Melvin backgrounds, thus generalising the Ernst metric of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By adjusting the parameters appropriately, it is possible to eliminate the nodal singularities of the dilaton C-metrics. For $a<1$ (but not for $a\ge 1$), it is possible to further restrict the parameters so that the dilaton Ernst solutions have a smooth euclidean section with topology $S^2\times S^2-{\rm\{pt\}}$, corresponding to instantons describing the pair production of dilaton black holes in a magnetic field. A different restriction on the parameters leads to smooth instantons for all values of $a$ with topology $S^2\times \R^2$.
