Title: The Strength of String Nonperturbative Effects and Strong-Weak Coupling  Duality
Authors: J. D. Cohn and Vipul Periwal
Abstract: A strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of the string equations of motion has been suggested in the literature. This symmetry implies that vacua occur in pairs. Since the coupling constant is a dynamical variable in string theory, tunneling solutions between strong and weak coupling vacua may exist. Such solutions would naturally lead to nonperturbative effects with anomalous coupling dependence. A highly simplified example is given.
