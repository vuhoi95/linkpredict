Title: The Relation between Linear and Non-Linear $N=3,4$ Supergravity Theories
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Kris Thielemans and Walter Troost
Abstract: The effective actions for $d=2$, $N=3,4$ chiral supergravities with a linear and a non-linear gauge algebra are related to each other by a quantum reduction, the latter is obtained from the former by putting quantum currents equal to zero. This implies that the renormalisation factors for the quantum actions are identical.
