Title: The Partition Function for Topological Field Theories
Authors: J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: We use a Hodge decomposition and its generalization to non-abelian flat vector bundles to calculate the partition function for abelian and non- abelian BF theories in $n$ dimensions. This enables us to provide a simple proof that the partition function is related to the Ray-Singer torsion defined on flat vector bundles for all odd-dimensional manifolds, and is equal to unity for even dimensions.
