Title: Chern-Simons States and Topologically Massive Gauge Theories
Authors: M. Asorey and S. Carlip and F. Falceto
Abstract: In an abelian topologically massive gauge theory, any eigenstate of the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a factor describing massive propagating gauge bosons and a Chern-Simons wave function describing a set of nonpropagating ``topological'' excitations. The energy depends only on the propagating modes, and energy eigenstates thus occur with a degeneracy that can be parametrized by the Hilbert space of the pure Chern-Simons theory. We show that for a {\em nonabelian} topologically massive gauge theory, this degeneracy is lifted: although the Gauss law constraint can be solved with a similar factorization, the Hamiltonian couples the propagating and nonpropagating (topological) modes.
