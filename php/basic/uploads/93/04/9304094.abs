Title: Canonical Analysis of Poincare' Gauge Theories for Two Dimansional  Gravity
Authors: G. Grignani and G. Nardelli
Abstract: Following the general method discussed in Refs.[1,2], Liouville gravity and the 2 dimensional model of non-Einstenian gravity ${\cal L} \sim curv^2 + torsion^2 + cosm. const.$ can be formulated as ISO(1,1) gauge theories. In the first order formalism the models present, besides the Poincar\'e gauge symmetry, additional local symmetries. We show that in both models one can fix these additional symmetries preserving the ISO(1,1) gauge symmetry and the diffeomorphism invariance, so that, after a preliminary Dirac procedure, the remaining constraints uniquely satisfy the ISO(1,1) algebra. After the additional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion are unaltered. One thus remarkably simplifies the canonical structure, especially of the second model. Moreover, one shows that the Poincar\'e group can always be used consistently as a gauge group for gravitational theories in two dimensions.
