Title: Virasoro Characters from Bethe Equations for the Critical Ferromagnetic  Three-State Potts Model
Authors: S. Dasmahapatra and R. Kedem and B. M. McCoy and E. Melzer
Abstract: We obtain new fermionic sum representations for the Virasoro characters of the confromal field theory describing the ferromagnetic three-state Potts spin chain. These arise from the fermionic quasi-particle excitations derived from the Bethe equations for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian. In the conformal scaling limit, the Bethe equations provide a description of the spectrum in terms of one genuine quasi-particle, and two ``ghost'' excitations with a limited microscopic momentum range. This description is reflected in the structure of the character formulas, and suggests a connection with the integrable perturbation of dimensions (2/3,2/3)$^+$ which breaks the $S_3$ symmetry of the conformal field theory down to $Z_2$.
