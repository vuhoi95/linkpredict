Title: 1-Loop Analysis of the Photon Self-Energy due to 3D-Gravity
Authors: C. Pinheiro and G. O. Pires and F. A. B. Rabelo de Carvalho
Abstract: A Maxwell-Chern-Simons field is minimally coupled to 3D-gravity. Feynman rules are written down and 1-loop corrections to the gauge-field self-energy are calculated. Transversality is verified and gauge-field dynamical mass generation does not take place.
