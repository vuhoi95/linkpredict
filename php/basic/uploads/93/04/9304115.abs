Title: On Higher-spin Generalisations of String Theory
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and X. J. Wang
Abstract: We construct BRST operators for certain higher-spin extensions of the Virasoro algebra, in which there is a spin-$s$ gauge field on the world sheet, as well as the spin-2 gauge field corrresponding to the two-dimensional metric. We use these BRST operators to study the physical states of the associated string theories, and show how they are related to certain minimal models.
