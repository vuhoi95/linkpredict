Title: General Form of Dilaton Gravity and Nonlinear Gauge Theory
Authors: Noriaki Ikeda and Izawa K. -I
Abstract: We construct a gauge theory based on general nonlinear Lie algebras. The generic form of `dilaton' gravity is derived from nonlinear Poincar{\' e} algebra, which exhibits a gauge-theoretical origin of the non-geometric scalar field in two-dimensional gravitation theory.
