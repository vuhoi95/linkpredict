Title: Classical $N=1$ and $N=2$ super W-algebras from a zero-curvature  condition
Authors: Francois Gieres and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: Starting from superdifferential operators in an $N=1$ superfield formulation, we present a systematic prescription for the derivation of classical $N=1$ and $N=2$ super W-algebras by imposing a zero-curvature condition on the connection of the corresponding first order system. We illustrate the procedure on the first non-trivial example (beyond the $N=1$ superconformal algebra) and also comment on the relation with the Gelfand-Dickey construction of $W$-algebras.
