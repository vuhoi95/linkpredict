Title: $q$-Deformed Classical Lie Algebras and their Anyonic Realization
Authors: Marialuisa Frau and Marco A. R-Monteiro and Stefano Sciuto
Abstract: All classical Lie algebras can be realized \`a la Schwinger in terms of fermionic oscillators. We show that the same can be done for their $q$-deformed counterparts by simply replacing the fermionic oscillators with anyonic ones defined on a two dimensional lattice. The deformation parameter $q$ is a phase related to the anyonic statistical parameter. A crucial r\^ole in this construction is played by a sort of bosonization formula which gives the generators of the quantum algebras in terms of the underformed ones. The entire procedure works even on one dimensional chains; in such a case $q$ can also be real.
