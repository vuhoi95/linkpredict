Title: $G/G$ Gauged Supergroup Valued WZNW Field Theory
Authors: Jiang-Bei Fan and Ming Yu
Abstract: The $G/G$ gauged supergroup valued WZNW theory is considered. It is shown that for $G=\OSP$, the $G/G$ theory tensoring a ($b$, $c$, $\beta$, $\gamma$) system is equivalent to the non-critical fermionic theory. The relation between integral or half integral moded affine superalgebra and its reduced theory, the NS or R superconformal algebra, is discussed in detail. The physical state space, i.e. the BRST semi-infinite cohomology, is calculated, for the $\OSP/\OSP$ theory.
