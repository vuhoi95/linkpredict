Title: Deformed Wong Particles
Authors: A. Stern and I. Yakushin
Abstract: By generalizing the Feynman proof of the Lorentz force law, recently reported by Dyson, we derive equations of motion for particles possessing internal degrees of freedom $I^a$ which do not, in general, generate a finite algebra. We obtain consistency criteria for fields which interact with such particles. It is argued that when a particle with internal $SU_q(2)$ degrees of freedom is coupled to $SU(2)$ gauge fields, $SU(2)$ gauge invariance is broken to $U(1)$. We further claim that when such an $SU_q(2)$ particle acts as a source for the field theory, the second rank antisymmetric field tensor, in general, cannot be globally defined.
