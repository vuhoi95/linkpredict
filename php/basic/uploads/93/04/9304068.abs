Title: Relating black holes in two and three dimensions
Authors: Ana Ach√∫carro and Miguel Ortiz
Abstract: The three dimensional black hole solutions of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) are dimensionally reduced in various different ways. Solutions are obtained to the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory of two dimensional gravity for spinless BTZ black holes, and to a simple extension with a non-zero dilaton potential for black holes of fixed spin. Similar reductions are given for charged black holes. The resulting two dimensional solutions are themselves black holes, and are appropriate for investigating exact ``S-wave'' scattering in the BTZ metrics. Using a different dimensional reduction to the string inspired model of two dimensional gravity, the BTZ solutions are related to the familiar two dimensional black hole and the linear dilaton vacuum.
