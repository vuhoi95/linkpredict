Title: Global Aspects of p-Branes
Authors: J. Mickelsson and R. Percacci
Abstract: We generalize to dimension $p>1$ the notion of string structure and discuss the related obstruction. We apply our results to a model of bosonic $p$-branes propagating on a principal $G$-bundle, coupled to a Yang--Mills field and an antisymmetric tensor field and in the presence of a Wess-Zumino term in the Lagrangian. We construct the quantization line bundle and discuss the action of background gauge transformations on wave functions.
