Title: Phase Space Reduction and Vortex Statistics: An Anyon Quantization  Ambiguity
Authors: Theodore J. Allen and Andrew J. Bordner and Dennis B. Crossley
Abstract: We examine the quantization of the motion of two charged vortices in a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect recently proposed by the first two authors. The system has two second-class constraints which can be implemented either in the reduced phase space or Dirac-Gupta-Bleuler formalism. Using the intrinsic formulation of statistics, we show that these two ways of implementing the constraints are inequivalent unless the vortices are quantized with conventional statistics; either fermionic or bosonic.
