Abstract: The general $\sigma$-model-type string action including both massless and massive higher spins background fields is suggested. Field equations for background fields are followed from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance. It is shown that renormalization of the theory can be produced level by level. The detailed consideration of background fields structure and corresponding fields equations is given for the first massive level of the closed bosonic string.
