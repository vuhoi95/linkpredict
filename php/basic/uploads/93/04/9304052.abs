Title: Continued Fraction as a Discrete Nonlinear Transform
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Kimball A. Milton
Abstract: The connection between a Taylor series and a continued-fraction involves a nonlinear relation between the Taylor coefficients $\{ a_n \}$ and the continued-fraction coefficients $\{ b_n \}$. In many instances it turns out that this nonlinear relation transforms a complicated sequence $\{a_n \}$ into a very simple one $\{ b_n \}$. We illustrate this simplification in the context of graph combinatorics.
