Title: Covariant - tensor method for quantum groups and applications I:  $SU(2)_{q}$
Authors: Stjepan Meljanac and Marijan Milekovic
Abstract: A covariant - tensor method for $SU(2)_{q}$ is described. This tensor method is used to calculate q - deformed Clebsch - Gordan coefficients. The connection with covariant oscillators and irreducible tensor operators is established. This approach can be extended to other quantum groups.
