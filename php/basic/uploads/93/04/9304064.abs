Title: Relation between Classical and Pseudo-classical Spinning Particle
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Seungjoon Hyun and Jae-Kwan Kim
Abstract: The spin degrees of freedom for the relativistic particle are described by either Poincar\'{e} group variables (classically) or Grassmann variables (pseudo-classically). The relationship between those two descriptions are given. In doing that, appropriate constraints are constructed to put into the lagrangian. Especially a natural relation of Poincar\'{e} group variables and Grassmann variables is obtained. Hopf fibration relating the spin momentum to the group is just the right transformation of the spin momentum under Poincar\'{e} group. And with the relation just mentioned, pseudoclassical lagrangian is derived naturally from the classical one.
