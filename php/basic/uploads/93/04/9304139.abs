Title: Supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy
Authors: Aaron K. Grant and Jonathan L. Rosner
Abstract: The connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Korteweg- de Vries (KdV) equation is discussed, with particular emphasis on the KdV conservation laws. It is shown that supersymmetric quantum mechanics aids in the derivation of the conservation laws, and gives some insight into the Miura transformation that converts the KdV equation into the modified KdV equation. The construction of the $\tau$-function by means of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed.
