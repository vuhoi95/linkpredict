Abstract: In this talk we report some results about the construction of soliton solutions for the Affine and Conformal Affine Toda models using the Hirota's method. We obtain new classes of solitons connected to the degeneracies of the Cartan matrix eigenvalues as well as to some particular features of the recursive scheme developed here. We obtain an universal mass formula for all those solitons. The examples of $SU(6)$ and $Sp(3)$ are discussed in some detail. ( Talk presented at the VII J.A.
