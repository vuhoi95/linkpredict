Title: Self-Similar Potentials and the q-Oscillator Algebra at Roots of Unity
Authors: S. Skorik and V. Spiridonov
Abstract: Properties of the simplest class of self-similar potentials are analyzed. Wave functions of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation provide bases of representations of the $q$-deformed Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. When the parameter $q$ is a root of unity the functional form of the potentials can be found explicitly. The general $q^3=1$ and the particular $q^4=1$ potentials are given by the equianharmonic and (pseudo)lemniscatic Weierstrass functions respectively.
