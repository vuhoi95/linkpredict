Title: Measurement of the Schrodinger wave of a single particle
Authors: Yakir Aharonov and Lev Vaidman
Abstract: We show that it is possible to measure Schrodinger wave of a single quantum system. This provides a strong argument for associating physical reality with the quantum state of a single system, and challenges the usual assumption that the quantum state has physical meaning only for an ensemble of identical systems.
