Title: Chronology Protection in Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Takashi Mishima and Akika Nakamichi
Abstract: The global structure of 1 + 1 dimensional compact Universe is studied in two-dimensional model of dilaton gravity. First we give a classical solution corresponding to the spacetime in which a closed time-like curve appears, and show the instability of this spacetime due to the existence of matters. We also observe quantum version of such a spacetime having closed timelike curves never reappear unless the parameters are fine-tuned.
