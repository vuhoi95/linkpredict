Title: Mirror Maps and Instanton Sums for Complete Intersections in Weighted  Projective Space
Authors: A. Klemm and S. Theisen
Abstract: We consider a class of Calabi-Yau compactifications which are constructed as a complete intersection in weighted projective space. For manifolds with one K\"ahler modulus we construct the mirror manifolds and calculate the instanton sum.
