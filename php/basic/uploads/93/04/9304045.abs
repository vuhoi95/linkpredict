Title: Generalized Calabi-Yau Manifolds and the Mirror of a Rigid Manifold
Authors: P. Candelas and E. Derrick and L. Parkes
Abstract: We describe the mirror of the Z orbifold as a representation of a class of generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be realized as manifolds of dimension five and seven. Despite their dimension these correspond to superconformal theories with $c=9$ and so are perfectly good for compactifying the heterotic string to the four dimensions of space-time. As a check of mirror symmetry we compute the structure of the space of complex structures of the mirror and check that this reproduces the known results for the Yukawa couplings and metric appropriate to the Kahler class parameters on the Z orbifold together with their instanton corrections.
