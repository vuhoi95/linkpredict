Title: N=2 Supersymmetry in Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
Authors: William M. Nelson and Youngchul Park
Abstract: Actions for $D=2$, $N=2$ supergravity coupled to a scalar field are calculated, and it is shown that the most general power-counting renormalizable dilaton gravity action has an $N=2$ locally supersymmetric extension. The presence of chiral terms in the action leads one to hope that non-renormalization theorems similar to those in global SUSY will apply; this would eliminate some of the renormalization ambiguities which plague ordinary bosonic (and $N=1$) dilaton gravity. To investigate this, the model is studied in superconformal gauge, where it is found that one chiral term becomes nonchiral, so that only one term is safe from renormalization.
