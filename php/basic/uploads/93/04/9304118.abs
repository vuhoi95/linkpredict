Title: Crystal bases, dilogarithm identities and torsion in algebraic K-groups
Authors: Edward Frenkel and Andras Szenes
Abstract: We give a new interpretation and proof of the dilogarithm identities, associated to the affine Kac-Moody algebra sl(2)^, using the path description of the corresponding crystal basis. We also discuss connections with algebraic K-theory.
