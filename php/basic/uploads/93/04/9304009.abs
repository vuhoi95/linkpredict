Title: Intertwiners and \ade Lattice Models
Authors: Paul A. Pearce and Yu-kui Zhou
Abstract: Intertwiners between \ade lattice models are presented and the general theory developed. The intertwiners are discussed at three levels: at the level of the adjacency matrices, at the level of the cell calculus intertwining the face algebras and at the level of the row transfer matrices. A convenient graphical representation of the intertwining cells is introduced. The utility of the intertwining relations in studying the spectra of the \ade models is emphasized. In particular, it is shown that the existence of an intertwiner implies that many eigenvalues of the \ade row transfer matrices are exactly in common for a finite system and, consequently, that the corresponding central charges and scaling dimensions can be identified.
