Title: Topological Field Theories and the Period Integrals
Authors: T. Eguchi and Y. Yamada and S. -K. Yang
Abstract: We discuss topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled to the 2-dimensional topological gravity. We point out that the basic recursion relations for correlation functions of the 2-dimesional gravity have exactly the same form as the Gauss-Manin differential equations for the period integrals of superpotentials. Thus the one-point functions on the sphere of the Landau-Ginzburg theories are given exactly by the period integrals. We discuss various examples, A-D-E minimal models and the $c=3$ topological theories.
