Title: Hidden Symmetry of the Racah and Clebsch-Gordan Problems for the Quantum  Algebra sl_q(2)
Authors: Ya. I. Granovskii and A. S. Zhedanov
Abstract: The Askey-Wilson algebra $AW(3)$ with three generators is shown to serve as a hidden symmetry algebra underlying the Racah and (new) generalized Clebsch-Gordan problems for the quantum algebra $sl_q(2)$. On the base of this hidden symmetry a simple method to calculate corresponding coefficients in terms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials is proposed.
