Title: Algebraic Characterization of the Lorentz and Diffeomorphism Anomalies
Authors: S. P. Sorella and M. Werneck de Oliveira
Abstract: The Wess-Zumino consistency conditions for Lorentz and diffeomorphism anomalies are discussed by introducing an operator 'delta' which allows to decompose the exterior derivative as a BRS commutator.
