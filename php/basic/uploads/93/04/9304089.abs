Title: Generalizations of the thermal Bogoliubov transformation
Authors: P. Elmfors and H. Umezawa
Abstract: The thermal Bogoliubov transformation in thermo field dynamics is generalized in two respects. First, a generalization of the $\alpha$--degree of freedom to tilde non--conserving representations is considered. Secondly, the usual $2\times2$ Bogoliubov matrix is extended to a $4\times4$ matrix including mixing of modes with non--trivial multiparticle correlations. The analysis is carried out for both bosons and fermions.
