Title: Macroscopic Loop Amplitudes in Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Yoichro Matsumura and Norisuke Sakai and Hiroshi Shirokura
Abstract: Macroscopic loop amplitudes are obtained for the dilation gravity in two-dimensions. The dependence on the macroscopic loop length $l$ is completely determined by using the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the mini-superspace approximation. The dependence on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is also determined by using the scaling argument in addition.
