Title: Free Fermionic Elliptic Reflection Matrices and Quantum Group Invariance
Authors: R. Cuerno and A. Gonz√°lez--Ruiz
Abstract: Elliptic diagonal solutions for the reflection matrices associated to the elliptic $R$ matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model are presented. They lead through the second derivative of the open chain transfer matrix to an XY hamiltonian in a magnetic field which is invariant under a quantum deformed Clifford--Hopf algebra.
