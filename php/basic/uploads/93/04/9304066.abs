Title: Yukawa Couplings involving Excited Twisted Sector States for ${\bf  Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ Orbifolds
Authors: D. Bailin and A. Love and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: A study is made for ${\bf Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ orbifolds of the modification of the form of the twisted sector Yukawa couplings when some of the states involved are excited twisted sectors rather than twisted sector ground states.
