Title: Time Symmetry and Asymmetry in Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Murray Gell-Mann and James B. Hartle
Abstract: We investigate the origin of the arrow of time in quantum mechanics in the context of quantum cosmology. The ``Copenhagen'' quantum mechanics of measured subsystems incorporates a fundamental arrow of time. Extending discussions of Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebovitz, Griffiths, and others we investigate a generalized quantum mechanics for cosmology that utilizes both an initial and a final density matrix to give a time-neutral formulation without a fundamental arrow of time. Time asymmetries can arise for particular universes from differences between their initial and final conditions. Theories for both would be a goal of quantum cosmology. A special initial condition and a final condition of indifference would be sufficient to explain the observed time asymmetries of the universe. In this essay we ask under what circumstances a completely time symmetric universe, with T-symmetric initial and final condition, could be consistent with the time asymmetries of the limited domain of our experience. We discuss the approach to equilibrium, the electromagnetic system, and T-violation in the weak interactions in such universes. The decoherence of alternatives that is necessary for the prediction of probabilities in the quantum mechanics of closed systems is the origin of a fundamental limitation on quantum cosmologies with initial and final conditions. The initial and final density matrices cannot both be pure; if they are there is no decoherence and no prediction.
