Title: A Twistor Formulation of the Non-Heterotic Superstring with Manifest  Worldsheet Supersymmetry
Authors: A. Galperin and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We propose a new formulation of the $D=3$ type II superstring which is manifestly invariant under both target-space $N=2$ supersymmetry and worldsheet $N=(1,1)$ super reparametrizations. This gives rise to a set of twistor (commuting spinor) variables, which provide a solution to the two Virasoro constraints. The worldsheet supergravity fields are shown to play the r\^ole of auxiliary fields.
