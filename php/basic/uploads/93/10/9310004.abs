Title: Fusion algebra at a rational level and cohomology of nilpotent  subalgebras of sl_2
Authors: Boris Feigin and Feodor Malikov
Abstract: We define and calculate the fusion algebra of WZW model at a rational level by cohomological methods. As a byproduct we obtain a cohomological characterization of admissible representations of $\widehat{\gtsl}_{2}$.
