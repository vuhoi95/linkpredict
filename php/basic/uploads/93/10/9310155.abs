Title: Extraction of Black Hole Geometry in Exactly Quantized Two Dimensional  Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Y. Kazama and Y. Satoh
Abstract: Based on our previous work, in which a model of two dimensional dilaton gravity of the type proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger was rigorously quantized, we explicitly demonstrate how one can extract space-time geometry in exactly solvable theory of quantum gravity. In particular, we have been able to produce a prototypical configuration in which a ( smeared ) matter shock wave generates a black hole without naked sigularity.
