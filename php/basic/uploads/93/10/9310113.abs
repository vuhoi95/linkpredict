Title: String Theory and Integrable Systems
Authors: Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: This is mainly a brief review of some key achievements in a `hot'' area of theoretical and mathematical physics. The principal aim is to outline the basic structures underlying {\em integrable} quantum field theory models with {\em infinite-dimensional} symmetry groups which display a radically new type of {\em quantum group} symmetries. Certain particular aspects are elaborated upon with some detail: integrable systems of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili type and their reductions appearing in matrix models of strings; Hamiltonian approach to Lie-Poisson symmetries; quantum field theory approach to two-dimensional relativistic integrable models with dynamically broken conformal invariance. All field-theoretic models in question are of primary relevance to diverse branches of physics ranging from nonlinear hydrodynamics to string theory of fundamental particle interactions at ultra-high energies.
