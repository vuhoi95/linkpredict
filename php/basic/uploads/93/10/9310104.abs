Title: Supersymmetry,Shape Invariance and Exactly Solvable Noncentral  Potentials
Authors: Avinash Khare and Rajat K. Bhaduri
Abstract: Using the ideas of supersymmetry and shape invariance we show that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a wide class of noncentral potentials can be obtained in a closed form by the operator method. This generalization considerably extends the list of exactly solvable potentials for which the solution can be obtained algebraically in a simple and elegant manner. As an illustration, we discuss in detail the example of the potential $$V(r,\theta,\phi)={\omega^2\over 4}r^2 + {\delta\over r^2}+{C\over r^2 sin^2\theta}+{D\over r^2 cos^2\theta} + {F\over r^2 sin^2\theta sin^2 \alpha\phi} +{G\over r^2 sin^2\theta cos^2\alpha\phi}$$ with 7 parameters.Other algebraically solvable examples are also given.
