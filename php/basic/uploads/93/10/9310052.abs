Title: Renormalization Group Approach to Interacting Crumpled Surfaces: The  hierarchical recursion
Authors: M. Cassandro and P. K. Mitter
Abstract: We study the scaling limit of a model of a tethered crumpled D-dimensional random surface interacting through an exclusion condition with a fixed impurity in d-dimensional Euclidean space by the methods of Wilson's renormalization group. In this paper we consider a hierarchical version of the model and we prove rigorously the existence of the scaling limit and convergence to a non-Gaussian fixed point for $1 \leq D< 2$ and $\epsilon >0$ sufficiently small, where $\epsilon = D - (2-D) {d\over 2}$.
