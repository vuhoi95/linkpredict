Title: Hilbert Spaces for Nonrelativistic and Relativistic "Free" Plektons  (Particles with Braid Group Statistics)
Authors: J. Mund and R. Schrader
Abstract: Using the theory of fibre bundles, we provide several equivalent intrinsic descriptions for the Hilbert spaces of $n$ ``free'' nonrelativistic and relativistic plektons in two space dimensions. These spaces carry a ray representation of the Galilei group and a unitary representation of the Poincar\'{e} group respectively. In the relativistic case we also discuss the situation where the braid group is replaced by the ribbon braid group.
