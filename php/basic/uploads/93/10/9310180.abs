Title: Bosonization of a Topological Coset Model and Non-Critical String Theory
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Hisao Suzuki
Abstract: We analyze the relation between a topological coset model based on super $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset and non-critical string theory by using free field realization. We show that the twisted $N=2$ algebra of the coset model can be naturally transformed into that of non-critical string. The screening operators of the coset models can be identified either with those of the minimal matters or with the cosmological constant operator. We also find that another screening operator, which is intrinsic in our approach, becomes the BRST nontrivial state of ghost number $0$ (generator of the ground ring for $c=1$ gravity).
