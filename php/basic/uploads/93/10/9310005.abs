Title: Zooming-in on the SU(2) fundamental domain
Authors: Pierre van Baal and Bas van den Heuvel
Abstract: For SU(2) gauge theories on the three-sphere we analyse the Gribov horizon and the boundary of the fundamental domain in the 18 dimensional subspace that contains the tunnelling path and the sphaleron and on which the energy functional is degenerate to second order in the fields. We prove that parts of this boundary coincide with the Gribov horizon with the help of bounds on the fundamental modular domain.
