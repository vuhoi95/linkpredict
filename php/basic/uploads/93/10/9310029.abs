Title: The Exact Tachyon Beta-Function for the Wess-Zumino-Witten Model
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones
Abstract: We derive an exact expression for the tachyon $\beta$-function for the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We check our result up to three loops by calculating the three-loop tachyon $\beta$-function for a general non-linear $\sigma$-model with torsion, and then specialising to the case of the WZW model.
