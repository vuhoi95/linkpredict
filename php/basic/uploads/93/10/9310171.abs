Title: Example of q-deformed Field Theory
Authors: V. Bardek and M. Doresic and S. Meljanac
Abstract: The non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory with the single-valued anyonic field is proposed as an example of q-deformed field theory. The corresponding q-deformed algebra interpolating between bosons and fermions,both in position and momentum spaces, is analyzed.A possible generalization to a space with an arbitrary dimension is suggested.
