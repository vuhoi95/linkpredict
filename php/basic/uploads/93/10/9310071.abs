Title: Integrability of N = 3 super Yang-Mills equations
Authors: Ch. Devchand and V. Ogievetsky
Abstract: We describe the harmonic superspace formulation of the Witten-Manin supertwistor correspondence for N=3 extended super Yang-Mills theories. The essence is that on being sufficiently supersymmetrised (up to the N=3 extension), the Yang-Mills equations of motion can be recast in the form of Cauchy-Riemann-like holomorphicity conditions for a pair of prepotentials in the appropriate harmonic superspace. This formulation makes the explicit construction of solutions a rather more tractable proposition than previous attempts.
