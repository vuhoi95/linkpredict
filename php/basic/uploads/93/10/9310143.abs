Title: Non-Perturbative interactions in two-dimensional (super) string theory
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Faux and B. Ovrut
Abstract: Non-perturbative interactions in the effective action of two-dimensional bosonic string theory are described. These interactions are due to ``stringy" instantons that are associated with a space-varying coupling parameter. We present progress towards identifying similar non-perturbative interactions in the effective action of two-dimensional superstring theory. We discuss the possible relation to higher dimensional string theory.
