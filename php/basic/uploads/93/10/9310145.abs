Title: Poisson Lie Group Symmetries for the Isotropic Rotator
Authors: G. Marmo and A. Simoni and A. Stern
Abstract: We find a new Hamiltonian formulation of the classical isotropic rotator where left and right $SU(2)$ transformations are not canonical symmetries but rather Poisson Lie group symmetries. The system corresponds to the classical analog of a quantum mechanical rotator which possesses quantum group symmetries. We also examine systems of two classical interacting rotators having Poisson Lie group symmetries.
