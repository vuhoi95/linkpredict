Title: Temperature- and Curvature Dependence of the Chiral Symmetry Breaking in  2D Gauge Theories
Authors: I. Sachs and A. Wipf
Abstract: The partition function and the order parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking are computed for a family of 2-dimensional interacting theories containing the gauged Thirring model. In particular we derive non-perturbative expressions for the dependence of the chiral condensate on the temperature and the curvature. Both, high temperature and high curvature supress the condensate exponentially and we can associate an effective temperature to the curvature.
