Title: Heating Field Theory the ``Environmentally Friendly'' Way!
Authors: M. A. van Ejick and Denjoe O'Connor and C. R. Stephens
Abstract: We discuss how to implement an ``environmentally friendly'' renormalization in the context of finite temperature field theory. Environmentally friendly renormalization provides a method for interpolating between the different effective field theories which characterize different asymptotic regimes. We give explicit two loop Pad\'e resummed results for $\l\ff$ theory for $T>T_c$. We examine the implications for non-Abelian gauge theories.
