Title: Chiral Operator Product Algebra Hidden in Certain Fractional Quantum  Hall Wave Functions
Authors: Xiao-Gang Wen and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: In this paper we study the conditions under which an N-electron wave function for a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state can be viewed as N-point correlation function in a conformal field theory (CFT). Several concrete examples are presented to illustrate, when these condition are satisfied, how to ``derive'' or ``uncover'' relevant operator algebra in the associated CFT from the FQH wave function. Besides the known Pfaffian state, the states studied here include three d-wave paired states, one for spinless electrons and two for spin-1/2 electrons (one of them is the Haldane-Rezayi state). It is suggested that the non-abelian topological order hidden in these states can be characterized by their associated chiral operator product algebra, from which one may infer the quantum numbers of quasi-particles and calculate their wave functions.
