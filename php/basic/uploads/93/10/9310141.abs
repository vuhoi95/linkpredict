Title: Finite temperature effective potential on hyperbolic spacetimes
Authors: Guido Cognola and Klaus Kirsten and Luciano Vanzo and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: The finite temperature one-loop effective potential for a scalar field defined on an ultrastatic spacetime, whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolic manifold, is studied. Different analytic expressions, especially valuable at low and high temperature are derived. Based on these results, the symmetry breaking and the topological mass generation are discussed.
