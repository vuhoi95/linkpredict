Title: Factorization in graviton interactions
Authors: S. Y. Choi and J. S. Shim and H. S. Song
Abstract: The study of factorization in the linearized gravity is extended to the graviton scattering processes with a massive scalar particle, with a massless vector boson and also with a graviton. Every transition amplitude is shown to be completely factorized and the physical implications of their common factors are discussed.
