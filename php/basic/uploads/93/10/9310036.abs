Title: Bose-Einstein condensation for a self-interacting theory in curved  spacetime
Authors: Min-Ho Lee and Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jae Kwan Kim
Abstract: The effective action is derived for a self-interacting theory with a finite fixed $O(2)$ charge at finite temperature in curved spacetime. We obtain the high temperature expansion of the effective action in the weak coupling limit. In the relativistic temperature, we discuss about the phase transition in a homogeneous spacetime.
