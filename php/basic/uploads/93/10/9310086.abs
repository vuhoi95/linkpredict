Title: Effective Critical Exponents for Dimensional Ccrossover and Quantum  Systems from an Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group
Authors: Denjoe O'Connor and C. R. Stephens
Abstract: Series for the Wilson functions of an ``environmentally friendly'' renormalization group are computed to two loops, for an $O(N)$ vector model, in terms of the ``floating coupling'', and resummed by the Pad\'e method to yield crossover exponents for finite size and quantum systems. The resulting effective exponents obey all scaling laws, including hyperscaling in terms of an effective dimensionality, ${d\ef}=4-\gl$, which represents the crossover in the leading irrelevant operator, and are in excellent agreement with known results.
