Title: On the Uniqueness of String Theory
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We show that bosonic strings may be viewed as a particular class of vacua for N=1 superstrings, and N=1 superstrings may be viewed as a particular class of vacua for N=2 strings. Continuing this line of string hierarchies, we are led to search for a universal string theory which includes all the rest as a special vacuum selection.
