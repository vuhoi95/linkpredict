Title: Strings And Non-Topological Solitons
Authors: R. Fiore and D. Galeazzi and L. Masperi and A. Megevand
Abstract: We have numerically calculated topological andnon-topological solitons in two spatial dimensions with Chern-Simons term. Their quantum stability, as well as that of the Maxwell vortex, is analyzed by means of bounce instantons which involve three-dimensional strings and non-topological solitons.
