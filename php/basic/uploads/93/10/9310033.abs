Title: Effective d=2 supersymmetric Lagrangians from d=1 supermatrix models
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Faux and B. Ovrut
Abstract: We discuss $d=1, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric matrix models and exhibit the associated $d=2$ collective field theory in the limit of dense eigenvalues. From this theory we construct, by the addition of several new fields, a $d=2$ supersymmetric effective field theory, which reduces to the collective field theory when the new fields are replaced with their vacuum expectation values. This effective theory is Poincare invariant and contains perturbative and non-perturbative information about the associated superstrings. We exhibit instanton solutions corresponding to the motion of single eigenvalues and discuss their possible role in supersymmetry breaking.
