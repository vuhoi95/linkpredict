Title: Some Exactly Solvable Three-Body Problems in One dimension
Authors: Avinash Khare and Rajat K. Bhaduri
Abstract: The three-body problem in one-dimension with a repulsive inverse square potential between every pair was solved by Calogero. Here, the known results of supersymmetric quantum mechanics are used to propose a number of new three-body potentials which can be solved algebraically. Analytic expressions for the eigenspectrum and the eigenfunctions are given with and without confinement.
