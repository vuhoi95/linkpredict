Title: On the 3d Ising Spin Glass
Authors: E. Marinari and G. Parisi and F. Ritort
Abstract: We study the $3d$ Ising spin glass with $\pm 1$ couplings. We introduce a modified local action. We use finite size scaling techniques and very large lattice simulations. We find that our data are compatible both with a finite $T$ transition and with a $T=0$ singularity of an unusual type.
