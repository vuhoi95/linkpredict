Title: Conformal Field Theory and Geometry of Strings
Authors: Jurg Frohlich and Krzysztof Gawedzki
Abstract: What is quantum geometry? This question is becoming a popular leitmotiv in theoretical physics and in mathematics. Conformal field theory may catch a glimpse of the right answer. We review global aspects of the geometry of conformal fields, such as duality and mirror symmetry, and interpret them within Connes' non-commutative geometry.
