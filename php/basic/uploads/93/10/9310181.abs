Title: Classification of Quantum Hall Universality Classes by $\ W_{1+\infty}\  $ symmetry
Authors: A. Cappelli and C. A. Trugenberger and G. R. Zemba
Abstract: We show how two-dimensional incompressible quantum fluids and their excitations can be viewed as $\ W_{1+\infty}\ $ edge conformal field theories, thereby providing an algebraic characterization of incompressibility. The Kac-Radul representation theory of the $\ W_{1+\infty}\ $ algebra leads then to a purely algebraic complete classification of hierarchical quantum Hall states, which encompasses all measured fractions. Spin-polarized electrons in single-layer devices can only have Abelian anyon excitations.
