Title: Limits on extra dimensions in orbifold compactifications of superstrings
Authors: I. Antoniadis and K. Benakli
Abstract: Perturbative breaking of supersymmetry in four-dimensional string theories predict in general the existence of new large dimensions at the TeV scale. Such dimensions can be consistent with perturbative unification up to the Planck scale in a class of string models and open the exciting possibility of lowering a part of the massive string spectrum at energies accessible to future accelerators. The main signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein excitations which have a very particular structure, strongly correlated with the supersymmetry breaking mechanism. We present a model independent analysis of the physics of these states in the context of orbifold compactifications of the heterotic superstring. In particular, we compute the limits on the size of large dimensions used to break supersymmetry.
