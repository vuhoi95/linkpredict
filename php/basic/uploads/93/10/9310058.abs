Title: Massless integrable quantum field theories and massless scattering in  1+1 dimensions
Authors: P. Fendley and H. Saleur
Abstract: These lecture notes provide an elementary introduction to the study of massless integrable quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions using ``massless scattering''. Some previously unpublished results are also presented, including a non-perturbative study of Virasoro conserved quantities.
