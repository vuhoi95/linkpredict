Title: On the Stability and Single-Particle Properties of Bosonized Fermi  Liquids
Authors: A. Houghton and H. -J. Kwon and J. B. Marston
Abstract: We study the stability and single-particle properties of Fermi liquids in spatial dimensions greater than one via bosonization. For smooth non-singular Fermi liquid interactions we obtain Shankar's renormalization- group flows and reproduce well known results for quasi-particle lifetimes. We demonstrate by explicit calculation that spin-charge separation does not occur when the Fermi liquid interactions are regular. We also explore the relationship between quantized bosonic excitations and zero sound modes and present a concise derivation of both the spin and the charge collective mode equations. Finally we discuss some aspects of singular Fermi liquid interactions.
