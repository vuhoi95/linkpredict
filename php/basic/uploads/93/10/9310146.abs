Title: A Generalized Gauge Invariant Regularization of the Schwinger Model
Authors: G. Bhattacharya and A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: The Schwinger model is studied with a new one - parameter class of gauge invariant regularizations that generalizes the usual point - splitting or Fujikawa schemes. The spectrum is found to be qualitatively unchanged, except for a limiting value of the regularizing parameter, where free fermions appear in the spectrum.
