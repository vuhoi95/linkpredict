Title: Wilson loop for large N Yang-Mills theory on a two-dimensional sphere
Authors: Jean-Marc DAUL and Vladimir A. KAZAKOV
Abstract: We calculate various Wilson loop averages in a pure $SU(N)$-gauge theory on a two-dimensional sphere, in the large $N$ limit. The results can be expressed through the density of rows in the most probable Young tableau. They are valid in both phases (small and large areas of the sphere). All averages for self-intersecting loops can be reproduced from the average for a simple (non self-intersecting) loop by means of loop equations.
