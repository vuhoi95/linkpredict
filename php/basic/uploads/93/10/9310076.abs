Title: Hamiltonian Reduction and Topological Conformal Algebra in $c\leq 1$  Non-critical Strings
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Hiroaki Kanno
Abstract: We study the hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie superalgebra $sl(2|1)^{(1)}$. Based on a scalar Lax operator formalism, we derive the free field realization of the classical topological topological algebra which appears in the $c\leq1$ non-critical strings. In the quantum case, we analyze the BRST cohomology to get the quantum free field expression of the algebra.
