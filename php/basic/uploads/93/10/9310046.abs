Title: Interactions in the SL(2,R)/U(1) Black Hole Background
Authors: K. Becker and M. Becker
Abstract: We calculate two- and three-point tachyon amplitudes of the SL(2,R)/U(1) two-dimensional Euclidean black hole for spherical topologies in the continuum approach proposed by Bershadsky and Kutasov. We find an interesting relation to the tachyon scattering amplitudes of standard non-critical string theory.
