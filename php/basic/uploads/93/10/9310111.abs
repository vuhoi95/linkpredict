Title: Landau gauge within the Gribov horizon
Authors: Nicola Maggiore and Martin Schaden
Abstract: We consider a model which effectively restricts the functional integral of Yang--Mills theories to the fundamental modular region. Using algebraic arguments, we prove that this theory has the same divergences as ordinary Yang Mills theory in the Landau gauge and that it is unitary. The restriction of the functional integral is interpreted as a kind of spontaneous breakdown of the $BRS$ symmetry.
