Title: BPST instanton and Spin from inequivalent quantizations
Authors: David McMullan and Izumi Tsutsui
Abstract: We present a simple alternative to Mackey's account of the (infinite) inequivalent quantizations possible on a coset space G/H. Our reformulation is based on the reduction ${\rm G \rightarrow G/H}$ and employs a generalized form of Dirac's approach to the quantization of constrained systems. When applied to the four-sphere $S^4 \simeq {\rm Spin(5)/Spin(4)}$, the inequivalent quantizations induce relativistic spin and a background BPST instanton; thus they might provide a natural account of both of these physical entities.
