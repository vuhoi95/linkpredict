Title: Composite gauge field models with broken symmetries
Authors: B. S. Balakrishna and K. T. Mahanthappa
Abstract: We present a generalization of the non-Abelian version of the $CP^{N-1}$ models (also known as Grassmannian models) that involve composite gauge fields to accommodate partial breaking of the non-Abelian gauge symmetry. For this to be possible, in most cases, the constituent fields need to belong to an anomaly free complex representation. Symmetry is broken dynamically for large $N$ primarily by a naturally generated composite scalar which simulates Higgs mechanism. In the example studied in some detail, the gauge group SO(10) gets broken down to subgroups like SU(5) or SU(5)$\times$U(1).
