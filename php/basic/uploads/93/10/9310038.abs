Title: Quantum Limits for Measurements on Macroscopic Bodies : A Decoherence  Analysis
Authors: Carlos O. Escobar and Lea Ferreira dos Santos and Paulo C. Marques
Abstract: We consider in this paper the quantum limits for measurements on macroscopic bodies which are obtained in a novel way employing the concept of decoherence coming from an analysis of the quantum mechanics of dissipative systems. Two cases are analysed, the free mass and the harmonic oscillator, and for both systems we compare our approach with previous treatments of such limits.
