Title: Functional Relations in Solvable Lattice Models II
Authors: Atsuo Kuniba and Tomoki Nakanishi and Junji Suzuki
Abstract: Reported are two applications of the functional relations ($T$-system) among a commuting family of row-to-row transfer matrices proposed in the previous paper Part I. For a general simple Lie algebra $X_r$, we determine the correlation lengths of the associated massive vertex models in the anti-ferroelectric regime and central charges of the RSOS models in two critical regimes. The results reproduce known values or even generalize them, demonstrating the efficiency of the $T$-system.
