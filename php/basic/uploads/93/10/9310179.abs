Title: Algebraic structure of Gravity with Torsion
Authors: O. Moritsch and M. Schweda and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: The BRS transformations for gravity with torsion are discussed by using the Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. With the help of an operator $\d$ which allows to decompose the exterior space-time derivative as a BRS commutator we solve the Wess-Zumino consistency condition corresponding to invariant Lagrangians and anomalies.
