Title: The Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard Model
Authors: D. B. Uglov and V. E. Korepin
Abstract: We discovered new hidden symmetry of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We showthat the one-dimensional Hubbard model on the infinite chain has the infinite-dimensional algebra of symmetries. This algebra is a direct sum of two $ sl(2) $-Yangians. This $ Y(sl(2)) \oplus Y(sl(2)) $ symmetry is an extension of the well-known $ sl(2) \oplus sl(2) $ . The deformation parameters of the Yangians are equal up to the signs to the coupling constant of the Hubbard model hamiltonian.
