Title: Inter-Relations of Solvable Potentials
Authors: Asim Gangopadhyaya and Prasanta K. Panigrahi and Uday P. Sukhatme
Abstract: Solvable Natanzon potentials in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics are known to group into two disjoint classes depending on whether the Schr\"odinger equation can be reduced to a hypergeometric or a confluent hypergeometric equation. All the potentials within each class are connected via point canonical transformations. We establish a connection between the two classes with appropriate limiting procedures and redefinition of parameters, thereby inter-relating all known solvable potentials.
