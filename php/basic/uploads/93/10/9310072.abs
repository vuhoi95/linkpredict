Title: The super self-dual matreoshka
Authors: Ch. Devchand and V. Ogievetsky
Abstract: In this talk we review the harmonic space formulation of the twistor transform for the supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The recently established harmonic-twistor correspondence for the N-extended supersymmetric gauge theories is described. It affords an explicit construction of solutions to these equations which displays a remarkable matreoshka-like structure determined by the N=0 core.
