Title: SU(2)xSU(2) Invariant Scattering Matrix of the Hubbard Model
Authors: Fabian H. L. Essler and Vladimir E. Korepin
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model. We show that the excitation spectrum is given by the scattering states of four elementary excitations, which form the fundamental representation of $SU(2)\times SU(2)$. We determine the exact two-particle Scattering matrix, which a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation and reflects the $SO(4)$ symmetry of the model. The results for repulsive and attractive Hubbard model are related by an interchange of spin and charge degrees of freedom.
