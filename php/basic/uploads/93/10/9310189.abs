Title: Anyons as quon particles
Authors: V. Bardek and M. Doresic and S. Meljanac
Abstract: The momentum operator representation of nonrelativistic anyons is developed in the Chern - Simons formulation of fractional statistics. The connection between anyons and the q-deformed bosonic algebra is established.
