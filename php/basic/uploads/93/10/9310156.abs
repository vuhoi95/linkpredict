Title: Space-time Geometry in Exactly Solvable Quantum Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Y. Kazama and Y. Satoh
Abstract: We describe in detail how one can extract space-time geometry in an exactly solvable model of quantum dilaton gravity of the type proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger ( CGHS ). Based on our previous work, in which a model with 24 massless matter scalars was quantized rigorously in BRST operator formalism, we compute, without approximation, mean values of the matter stress-energy tensor, the inverse metric and some related quantities in a class of coherent physical states constructed in a specific gauge within the conformal gauge. Our states are so designed as to describe a variety of space-time in which in-falling matter energy distribution produces a black hole with or without naked sigularity. In particular, we have been able to produce the prototypical configuration first discovered by CGHS, in which a ( smeared ) matter shock wave produces a black hole without naked sigularity.
