Title: Off-Shell Bethe Ansatz Equation for Gaudin Magnets and Solutions of  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equations
Authors: H. M. Babujian and R. Flume
Abstract: We generalize the previously established connection between the off-shell Bethe ansatz equation for inhomogeneous SU(2) lattice vertex models in the quasiclassical limit and the solutions of the SU(2) Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations to the case of arbitrary simple Lie algebras.
