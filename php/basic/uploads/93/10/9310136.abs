Title: Two Ising Models Coupled to 2-Dimensional Gravity
Authors: Mark Bowick and Marco Falcioni and Geoffrey Harris and Enzo Marinari
Abstract: To investigate the properties of $c=1$ matter coupled to $2$d{--}gravity we have performed large-scale simulations of two copies of the Ising Model on a dynamical lattice. We measure spin susceptibility and percolation critical exponents using finite-size scaling. We show explicitly how logarithmic corrections are needed for a proper comparison with theoretical exponents. We also exhibit correlations, mediated by gravity, between the energy and magnetic properties of the two Ising species. The prospects for extending this work beyond $c=1$ are addressed.
