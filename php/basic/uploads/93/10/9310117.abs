Title: Quantum $Îº$-Poincare in Any Dimensions
Authors: Jerzy Lukierski and Henri Ruegg
Abstract: The $\kappa$-deformation of the D-dimensional Poincar\'e algebra $(D\geq 2)$ with any signature is given. Further the quadratic Poisson brackets, determined by the classical $r$-matrix are calculated, and the quantum Poincar\'e group "with noncommuting parameters" is obtained.
