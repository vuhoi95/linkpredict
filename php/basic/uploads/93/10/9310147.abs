Title: Currents on Grassmann algebras
Authors: R. Coquereaux and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We define currents on a Grassmann algebra $Gr(N)$ with $N$ generators as distributions on its exterior algebra (using the symmetric wedge product). We interpret the currents in terms of ${\Z}_2$-graded Hochschild cohomology and closed currents in terms of cyclic cocycles (they are particular multilinear forms on $Gr(N)$). An explicit construction of the vector space of closed currents of degree $p$ on $Gr(N)$ is given by using Berezin integration.
