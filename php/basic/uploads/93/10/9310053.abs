Authors: V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and P. Vitale and F. Zaccaria
Abstract: For all three--dimensional Lie algebras the construction of generators in terms of functions on 4-dimensional real phase space is given with a realization of the Lie product in terms of Poisson brackets. This is the classical Jordan--Schwinger map which is also given for the deformed algebras ${\cal {SL}}_{q}(2,\R)$, ${\cal E}_{q} (2)$ and ${\cal H}_q(1)$. The ${\cal U}_{q}(n)$ algebra is discussed in the same context.
