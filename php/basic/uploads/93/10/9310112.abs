Title: A WZW model based on a non-semi-simple group
Authors: C. R. Nappi and E. Witten
Abstract: We present a conformal field theory which desribes a homogeneous four dimensional Lorentz-signature space-time. The model is an ungauged WZW model based on a central extension of the Poincar\'e algebra. The central charge of this theory is exactly four, just like four dimensional Minkowski space. The model can be interpreted as a four dimensional monochromatic plane wave. As there are three commuting isometries, other interesting geometries are expected to emerge via $O(3,3)$ duality.
