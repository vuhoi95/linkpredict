Title: Minimum Uncertainty, Coherence and Squeezing in Diffusion Processes, and  Stochastic Quantization
Authors: Salvatore De Martino and Silvio De Siena and Fabrizio Illuminati and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We show that uncertainty relations, as well as minimum uncertainty coherent and squeezed states, are structural properties for diffusion processes. Through Nelson stochastic quantization we derive the stochastic image of the quantum mechanical coherent and squeezed states.
