Abstract: We analyze a possibility of experimental detection of the contribution of the Kaluza-Klein tower of heavy particles to scattering cross-section in a six-dimensional scalar model with two dimensions being compactified to the torus with the radii $R$. It is shown that there is a noticeable effect even for the energies of colliding particles below $R^{-1}$ which may be observed in future collider experiments if $R^{-1}$ is of the order of $1 TeV$.
