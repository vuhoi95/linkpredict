Title: Spacetime Topology Change: The Physics of Calabi-Yau Moduli Space
Authors: P. S. Aspinwall and B. R. Greene and D. R. Morrison
Abstract: We review recent work which has significantly sharpened our geometric understanding and interpretation of the moduli space of certain $N$=2 superconformal field theories. This has resolved some important issues in mirror symmetry and has also established that string theory admits physically smooth processes which can result in a change in topology of the spatial universe.
