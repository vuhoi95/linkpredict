Title: Optimized Perturbation Methods for the Free Energy of the Anharmonic  Oscillator
Authors: Kostas Vlachos and Anna Okopinska
Abstract: Two possibile applications of the optimized expansion for the free energy of the quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator are discussed. The first method is for the finite temperature effective potential; the second one, for the classical effective potential. The results of both methods show a quick convergence and agree well with the exact free energy in the whole range of temperatures.
