Abstract: In the numerical simulation of certain field theoretical models, the complex Langevin simulation has been believed to fail due to the violation of ergodicity. We give a detailed analysis of this problem based on a toy model with one degree of freedom ($S=-\beta\cos\theta$). We find that the failure is not due to the defect of complex Langevin simulation itself, but rather to the way how one treats the singularity appearing in the drift force. An effective algorithm is proposed by which one can simulate the ${1/\beta}$ behaviour of the expectation value $<\cos\theta>$ in the small $\beta$ limit.
