Title: No generalized statistics from dynamics in curved spacetime
Authors: J. W. Goodison and D. J. Toms
Abstract: We consider quon statistics in a dynamically evolving curved spacetime in which prior to some initial time and subsequent to some later time is flat. By considering the Bogoliubov transformations associated with gravitationally induced particle creation, we find that the consistent evolution of the generalized commutation relations from the first flat region to the second flat region can only occur if $q = \pm 1$.
