Title: Light-Cone Quantization of Gauge Fields
Authors: Gary McCartor and David G. Robertson
Abstract: Light-cone quantization of gauge field theory is considered. With a careful treatment of the relevant degrees of freedom and where they must be initialized, the results obtained in equal-time quantization are recovered, in particular the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt form of the gauge field propagator. Some aspects of the ``discretized'' light-cone quantization of gauge fields are discussed.
