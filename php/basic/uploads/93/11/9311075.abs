Title: Regular Representation of the Quantum Heisenberg Double $U_q(sl(2))$,  $Fun_{q}(SL(2))$ ($q$ is a root of unity)
Authors: D. V. Gluschenkov and A. V. Lyakhovskaya
Abstract: Pairing between the universal enveloping algebra $U_q(sl(2))$ and the algebra of functions over $SL_q(2)$ is obtained in explicit terms. The regular representation of the quantum double is constructed and investigated. The structure of the root subspaces of the Casimir operator is revealed and described in terms of $SL_q(2)$ elements.
