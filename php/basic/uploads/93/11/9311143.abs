Title: On Periods for String Compactifications
Authors: P. Berglund and E. Derrick and T. HÃ¼bsch and D. Jancic
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the computation of periods for string compactifications with $c=9$, we develop a complementary method which also produces a convenient basis for related calculations. The models are realized as Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of dimension four or as Landau-Ginzburg vacua. The calculation reproduces known results and also allows a treatment of Landau--Ginzburg orbifolds with more than five fields.
