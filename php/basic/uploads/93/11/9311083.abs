Title: Conformally Invariant Off-shell Strings
Authors: R. C. Myers and V. Periwal
Abstract: Recent advances in non-critical string theory allow a unique continuation of critical Polyakov string amplitudes to off-shell momenta, while preserving conformal invariance. These continuations possess unusual, apparently stringy, characteristics, as we illustrate with our results for three-point functions. (Talk by R.C.M. at Strings '93)
