Title: Particles with distance dependent statistics at low temperatures
Authors: S. V. Mashkevich and G. M. Zinovjev
Abstract: We consider a simplified model of particles with effectively distance dependent statistics, that is particles coupled to a gauge field the Lagrangian of which contains the Chern-Simons term. We analyze the low-lying states of the two-particle system and show that under certain conditions they can exhibit negative compressibility, hinting on a possible \`a la van der Vaals picture.
