Title: Sewing Constraints and Non-Orientable Open Strings
Authors: D. Fioravanti and G. Pradisi and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: We extend to non-orientable surfaces previous work on sewing constraints in Conformal Field Theory. A new constraint, related to the real projective plane, is described and is used to illustrate the correspondence with a previous construction of open-string spectra.
