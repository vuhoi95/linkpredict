Title: Supergravity in $2+Îµ$ Dimensions
Authors: S. Kojima and N. Sakai and Y. Tanii
Abstract: Supergravity theory in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions is studied. It is invariant under supertransformations in 2 and 3 dimensions. One-loop divergence is explicitly computed in the background field method and a nontrivial fixed point is found. In quantizing the supergravity, a gauge fixing condition is devised which explicitly isolates conformal and superconformal modes. The renormalization of the gravitationally dressed operators is studied and their anomalous dimensions are computed. Problems to use the dimensional reduction are also examined.
