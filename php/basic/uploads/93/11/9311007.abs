Title: Equivalent Quantisations of (2+1)-Dimensional Gravity
Authors: S. Carlip and J. E. Nelson
Abstract: For spacetimes with the topology $\IR\!\times\!T^2$, the action of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant $\La$ is written uniquely in terms of the time-independent traces of holonomies around two intersecting noncontractible paths on $T^2$. The holonomy parameters are related to the moduli on slices of constant mean curvature by a time-dependent canonical transformation which introduces an effective Hamiltonian. The quantisation of the two classically equivalent formulations differs by terms of order $O(\hbar^3)$, negligible for small $|\La|$.
