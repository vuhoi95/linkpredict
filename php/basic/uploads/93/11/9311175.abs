Title: Duality of a Generalized Gauge Invariant Ising Model on Random Surfaces
Authors: Z. B. Li and B. Zheng and L. Sch√ºlke
Abstract: A generalized gauge invariant Ising model on random surfaces with non-trivial topology is proposed and investigated with the dual transformation. It is proved that the model is self-dual in case of a self-dual lattice. In special cases the model reduces to the known solvable Ising-type models.
