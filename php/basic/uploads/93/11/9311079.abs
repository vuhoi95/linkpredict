Title: One-Loop Renormalization of Higher-Derivative 2D Dilaton Gravity
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. Naftulin and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: A theory of higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity which has its roots in the massive higher-spin mode dynamics of string theory is suggested. The divergences of the effective action to one-loop are calculated, both in the covariant and in the conformal gauge. Some technical problems which appear in the calculations are discussed. An interpretation of the theory as a particular D=2 higher-derivative $\sigma$-model is given. For a specific case of higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity, which is one loop multiplicatively renormalizable, static configurations corresponding to black holes are shown to exist.
