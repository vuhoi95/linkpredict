Title: On the algebraic structures connected with the linear Poisson brackets  of hydrodynamics type
Authors: A. A. Balinsky and A. I. Balinsky
Abstract: The generalized form of the Kac formula for Verma modules associated with linear brackets of hydrodynamics type is proposed. Second cohomology groups of the generalized Virasoro algebras are calculated. Connection of the central extensions with the problem of quntization of hydrodynamics brackets is demonstrated.
