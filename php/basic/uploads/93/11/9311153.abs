Title: Derivative and higher order extensions of Davey-Stewartson equation from  matrix KP hierarchy
Authors: Anjan Kundu and Walter Strampp
Abstract: It is shown that the matrix KP hierarchy can yield new integrable equations in $(2+1)$-dimensions along with the corresponding Lax pair. For particular gauge choice this may result derivative and also a higher order nonlinear extension of the Devay-Stewartson equation (DSE),the higher order DSE being a higher dimensional generalisation of the Kundu- Eckhaus equation. Such gauge transformation is shown also to produce significant extensions to the constrained matrix KP system.
