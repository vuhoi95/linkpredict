Title: Covariant Quantization Of Green Schwarz Superstring
Authors: A. Restuccia and J. Stephany
Abstract: We describe a canonical covariant approach to the quantization of the Green-Schwarz superstring. The approach is first applied to the canonical covariant quantization of the Brink and Schwarz superparticle. The Kallosh action is obtained in this case, with the correct BRST cohomology.
