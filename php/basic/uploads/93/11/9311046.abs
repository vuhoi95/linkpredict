Title: Computing the Mass of a Magnetic Monopole in SU(2) Gauge Theory
Authors: J. Smit and A. J. van der Sijs
Abstract: A single magnetic monopole in pure SU(2) gauge theory is simulated on the lattice and its mass is computed in the full quantum theory. The results are relevant for our proposed realization of the dual superconductor hypothesis of confinement.
