Title: 2D Ising Model with a Defect Line
Authors: D. C. Cabra and C. M. Na√≥n
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional Ising model with a defect line and evaluate multipoint energy correlation functions using non-perturbative field-theoretical methods. We also discuss the evaluation of the two spin correlator on the defect line.
