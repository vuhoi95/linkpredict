Title: Distance dependent statistics in a P,T-invariant model
Authors: E. V. Gorbar and S. V. Mashkevich
Abstract: It is shown that in the P,T-invariant model with the mixed Chern-Simons term the interaction of charge carriers leads to effective changing of their statistics, which depends on distance between them. In particular, in the limit of large distances fermions effectively turn into bosons.
