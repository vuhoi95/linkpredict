Title: Quantization of the external algebra on a Poisson-Lie group
Authors: G. E. Arutyunov and P. B. Medvedev
Abstract: We show that the external algebra $\cal M$ on $GL(N)$ can be equipped with the graded Poisson brackets compatible with the group action. We prove that there are only two graded Poisson-Lie structures (brackets) on $\cal M$ and we obtain their explicit description. We realize that just these two structures appear as the quasiclassical limit of the bicovariant differential calculi on the quantum linear group $GL_q (N)$.
