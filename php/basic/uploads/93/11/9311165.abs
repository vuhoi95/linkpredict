Title: Local Magnetization in Critical Ising Model with Boundary Magnetic Field
Authors: R. Chatterjee and A. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We discribe a simple way to derive spin correlation functions in 2D Ising model at critical temperature but with nonzero magnetic field at the boundary. Local magnetization (i.e. one-point function) is computed explicitly for half-plane and disk geometries.
