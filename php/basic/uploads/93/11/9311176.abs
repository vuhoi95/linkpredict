Title: Cosmic Censorship Violation for a Class of Supersymmetric Solitons
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Donam Youm
Abstract: We study vacuum domain walls in a class of four-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity theories where along with the matter field, forming the wall, there is more than one ``dilaton'', each respecting $SU(1,1)$ symmetry in their sub-sector. We find {\it supersymmetric} (planar, static) walls, interpolaing between Minkowski vacuum and a new class of supersymmetric vacua which have a naked (planar) singularity. Such walls provide the first example of supersymmetric classical ``solitons'' with naked singularities, and thus violate the (strong) cosmic censorship conjecture within a supersymmetric theory.
