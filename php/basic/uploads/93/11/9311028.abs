Title: Matrix Versions of the Calogero Model
Authors: O. V. Dodlov and S. E. Konstein and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Matrix generalizations of the N-particle quantum-mechanical Calogero model classifying according to representations of the symmetric group $S_N$ are considered. Symmetry properties of the eigen-wave functions in the matrix Calogero models are analyzed. Latex.
