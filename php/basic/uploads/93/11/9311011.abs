Title: Is the Lowest Order Supersymmetric WKB Approximation Exact for All Shape  Invariant Potentials ?
Authors: D. T. Barclay and Avinash Khare and U. Sukhatme
Abstract: It has previously been proved that the lowest order supersymmetric WKB approximation reproduces the exact bound state spectrum of shape invariant potentials. We show that this is not true for a new, recently discovered class of shape invariant potentials and analyse the reasons underlying this breakdown of the usual proof.
