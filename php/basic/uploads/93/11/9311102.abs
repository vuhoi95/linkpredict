Title: On the Infrared Limit of Two Dimensional QCD
Authors: A. J. Niemi and P. Pasanen
Abstract: We study the infrared limit of two dimensional QCD, with massless dynamical Dirac fermions that are in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. We find that the theory reduces to a spin generalization of the Calogero model with an additional magnetic coupling which is of the Pauli type.
