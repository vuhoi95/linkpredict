Title: A Class of String Backgrounds as a Semiclassical Limit of WZW Models
Authors: D. I. Olive and E. Rabinovici and A. Schwimmer
Abstract: A class of string backgrounds associated with non semi-simple groups is obtained as a special large level limit of ordinary WZW models. The models have an integer Virasoro central charge and they include the background recently studied by Nappi and Witten.
