Title: Integrable QFT(2) Encoded on Products of Dynkin Diagrams
Authors: E. Quattrini and F. Ravanini and R. Tateo
Abstract: A large class of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations governing the Renormalization Group evolution of the Casimir energy of the vacuum on the cylinder for an integrable two-dimensional field theory, can often be encoded on a tensor product of two graphs. We demonstrate here that in this case the two graphs can only be of $ADE$ type. We also give strong numerical evidence for a new large set of Dilogarithm sum Rules connected to $ADE\times ADE$ and a simple formula for the ultraviolet perturbing operator conformal dimensions only in terms of rank and Coxeter numbers of $ADE\times ADE$. We conclude with some remarks on the curious case $ADE\times D$.
