Abstract: In this paper we present a new series of 3-dimensional integrable lattice models with $N$ colors. The case $N=2$ generalizes the elliptic model of our previous paper. The weight functions of the models satisfy modified tetrahedron equations with $N$ states and give a commuting family of two-layer transfer-matrices. The dependence on the spectral parameters corresponds to the static limit of the modified tetrahedron equations and weights are parameterized in terms of elliptic functions. The models contain two free parameters: elliptic modulus and additional parameter $\eta$. Also we briefly discuss symmetry properties of weight functions of the models.
