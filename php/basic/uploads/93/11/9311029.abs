Title: Quantisation of 2+1 gravity for genus 2
Authors: J. E. Nelson and T. Regge
Abstract: In [1,2] we established and discussed the algebra of observables for $2+1$ gravity at both the classical and quantum level, and gave a systematic discussion of the reduction of the expected number of independent observables to $6g - 6 (g > 1)$. In this paper the algebra of observables for the case $g=2$ is reduced to a very simple form. A Hilbert space of state vectors is defined and its representations are discussed using a deformation of the Euler-Gamma function. The deformation parameter $\th$ depends on the cosmological and Planck's constants.
