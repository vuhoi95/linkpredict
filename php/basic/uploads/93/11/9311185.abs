Title: Exact String Theory Instantons by Dimensional Reduction
Authors: C. Bachas and E. Kiritsis
Abstract: We identify exact gauge-instanton-like solutions to (super)-string theory using the method of dimensional reduction. We find in particular the Polyakov instanton of 3d QED, and a class of generalized Yang-Mills merons. We discuss their marginal deformations, and show that for the $3d$ instanton they correspond to a dissociation of vector- and axial-magnetic charges.
