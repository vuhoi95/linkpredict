Title: On the Meissner effect in SU(2) lattice gauge theory
Authors: P. Cea and L. Cosmai
Abstract: We investigate the dual superconductor model of color confinement in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We find that the transverse distribution of the longitudinal chromoelectric field between static quarks displays the dual Meissner effect. We also give evidence that the problem of color confinement could be approached in the framework of the 't~Hooft's Abelian projection.
