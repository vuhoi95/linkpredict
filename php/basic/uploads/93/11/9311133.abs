Title: Formation and Evaporation of a Naked Singularity in 2D Gravity
Authors: Cenalo Vaz and Louis Witten
Abstract: We describe a classical configuration of conformal matter forming a naked singularity and discuss its subsequent Hawking evaporation within the context of two dimensional dilaton gravity. The one loop analysis is credible for a large mass naked singularity and suggests the existence of a weak cosmological censorship that would cause it to explode into radiation upon forming.
