Title: Symmetries in a Polynomial Formulation of the Non-Linear Sigma-Model
Authors: C. D. Fosco and R. C. Trinchero
Abstract: We study the realisation of global symmetries in a polynomial formulation of the non-linear sigma-model. We show that there are global symmetries whose corresponding Noether currents are the topological currents in the usual formulation. The usual Noether currents associated with the internal symmetry group are reproduced, but part of them become non-local in terms of the dynamical variables of the polynomial formulation.
