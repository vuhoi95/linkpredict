Abstract: The oscillations of photon distribution function for squeezed and correlated light are shown to decrease when the temperature increases.The influence of the squeezing parameter and photon quadrature correlation coefficient on the photon distribution oscillations at nonzero temperatures is studied. The connection of deformation of Planck distribution formula with oscillations of distribution for squeezed and correlated light is discussed.
