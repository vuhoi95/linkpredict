Title: A Clifford Dyadic Superfield from Bilateral Interactions of Geometric  Multispin Dirac Theory
Authors: William Pezzaglia and Alfred Differ
Abstract: Multivector quantum mechanics utilizes wavefunctions which are Clifford aggregates (e.g. sum of scalar, vector, bivector). This is equivalent to multi- spinors constructed of Dirac matrices, with the representation independent form of the generators geometrically interpreted as the basis vectors of spacetime. Multiple generations of particles appear as left ideals of the algebra, coupled only by now-allowed right-side applied (dextral) operations. A generalized bilateral (two-sided operation) coupling is proposed which includes the above mentioned dextrad field, and the spin-gauge interaction as particular cases. This leads to a new principle of {\it poly-dimensional covariance}, in which physical laws are invariant under the reshuffling of coordinate geometry. Such a multigeometric superfield equation is proposed, which is sourced by a bilateral current. In order to express the superfield in representation and coordinate free form, we introduce Eddington E-F {\it double-frame} numbers. Symmetric tensors can now be represented as 4D ``dyads", which actually are elements of a global 8D Clifford algebra. As a restricted example, the dyadic field created by the Greider-Ross multivector current (of a Dirac electron) describes both electromagnetic and Morris- Greider gravitational interactions.
