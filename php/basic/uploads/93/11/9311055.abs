Title: Supersymmetry and Bogomol'nyi equations in the Abelian Higgs Model
Authors: José Edelstein and Carlos Nuñez and Fidel Schaposnik
Abstract: The N=2 supersymmetric extension of the 2+1 dimensional Abelian Higgs model is discussed. By analysing the resulting supercharge algebra, the connection between supersymmetry and Bogomol'nyi equations is clarified. Analogous results are presented when the model is considered in 2-dimensional (Euclidean) space.
