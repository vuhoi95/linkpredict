Authors: M. Chaichian and A. P. Demichev
Abstract: We construct quantum deformation of Poincar\'e group using as a starting point $SU(2,2)$ conformal group and twistor-like definition of the Minkowski space. We obtain quantum deformation of $SU(2,2)$ as a real form of multiparametric $GL(4,C)_{q_{ij},r}$. It is shown that Poincar\'e subgroup exists for special nonstandard one-parametric deformation only, the deformation parameter $r$ being equal to unity. This leads to commuting affine structure of the corresponding Minkowski space and simple structure of the corresponding Lie algebra, the deformation of the group being non-trivial.
