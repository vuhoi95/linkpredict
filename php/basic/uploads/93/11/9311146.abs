Title: Conformal Gauge Generators in Liouville Theory
Authors: M. Blagojević and M. Vasilić and T. Vukašinac
Abstract: The conformal symmetry in the Liouville theory is analysed by using the Hamiltonian light--front formalism. The boundary conditions of dynamical variables are seen to involve an arbitrary function of time, so that the standard methods for studying gauge symmetries do not work. We develop a general method for constructing the gauge generators, which enables a consistent treatment of the boundary conditions present in the case of the conformal symmetry.
