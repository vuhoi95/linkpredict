Title: Mirror Symmetry for Hypersurfaces in Weighted Projective Space and  Topological Couplings
Authors: P. Berglund and S. Katz
Abstract: By means of toric geometry we study hypersurfaces in weighted projective space of dimension four. In particular we compute for a given manifold its intrinsic topological coupling. We find that the result agrees with the calculation of the corresponding coupling on the mirror model in the large complex structure limit.
