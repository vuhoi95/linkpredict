Title: New QCD Results from String Theory
Authors: Z. Bern and L. Dixon and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: We discuss new results in QCD obtained with string-based methods. These methods were originally derived from superstring theory and are significantly more efficient than conventional Feynman rules. This technology was a key ingredient in the first calculation of the one-loop five-gluon amplitude. We also present a conjecture for a particular one-loop helicity amplitude with an arbitrary number of external gluons.
