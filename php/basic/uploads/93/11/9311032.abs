Title: On the top of the energy barrier. Margarita Garcia Perez
Authors: Antonio Gonzalez-Arroyo and Jeroen Snippe and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: We present results related to the search of SU(2) instantons on a geometry $[0,L]^3\times [0,T]$ obtained using over-improved cooling with fixed boundary conditions. We also introduce a criterion for finding a sphaleron at the top of the energy barrier of the instanton path.
