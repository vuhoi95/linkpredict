Title: The differential geometry of Fedosov's quantization
Authors: Claudio Emmrich and Alan Weinstein
Abstract: B. Fedosov has given a simple and very natural construction of a deformation quantization for any symplectic manifold, using a flat connection on the bundle of formal Weyl algebras associated to the tangent bundle of a symplectic manifold. The connection is obtained by affinizing, nonlinearizing, and iteratively flattening a given torsion free symplectic connection. In this paper, a classical analog of Fedosov's operations on connections is analyzed and shown to produce the usual exponential mapping of a linear connection on an ordinary manifold. A symplectic version is also analyzed. Finally, some remarks are made on the implications for deformation quantization of Fedosov's index theorem on general symplectic manifolds.
