Title: A One Dimensional Ideal Gas of Spinons, or Some Exact Results on the XXX  Spin Chain with Long Range Interaction
Authors: D. Bernard and V. Pasquier and D. Serban
Abstract: We describe a few properties of the XXX spin chain with long range interaction. The plan of these notes is: 1. The Hamiltonian 2. Symmetry of the model 3. The irreducible multiplets 4. The spectrum 5. Wave functions and statistics 6. The spinon description 7. The thermodynamics
