Title: Monopole-Catalysed Baryon Decay: A Boundary Conformal Field Theory  Approach
Authors: Ian Affleck and Jacob Sagi
Abstract: Monopole-mediated baryon number violation, the Callan-Rubakov effect, is reexamined using boundary conformal field theory techniques. It is shown that the low-energy behaviour is described simply by free fermions with a conformally invariant boundary condition at the dyon location. When the number of fermion flavours is greater than two, this boundary condition is of a non-trivial type which has not been elucidated previously.
