Title: Exploring the Dynamics of Three-Dimensional Lattice Gauge Theories by  External Fields
Authors: P. Cea and L. Cosmai
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of three-dimensional lattice gauge theories by means of an external Abelian magnetic field. For the SU(2) lattice gauge theory we find evidence of the unstable modes.
