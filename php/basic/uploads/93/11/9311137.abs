Title: On the W-gravity spectrum and its G-structure
Authors: P. Bouwknegt and J. Mccarthy and K. Pilch
Abstract: We present results for the BRST cohomology of $\cW[\bfg]$ minimal models coupled to $\cW[\bfg]$ gravity, as well as scalar fields coupled to $\cW[\bfg]$ gravity. In the latter case we explore an intricate relation to the (twisted) $\bfg$ cohomology of a product of two twisted Fock modules.
