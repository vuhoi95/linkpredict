Title: Particle Physics Models, Grand Unification, and Gravity in  Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and J. Fr√∂hlich
Abstract: We review the construction of particle physics models in the framework of non-commutative geometry. We first give simple examples, and then progress to outline the Connes-Lott construction of the standard Weinberg-Salam model and our construction of the SO(10) model. We then discuss the analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action and gravitational matter couplings. Finally we speculate on some experimental signatures of predictions specific to the non-commutative approach.
