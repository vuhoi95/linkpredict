Title: Quantum Bubble Dynamics in 2+1 Dimensional Gravity I: Geometrodynamic  Approach
Authors: H. Zaidi and J. Gegenberg
Abstract: The Dirac quantization of a 2+1 dimensional bubble is performed. The bubble consists of a string forming a boundary between two regions of space-time with distinct geometries. The ADM constraints are solved and the coupling to the string is introduced through the boundary conditions. The wave functional is obtained and the quantum uncertainty in the radius of the ring is calculated; this uncertainty becomes large at the Planck scale.
