Title: Path Integral Approach to Two-Dimensional QCD in the Light-Front
Authors: P. Gaete and J. Gamboa and I. Schmidt
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum cromodynamics in the light-front frame is studied following hamiltonian methods. The theory is quantized using the path integral formalism and an effective theory similar to the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model is obtained. Confinement in two dimensions is derived analyzing directly the constraints in the path integral.
