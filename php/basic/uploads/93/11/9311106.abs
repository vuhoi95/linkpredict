Authors: S. C. S. Silva and P. C. R. C. Mello and M. C. Nemes
Abstract: In the present contribution we show that the introduction of a conserved axial current in electrodynamics can explain the quantization of electric charge, preserving parity conservation, and introduces a dynamical discreteness into space-time.
