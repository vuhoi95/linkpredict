Title: Anyonic Construction of the $SL_{Q,s}(2)$ Algebra
Authors: J. L. Matheus-Valle and M. R-Monteiro
Abstract: Considering anyonic oscillators in a two-dimensional lattice, we realize the quantum semi-group $sl_{(q,s)}(2)$ by means of a generalized Schwinger construction. We find that the parameter $q$ of the algebra is connected to the statistical parameter, whereas the $s$ parameter is related to a $s$-deformed oscillator introduced at each point of the lattice.
