Title: Physical Scaling and Renormalization Group in Two-Dimensional Gravity
Authors: Y. Tanii and S. Kojima and N. Sakai
Abstract: Quantum gravitational effects on the renormalization group equation are studied in the $(2+\epsilon)$-dimensional approach. Divergences in a matter one-loop effective action do not receive gravitational radiative corrections. The renormalization factor for beta functions recently found by Klebanov, Kogan and Polyakov is obtained by using the renormalized cosmological constant to define the physical scale transformation.
