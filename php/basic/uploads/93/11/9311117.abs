Title: Six-loop divergences in the supersymmetric Kahler sigma model
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and J. Panvel
Abstract: The two-dimensional supersymmetric $\s$-model on a K\"ahler manifold has a non-vanishing $\b$-function at four loops, but the $\b$-function at five loops can be made to vanish by a specific choice of renormalisation scheme. We investigate whether this phenomenon persists at six loops, and conclude that it does not; there is a non-vanishing six-loop $\b$-function irrespective of renormalisation scheme ambiguities.
