Title: Flux-Confinement in Dilatonic Cosmic Strings
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and C. G. Wells
Abstract: We study dilaton-electrodynamics in flat spacetime and exhibit a set of global cosmic string like solutions in which the magnetic flux is confined. These solutions continue to exist for a small enough dilaton mass but cease to do so above a critcal value depending on the magnetic flux. There also exist domain wall and Dirac monopole solutions. We discuss a mechanism whereby magnetic monopolesmight have been confined by dilaton cosmic strings during an epoch in the early universe during which the dilaton was massless.
