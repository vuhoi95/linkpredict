Title: Parity Transformation in the Front Form
Authors: M. Sawicki and D. V. Ahluwalia
Abstract: By considering the parity-transformation properties of the $(1/2,\,0)$ and $(0,\,1/2)$ fields in the {\it front form} we find ourselves forced to study the front-form evolution both along $x^+$ and $x^-$ directions. As a by product, we find that half of the dynamical degrees of freedom of a full theory live on the $x^+=0$ surface and the other half on the $x^-=0$ surface. Elsewhere, Jacob shows how these results are required to build a satisfactory, and internally consistent, front-form quantum field theory.
