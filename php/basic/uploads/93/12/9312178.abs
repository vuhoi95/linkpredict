Title: Alternative Canonical Formalism for the Wess-Zumino-Witten Model
Authors: S. G. Rajeev and G. Sparano and P. Vitale
Abstract: We study a canonical quantization of the Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) model which depends on two integer parameters rather than one. The usual theory can be obtained as a contraction, in which our two parameters go to infinity keeping the difference fixed. The quantum theory is equivalent to a generalized Thirring model, with left and right handed fermions transforming under different representations of the symmetry group. We also point out that the classical WZW model with a compact target space has a canonical formalism in which the current algebra is an affine Lie algebra of non--compact type. Also, there are some non--unitary quantizations of the WZW model in which there is invariance only under half the conformal algebra (one copy of the Virasoro algebra).
