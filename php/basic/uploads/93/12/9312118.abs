Title: Loop Space Hamiltonians And Field Theory Of Non-Critical Strings
Authors: A. Jevicki and J. Rodrigues
Abstract: We consider the loop space representation of multi-matrix models. Explaining the origin of a time variable through stochastic quantization we make contact with recent proposals of Ishibashi and Kawai. We demonstrate how collective field theory with its loop space interactions generates a field theory of non-critical strings.
