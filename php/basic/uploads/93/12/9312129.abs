Title: Deformation Quantization of the Heisenberg Group
Authors: F. Bonechi and R. Giachetti and E. Sorace and M. Tarlini
Abstract: A *-product compatible with the comultiplication of the Hopf algebra of the functions on the Heisenberg group is determined by deforming a coboundary Lie-Poisson structure defined by a classical r-matrix satisfying the modified Yang-Baxter equation. The corresponding quantum group is studied and its R-matrix is explicitly calculated.
