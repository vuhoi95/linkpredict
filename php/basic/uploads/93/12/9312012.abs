Title: Causal Feature of Central Singularity and Gravitational Mass
Authors: Tatsuhiko Koike and Hisashi Onozawa and Masaru Siino
Abstract: Mass of singularity is defined, and its relation to whether the singularity is spacelike, timelike or null is discussed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. It is shown that if the mass of singularity is positive (negative) the singularity is non-timelike (non-spacelike). The connection between the sign of the mass and the force on a particle is also discussed.
