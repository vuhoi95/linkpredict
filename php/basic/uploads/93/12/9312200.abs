Title: Swimming of Microorganisms Viewed from String and Membrane Theories
Authors: Masako Kawamura and Akio Sugamoto and Shin'ichi Nojiri
Abstract: Swimming of microorganisms is studied from a viewpoint of extended objects (strings and membranes) swimming in the incompressible f luid of low Reynolds number. The flagellated motion is analyzed in two dimensional fluid, by using the method developed in the ciliated motion with the Joukowski transformation. Discussion is given on the conserved charges and the algebra which are associated with the area (volume)- preserving diffeomorphisms giving the swimming motion of microorganisms. It is also suggested that the $N$-point string- and membrane-like amplitudes are useful for studying the collective swimming motion of microorganisms when fluctuation of the vorticity distribution exists in the sticky or rubber-like fluid.
