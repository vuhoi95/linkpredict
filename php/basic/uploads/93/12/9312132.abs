Title: Dynamical Determination of the Metric Signature in Spacetime of  Nontrivial Topology
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov and A. Romeo
Abstract: The formalism of Greensite for treating the spacetime signature as a dynamical degree of freedom induced by quantum fields is considered for spacetimes with nontrivial topology of the kind ${\bf R}^{D-1} \times {\bf T}^1$, for varying $D$. It is shown that a dynamical origin for the Lorentzian signature is possible in the five-dimensional space ${\bf R}^4 \times {\bf T}^1$ with small torus radius (periodic boundary conditions), as well as in four-dimensional space with trivial topology. Hence, the possibility exists that the early universe might have been of the Kaluza-Klein type, \ie multidimensional and of Lorentzian signature.
