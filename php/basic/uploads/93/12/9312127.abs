Title: Black Hole Evaporation along Macroscopic Strings
Authors: A. Lawrence and E. Martinec
Abstract: We develop the quantization of a macroscopic string which extends radially from a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking process excites a thermal bath of string modes that causes the black hole to lose mass. The resulting typical string configuration is a random walk in the angular coordinates. We show that the energy flux in string excitations is approximately that of spacetime field modes.
