Abstract: By using the free field realizations, we analyze the representation theory of the W_{1+infinity} algebra with c=1. The eigenvectors for the Cartan subalgebra of W_{1+infinity} are parametrized by the Young diagrams, and explicitly written down by W_{1+infinity} generators. Moreover, their eigenvalues and full character formula are also obtained.
