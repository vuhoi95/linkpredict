Title: The R-matrix structure of the Euler-Calogero-Moser model
Authors: E. Billey and J. Avan and O. Babelon
Abstract: We construct the $r$-matrix for the generalization of the Calogero-Moser system introduced by Gibbons and Hermsen. By reduction procedures we obtain the $r$-matrix for the $O(N)$ Euler-Calogero-Moser model and for the standard $A_N$ Calogero-Moser model.
