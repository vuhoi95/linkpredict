Title: Quantum Hall effect from soliton equation
Authors: Hideaki Hiro-Oka and Satoru Saito
Abstract: The Laughlin function of quantum Hall effect is shown to satisfy Hirota's bilinear difference equation with certain coefficients a little different from the KP hierarchy. Vertex operators which constitute blocks of solutions generate a B\"acklund transformation. Besides the Laughlin function, the equation admits soliton solutions.
