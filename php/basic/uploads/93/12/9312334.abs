Title: Quadratic Divergences in GUTs with Vanishing One-Loop Beta Functions
Authors: Wolfgang LUCHA and Michael MOSER
Abstract: All members of a recently proposed new set of (non-supersymmetric) grand unified theories with at the one-loop level vanishing beta functions for the gauge, Yukawa, and scalar-boson self-interaction coupling constants are shown to involve, already at the one-loop level, quadratically divergent contributions to both the vector-boson and scalar-boson masses.
