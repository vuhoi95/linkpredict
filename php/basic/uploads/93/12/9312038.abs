Title: Radiation from a moving Scalar Source
Authors: Hai Ren and Erick J. Weinberg
Abstract: We study classical radiation and quantum bremsstrahlung effect of a moving point scalar source. Our classical analysis provides another example of resolving a well-known apparent paradox, that of whether a constantly accelerating source radiates or not. Quantum mechanically, we show that for a scalar source with arbitrary motion, the tree level emission rate of scalar particles in the inertial frame equals the sum of emission and absorption rates of zero-energy Rindler particles in the Rindler frame. We then explicitly verify this result for a source undergoing constant proper acceleration.
