Title: Infinite Charge Algebra of Gravitational Instantons
Authors: Jens Hoppe and Q-Han Park
Abstract: Using a formalism of minitwistors, we derive infinitely many conserved charges for the $sl(\infty )$-Toda equation which accounts for gravitational instantons with a rotational Killing symmetry. These charges are shown to form an infinite dimensional algebra through the Poisson bracket which is isomorphic to two dimensional area preserving diffeomorphism with central extentions.
