Abstract: The multimode even and odd coherent states (multimode Schroedinger cat states) are constructed for polymode parametric oscillators of the electromagnetic field. The evolution of the photon distribution function is evaluated explicitly. The distribution function is expressed in terms of the multivariable Hermite polynomials, its means and dispersions are calculated. The conditions for the existence of squeezing are formulated. The correlations among the different modes of Schroedinger cat states are studied.
