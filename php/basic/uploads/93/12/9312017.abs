Title: Universality and Scaling at the Onset of Quantum Black Hole Formation
Authors: A. Strominger and L. Thorlacius
Abstract: In certain two-dimensional models, collapsing matter forms a black hole if and only if the incoming energy flux exceeds the Hawking radiation rate. Near the critical threshold, the black hole mass is given by a universal formula in terms of the distance from criticality, and there exists a scaling solution describing the formation and evaporation of an arbitrarily small black hole.
