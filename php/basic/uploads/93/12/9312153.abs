Title: Classical and Quantum Mechanics of Free \k Relativistic Systems
Authors: J. Lukierski and H. Ruegg and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism describing free \k-relativistic particles with their four-momenta constrained to the \k-deformed mass shell. We study the modifications of the formalism which follow from the introduction of space coordinates with nonvanishing Poisson brackets and from the redefinitions of the energy operator. The quantum mechanics of free \k-relativistic particles and of the free \k-relativistic oscillator is also presented. It is shown that the \k-relativistic oscillator describes a quantum statistical ensemble with finite Hagedorn temperature. The relation to a \k-deformed Schr\"odinger quantum mechanics in which the time derivative is replaced by a finite difference derivative is also discussed.
