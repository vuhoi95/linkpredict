Title: Braided Matrix Structure of $q$-Minkowski Space and $q$-Poincare Group
Authors: Shahn Majid and Ulrich Meyer
Abstract: We clarify the relation between the approach to $q$-Minkowski space of Carow-Watamura et al. with an approach based on the idea of $2\times 2$ braided Hermitean matrices. The latter are objects like super-matrices but with Bose-Fermi statistics replaced by braid statistics. We also obtain new R-matrix formulae for the $q$-Poincare group in this framework.
