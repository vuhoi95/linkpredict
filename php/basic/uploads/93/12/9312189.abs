Title: Topological Landau-Ginzburg Model of Two-Dimensional String Theory
Authors: Debashis Ghoshal and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We study a topological Landau-Ginzburg model with superpotential W(X)=X^{-1}. This is argued to be equivalent to c=1 string theory compactified at the self-dual radius. We compute the tree-level correlation function of N tachyons in this theory and show their agreement with matrix-model results. We also discuss the nature of contact terms, the perturbed superpotential and the flow of operators in the small phase space. The role of gravitational descendants in this theory is examined, and the tachyon two-point function in genus 1 is obtained using a conjectured modification of the gravitational recursion relations.
