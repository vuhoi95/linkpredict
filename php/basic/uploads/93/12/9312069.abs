Title: A modified Schwinger's formula for the Casimir effect
Authors: M. V. Cougo-Pinto and C. Farina and Antonio J. Segui-Santonja
Abstract: After briefly reviewing how the (proper-time) Schwinger's formula works for computing the Casimir energy in the case of "scalar electrodynamics" where the boundary conditions are dictated by two perfectly conducting parallel plates with separation "a" in the Z-axis, we propose a slightly modification in the previous approach based on an analytical continuation method. As we will see, for the case at hand our formula does not need the use of Poisson summation to get a (renormalized) finite result.
