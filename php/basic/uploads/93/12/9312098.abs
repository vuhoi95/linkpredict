Title: A coherent state associated with shape-invariant potentials
Authors: T. Fukui and N. Aizawa
Abstract: An algebraic treatment of shape-invariant potentials is discussed. By introducing an operator which reparametrizes wavefunctions, the shape-invariance condition can be related to a generalized Heisenberg- Weyl algebra. It is shown that this makes it possible to define a coherent state associated with the shape-invariant potentials.
