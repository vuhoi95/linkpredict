Title: Extended Loops: A New Arena for Nonperturbative Quantum Gravity
Authors: C. Di Bartolo and R. Gambini and J. Griego and J. Pullin
Abstract: We propose a new representation for gauge theories and quantum gravity. It can be viewed as a generalization of the loop representation. We make use of a recently introduced extension of the group of loops into a Lie Group. This extension allows the use of functional methods to solve the constraint equations. It puts in a precise framework the regularization problems of the loop representation. It has practical advantages in the search for quantum states. We present new solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation that reinforce the conjecture that the Jones Polynomial is a state of nonperturbative quantum gravity.
