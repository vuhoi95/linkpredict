Title: Knot invariants from rational conformal field theories
Authors: P. Ramadevi and T. R. Govindarajan and R. K. Kaul
Abstract: A framework for studying knot and link invariants from any rational conformal field theory is developed. In particular, minimal models, superconformal models and $W_N$ models are studied. The invariants are related to the invariants obtained from the Wess-Zumino models associated with the coset representations of these models. Possible Chern-Simons representation of these models is also indicated. This generalises the earlier work on knot and link invariants from Chern-Simons theories.
