Title: A Universal Fractal Structure of 2D Quantum Gravity for c > 1
Authors: J. Ambjorn and G. Thorleifsson
Abstract: We investigate the fractal structure of $2d$ quantum gravity coupled to matter by measuring the distributions of so-called baby universes. We demonstrate that the method works well as long as $c \leq 1$. For $c >1$ it is not clear what distribution to expect. However, we observe strikingly similar distributions for various kinds of matter fields with the same $c$. This indicate that there might be some range of $c >1$ where the central charge of the matter fields alone determines the fractal structure of gravity coupled to matter. The hypothesis that the string susceptibility $\g = 1/3$ is found to be compatible with the data for $1 < c \leq 4$.
