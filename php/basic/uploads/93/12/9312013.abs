Title: A W-String Realization of the Bosonic String
Authors: Nathan Berkovits and Mike Freeman and Peter West
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the ordinary bosonic string can be represented by a special background of N=1 or N=2 strings. In this paper, it will be shown that the bosonic string can also be represented by a special background of $W$-strings.
