Title: Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity in Temporal Gauge
Authors: M. Fukuma and N. Ishibashi and H. Kawai and M. Ninomiya
Abstract: We propose a new type of gauge in two-dimensional quantum gravity. We investigate pure gravity in this gauge, and find that the system reduces to quantum mechanics of loop length $l$. Furthermore, we rederive the $c\!=\!0$ string field theory which was discovered recently. In particular, the pregeometric form of the Hamiltonian is naturally reproduced.
