Title: Mirror Symmetry of K3 and Torus
Authors: Masaru Nagura and Katsuyuki Sugiyama
Abstract: We discuss a K3 and torus from view point of "mirror symmetry". We calculate the periods of the K3 surface and obtain the mirror map, the two-point correlation function, and the prepotential. Then we find there is no instanton correction on K3 (also torus), which is expected from view point of Algebraic geometry.
