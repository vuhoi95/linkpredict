Title: Deformation Quantization of the Isotropic Rotator
Authors: A. Stern and I. Yakushin
Abstract: We perform a deformation quantization of the classical isotropic rigid rotator. The resulting quantum system is not invariant under the usual $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ chiral symmetry, but instead $SU_{q^{-1}}(2) \times SU_q(2)$.
