Title: Galilean Limit of Equilibrium Relativistic Mass Distribution
Authors: L. Burakovsky and L. P. Horwitz
Abstract: The low-temperature form of the equilibrium relativistic mass distribution is subject to the Galilean limit by taking $c\rightarrow \infty .$ In this limit the relativistic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution passes to the usual nonrelativistic form and the Dulong-Petit law is recovered.
