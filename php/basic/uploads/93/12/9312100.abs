Title: Unstable geodesics and topological field theory
Authors: Yukinori Yasui and Satoshi Takahashi
Abstract: A topological field theory is used to study the cohomology of mapping space. The cohomology is identified with the BRST cohomology realizing the physical Hilbert space and the coboundary operator given by the calculations of tunneling between the perturbative vacua. Our method is illustrated by a simple example.
