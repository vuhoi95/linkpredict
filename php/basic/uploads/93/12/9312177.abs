Title: Graph Quantum Groups
Authors: C. Gomez and G. Sierra
Abstract: We define a new mathematical structure ( graph quantum group) which combines the tower of algebras associated with a graph ${\cal G}$ and the structure of a Hopf algebra {\cal A}. In this structure Ocneanu's string operators become Hopf algebra intertwiners. We present some examples of graph quantum groups.
