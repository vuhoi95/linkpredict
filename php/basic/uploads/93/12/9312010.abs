Title: Parafermions, $W$ Strings and their BRST Charges
Authors: Michael Freeman and Peter West
Abstract: We show how to relate the parafermions that occur in the $W_3$ string to the standard construction of parafermions. This result is then used to show that one of the screening charges that occurs in parafermionic theories is precisely the non-trivial part of the $W_3$ string BRST charge. A way of generalizing this pattern for a $W_N$ string is explained. This enables us to construct the full BRST charge for a $W_{2,N}$ string and to prove the relation of such a string to the algebra $W_{N-1}$ for arbitrary $N$, We also show how to calculate part of the BRST charge for a $W_N$ string, and we explain how our method might be extended to obtain the full BRST charge for such a string.
