Title: Explicit Relation of Quantum Hall Effect and Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: Hiroo Azuma and Satoshi Iso
Abstract: Explicit relation between Laughlin state of the quantum Hall effect and one-dimensional(1D) model with long-ranged interaction ($1/r^2$) is discussed. By rewriting lowest Landau level wave functions in terms of 1D representation, Laughlin state can be written as a deformation of the ground state of Calogero-Sutherland model. Corresponding to Laughlin state on different geometries, different types of 1D $1/r^2$ interaction models are derived.
