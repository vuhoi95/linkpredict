Title: Topological-Antitopological Fusion and the Large N CP^N Model
Authors: M. Bourdeau and M. R. Douglas
Abstract: We discuss the large $N$ limit of the supersymmetric $CP^N$ models as an illustration of Cecotti and Vafa's $tt^*$ formalism. In this limit the `$tt^*$ equation' becomes the long wavelength limit of the $2D$ Toda lattice, an equation first studied in the context of self-dual gravity. We show how simple finite temperature and large $N$ techniques determine the relevant solution, and verify analytically that it solves the $tt^*$ equation, using Legendre transform techniques from self-dual gravity.
