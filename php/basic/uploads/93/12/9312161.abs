Title: Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Quantum Mechanics and Non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm  Effect
Authors: Taejin Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We construct a classical action for a system of $N$ point-like sources which carry SU(2) non-Abelian charges coupled to non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge fields, and develop a quantum mechanics for them. Adopting the coherent state quantization and solving the Gauss' constraint in an appropriately chosen gauge, we obtain a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian given in terms of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. Then we study the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect, employing the obtained Hamiltonian for two-particle sector. An explicit evaluation of the differential cross section for the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering is given.
