Title: Evaluation of Observables in the Gaussian $N=\infty$ Kazakov-Migdal  Model
Authors: M. Dobroliubov and A. Morozov and G. Semenoff and N. Weiss
Abstract: We examine the properties of observables in the Kazakov-Migdal model. We present explicit formulae for the leading asymptotics of adjoint Wilson loops as well as some other observables for the model with a Gaussian potential. We discuss the phase transiton in the large $N$ limit of the $d=1$ model. One of appendices is devoted to discussion of the $N =\infty$ Itzykson-Zuber integrals for arbitrary eigenvalue densities.
