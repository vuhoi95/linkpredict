Title: Coalgebras, Cocompositions and Cohomology
Authors: Zbigniew Oziewicz and Eugen Paal and Jerzy Różański
Abstract: The (co)homology theory of n-ary (co)compositions is a functor associating to $n$-ary (co)composition a complex. We present unified approach to the cohomology theory of coassociative and Lie coalgebras and for $2n$-ary cocompositions. This approach points to a possible generalization.
