Title: Symplectic structure of the moduli space of flat connections on a  Riemann surface
Authors: A. Yu. Alekseev and A. Z. Malkin
Abstract: We consider canonical symplectic structure on the moduli space of flat ${\g}$-connections on a Riemann surface of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points. For ${\g}$ being a semisimple Lie algebra we obtain an explicit efficient formula for this symplectic form and prove that it may be represented as a sum of $n$ copies of Kirillov symplectic form on the orbit of dressing transformations in the Poisson-Lie group $G^{*}$ and $g$ copies of the symplectic structure on the Heisenberg double of the Poisson-Lie group $G$ (the pair ($G,G^{*}$) corresponds to the Lie algebra ${\g}$).
