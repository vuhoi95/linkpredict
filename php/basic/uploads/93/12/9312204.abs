Title: Abelian Chern-Simons field theory and anyon equation on a torus
Authors: Kyung-Hyun Cho and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We quantize the abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to non-relativistic matter field on a torus without invoking the flux quantization. Through a series of canonical transformations which is equivalent to solving the Gauss constraint, we obtain an effective hamiltonian density with periodic matter field. We also obtain the many-anyon Schr\"odinger equation with periodic Aharonov-Bohm potentials and analyze the periodic property of the wavefunction. Some comments are given on the different features of our approach from the previous ones.
