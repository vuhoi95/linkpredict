Title: Cartan Calculus on Quantum Lie Algebras
Authors: Peter Schupp and Paul Watts and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: A generalization of the differential geometry of forms and vector fields to the case of quantum Lie algebras is given. In an abstract formulation that incorporates many existing examples of differential geometry on quantum spaces we combine an exterior derivative, inner derivations, Lie derivatives, forms and functions all into one big algebra, the ``Cartan Calculus''.
