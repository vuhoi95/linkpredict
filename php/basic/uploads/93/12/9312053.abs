Title: On the Zero-Slope Limit of the Compactified Closed Bosonic String
Authors: Raffaele Marotta and Franco Pezzella
Abstract: In the framework of the compactified closed bosonic string theory with the extra spatial coordinates being circular with radius $R$, we perform both the zero-slope limit and the $R \rightarrow 0$ limit of the tree scattering amplitude of four massless scalar particles. We explicitly show that this double limit leads to amplitudes involving scalars which interact through the exchange of a scalar, spin 1 and spin 2 particle. In particular, this latter case reproduces the same result obtained in linearized quantum gravity.
