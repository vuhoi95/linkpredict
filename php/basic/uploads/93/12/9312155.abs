Title: Conformal Field Theory and Hyperbolic Geometry
Authors: P. Kleban and I. Vassileva
Abstract: We examine the correspondence between the conformal field theory of boundary operators and two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. By consideration of domain boundaries in two-dimensional critical systems, and the invariance of the hyperbolic length, we motivate a reformulation of the basic equation of conformal covariance. The scale factors gain a new, physical interpretation. We exhibit a fully factored form for the three-point function. A doubly-infinite discrete series of central charges with limit c=-2 is discovered. A correspondence between the anomalous dimension and the angle of certain hyperbolic figures emerges.
