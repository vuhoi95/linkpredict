Title: On Discrete Symmetries of the Multi-Boson KP Hierarchies
Authors: H. Aratyn and L. A. Ferreira and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: We show that the multi-boson KP hierarchies possess a class of discrete symmetries linking them to the discrete Toda systems. These discrete symmetries are generated by the similarity transformation of the corresponding Lax operator. This establishes a canonical nature of the discrete transformations. The spectral equation, which defines both the lattice system and the corresponding Lax operator, plays a key role in determining pertinent symmetry structure. We also introduce a concept of the square-root lattice leading to a family of new pseudo-differential operators with covariance under additional B\"{a}cklund transformations.
