Title: Quantum Cosmological Approach to 2d Dilaton Gravity
Authors: J. Navarro-Salas and C. F. Talavera
Abstract: We study the canonical quantization of the induced 2d-gravity and the pure gravity CGHS-model on a closed spatial section. The Wheeler-DeWitt equations are solved in (spatially homogeneous) choices of the internal time variable and the space of solutions is properly truncated to provide the physical Hilbert space. We establish the quantum equivalence of both models and relate the results with the covariant phase-space quantization. We also discuss the relation between the quantum wavefunctions and the classical space-time solutions and propose the wave function representing the ground state.
