Title: Flat Connections and Non-Local Conserved Quantities in Irrational  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: M. B. Halpern and N. A. Obers
Abstract: Irrational conformal field theory (ICFT) includes rational conformal field theory as a small subspace, and the affine-Virasoro Ward identities describe the biconformal correlators of ICFT. We reformulate the Ward identities as an equivalent linear partial differential system with flat connections and new non-local conserved quantities. As examples of the formulation, we solve the system of flat connections for the coset correlators, the correlators of the affine-Sugawara nests and the high-level $n$-point correlators of ICFT.
