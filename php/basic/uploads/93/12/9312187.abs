Title: $N=1$ from $N=2$ Superstrings
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Jens Lyng Petersen
Abstract: We give a simple proof that a particular class of $N=2$ superstrings are equivalent to the $N=1$ superstrings. This is achieved by constructing a similarity transformation which transforms the $N=2$ BRST operators into a direct sum of the BRST operators for the $N=1$ string and topological sectors.
