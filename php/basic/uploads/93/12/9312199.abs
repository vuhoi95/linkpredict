Title: Relation between Yang-Baxter and Pair Propagation Equations in 16-Vertex  Models
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Minoru Horibe and Kazuyasu Shigemoto
Abstract: We study a relation between two integrability conditions, namely the Yang-Baxter and the pair propagation equations, in 2D lattice models. While the two are equivalent in the 8-vertex models, discrepancies appear in the 16-vertex models. As explicit examples, we find the exactly solvable 16-vertex models which do not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equations.
