Title: The Perturbative Calculation of the Spin-Spin Correlation Function in  the Two Dimensional Ising Model
Authors: B. Mikhak and A. M. Zarkesh
Abstract: Using the variational formula for operator product coefficients a method for perturbative calculation of the short-distance expansion of the Spin-Spin correlation function in the two dimensional Ising model is presented. Results of explicit calculation up to third order agree with known results from the scaling limit of the lattice calculation.
