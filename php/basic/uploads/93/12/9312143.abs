Title: Non-Compact Calabi-Yau Spaces and Other Non-Trivial Backgrounds for 4-D  Superstrings
Authors: E. Kiritsis and C. Kounnas and D. Lust
Abstract: A large class of new 4-D superstring vacua with non-trivial/singular geometries, spacetime supersymmetry and other background fields (axion, dilaton) are found. Killing symmetries are generic and are associated with non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. Duality symmetries preserving N=2 superconformal invariance are employed to generate a large class of explicit metrics for non-compact 4-D Calabi-Yau manifolds with Killing symmetries.
