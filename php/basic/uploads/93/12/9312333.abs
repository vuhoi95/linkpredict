Title: One-Loop N Gluon Amplitudes with Maximal Helicity Violation via  Collinear Limits
Authors: Z. Bern and G. Chalmers and L. Dixon and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: We present a conjecture for the $n$-gluon one-loop amplitudes with maximal helicity violation. The conjecture emerges from the powerful requirement that the amplitudes have the correct behavior in the collinear limits of external momenta. One implication is that the corresponding amplitudes where three or more gluon legs are replaced by photons vanish for $n>4$.
