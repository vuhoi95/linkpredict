Title: On Integrable Models Related to the $osp(1,2)$ Gaudin Algebra
Authors: T. Brzezinski and A. J. Macfarlane
Abstract: We define the $osp(1,2)$ Gaudin algebra and consider integrable models described by it. The models include the $osp(1,2)$ Gaudin magnet and the Dicke model related to it. Detailed discussion of the simplest cases of these models is presented. The effect of the presence of fermions on the separation of variables is indicated.
