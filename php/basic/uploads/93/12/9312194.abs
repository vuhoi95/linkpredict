Title: Evaporating Black Holes and Entropy
Authors: Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Samir D. Mathur
Abstract: We study the Hawking radiation for the geometry of an evaporating 1+1 dimensional black hole. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and the stress tensor. We use a recent result of Srednicki to estimate the entropy of entanglement produced in the evaporation process, for the 1+1 dimensional hole and for the 3+1 dimensional hole. It is found that the one space dimensional result of Srednicki is the pertinent one to use, in both cases.
