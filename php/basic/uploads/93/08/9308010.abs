Title: Quantum Deformation of the Affine Transformation Algebra
Authors: N. Aizawa and H. -T. Sato
Abstract: We discuss quantum deformation of the affine transformation algebra. It is shown that the quantum algebra has a non-cocommutative Hopf algebra structure, simple realizations and quantum tensor operators.
