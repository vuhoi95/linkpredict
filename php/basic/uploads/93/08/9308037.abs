Title: Virasoro Singular Vectors via Quantum DS Reduction
Authors: A. Ch. Ganchev and V. B. Petkova
Abstract: The BRST quantisation of the Drinfeld - Sokolov reduction is exploited to recover all singular vectors of the Virasoro algebra Verma modules from the corresponding $A^{(1)}_1\,$ ones. The two types of singular vectors are shown to be identical modulo terms trivial in the $Q_{BRST}$ cohomology. The main tool is a quantum version of the DS gauge transformation.
