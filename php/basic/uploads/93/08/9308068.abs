Title: Non-Abelian Cornucopions
Authors: E. E. Donets and D. V. Gal'tsov and M. S. Volkov
Abstract: An infinite family of cornucopions is found within the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ sector of the 4--d heterotic string low-energy theory, the extremal $U(1)$ magnetic dilatonic black hole being the lowest energy state. Non-abelian cornucopions are interpreted as sphalerons associated with potential barriers separating topologically distinct Yang-Mills vacua on the $U(1)$ cornucopion background. A mass formula for non-abelian dilatonic black holes is derived, and the free energy is calculated through the Euclidean action.
