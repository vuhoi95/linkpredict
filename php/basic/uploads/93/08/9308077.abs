Title: Duality Invariance of the Hawking Temperature and Entropy
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Dean L. Welch
Abstract: We consider solutions to low energy string theory which have a horizon and a spacelike symmetry. Each of these solutions has a geometrically different dual description. We show that the dual solution has a horizon with exactly the same Hawking temperature (surface gravity) and entropy (area) as the original solution.
