Title: Scattering Matrix and Excitation Spectrum of the Hubbard Model
Authors: Fabian H. L. Essler and Vladimir E. Korepin
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling. We show that both excitation spectrum and S-matrix are determined by the SO(4) symmetry of the model. The complete set of excitations is given by the scattering states four elementary excitations, which form the fundamental representation of SO(4). We evaluate the exact S-matrix, which satisfies the Yang-Baxter relation. The results for the repulsive and attractive Hubbard model are related by an interchange of spin and charge degrees of freedom.
