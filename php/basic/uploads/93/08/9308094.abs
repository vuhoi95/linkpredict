Title: Geometrical String and Spin Systems
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and F. J. Wegner
Abstract: We formulate a new geometrical string on the euclidean lattice. It is possible to find such spin systems with local interaction which reproduce the same surface dynamics.In the three-dimensional case this spin system is a usual Ising ferromagnet with additional diagonal antiferromagnetic interaction and with specially adjusted coupling constants. In the four-dimensional case the spin system coincides with the gauge Ising system with an additional double-plaquette interaction and also with specially tuned coupling constants. We extend this construction to random walks and random hypersurfaces (membrane and p-branes) of high dimensionality. We compare these spin systems with the eight-vertex model and BNNNI models.
