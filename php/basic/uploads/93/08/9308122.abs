Title: Mirror Symmetry, Mirror Map and Applications to Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces
Authors: S. Hosono and A. Klemm and S. Theisen and S. -T. Yau
Abstract: Mirror Symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations and instanton corrected Yukawa couplings are discussed within the framework of toric geometry. It allows to establish mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces for which the mirror manifold had been unavailable in previous constructions. Mirror maps and Yukawa couplings are explicitly given for several examples with two and three moduli.
