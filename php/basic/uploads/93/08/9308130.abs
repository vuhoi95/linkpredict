Title: Conformal- and Thermodynamic Properties of a Family of Thirring-like  Models
Authors: I. Sachs and A. Wipf and A. Dettki
Abstract: We investigate Thirring-like models containing fermionic and scalar fields propagating in 2-dimensional space time. The corresponding conformal algebra is studied and we disprove a conjecture relating the finite size effects to the central charge. Some new results concerning the fermionic determinant on the torus with chirally twisted boundary conditions and a chemical potential are presented. In particular we show how the thermodynamics of the Thirring model depends on the current-current interaction.
