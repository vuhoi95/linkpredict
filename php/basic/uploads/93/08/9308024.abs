Title: Quantum Gravity and Non-unitarity in Black Hole Evaporation
Authors: Claus Kiefer and Rainer Mueller and Tejinder P. Singh
Abstract: We discuss the relevance of quantum gravitational corrections to the functional Schr\"odinger equation for the information loss paradox in black hole evaporation. These corrections are found from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation through a semiclassical expansion scheme. The dominant contribution in the final evaporation stage, when the black hole approaches the Planck regime, is a term which explicitly violates unitarity in the non-gravitational sector. While pure states remain pure, there is an increase in the degree of purity for non-pure states in this sector. This result holds irrespective of whether full quantum gravity respects unitarity or not.
