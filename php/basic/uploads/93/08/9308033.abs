Authors: V. V. Dodonov and O. V. Man'ko and V. I. Man'ko
Abstract: For N-mode light described by the Wigner function of generic Gaussian form the photon distribution function is obtained explicitly and expressed in terms of Hermite polynomial of $2N$ variables with equal pairs of indices.The mean values and dispersions of photon numbers are obtained for this generic mixed state.Generating function for photon distribution is obtained explicitly. The expression for $N$-mode photon distribution function for squeezed photon number states in terms of Hermite polynomials of $2N$ variables and for squeezed coherent states in terms of Hermite polynomials of $N$ variables is discussed.
