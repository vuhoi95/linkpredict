Title: Stress-Energy Tensor and Ultraviolet Behaviour in Massive Integrable  Quantum Field Theories
Authors: G. Mussardo and P. Simonetti
Abstract: The short distance behaviour of massive integrable quantum field theories is analyzed in terms of the form factor approach. We show that the on-shell dynamics is compatible with different definitions of the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ of the theory. In terms of form factors, this is equivalent to having a possible non-zero matrix element $F_1$ of the trace of $T_{\mu\nu}$ on one-particle state. Each choice of $F_1$ induces a different scaling behaviour of the massive theory in the ultraviolet limit.
