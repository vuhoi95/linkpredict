Title: Chiral Splitting at Work
Authors: Z. Hasiewicz and P. Siemion
Abstract: Second-order equations of motion on a group manifold that appear in a large class of so-called chiral theories are presented. These equations are presented and explicitely solved for cases of semi-simple, finite-dimensional Lie groups. With three figures avaliable from the authors upon request.
