Title: Coherent States of $SU(l,1)$ groups
Authors: D. M. Gitman and A. L. Shelepin
Abstract: This work can be considered as a continuation of our previous one (J.Phys., 26 (1993) 313), in which an explicit form of coherent states (CS) for all SU(N) groups was constructed by means of representations on polynomials. Here we extend that approach to any SU(l,1) group and construct explicitly corresponding CS. The CS are parametrized by dots of a coset space, which is, in that particular case, the open complex ball $CD^{l}$. This space together with the projective space $CP^{l}$, which parametrizes CS of the SU(l+1) group, exhausts all complex spaces of constant curvature. Thus, both sets of CS provide a possibility for an explicit analysis of the quantization problem on all the spaces of constant curvature.
