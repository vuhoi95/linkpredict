Title: Weyl Invariance and Spurious Black Hole in Two-Dimensional Dilaton  Gravity
Authors: Takanori Fujiwara and Yuji Igarashi and Jisuke Kubo
Abstract: In two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories, there may exist a global Weyl invariance which makes black hole spurious. If the global invariance and the local Weyl invariance of the matter coupling are intact at the quantum level, there is no Hawking radiation. We explicitly verify the absence of anomalies in these symmetries for the model proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger. The crucial observation is that the conformal anomaly can be cohomologically trivial and so not truly anomalous in such dilaton gravity models.
