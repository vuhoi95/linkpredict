Title: Higher-spin strings and W minimal models
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and K. Thielemans and X. J. Wang
Abstract: We study the spectrum of physical states for higher-spin generalisations of string theory, based on two-dimensional theories with local spin-2 and spin-$s$ symmetries. We explore the relation of the resulting effective Virasoro string theories to certain $W$ minimal models. In particular, we show how the highest-weight states of the $W$ minimal models decompose into Virasoro primaries.
