Title: Extended de Sitter Theory of Two Dimensional Gravitational Forces
Authors: Daniel Cangemi and Gerald Dunne
Abstract: We present a simple unifying gauge theoretical formulation of gravitational theories in two dimensional spacetime. This formulation includes the effects of a novel matter-gravity coupling which leads to an extended de Sitter symmetry algebra on which the gauge theory is based. Contractions of this theory encompass previously studied cases.
