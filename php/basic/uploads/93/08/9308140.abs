Title: On the equivalence between the unified and standard versions of  constraint dynamics
Authors: I. A. Batalin and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: The structure of physical operators and states of the unified constraint dynamics is studied. The genuine second--class constraints encoded are shown to be the superselection operators. The unified constrained dynamics is established to be physically--equivalent to the standard BFV--formalism with constraints split.
