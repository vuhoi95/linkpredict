Authors: J. A. Dixon and R. Minasian and J. Rahmfeld
Abstract: We examine the BRS cohomology of chiral matter in $N=1$, $D=4$ supersymmetry to determine a general form of composite superfield operators which can suffer from supersymmetry anomalies. Composite superfield operators $\Y_{(a,b)}$ are products of the elementary chiral superfields $S$ and $\ov S$ and the derivative operators $D_\a$, $\ov D_{\dot \b}$ and $\pa_{\a \dot \b}$. Such superfields $\Y_{(a,b)}$ can be chosen to have `$a$' symmetrized undotted indices $\a_i$ and `$b$' symmetrized dotted indices $\dot \b_j$. The result derived here is that each composite superfield $\Y_{(a,b)}$ is subject to potential supersymmetry anomalies if $a-b$ is an odd number, which means that $\Y_{(a,b)}$ is a fermionic superfield.
