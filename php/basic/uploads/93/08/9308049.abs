Title: Quantum affine transformation group and covariant differential calculus
Authors: N. Aizawa and H. -T. Sato
Abstract: We discuss quantum deformation of the affine transformation group and its Lie algebra. It is shown that the quantum algebra has a non-cocommutative Hopf algebra structure, simple realizations and quantum tensor operators. The deformation of the group is achieved by using the adjoint representation. The elements of quantum matrix form a Hopf algebra. Furthermore, we construct a differential calculus which is covariant with respect to the action of the quantum matrix.
