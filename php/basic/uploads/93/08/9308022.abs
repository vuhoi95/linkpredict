Title: Particles, Superparticles and Super Yang--Mills
Authors: C. M. Hull and J. -L. Vazquez-Bello
Abstract: This paper is concerned with theories describing spinning particles that are formulated in terms of actions possessing either local world-line supersymmetry or local fermionic {\it kappa} invariance. These classical actions are obtained by adding a finite number of spinor or vector coordinates to the usual space-time coordinates. Generalizing to superspace leads to corresponding types of \lq spinning superparticle' theories in which the wave-functions are superfields in some (generally reducible) representation of the Lorentz group. A class of these spinning superparticle actions possesses the same spectrum as ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory, which it is shown can be formulated in terms of either vector or spinor superfields satisfying supercovariant constraints. The models under consideration include some that were known previously and some new ones.
