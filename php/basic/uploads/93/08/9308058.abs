Title: Two-Dimensional Quantum Poincar√â Group
Authors: Jakub Rembielinski and Waclaw Tybor
Abstract: Quantum Poincar\'e-Weyl group in two dimensional quantum Minkowski space-time is considered and an appriopriate relativistic kinematics is investigated. It is claimed that a consistent approach to the above questions demands a kind of a ``quantum geometry'' in the $q$-deformed space-time.
