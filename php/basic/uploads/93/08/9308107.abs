Title: Illusory Quantum Hair
Authors: A. Casher and O. Pelc
Abstract: We analyze the quantum hair model proposed recently by Coleman, Preskill and Wilczek. We give arguments suggesting that the potential hair is expected to be destroyed by the instability of the black-hole. We also discuss the general implications of such arguments on the prospects for formulating a quantum extension of the classical ``no hair'' theorems.
