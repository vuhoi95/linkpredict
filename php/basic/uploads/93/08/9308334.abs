Title: Infinite Renormalization of Theta-Term and Jarlskog Invariant for  CP-Violation
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and A. I. Vainshtein
Abstract: The logarithmic ultraviolet divergence in the theta-term induced by electroweak interactions in the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP-violation, found by Ellis and Gaillard, is discussed. We relate it to the Jarlskog CP-odd invariant of quark mass matrix. The divergence arises in 14th order in Higgs coupling as well as in 12th order plus 2nd order in U(1) gauge boson coupling.
