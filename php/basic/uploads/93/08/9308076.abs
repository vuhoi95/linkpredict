Title: BV analysis for covariant and non-covariant actions
Authors: C. Ordóñez and J. París and J. M. Pons and R. Toldrà
Abstract: The equivalence between the covariant and the non-covariant version of a constrained system is shown to hold after quantization in the framework of the field-antifield formalism. Our study covers the cases of Electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields and sheds light on some aspects of the Faddeev-Popov method, for both the coratiant and non-covariant approaches, which had not been fully clarified in the literature.
