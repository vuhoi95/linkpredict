Abstract: We consider a hierarchy of many particle systems on the line with polynomial potentials separable in parabolic coordinates. Using the Lax representation, written in terms of $2\times 2$ matrices for the whole hierarchy, we construct the associated linear $r$-matrix algebra with the $r$-matrix dependent on the dynamical variables. A dynamical Yang-Baxter equation is discussed.
