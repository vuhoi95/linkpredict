Title: Statistical Mechanics of Kinks in (1+1)-Dimensions: Numerical  Simulations and Double Gaussian Approximation
Authors: Francis J. Alexander and Salman Habib and Alex Kovner
Abstract: We investigate the thermal equilibrium properties of kinks in a classical $\F^4$ field theory in $1+1$ dimensions. From large scale Langevin simulations we identify the temperature below which a dilute gas description of kinks is valid. The standard dilute gas/WKB description is shown to be remarkably accurate below this temperature. At higher, ``intermediate'' temperatures, where kinks still exist, this description breaks down. By introducing a double Gaussian variational ansatz for the eigenfunctions of the statistical transfer operator for the system, we are able to study this region analytically. In particular, our predictions for the number of kinks and the correlation length are in agreement with the simulations. The double Gaussian prediction for the characteristic temperature at which the kink description ultimately breaks down is also in accord with the simulations. We also analytically calculate the internal energy and demonstrate that the peak in the specific heat near the kink characteristic temperature is indeed due to kinks. In the neighborhood of this temperature there appears to be an intricate energy sharing mechanism operating between nonlinear phonons and kinks.
