Title: Complementarity in Wormhole Chromodynamics
Authors: Hoi-Kwong Lo and Kai-Ming Lee and John Preskill
Abstract: The electric charge of a wormhole mouth and the magnetic flux ``linked'' by the wormhole are non-commuting observables, and so cannot be simultaneously diagonalized. We use this observation to resolve some puzzles in wormhole electrodynamics and chromodynamics. Specifically, we analyze the color electric field that results when a colored object traverses a wormhole, and we discuss the measurement of the wormhole charge and flux using Aharonov-Bohm interference effects. We suggest that wormhole mouths may obey conventional quantum statistics, contrary to a recent proposal by Strominger.
