Title: String-Dominated Cosmology
Authors: Dalia S. Goldwirth and Malcolm J. Perry
Abstract: If string theory controls physics at the string scale, the dynamics of the early universe before the GUT era will be governed by the low-energy string equations of motion. Studying these equations for FRW spacetimes, we find that depending on the initial conditions when the stringy era starts, and on the time when it ends, there are a wide variety of qualitatively distinct types of evolution. We classify these, and present the general solution to the equations of motion.
