Title: Charged Particle System in Uniform Magnetic and Electric Fields: The  Role of Galilean Transformation
Authors: Chanju Kim and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: Galilean transformation relates a physical system under mutually perpendicular uniform magnetic and electric fields to that under uniform magnetic field only. This allows a complete specification of quantum states in the former case in terms of those for the latter. Based on this observation, we consider the Hall effect and the behavior of a neutral composite system in the presence of uniform electromagnetic fields.
