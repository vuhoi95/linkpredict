Title: Regular representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras
Authors: B. Feigin and S. Parkhomenko
Abstract: In this paper we investigate one Wakimoto-type construction of affine Kac-Moody algebras. We obtain a version of the regular representation, on which the affine algebra acts from the left and from the right with the sum of levels equal to minus two dual Coxeter numbers.
