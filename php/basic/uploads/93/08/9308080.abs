Title: Quantum Non-abelian Toda Field Theories
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and J. Panvel
Abstract: We derive an explicit, exactly conformally invariant form for the action for the non-abelian Toda field theory. We demonstrate that the conformal invariance conditions, expressed in terms of the $\beta$-functions of the theory, are satisfied to all orders, and we use our results to obtain a value for the central charge agreeing with previous calculations.
