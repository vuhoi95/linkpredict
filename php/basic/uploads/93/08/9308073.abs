Title: On Calculation of $2+\veps$ RG Functions in the Gross Neveu Model from  Large $N$ Expansions of Critical Exponents
Authors: N. A. Kivel and A. S. Stepanenko and A. N. Vasil'ev
Abstract: Using knowledge of the explicit $n$ dependence of the RG functions and expressions of critical exponents in the framework of large $N$ expansion in the Gross Neveu model we derive RG functions in 4- and 5-loop approximation.
