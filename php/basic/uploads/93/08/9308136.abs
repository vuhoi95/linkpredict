Title: Proof of Jacobi identity in generalized quantum dynamics
Authors: S. L. Adler and G. V. Bhanot and J. D. Weckel
Abstract: We prove that the Jacobi identity for the generalized Poisson bracket is satisfied in the generalization of Heisenberg picture quantum mechanics recently proposed by one of us (SLA). The identity holds for any combination of fermionic and bosonic fields, and requires no assumptions about their mutual commutativity.
