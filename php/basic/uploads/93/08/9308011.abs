Title: Chiral Fermions on the Lattice
Authors: Rajamani Narayanan and Herbert Neuberger
Abstract: An expression for the lattice effective action induced by chiral fermions in any even dimensions in terms of an overlap of two states is shown to have promising properties in two dimensions: The correct abelian anomaly is reproduced and instantons are suppressed.
