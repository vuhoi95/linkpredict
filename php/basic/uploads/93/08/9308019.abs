Title: Effective Potential for the Conformal Sector of Quantum Gravity with  Torsion
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: The effective potential which describes the conformal dynamics of quantum gravity with torsion is discussed. The phase transitions induced by the combination of torsion and curvature are investigated. The mechanism for fixing the vacuum expectation values of the metric and torsion is presented.
