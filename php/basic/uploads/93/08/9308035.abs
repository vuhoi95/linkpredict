Title: Resumming the Effective Action
Authors: A. Leonidov and A. Zelnikov
Abstract: At the simple example of a massless scalar field propagating in the static background we study the resummed expressions for the effective action at zero and finite temperature that are free from a usual sickness of the effective action induced by massless particles.
