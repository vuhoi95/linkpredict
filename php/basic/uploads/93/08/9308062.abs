Title: Perturbation of the Ground Varieties of C = 1 String Theory
Authors: Debashis Ghoshal and Porus Lakdawala and Sunil Mukhi
Abstract: We discuss the effect of perturbations on the ground rings of $c=1$ string theory at the various compactification radii defining the $A_N$ points of the moduli space. We argue that perturbations by plus-type moduli define ground varieties which are equivalent to the unperturbed ones under redefinitions of the coordinates and hence cannot smoothen the singularity. Perturbations by the minus-type moduli, on the other hand, lead to semi-universal deformations of the singular varieties that can smoothen the singularity under certain conditions. To first order, the cosmological perturbation by itself can remove the singularity only at the self-dual ($A_1$) point.}
