Title: Bose-Fermi Transformation In Three Dimensional Space
Authors: Luis Huerta and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: A generalization of the Jordan-Wigner transformation to three (or higher) dimensions is constructed. The nonlocal mapping of spin to fermionic variables is expressed as a gauge transformation with topological charge equal to one. The resulting fermionic theory is minimally coupled to a nonabelian gauge field in a spontaneously broken phase containing monopoles.
