Title: Free and self-interacting scalar fields in the presence of conical  singularities
Authors: Guido Cognola and Klaus Kirsten and Luciano Vanzo
Abstract: Free and self-interacting scalar fields in the presence of conical singularities are analized in some detail. The role of such a kind of singularities on free and vacuum energy and also on the one-loop effective action is pointed out using $\zeta$-function regularization and heat-kernel techniques.
