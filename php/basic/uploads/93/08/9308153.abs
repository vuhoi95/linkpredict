Title: Quasifinite highest weight modules over the Lie algebra of differential  operators on the circle
Authors: Victor G. Kac and A. Radul
Abstract: We classify positive energy representations with finite degeneracies of the Lie algebra $W_{1+\infty}\/$ and construct them in terms of representation theory of the Lie algebra $\hatgl ( \infty R_m )\/$ of infinite matrices with finite number of non-zero diagonals over the algebra $R_m = \C [ t ] / ( t^{m + 1} )\/$. The unitary ones are classified as well. Similar results are obtained for the sin-algebras.
