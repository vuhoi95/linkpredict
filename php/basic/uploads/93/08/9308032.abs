Title: Photon statistics of multimode even and odd coherent light
Authors: Nadeem A. Ansari and V. I. Man'ko
Abstract: The even and odd coherent states are generalized for multimode case. The explicit forms for the photon distribution, Q-function and Wigner function are derived. In particular, it is shown that for two-mode case there exist strong correlations between these modes, under certain conditions, which are responsible for two-mode squeezing in case of even coherent states
