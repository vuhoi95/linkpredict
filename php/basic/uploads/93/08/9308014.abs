Title: Comment On Vortices In Chern-Simons And Maxwell Electrodynamics
Authors: Pietro Donatis and Roberto Iengo
Abstract: We compare the vortex-like solutions of two different theories in (2+1) dimensions. In the first a nonrelativistic field self-interacts through a Chern-Simons gauge connection. It is $P$ and $T$ violating. The second is the standard Maxwell scalar electrodynamics. We show that for specific values of some parameters the same vortex-configurations provide solutions for both theories.
