Title: Quantum mechanical composition laws in reparameterization invariant  systems
Authors: J. J. Halliwell and M. E. Ortiz
Abstract: This paper gives a brief description of the derivation of a composition law for the propagator of a relativistic particle, in a sum over histories quantization. The extension of this derivation to the problem of finding a composition law for quantum cosmology is also discussed. (For the proceedings of Journees Relativistes 93)
