Title: Quasi-particles models for the representations of Lie algebras and  geometry of flag manifold
Authors: Boris Feigin and A. V. Stoyanovsky
Abstract: We give a new interpretation and proof of the "quasi-particle" type character formulas for integrable representations of the simply-laced affine Kac-Moody algebras through a new "semi-infinite" construction of such representations. We compare formulas of this kind to other formulas obtained using the geometry of the corresponding flag manifold and in particular give a new proof to the Gordon type identities.
