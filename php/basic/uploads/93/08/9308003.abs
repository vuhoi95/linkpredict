Title: On Toy Aging
Authors: Enzo Marinari and Giorgio Parisi
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a simple one dimensional model and we discuss the phenomenon of aging (i.e., the strong dependence of the dynamical correlation functions over the waiting time). Our model is the so-called random random walk, the toy model of a directed polymer evolving in a random medium.
