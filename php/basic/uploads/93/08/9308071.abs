Title: Hamiltonian formulation of SL(3) Ur-KdV equation
Authors: B. K. Chung and K. G. Joo and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We give a unified view of the relation between the $SL(2)$ KdV, the mKdV, and the Ur-KdV equations through the Fr\'{e}chet derivatives and their inverses. For this we introduce a new procedure of obtaining the Ur-KdV equation, where we require that it has no non-local operators. We extend this method to the $SL(3)$ KdV equation, i.e., Boussinesq(Bsq) equation and obtain the hamiltonian structure of Ur-Bsq equationin a simple form. In particular, we explicitly construct the hamiltonian operator of the Ur-Bsq system which defines the poisson structure of the system, through the Fr\'{e}chet derivative and its inverse.
