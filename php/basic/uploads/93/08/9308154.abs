Title: On Nonabelian Duality
Authors: Amit Giveon and Martin Rocek
Abstract: We show that nonabelian duality is not a symmetry of a conformal field theory, but rather a symmetry between different theories. We expose a nonlocal symmetry of nonabelian dual theories. We show how, in the case with vanishing isotropy, it can be used to find the inverse dual transformation. Finally, we consider a number of new examples.
