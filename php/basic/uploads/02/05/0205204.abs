Title: N=1 and N=2 Super Yang-Mills theories from wrapped branes
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and A. Lerda and P. Merlatti
Abstract: We consider supergravity solutions of D5 branes wrapped on supersymmetric 2-cycles and use them to discuss relevant features of four-dimensional N=1 and N=2 super Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(n). In particular in the N=1 case, using a gravitational dual of the gaugino condensate, we obtain the complete NSVZ beta-function. We also find non-perturbative corrections associated to fractional instantons with charge 2/n. These non-perturbative effects modify the running of the coupling constant which remains finite even at small scales in a way that resembles to the soft confinement scenario of QCD.
