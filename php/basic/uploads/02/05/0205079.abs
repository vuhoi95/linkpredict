Title: Time-dependent backgrounds of 2D string theory
Authors: Sergei Yu. Alexandrov and Vladimir A. Kazakov and Ivan K. Kostov
Abstract: We study possible backgrounds of 2D string theory using its equivalence with a system of fermions in upside-down harmonic potential. Each background corresponds to a certain profile of the Fermi sea, which can be considered as a deformation of the hyperbolic profile characterizing the linear dilaton background. Such a perturbation is generated by a set of commuting flows, which form a Toda Lattice integrable structure. The flows are associated with all possible left and right moving tachyon states, which in the compactified theory have discrete spectrum. The simplest nontrivial background describes the Sine-Liouville string theory. Our methods can be also applied to the study of 2D droplets of electrons in a strong magnetic field.
