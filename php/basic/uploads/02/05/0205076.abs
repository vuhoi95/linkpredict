Title: From integrability to conductance, impurity systems
Authors: Olalla Castro-Alvaredo and Andreas Fring
Abstract: We compute the DC conductance with two different methods, which both exploit the integrability of the theories under consideration. On one hand we determine the conductance through a defect by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and standard relativistic potential scattering theory based on a Landauer transport theory picture. On the other hand, we propose a Kubo formula for a defect system and evaluate the current-current two-point correlation function it involves with the help of a form factor expansion. For a variety of defects in a fermionic system we find excellent agreement between the two different theoretical descriptions.
