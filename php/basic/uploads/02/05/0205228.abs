Abstract: The soliton spectrum (massive and massless) of a family of integrable models with local U(1) and U(1)\otimes U(1) symmetries is studied. These models represent relevant integrable deformations of SL(2,R) \otimes U(1)^{n-1} - WZW and SL(2,R) \otimes SL(2,R)\otimes U(1)^{n-2} - WZW models. Their massless solitons appears as specific topological solutions of the U(1) (or U(1)\otimes U(1)) - CFTs. The nonconformal analog of the GKO-coset formula is derived and used in the construction of the composite massive solitons of the ungauged integrable models.
