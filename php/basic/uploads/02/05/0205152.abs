Title: Non-Gaussian Signatures in the Cosmic Background Radiation from Warm  Inflation
Authors: S. Gupta and A. Berera and A. F. Heavens and S. Matarrese
Abstract: We calculate the bispectrum of the gravitational field fluctuations generated during warm inflation, where dissipation of the vacuum potential during inflation is the mechanism for structure formation. The bispectrum is non--zero because of the self--interaction of the scalar field. We compare the predictions with those of standard, or `supercooled', inflationary models, and consider the detectability of these levels of non--Gaussianity in the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background. We find that the levels of non--Gaussianity for warm and supercooled inflation are comparable, and over--ridden by the contribution to the bispectrum due to other physical effects. We also conclude that the resulting bispectrum values will be undetectable in the cosmic microwave background for both the MAP and Planck Surveyor satellites.
