Title: Finite Factorization equations and Sum Rules for BPS correlators in N=4  SYM theory
Authors: Steven Corley and Sanjaye Ramgoolam
Abstract: A class of exact non-renormalized extremal correlators of half-BPS operators in N=4 SYM, with U(N) gauge group, is shown to satisfy finite factorization equations reminiscent of topological gauge theories. The finite factorization equations can be generalized, beyond the extremal case, to a class of correlators involving observables with a simple pattern of SO(6) charges. The simple group theoretic form of the correlators allows equalities between ratios of correlators in N=4 SYM and Wilson loops in Chern-Simons theories at k=\infty, correlators of appropriate observables in topological G/G models and Wilson loops in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories. The correlators also obey sum rules which can be generalized to off-extremal correlators. The simplest sum rules can be viewed as large k limits of the Verlinde formula using the Chern-Simons correspondence. For special classes of correlators, the saturation of the factorization equations by a small subset of the operators in the large N theory is related to the emergence of semiclassical objects like KK modes and giant gravitons in the dual ADS \times S background. We comment on an intriguing symmetry between KK modes and giant gravitons.
