Title: Localizing gravity on a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole in seven dimensions
Authors: Ewald Roessl and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: We present regular solutions for a brane world scenario in the form of a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole living in the three-dimensional spherical symmetric transverse space of a seven-dimensional spacetime. In contrast to the cases of a domain-wall in five dimensions and a string in six dimensions, there exist gravity-localizing solutions for both signs of the bulk cosmological constant. A detailed discussion of the parameter space that leads to localization of gravity is given. A point-like monopole limit is discussed.
