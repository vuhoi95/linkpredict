Title: Cubic String Field Theory in pp-wave Background and Background  Independent Moyal Structure
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho and Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: We study Witten open string field theory in the pp-wave background in the tensionless limit, and construct the N-string vertex in the basis which diagonalizes the string perturbative spectrum. We found that the Witten *-product can be viewed as infinite copies of the Moyal product with the same noncommutativity parameter $\theta=2$. Moreover, we show that this Moyal structure is universal in the sense that, written in the string bit basis, Witten's *-product for any background can always be given in terms of the above-mentioned Moyal structure. We identify some projective operators in this algebra that we argue to correspond to D-branes of the theory.
