Title: Penrose Limits of RG Fixed Points and PP-Waves with Background Fluxes
Authors: Richard Corrado and Nick Halmagyi and Kristian D. Kennaway and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We consider a family of pp-wave solutions of IIB supergravity. This family has a non-trivial, constant 5-form flux, and non-trivial, (light-cone) time-dependent RR and NS-NS 3-form fluxes. The solutions have either 16 or 20 supersymmetries depending upon the time dependence. One member of this family of solutions is the Penrose limit of the solution obtained by Pilch and Warner as the dual of a Leigh-Strassler fixed point. The family of solutions also provides indirect evidence in support of a recent conjecture concerning a large N duality group that acts on RG flows of N=2 supersymmetric, quiver gauge theories.
