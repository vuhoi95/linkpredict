Title: One Loop Vaccum Polarization in a Locally de Sitter Background
Authors: T. Prokopec and O. Tornkvist and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We compute the one loop vacuum polarization from massless, minimally coupled scalar QED in a locally de Sitter background. Gauge invariance is maintained through the use of dimensional regularization, whereas conformal invariance is explicitly broken by the scalar kinetic term as well as through the conformal anomaly. A fully renormalized result is obtained. The one loop corrections to the linearized, effective field equations do not vanish when evaluated on-shell. In fact the on-shell one loop correction depends quadratically on the inflationary scale factor, similar to a photon mass. The contribution from the conformal anomaly is insignificant by comparison.
