Title: N=1* vacua, Fuzzy Spheres and Integrable Systems
Authors: Nick Dorey and Annamaria Sinkovics
Abstract: We calculate the exact eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar fields in the massive vacua of N=1* SUSY Yang-Mills with gauge group SU(N). This provides a field theory prediction for the distribution of D3 brane charge in the AdS dual. We verify the proposal of Polchinski and Strassler that the D3-brane's lie on a fuzzy sphere in the supergravity limit and determine the corrections to this distribution due to worldsheet and quantum effects. The calculation also provides several new results concerning the equilibrium configurations of the N-body Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.
