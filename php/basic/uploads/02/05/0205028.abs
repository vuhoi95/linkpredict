Title: Gravitational Energy of Kerr and Kerr Anti-de Sitter Space-times in the  Teleparallel Geometry
Authors: J. F. da Rocha-Neto and K. H. Castello-Branco
Abstract: In the context of the Hamiltonian formulation of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity we compute the gravitational energy of Kerr and Kerr Anti-de Sitter (Kerr-AdS) space-times. The present calculation is carried out by means of an expression for the energy of the gravitational field that naturally arises from the integral form of the constraint equations of the formalism. In each case, the energy is exactly computed for finite and arbitrary spacelike two-spheres, without any restriction on the metric parameters. In particular, we evaluate the energy at the outer event horizon of the black holes.
