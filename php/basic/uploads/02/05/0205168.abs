Title: A New Era in High-energy Physics
Authors: Eun-Joo Ahn and Marco Cavaglia
Abstract: In TeV-scale gravity, scattering of particles with center-of-mass energy of the order of a few TeV can lead to the creation of nonperturbative, extended, higher-dimensional gravitational objects: Branes. Neutral or charged, spinning or spinless, Einsteinian or supersymmetric, low-energy branes could dramatically change our picture of high-energy physics. Will we create branes in future particle colliders, observe them from ultra high energy cosmic rays, and discover them to be dark matter?
