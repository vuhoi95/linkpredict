Title: PT-symmetric square well and the associated SUSY hierarchies
Authors: B. Bagchi and S. Mallik and C. Quesne
Abstract: The PT-symmetric square well problem is considered in a SUSY framework. When the coupling strength $Z$ lies below the critical value $Z_0^{\rm (crit)}$ where PT symmetry becomes spontaneously broken, we find a hierarchy of SUSY partner potentials, depicting an unbroken SUSY situation and reducing to the family of $\sec^2$-like potentials in the $Z \to 0$ limit. For $Z$ above $Z_0^{\rm (crit)}$, there is a rich diversity of SUSY hierarchies, including some with PT-symmetry breaking and some with partial PT-symmetry restoration.
