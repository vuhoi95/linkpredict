Title: Geometric Transitions and Open String Instantons
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Bogdan Florea and Antonella Grassi
Abstract: We investigate the physical and mathematical structure of a new class of geometric transitions proposed by Aganagic and Vafa. The distinctive aspect of these transitions is the presence of open string instanton corrections to Chern-Simons theory. We find a precise match between open and closed string topological amplitudes applying a beautiful idea proposed by Witten some time ago. The closed string amplitudes are reproduced from an open string perspective as a result of a fascinating interplay of enumerative techniques and Chern-Simons computations.
