Title: On Operator Mixing in N=4 SYM
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Burkhard Eden and Giancarlo Rossi and Yassen S. Stanev
Abstract: We resolve the mixing of the scalar operators of naive dimension 4 belonging to the representation 20' of the SU(4) R-symmetry in N=4 SYM. We compute the order g^2 corrections to their anomalous dimensions and show the absence of instantonic contributions thereof. Ratios of the resulting expressions are irrational numbers, even in the large N limit where, however, we observe the expected decoupling of double-trace operators from single-trace ones. We briefly comment on the generalizations of our results required in order to make contact with the double scaling limit of the theory conjectured to be holographically dual to type IIB superstring on a pp-wave.
