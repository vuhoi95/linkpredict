Title: A class of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras
Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel and David I Olive and Peter C West
Abstract: We consider a natural generalisation of the class of hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. We describe in detail the conditions under which these algebras are Lorentzian. We also construct their fundamental weights, and analyse whether they possess a real principal so(1,2) subalgebra. Our class of algebras include the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras that have recently been proposed as symmetries of M-theory and the closed bosonic string.
