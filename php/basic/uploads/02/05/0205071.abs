Title: Yukawa Hierarchy Transfer Based on Superconformal Dynamics and  Geometrical Realization in String Models

Abstract: We propose a scenario that leads to hierarchical Yukawa couplings and degenerate sfermion masses at the same time, in the context of extra-dimensional models, which can be naturally embedded in a wide class of string models. The hierarchy of Yukawa couplings and degeneracy of sfermion masses can be realized thanks to superconformal gauge dynamics. The sfermion mass degeneracy is guaranteed by taking the superconformal fixed point to be family independent. In our scenario, the origin of Yukawa hierarchy is attributed to geometry of compactified dimensions and the consequent volume dependence of gauge couplings in the superconformal sectors. The difference in these gauge couplings is dynamically transferred to the hierarchy of the Yukawa couplings. Thus, our scenario combines a new dynamical approach and the conventional geometrical approach to the supersymmetric flavor problem.
