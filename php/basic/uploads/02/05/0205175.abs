Title: Novel type of color solitons with topological charge not coinciding with  baryon number and extended chiral group E$Ï‡$
Authors: Victor Novozhilov and Yuri Novozhilov
Abstract: We consider extended chiral group $E\chi $ of gauge plus chiral transformations of the quark path integral in the background gauge and present novel type of color solitons described by the effective action resulting from bosonization. O(3) solitons are formed by a chiral field including parameters with diquark quantum numbers within symplectic subgroup of $E\chi $, as well as within complete $E\chi $; isolated solitons (i.e. solitons in gluonic vacuum) can be stable due to proper asymptotics induced by background vacuum, their topological charge starts from $\pm \frac 43$ and does not coincide with the baryon number, as if notions of left anf right were dependent also on non-abelian directions in such a SU(2) group, where the baryon number defines a diagonal generator.
