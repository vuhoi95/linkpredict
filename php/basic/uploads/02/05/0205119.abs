Title: Stable de Sitter Vacua from N=2 Supergravity
Authors: Pietro Fre and Mario Trigiante and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We find extrema of the potential of matter couplings to N=2 supergravity that define de Sitter vacua and no tachyonic modes. There are three essential ingredients in our construction: namely non-abelian non-compact gaugings, de Roo-Wagemans rotation angles, and Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.
