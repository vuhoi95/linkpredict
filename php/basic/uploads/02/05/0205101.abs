Title: Multidimensional Black Hole Solutions In Model With Perfect Fluid
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov and A. B. Selivanov
Abstract: A family of black-hole solutions in the model with 1-component perfect fluid is obtained. The metric of any solution contains (n -1) Ricci-flat "internal space" metrics and for certain equations of state coincides with the metric of black brane (or black hole) solution in the model with antisymmetric form. Certain examples (e.g. imitating M2 and M5 black branes) are considered. The post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to the 4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated.
