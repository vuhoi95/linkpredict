Title: Entropy bounds and Cardy-Verlinde formula in Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: Using gauge formulation of gravity the three-dimensional SU(2) YM theory equations of motion are presented in equivalent form as FRW cosmological equations. With the radiation, the particular (periodic, big bang-big crunch) three-dimensional universe is constructed. Cosmological entropy bounds (so-called Cardy-Verlinde formula) have the standard form in such universe. Mapping such universe back to YM formulation we got the thermal solution of YM theory. The corresponding holographic entropy bounds (Cardy-Verlinde formula) in YM theory are constructed. This indicates to universal character of holographic relations.
