Title: Brane induced supersymmetry breakdown and restoration
Authors: K. A. Meissner and H. P. Nilles and M. Olechowski
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of brane induced supersymmetry breakdown on orbifolds in the presence of a Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. General consistency conditions are derived for arbitrary dimensions and the results are illustrated in the specific example of a 5-dimensional theory compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. This includes a discussion of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and the possibility of a brane induced supersymmetry restoration.
