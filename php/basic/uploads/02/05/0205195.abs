Title: Stability Equation and Two-Component Eigenmode for Domain Walls in a  Scalar Potential Model
Authors: G. S. Dias and E. L. Gra√ßa and R. de Lima Rodrigues
Abstract: The connection between the supersymmetric quantum mechanics involving two-component eigenfunctions and the stability equation associated with two classical configurations is investigated, and a matrix superpotential is deduced. The issue of stability is ensured for the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states on two domain walls in a scalar potential model containing up to fourth-order powers in the fields, which is explicit demonstrated using the intertwining operators in terms of 2x2-matrix superpotential in the algebraic framework of supersymmetry in quantum mechanics. Also, a non-BPS state is found to be non-stable via fluctuation hessian matrix.
