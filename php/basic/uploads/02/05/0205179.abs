Title: Aspects of Tachyonic Inflation with Exponential Potential
Authors: M. Sami and Pravabati Chingangbam and Tabish Qureshi
Abstract: We consider issues related to tachyonic inflation with exponential potential. We find exact solution of evolution equations in the slow roll limit in FRW cosmology. We also carry out similar analysis in case of Brane assisted tachyonic inflation. We investigate the phase space behavior of the system and show that the dust like solution is a late time attractor. The difficulties associated with reheating in the tachyonic model are also indicated.
