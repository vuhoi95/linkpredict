Title: WZW branes and gerbes
Authors: Krzysztof Gawedzki and Nuno Reis
Abstract: We reconsider the role that bundle gerbes play in the formulation of the WZW model on closed and open surfaces. In particular, we show how an analysis of bundle gerbes on groups covered by SU(N) permits to determine the spectrum of symmetric branes in the boundary version of the WZW model with such groups as the target. We also describe a simple relation between the open string amplitudes in the WZW models based on simply connected groups and in their simple-current orbifolds.
