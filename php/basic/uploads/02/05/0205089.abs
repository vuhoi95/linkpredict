Abstract: Recently, Berenstein et al. have proposed a duality between a sector of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory with large R-charge J, and string theory in a pp-wave background. In the limit considered, the effective 't Hooft coupling has been argued to be lambda'=g_{YM}^2 N/J^2=1/(mu p^+ alpha')^2. We study Yang-Mills theory at small lambda' (large mu) with a view to reproducing string interactions. We demonstrate that the effective genus counting parameter of the Yang-Mills theory is g_2^2=J^4/N^2=(4 pi g_s)^2 (mu p^+ alpha')^4, the effective two-dimensional Newton constant for strings propagating on the pp-wave background. We identify g_2 sqrt{lambda'} as the effective coupling between a wide class of excited string states on the pp-wave background. We compute the anomalous dimensions of BMN operators at first order in g_2^2 and lambda' and interpret our result as the genus one mass renormalization of the corresponding string state. We postulate a relation between the three-string vertex function and the gauge theory three-point function and compare our proposal to string field theory. We utilize this proposal, together with quantum mechanical perturbation theory, to recompute the genus one energy shift of string states, and find precise agreement with our earlier computation.
