Title: Radion Induced Brane Preheating
Authors: Hael Collins and R. Holman and Matthew R. Martin
Abstract: When the interbrane separation in compact Randall-Sundrum models is stabilized via the Goldberger-Wise mechanism, a potential is generated for the four dimensional field that encodes this geometric information, the so-called radion. Due to its origin as a part of the full five dimensional metric, the radion couples directly to particles on both branes. We exhibit the exponential growth in the number of brane particles due to parametric amplification from radion oscillations and discuss some of the consequences of this process for brane cosmology.
