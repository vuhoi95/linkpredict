Title: First order gauge field theories from a superfield formulation
Authors: Ludde Edgren and Niclas Sandstrom
Abstract: Recently, Batalin and Marnelius proposed a superfield algorithm for master actions in the BV-formulation for a class of first order gauge field theories. Possible theories are determined by a ghost number prescription and a simple local master equation. We investigate consistent solutions of these local master equations with emphasis on four and six dimensional theories.
