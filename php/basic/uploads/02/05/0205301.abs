Title: Confining Phase Superpotentials for SO/Sp Gauge Theories via Geometric  Transition
Authors: Hiroyuki Fuji and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: We examine a large N duality via geometric transition for N=1 SO/Sp gauge theories with superpotential for adjoint chiral superfield. In this paper, we find that the large N gauge theories are exactly analyzed for the classical quartic superpotentials by the finite rank SO/Sp gauge theories. With this classical superpotentials, we evaluate the confining phase superpotentials using the Seiberg-Witten theory. In the dual theory, we calculate the superpotential generated by the R-R and NS-NS 3-form fluxes. As the non-trivial examples, we discuss for SO(6), SO(8) and Sp(4) gauge theories. In these cases we have the perfect agreement of the confining phase superpotentials up to the 4th order of the glueball superfields.
