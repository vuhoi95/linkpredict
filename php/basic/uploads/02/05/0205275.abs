Title: Open String Field Theory around Universal Solutions
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We study the physical spectrum of cubic open string field theory around universal solutions, which are constructed using the matter Virasoro operators and the ghost and anti-ghost fields. We find the cohomology of the new BRS charge around the solutions, which appear with a ghost number that differs from that of the original theory. Considering the gauge-unfixed string field theory, we conclude that open string excitations perturbatively disappear after the condensation of the string field to the solutions.
