Title: Vanishing index for supersymmetric 2-matrix model with odd dimensional  gauge group
Authors: G. M. Graf and D. Hasler and J. Hoppe
Abstract: We define an operator which for odd-dimensional compact gauge group furnishes unitary equivalence of the bosonic and fermionic sector in the supersymmetric quantum-mechanical matrix model obtained by dimensional reduction from 3-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
