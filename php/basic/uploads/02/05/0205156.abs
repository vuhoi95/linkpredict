Title: A demonstration of scheme independence in scalar ERGs
Authors: Stefano Arnone and Antonio Gatti and Tim R. Morris
Abstract: The standard demand for the quantum partition function to be invariant under the renormalization group transformation results in a general class of exact renormalization group equations, different in the form of the kernel. Physical quantities should not be sensitive to the particular choice of the kernel. Such scheme independence is elegantly illustrated in the scalar case by showing that, even with a general kernel, the one-loop beta function may be expressed only in terms of the effective action vertices, and in this way the universal result is recovered.
