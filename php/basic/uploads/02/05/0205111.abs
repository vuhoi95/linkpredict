Title: New Vistas in Braneworld Cosmology
Authors: Varun Sahni and Yuri Shtanov
Abstract: Traditionally, higher-dimensional cosmological models have sought to provide a description of the fundamental forces in terms of a unifying geometrical construction. In this essay we discuss how, in their present incarnation, higher-dimensional `braneworld' models might provide answers to a number of cosmological puzzles including the issue of dark energy and the nature of the big-bang singularity.
