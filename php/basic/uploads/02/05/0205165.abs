Authors: Martin Cederwall and Bengt E. W. Nilsson and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We compute the spinorial cohomology of ten-dimensional abelian SYM at order alpha'^3 and we find that it is trivial. Consequently, linear supersymmetry alone excludes the presence of alpha'^3-order corrections. Our result lends support to the conjecture that there may be a unique supersymmetric deformation of ordinary ten-dimensional abelian SYM.
