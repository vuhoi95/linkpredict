Title: Asymptotical AdS from non-linear gravitational models with stabilized  extra dimensions
Authors: U. Guenther and P. Moniz and A. Zhuk
Abstract: We consider non-linear gravitational models with a multidimensional warped product geometry. Particular attention is payed to models with quadratic scalar curvature terms. It is shown that for certain parameter ranges, the extra dimensions are stabilized if the internal spaces have negative constant curvature. In this case, the 4-dimensional effective cosmological constant as well as the bulk cosmological constant become negative. As a consequence, the homogeneous and isotropic external space is asymptotically AdS. The connection between the D-dimensional and the 4-dimensional fundamental mass scales sets a restriction on the parameters of the considered non-linear models.
