Title: Rigorous proof of attractive nature for Casimir force of p-odd hypercube
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Xiang-hua Zhai
Abstract: The Casimir effect giving rise to an attractive force between the configuration boundaries that confine the massless scalar field is rigorously proven for odd dimensional hypercube with the Dirichlet boundary conditions and different spacetime dimensions D by the Epstein zeta function regularization.
