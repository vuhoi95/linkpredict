Abstract: The Polyakov world-line path integral describing the propagation of gluon field quanta is constructed by employing the background gauge fixing method and is subsequently applied to analytically compute the divergent terms of the one (gluonic) loop effective action to fourth order in perturbation theory. The merits of the proposed approach is that, to a given order, it reduces to performing two integrations, one over a set of Grassmann and one over a set of Feynman-type parameters through which one manages to accomodate all Feynman diagrams entering the computation at once.
