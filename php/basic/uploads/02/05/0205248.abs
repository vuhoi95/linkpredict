Title: Residual Symmetries in the Presence of an EM Background
Authors: H. L. Carrion and M. Rojas and F. Toppan
Abstract: The symmetry algebra of a QFT in the presence of an external EM background (named "residual symmetry") is investigated within a Lie-algebraic, model independent scheme. Some results previously encountered in the literature are here extended. In particular we compute the symmetry algebra for a constant EM background in D=3 and D=4 dimensions. In D= 3 dimensions the residual symmetry algebra is isomorphic to $u(1)\oplus {\cal P}_c(2)$, with ${\cal P}_c(2)$ the centrally extended 2-dimensional Poincar\'e algebra. In D=4 dimension the generic residual symmetry algebra is given by a seven-dimensional solvable Lie algebra which is explicitly computed. Residual symmetry algebras are also computed for specific non-constant EM backgrounds.
