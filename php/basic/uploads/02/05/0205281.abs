Title: On the partition sum of the NS five-brane
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and E. Verlinde and M. Vonk
Abstract: We study the Type IIA NS five-brane wrapped on a Calabi-Yau manifold X in a double-scaled decoupling limit. We calculate the euclidean partition function in the presence of a flat RR 3-form field. The classical contribution is given by a sum over fluxes of the self-dual tensor field which reduces to a theta-function. The quantum contributions are computed using a T-dual IIB background where the five-branes are replaced by an ALE singularity. Using the supergravity effective action we find that the loop corrections to the free energy are given by B-model topological string amplitudes. This seems to provide a direct link between the double-scaled little strings on the five-brane worldvolume and topological strings. Both the classical and quantum contributions to the partition function satisfy (conjugate) holomorphic anomaly equations, which explains an observation of Witten relating topological string theory to the quantization of three-form fields.
