Title: Gauge invariant cosmological perturbation theory for braneworlds
Authors: Alain Riazuelo and Filippo Vernizzi and Dani√®le Steer and Ruth Durrer
Abstract: We derive the gauge invariant perturbation equations for a 5-dimensional bulk spacetime in the presence of a brane. The equations are derived in full generality, without specifying a particular energy content of the bulk or the brane. We do not assume Z_2 symmetry, and show that the degree of freedom associated with brane motion plays a crucial role. Our formalism may also be used in the Z_2 symmetric case where it simplifies considerably.
