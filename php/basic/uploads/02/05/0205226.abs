Title: Renormalization flow from UV to IR degrees of freedom
Authors: Holger Gies and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: Within the framework of exact renormalization group flow equations, a scale-dependent transformation of the field variables provides for a continuous translation of UV to IR degrees of freedom. Using the gauged NJL model as an example, this translation results in a construction of partial bosonization at all scales. A fixed-point structure arises which makes it possible to distinguish between fundamental-particle and bound-state behavior of the scalar fields.
