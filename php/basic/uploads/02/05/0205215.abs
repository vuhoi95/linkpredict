Title: On correlation functions of characteristic polynomials for chiral  Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
Authors: Yan V Fyodorov and Eugene Strahov
Abstract: We calculate a general spectral correlation function of products and ratios of characteristic polynomials for a $N\times N$ random matrix taken from the chiral Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (chGUE). Our derivation is based upon finding an Itzykson-Zuber type integral for matrices from the non-compact manifold ${\sf{Gl(n,{\mathcal{C}})/U(1)\times ...\times U(1)}}$ (matrix Macdonald function). The correlation function is shown to be always represented in a determinant form generalising the known expressions for only positive moments. Finally, we present the asymptotic formula for the correlation function in the large matrix size limit.
