Title: The Harmonic Oscillator in the Plane and the Jordan-Schwinger Algebras
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Pradip Mukherjee
Abstract: The direct and indirect Lagrangian representations of the planar harmonic oscillator have been discussed. The reduction of these Lagrangians in their basic forms characterising either chiral, or pseudo - chiral oscillators have been given. A Hamiltonian analysis, showing its equivalence with the Lagrangian formalism has also been provided. Finally, we show that the chiral and pseudo - chiral modes act as dynamical structures behind the Jordan - Schwinger realizations of the SU(2) and SU(1,1) algebras. Also, the SU(1,1) construction found here is different from the standard Jordan - Schwinger form.
