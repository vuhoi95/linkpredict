Title: Quantum group symmetry and particle scattering in (2+1)-dimensional  quantum gravity
Authors: F. A. Bais and N. M. Muller and B. J. Schroers
Abstract: Starting with the Chern-Simons formulation of (2+1)-dimensional gravity we show that the gravitational interactions deform the Poincare symmetry of flat space-time to a quantum group symmetry. The relevant quantum group is the quantum double of the universal cover of the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz group, or Lorentz double for short. We construct the Hilbert space of two gravitating particles and use the universal R-matrix of the Lorentz double to derive a general expression for the scattering cross section of gravitating particles with spin. In appropriate limits our formula reproduces the semi-classical scattering formulae found by 't Hooft, Deser, Jackiw and de Sousa Gerbert.
