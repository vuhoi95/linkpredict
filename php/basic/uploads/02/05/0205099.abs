Title: Gravitational decays of heavy particles in large extra dimensions
Authors: E. Gabrielli and B. Mele
Abstract: In the framework of quantum gravity propagating in large extra dimensions, we analyze the inclusive radiative emission of Kaluza-Klein spin-2 gravitons in the two-fermions decays of massive gauge bosons, heavy quarks, Higgs bosons, and in the two-massive gauge bosons decay of Higgs bosons. We provide analytical expressions for the square modulus of amplitudes summed over polarizations, and numerical results for the widths and branching ratios. The corresponding decays in the Z, top quark, and Higgs boson sectors of the standard model are analyzed in the light of present and future experiments.
