Title: Energy Bounds of Linked Vortex States
Authors: A. P. Protogenov and V. A. Verbus
Abstract: Energy bounds of knotted and linked vortex states in a charged two-component system are considered. It is shown that a set of local minima of free energy contains new classes of universality. When the mutual linking number of vector order parameter vortex lines is less than the Hopf invariant, these states have lower-lying energies.
