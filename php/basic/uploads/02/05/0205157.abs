Title: Spinning Q-Balls
Authors: Mikhail S. Volkov and Erik Woehnert
Abstract: We present numerical evidence for the existence of spinning generalizations for non-topological Q-ball solitons in the theory of a complex scalar field with a non-renormalizable self-interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first explicit example of spinning solitons in 3+1 dimensional Minkowski space. In addition, we find an infinite discrete family of radial excitations of non-rotating Q-balls, and construct also spinning Q-balls in 2+1 dimensions.
