Title: Second order perturbations in the radius stabilized Randall-Sundrum two  branes model II -- Effect of relaxing strong coupling approximation --
Authors: Hideaki Kudoh and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We discuss gravitational perturbations in the Randall-Sundrum two branes model with radius stabilization. Following the idea by Goldberger and Wise for the radius stabilization, we introduce a scalar field which has potentials localized on the branes in addition to a bulk potential. In our previous paper we discussed gravitational perturbations induced by static, spherically symmetric and nonrelativistic matter distribution on the branes under the condition that the values of the scalar field on the respective branes cannot fluctuate due to its extremely narrow brane potentials. We call this case the strong coupling limit. Our concern in this paper is to generalize our previous analysis relaxing the limitation of taking the strong coupling limit. We find that new corrections in metric perturbations due to relaxing the strong coupling limit enhance the deviation from the 4D Einstein gravity only in some exceptional cases. In the case that matter fields reside on the negative tension brane, the stabilized radion mass becomes very small when the new correction becomes large.
