Title: Electroweak Hadronic Contributions to the muon g-2
Authors: M. Knecht and S. Peris and M. Perrottet and E. de Rafael
Abstract: We reanalyze the two-loop electroweak hadronic contributions to the muon g-2 that may be enhanced by large logarithms. The present evaluation is improved over those already existing in the literature by the implementation of the current algebra Ward identities and the inclusion of the correct short-distance QCD behaviour of the relevant hadronic Green's function.
