Title: On the stability of gravity in the presence of a non-minimally coupled  scalar field
Authors: L. Raul Abramo and L. Brenig and E. Gunzig
Abstract: We show that Einstein's gravity coupled to a non-minimally coupled scalar field is stable even for high values of the scalar field, when the sign of the Einstein-Hilbert action is reversed. We also discuss inflationary solutions and a possible new mechanism of reheating.
