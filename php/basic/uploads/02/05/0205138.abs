Title: Intersecting Membranes from Charged Macroscopic Strings
Authors: Anindya Biswas and Kamal Lochan Panigrahi
Abstract: We present a class of orthogonal membrane configurations which preserve 1/4 of the full type IIA supersymmetry. These membrane configurations carry additional F-string charges. We further analyze the D1-D3 configuration after applying T- duality along the world volume directions of the above orthogonal membranes.
