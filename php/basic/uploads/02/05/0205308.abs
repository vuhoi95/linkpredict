Title: WDVV Equations as Functional Relations
Authors: H. W. Braden and A. Marshakov
Abstract: We discuss the associativity or WDVV equations and demonstrate that they can be rewritten as certain functional relations between the {\it second} derivatives of a single function, similar to the dispersionless Hirota equations. The properties of these functional relations are further discussed.
