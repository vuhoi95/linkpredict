Title: Crystalline Color Superconductivity: Effective Lagrangian and Phonon  Dispersion Law
Authors: R. Casalbuoni and R. Gatto and G. Nardulli
Abstract: The recent study by Bowers and Rajagopal on the possible structures for the QCD crystalline color superconducting phase favors a cubic structure and allows for a first discussion of the QCD dynamics in the crystalline phase. The cubic structure leads to complete breaking of traslation invariance and to three phonon modes. We discuss the expected form of the effective Lagrangian and the phonon dispersion laws assuming the proposed crystal structure. Besides the interest for QCD and the related possible relevance to compact stars these considerations may become useful to atomic systems exhibiting crystalline superfluidity.
