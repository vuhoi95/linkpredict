Title: de Sitter black hole with a conformally coupled scalar field in four  dimensions
Authors: Cristian Martinez and Ricardo Troncoso and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: A four-dimensional black hole solution of the Einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant, coupled to a conformal scalar field, is given. There is a curvature singularity at the origin, and scalar field diverges inside the event horizon. The electrically charged solution, which has a fixed charge-to-mass ratio is also found. The quartic self-interacting coupling becomes bounded in terms of Newton's and the cosmological constants.
