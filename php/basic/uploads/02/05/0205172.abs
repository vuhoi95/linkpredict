Title: Non-universal corrections to the tension ratios in softly broken N=2  SU(N) gauge theory
Authors: Roberto Auzzi and Kenichi Konishi
Abstract: Calculation by Douglas and Shenker of the tension ratios for vortices of different N-alities in the softly broken N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, is carried to the second order in the adjoint multiplet mass m. Corrections to the ratios violating the well-known sine formula are found, showing that it is not a universal quantity.
