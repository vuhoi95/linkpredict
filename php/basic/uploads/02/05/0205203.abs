Title: Shortcuts for Graviton Propagation in a Six Dimensional Brane World  Model
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and Adenauer Casali and Bertha Cuadros-Melgar
Abstract: We consider a six dimensional brane world model with asymmetric warp factors for time and both extra spatial coordinates, $y$ and $z$. We derive the set of differential equations governing the shortest graviton path and numerically solve it for AdS-Schwarzschild and AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om bulks. In both cases we derive a set of conditions for the existence of shortcuts in bulks with shielded singularities and show some examples of shortcuts obtained under these conditions. Consequences are discussed.
