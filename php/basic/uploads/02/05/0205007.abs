Title: Complete positivity and entangled degrees of freedom
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini and R. Romano
Abstract: We study how some recently proposed noncontextuality tests based on quantum interferometry are affected if the test particles propagate as open systems in presence of a gaussian stochastic background. We show that physical consistency requires the resulting markovian dissipative time-evolution to be completely positive.
