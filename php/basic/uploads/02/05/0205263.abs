Title: Towards chaos criterion in quantum field theory
Authors: V. I. Kuvshinov and A. V. Kuzmin
Abstract: Chaos criterion for quantum field theory is proposed. Its correspondence with classical chaos criterion in semi-classical regime is shown. It is demonstrated for real scalar field that proposed chaos criterion can be used to investigate stability of classical solutions of field equations.
