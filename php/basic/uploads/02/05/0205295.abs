Title: Freezing of Moduli with Fluxes in Three Dimensions
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Vanicson L. Campos and Gabriele Ferretti and Rainer Heise
Abstract: We study warped compactifications to three dimensions, realized as an orientifold of type IIA string theory on T^7. By turning on 3- and 4-form fluxes on the torus in a supersymmetric way, we generate a potential for the moduli fields. We present various flux configurations with N=1,2,3,4,5,6 supersymmetries and count the number of moduli in each case. In particular, we show that there are N=1 configurations where all but one of the moduli are frozen.
