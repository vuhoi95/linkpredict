Title: CP violation and CKM predictions from Discrete Torsion
Authors: S. A. Abel and A. W. Owen
Abstract: We present a supersymmetric D-brane model that has CP spontaneously broken by discrete torsion. The low energy physics is largely independent of the compactification scheme and the kahler metric has `texture zeros' dictated by the choice of discrete torsion. This motivates a simple ansatz for the kahler metric which results in a CKM matrix given in terms of two free parameters, hence we predict a single mixing angle and the CKM phase. The CKM phase is predicted to be close to Pi/3.
