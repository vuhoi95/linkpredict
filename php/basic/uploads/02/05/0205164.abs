Title: Logarithmic Corrections to Black Hole Entropy and AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Sudipta Mukherji and Shesansu Sekhar Pal
Abstract: We calculate the correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes due to thermodynamic fluctuations. The result is then compared with the boundary gauge theory entropy corrections via AdS/CFT correspondence. We then further generalise our analysis for the rotating black hole in five dimensional AdS space.
