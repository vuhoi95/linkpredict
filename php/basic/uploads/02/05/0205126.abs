Title: Trace extensions, determinant bundles, and gauge group cocycles
Authors: Joakim Arnlind and Jouko Mickelsson
Abstract: We study the geometry of determinant line bundles associated to Dirac operators on compact odd dimensional manifolds. Physically, these arise as (local) vacuum line bundles in quantum gauge theory. We give a simplified derivation of the commutator anomaly formula using a construction based on noncyclic trace extensions and associated multiplicative renormalized determinants.
