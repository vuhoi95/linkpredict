Authors: Dongsu Bak and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Mohammad M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: After reviewing the supertubes and super brane-antibrane systems in the context of matrix model, we look for more general higher-dimensional configurations. For D3-bar{D3}, we find a non-trivial configuration with E cdot B not equal to 0 and describe the worldvolume gauge theory. We present the string probe of D3-bar{D3} system and study the decoupling limits leading to either noncommutative Super-Yang-Mills or NCOS theories with eight supercharges.
