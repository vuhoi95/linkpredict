Title: Deconstructing 5-D QED
Authors: Christopher T. Hill and Adam K. Leibovich
Abstract: We discuss periodic compactification and latticization of a 5-D U(1) theory with a Dirac fermion, yielding a 1+3 effective theory. We address subtleties in the lattice fermionic action,such as fermion doubling and the Wilson term. We compute the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the Wilson line which is finite for N-branes >= 3, due to the Z_N symmetry, which replaces translations in the 5th dimension. This mode becomes a PNGB in the low energy 1+3 theory. We derive its anomalous coupling to the "photon" and its KK-modes.
