Title: 1/4 BPS Dyonic Calorons
Authors: Kimyeong Lee and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We explore the 1/4 BPS configurations of the supersymmetric gauge theories on $R^{1+3} \times S^1$. The BPS bound for energy and the BPS equations are obtained and the characteristics of the BPS solutions are studied. These BPS configurations describe electrically charged calorons, which are constituted of dyons and carry linear momentum along the compact direction. We carry out various approaches to the single caloron case in the theory of SU(2) gauge group.
