Title: Bulk shape of brane-world black holes
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Lorenzo Mazzacurati
Abstract: We propose a method to extend into the bulk asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric brane-world metrics. We employ the multipole (1/r) expansion in order to allow exact integration of the relevant equations along the (fifth) extra coordinate and make contact with the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism. We apply our method to three families of solutions previously appeared as candidates of black holes in the brane world and show that the shape of the horizon is very likely a flat ``pancake'' for astrophysical sources.
