Title: Nonperturbative renormalization-group approach for quantum dissipative  systems
Authors: Ken-Ichi Aoki and Atsushi Horikoshi
Abstract: We analyze the dissipative quantum tunneling in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the nonperturbative renormalization-group method. We classify the dissipation effects by introducing the notion of effective cutoffs. We calculate the localization susceptibility to evaluate the critical dissipation for the quantum-classical transition. Our results are consistent with previous semiclassical arguments, but give considerably larger critical dissipation.
