Abstract: In this paper, following a stream of investigation on supersymmetric gauge theories with cosmic string solutions, we contemplate the possibility of building up a D-and-F term cosmic string by means of a gauge-field mixing in connection with a U(1) x U(1)'-symmetry. The spontaneous break of both gauge symmetry and supersymmetry are thoroughly analysed and the fermion zero-modes are worked out. The role of the gauge-field mixing parameter is elucidated in connection with the string configuration that comes out. As an application of the model presented here, we propose the possibility that the supersimetric cosmic string yield production of fermionic charge carriers that may eject, at their late stages, particles that subsequently decay to produce cosmic rays of ultra-high energy. In our work, it turns out that massive supersymmetric fermionic partners may be produced for a susy breaking scale in the range 10^{11} to 10^{13} GeV, which is compatible with the phenomenology of a gravitino mass at the TeV scale. We also determine the range of the gauge-field mixing parameter, \alpha, in connection with the mass scales of the present model.
