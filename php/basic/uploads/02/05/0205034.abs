Title: Fayet-Iliopoulos terms in 5d theories and their phenomenological  implications
Authors: Daniel Marti and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: Supersymmetric theories in 5d orbifold can have Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms on the boundaries. These terms induce a 5d mass for the bulk matter fields. We analyze this effect using N=1 superfields and show how it can be understood as a mixing between the U(1) gauge boson and the graviphoton. We also study the implications of the FI-terms in the mass spectrum of theories with Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking. We present a new 5d supersymmetric model that has the massless spectrum of the Standard Model and predicts a Higgs boson with a mass around the present experimental limit.
