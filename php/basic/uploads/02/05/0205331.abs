Title: Photon mass from inflation
Authors: Tomislav Prokopec and Ola Tornkvist and Richard Woodard
Abstract: We consider vacuum polarization from massless scalar electrodynamics in de Sitter inflation. The theory exhibits a 3+1 dimensional analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in which a photon mass is dynamically generated. The mechanism is generic for light scalar fields that couple minimally to gravity. The non-vanishing of the photon mass during inflation may result in magnetic fields on cosmological scales.
