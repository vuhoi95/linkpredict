Title: Topological Defects and the Trial Orbit Method
Authors: D. Bazeia and W. Freire and L. Losano and R. F. Ribeiro
Abstract: We deal with the presence of topological defects in models for two real scalar fields. We comment on defects hosting topological defects, and we search for explicit defect solutions using the trial orbit method. As we know, under certain circumstances the second order equations of motion can be solved by first order differential equations. In this case we show that the trial orbit method can be used very efficiently to obtain explicit solutions.
