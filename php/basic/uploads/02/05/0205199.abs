Title: Spectral asymmetry for bag boundary conditions
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and E. M. Santangelo and A. Wipf
Abstract: We give an expression, in terms of boundary spectral functions, for the spectral asymmetry of the Euclidean Dirac operator in two dimensions, when its domain is determined by local boundary conditions, and the manifold is of product type. As an application, we explicitly evaluate the asymmetry in the case of a finite-length cylinder, and check that the outcome is consistent with our general result. Finally, we study the asymmetry in a disk, which is a non-product case, and propose an interpretation.
