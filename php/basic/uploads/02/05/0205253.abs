Title: Convergence of the Gaussian Expansion Method in Dimensionally Reduced  Yang-Mills Integrals
Authors: Jun Nishimura and Toshiyuki Okubo and Fumihiko Sugino
Abstract: We advocate a method to improve systematically the self-consistent harmonic approximation (or the Gaussian approximation), which has been employed extensively in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. We demonstrate the {\em convergence} of the method in a model obtained from dimensional reduction of SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory in $D$ dimensions. Explicit calculations have been carried out up to the 7th order in the large-N limit, and we do observe a clear convergence to Monte Carlo results. For $D \gtrsim 10$ the convergence is already achieved at the 3rd order, which suggests that the method is particularly useful for studying the IIB matrix model, a conjectured nonperturbative definition of type IIB superstring theory.
