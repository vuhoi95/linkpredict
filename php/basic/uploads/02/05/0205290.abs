Title: The dual of nothing
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We consider ``bubbles of nothing'' constructed by analytically continuing black hole solutions in Anti-de Sitter space. These provide interesting examples of smooth time-dependent backgrounds which can be studied through the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our examples include bubbles constructed from Schwarzschild-AdS, Kerr-AdS and Reissner-Nordstrom AdS. The Schwarzschild bubble is dual to Yang-Mills theory on three dimensional de Sitter space times a circle. We construct the boundary stress tensor of the bubble spacetime and relate it to the properties of field theory on de Sitter.
