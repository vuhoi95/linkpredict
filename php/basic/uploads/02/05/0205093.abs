Title: Radiative Correctionsin Noncommutative QED
Authors: Ki Boum Eom and Sung-Shig Kang and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We study the radiative corrections of the noncommutative QED at the one-loop level. A correction of the magnetic dipole moment due to the noncommutativity are evaluated. As in the ordinary QED, IR divergence is shown to vanish when we combine both the tree level Bremsstrahlung diagram and the one-loop electron vertex function.
