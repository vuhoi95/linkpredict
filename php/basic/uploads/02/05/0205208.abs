Title: Cosmological Perturbations in Brane World - Brane view v.s. Bulk view -
Authors: Jiro Soda and Kazuya Koyama
Abstract: First, we will study the cosmological perturbations from the brane point of view. It turns out that two types of the extra data are necessary to know the evolution of the system. To fix these data, the analysis of the bulk is needed. So, we have solved equations of motion for the bulk gravity and determined the extra data. We would like to stress that, both analysis take complementary roles to achieve this goal.
