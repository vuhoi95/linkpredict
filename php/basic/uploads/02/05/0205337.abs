Title: The Formation of Classical Defects After a Slow Quantum Phase Transition
Authors: R. J. Rivers and F. C. Lombardo and F. D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: Classical defects (monopoles, vortices, etc.) are a characteristic consequence of many phase transitions of quantum fields. We show a model in which the onset of classical probability distributions, for the long-wavelength modes at early times, allows the identification of line-zeroes of the field with vortex separation. We obtain a refined version of Kibble's causal results for defect separation, but from a completely different approach. It is apparent that vortices are not created from thermal fluctuations in the Ginzburg regime.
