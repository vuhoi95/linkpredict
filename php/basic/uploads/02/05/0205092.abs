Title: Wess-Zumino term for AdS superstring
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: We examine a bilinear form Wess-Zumino term for a superstring in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. This is composed of two parts; a bilinear term in superinvariant currents and a total derivative bilinear term which is required for the pseudo-superinvariance of the Wess-Zumino term. The covariant supercharge commutator containing a string charge is also obtained.
