Title: Fermionic zeromodes in heterotic fivebrane backgrounds
Authors: Yasutaka Katagiri and Noriaki Kitazawa
Abstract: We investigate the explicit form of the fermionic zeromodes in heterotic fivebrane backgrounds. By explicitly solving the fermionic field equations in fivebrane backgrounds, two normalizable and physical fermionic zeromodes are obtained. Each of these zeromodes has a non-vanishing gravitino component. We suggest a possible scenario of the gravitino pair condensation.
