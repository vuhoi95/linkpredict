Title: Braneworld Tensor Anisotropies in the CMB
Authors: Bernard Leong and Anthony Challinor and Roy Maartens and Anthony Lasenby
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations provide in principle a high-precision test of models which are motivated by M theory. We set out the framework of a program to compute the tensor anisotropies in the CMB that are generated in braneworld models. In the simplest approximation, we show the braneworld imprint as a correction to the power spectra for standard temperature and polarization anisotropies.
