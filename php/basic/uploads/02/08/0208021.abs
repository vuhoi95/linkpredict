Title: Dirac Spectra and Real QCD at Nonzero Chemical Potential
Authors: D. Toublan and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: We show that QCD Dirac spectra well below Lambda_{QCD}, both at zero and at nonzero chemical potential, can be obtained from a chiral Lagrangian. At nonzero chemical potential Goldstone bosons with nonzero baryon number condense beyond a critical value. Such superfluid phase transition is likely to occur in any system with a chemical potential with the quantum numbers of the Goldstone bosons. We discuss the phase diagram for one such system, QCD with two colors, and show the existence of a tricritical point in an effective potential approach.
