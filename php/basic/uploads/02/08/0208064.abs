Title: A curious electrovac spacetime as $G = 0$ limit of the NUT space
Authors: Naresh Dadhich and L K Patel
Abstract: We take the $G = 0$ limit of the NUT space which yields a non flat space and show that source of its curvature is electromagnetic field generated by the NUT parameter defining the NUT symmetry. This is a very curious electrovac NUT space. Further it is also possible to superpose on it a global monopole.
