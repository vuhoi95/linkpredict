Title: Black-brane solution for A_3 algebra
Authors: M. A. Grebeniuk and V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: Black p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersection rules and Ricci-flat ``internal'' spaces are considered. They are defined up to moduli functions H_s obeying non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. A new solution with intersections corresponding to the Lie algebra A_3 is obtained. The functions H_1, H_2 and H_3 for this solution are polynomials of degree 3, 4 and 3, correspondingly. An example of A_3-solution with three 3-branes in 12-dimensional model (suggested by N. Khviengia et al) is presented.
