Title: Central elements of the elliptic Yang--Baxter algebra at roots of unity
Authors: A. Belavin and M. Jimbo
Abstract: We give central elements of the Yang-Baxter algebra for the $R$-matrix of the eight-vertex model, in the case when the crossing parameter is a rational multiple of one of the periods.
