Title: Black Hole Solutions in Braneworlds with Induced Gravity
Authors: G. Kofinas and E. Papantonopoulos and V. Zamarias
Abstract: We extent our previous study on spherically symmetric braneworld solutions with induced gravity, including non-local bulk effects. We find the most general static four-dimensional black hole solutions with g_{tt}=-g_{rr}^{-1}. They satisfy a closed system of equations on the brane and represent the strong-gravity corrections to the Schwarzschild-(A)dS_4 spacetime. These new solutions have extra terms which give extra attraction relative to the Newtonian-(A)dS_4 force; however, the conventional limits are easily obtained. These terms, when defined asymptotically, behave like AdS_4 in this regime, while when defined at infinitely short distances predict either an additional attractive Newtonian potential or an attractive potential which scales approximately as sqrt(r). One of the solutions found gives extra deflection of light compared to Newtonian deflection.
