Title: Disturbing Implications of a Cosmological Constant
Authors: Lisa Dyson and Matthew Kleban and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: In this paper we consider the implications of a cosmological constant for the evolution of the universe, under a set of assumptions motivated by the holographic and horizon complementarity principles. We discuss the ``causal patch" description of spacetime required by this framework, and present some simple examples of cosmologies described this way. We argue that these assumptions inevitably lead to very deep paradoxes, which seem to require major revisions of our usual assumptions.
