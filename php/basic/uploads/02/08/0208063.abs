Title: Quasi-normal modes of D3-brane Black Holes
Authors: Yasunari Kurita and Masa-aki Sakagami
Abstract: We investigate a method to evaluate quasi-normal modes of D3-brane black holes by wave interpretation of fields on D3-brane based on the Feynman's space-time approach. We perturbatively solve the wave equation which describes propagation of a dilaton wave in a bulk space and its interaction with the D3-brane. The obtained condition for the quasi-normal modes are qualitatively equivalent to that evaluated in the usual scattering of the dilaton in the black 3-brane spacetime in the corresponding supergravity description.
