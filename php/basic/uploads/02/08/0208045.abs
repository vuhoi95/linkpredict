Title: Spatially Averaged Quantum Inequalities Do Not Exist in Four-Dimensional  Spacetime
Authors: L. H. Ford and Adam D. Helfer and Thomas A. Roman
Abstract: We construct a particular class of quantum states for a massless, minimally coupled free scalar field which are of the form of a superposition of the vacuum and multi-mode two-particle states. These states can exhibit local negative energy densities. Furthermore, they can produce an arbitrarily large amount of negative energy in a given region of space at a fixed time. This class of states thus provides an explicit counterexample to the existence of a spatially averaged quantum inequality in four-dimensional spacetime.
