Title: Testing Nonperturbative Orbifold Conjecture
Authors: A. Gorsky and M. Shifman
Abstract: We discuss Strassler's hypothesis of matching nonperturbative effects in orbifold pairs of gauge theories which are perturbatively planar equivalent. One of the examples considered is the parent N=1 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and its nonsupersymmetric orbifold daughter. We apply two strategies allowing us to study nonperturbative effects: (i) low-energy theorems; (ii) putting the theory on small-size T^4 or R^3 x S^1 the parent and daughter theories are weakly coupled and amenable to quasiclassical treatment. In all cases our consideration yields a mismatch between the parent and daughter theories. Thus, regretfully, we present evidence against Strassler's hypothesis.
