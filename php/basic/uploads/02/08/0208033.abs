Abstract: We consider the evolution of small rotational perturbations, with azimuthal symmetry, of the brane-world cosmological models. The equations describing the temporal, radial, and angular dependence of the perturbations are derived by taking into account the effects of both scalar and tensor parts of the dark energy term on the brane. The time decay of the initial rotation is investigated for several types of equation of state of the ultra-high density cosmological matter. For an expanding Universe, rotation always decays in the case of the perfect dragging, for which the angular velocity of the matter on the brane equals the rotation metric tensor. For non-perfect dragging, the behavior of the rotation is strongly equation of state dependent. For some classes of dense matter, like the stiff causal or the Chaplygin gas, the angular velocity of the matter on the brane is an increasing function of time. For other types of the ultra-dense matter, like the Hagedorn fluid, rotation is smoothed out by the expansion of the Universe. Therefore the study of dynamics of rotational perturbations of brane world models, as well as in general relativity, could provide some insights on the physical properties and equation of state of the cosmological fluid filling the very early Universe.
