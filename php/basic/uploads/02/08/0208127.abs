Authors: Minoru Eto and Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai and Tsuyoshi Sakata
Abstract: A BPS exact wall solution is found in N=1 supergravity in four dimensions. The model uses chiral scalar field with a periodic superpotential admitting winding numbers. Maintaining the periodicity in supergravity requires a gravitational correction to superpotential which allows the exact solution. By introducing boundary cosmological constants, we construct non-BPS multi-wall solutions for which a systematic analytic approximation is worked out for small gravitational coupling.
