Title: Hilbert Space Structure in Classical Mechanics: (II)
Authors: E. Deotto and E. Gozzi and D. Mauro
Abstract: In this paper we analyze two different functional formulations of classical mechanics. In the first one the Jacobi fields are represented by bosonic variables and belong to the vector (or its dual) representation of the symplectic group. In the second formulation the Jacobi fields are given as condensates of Grassmannian variables belonging to the spinor representation of the metaplectic group. For both formulations we shall show that, differently from what happens in the case presented in paper no. (I), it is possible to endow the associated Hilbert space with a positive definite scalar product and to describe the dynamics via a Hermitian Hamiltonian. The drawback of this formulation is that higher forms do not appear automatically and that the description of chaotic systems may need a further extension of the Hilbert space.
