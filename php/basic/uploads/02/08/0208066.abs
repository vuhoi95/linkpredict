Title: Quenched chiral logarithms in lattice QCD with overlap Dirac quarks
Authors: Ting-Wai Chiu and Tung-Han Hsieh
Abstract: We examine quenched chiral logarithms in lattice QCD with overlap Dirac quarks. From our data of m_pi^2, we determine the coefficient of quenched chiral logarithm delta = 0.203(14), 0.176(17), 0.193(17) and 0.200(13) for lattices of sizes 8^3 times 24, 10^3 times 24, 12^3 times 24 and 16^3 times 32 respectively. Also, for the first three lattice sizes, we measure the index susceptibility of the overlap Dirac operator, and use the exact relation between the index susceptibility and the eta' mass in quenched chiral perturbation theory to obtain an independent determination of delta = 0.198(27), 0.173(24), 0.169(22), which are in good agreement with those determined from m_pi^2.
