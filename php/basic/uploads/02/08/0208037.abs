Title: Bianchi type I cosmology and the Euler-Calogero-Sutherland model
Authors: A. M. Khvedelidze and D. M. Mladenov
Abstract: The Bianchi type I cosmological model is brought into a form where the evolution of observables is governed by the unconstrained Hamiltonian that coincides with the Hamiltonian describing the relative motion of particles in the integrable three-body hyperbolic Euler-Calogero-Sutherland system.
