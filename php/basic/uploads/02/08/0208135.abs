Title: Order $1/N^2$ test of the Maldacena conjecture II: the full bulk  one-loop contribution to the boundary Weyl anomaly
Authors: Paul Mansfield and David Nolland and Tatsuya Ueno
Abstract: We compute the complete bulk one-loop contribution to the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory for IIB Supergravity compactified on $ AdS_5\times S^5$. The result, that $\delta {\cal A}=(E+I)/(2\pi^2)$, reproduces the subleading term in the exact expression ${\cal A}=-(N^2-1)(E+I)/(2\pi^2)$ for the Weyl anomaly of ${\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory, confirming the Maldacena conjecture. The anomaly receives contributions from all multiplets casting doubt on the possibility of describing the boundary theory beyond leading order in $N$ by a consistent truncation to the `massless' multiplet of IIB Supergravity.
