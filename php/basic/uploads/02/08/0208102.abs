Title: Black Hole as a Point Radiator and Recoil Effect on the Brane World
Authors: Valeri Frolov and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: A small black hole attached to a brane in a higher dimensional space emitting quanta into the bulk may leave the brane as a result of a recoil. We construct a field theory model in which such a black hole is described as a massive scalar particle with internal degrees of freedom. In this model, the probability of transition between the different internal levels followed by emission of massless quanta is identical to the probability of thermal emission calculated for the Schwarzschild black hole. The discussed recoil effect implies that the thermal emission of the black holes, which might be created by interaction of high energy particles in colliders, could be terminated and the energy non-conservation can be observed in the brane experiments.
