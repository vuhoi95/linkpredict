Title: The accelerating universe in brane-world cosmology
Authors: M. D. Maia and Edmundo M. Monte and J. M. F. Maia
Abstract: The standard Friedmann universe embedded in a five dimensional and constant curvature bulk is examined without any a priori junction condition between the brane and the bulk. A geometrical explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe is derived by using a minimum set of assumptions consistent with the brane-world program. It is shown that the extrinsic curvature of the brane can be associated to the dark energy which presumably drives the universe expansion.
