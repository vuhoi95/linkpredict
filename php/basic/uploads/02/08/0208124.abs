Title: Tachyonic Inflation in the Braneworld Scenario
Authors: M. C. Bento and O. Bertolami and A. A. Sen
Abstract: We consider cosmological inflation driven by the rolling tachyon in the context of the braneworld scenario. We show that sufficient inflation consistent with the observational constraints can be achieved for well defined upper limits on the five-dimensional mass scale, string mass scale and the string coupling for the bosonic string.
