Title: Running of Gauge Couplings in AdS5 via Deconstruction
Authors: Adam Falkowski and Hyung Do Kim
Abstract: Running of gauge couplings on a slice of AdS5 is examined using the deconstruction set-up. Logarithmic running instead of (linear) power law is justified when the cutoff is lower than the curvature scale. Most of interesting features in warped gauge theory including the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes, the widening of higher Kaluza-Klein spectrum spacing are well captured within the framework of the deconstruction.
