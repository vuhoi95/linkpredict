Title: The one-loop effective action for quantum electrodynamics on  noncomutative space
Authors: Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the divergent part of the one loop effective action for QED on noncommutative space using the background field method. The effective action is obtained up to the second order in the noncommutative parameter theta and in the classical fields.
