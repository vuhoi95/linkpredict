Title: Magnetic monopoles with generalized quantization condition
Authors: Alexander I Nesterov and F. Aceves de la Cruz
Abstract: Theory of pointlike magnetic monopole with an arbitrary magnetic charge is considered. It is shown that a proper description requires making use of nonunitary representations of the rotation group and the nonassociative generalization of the gauge group and fibre bundle theory.
