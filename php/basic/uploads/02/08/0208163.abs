Title: On the Hagedorn Behaviour of PP-wave Strings and N=4 SYM Theory at  Finite R-Charge Density
Authors: Brian R. Greene and Koenraad Schalm and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We discuss the high temperature behaviour of IIB strings in the maximally symmetric plane wave background, and show that there is a Hagedorn temperature. We discuss the map between strings in the pp-wave background and the dual superconformal field theory in the thermal domain. The Hagedorn bound describes a curve in the R-charge chemical potential versus temperature phase diagram of the dual Yang-Mills theory and the theory manifestly exists on both sides. Using a recent observation of Brower, Lowe, and Tan, we update our earlier calculation to reflect that the pp-wave string exists on both sides of the Hagedorn bound as well.
