Title: Minimal Superspace Vector Fields for 5D Minimal Supersymmetry
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Lubna Rana
Abstract: We investigate a minimal superspace description for 5D superconformal Killing vectors. The vielbein appropriate for AdS symmetry is discussed within the confines of this minimal supergeometry.
