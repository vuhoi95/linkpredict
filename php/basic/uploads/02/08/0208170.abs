Title: No-go theorem for the classical Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics in  odd-dimensional worlds
Authors: Andrew E. Chubykalo and Augusto Espinoza and B. P. Kosyakov
Abstract: If the conventional Maxwell--Lorentz formulation of classical electrodynamics is adopted in a flat spacetime of arbitrary odd dimension, then the retarded vector potential $A^\mu$ generated by a point charge turns out to be pure gauge, $A^\mu=\partial^\mu\chi$. By Gauss' law, the charge shows up as zero. The classical electromagnetic coupling is thus missing from odd-dimensional worlds. If the action is augmented by the addition of the Chern--Simons term, then the classical interaction picture in the three-dimensional world becomes nontrivial.
