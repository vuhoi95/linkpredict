Title: Exact Anomalous Dimensions for N=2 ADE SCFTs
Authors: Yaron Oz and Tadakatsu Sakai
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories based on ADE quiver diagrams. We use the procedure of hep-th/0206079 and compute the exact anomalous dimensions of operators with large U(1)_R charge to all orders in perturbation in the planar limit. The results are in agreement with the string computation in the dual pp-wave backgrounds.
