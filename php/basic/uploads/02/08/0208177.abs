Title: Enhanced gauge symmetry from `toric' G_2 cones
Authors: L. Anguelova and C. I. Lazaroiu
Abstract: We review our recent work on M-theory compactifications on `toric' G_2 cones, a class of models which generalize those recently considered by Acharya and Witten and lead to chiral matter in four dimensions. We explain our criteria for identifying the gauge group content of such theories and briefly discuss the associated metrics.
