Title: Dynamics and holographic discreteness of tachyonic inflation
Authors: Bin Wang and Elcio Abdalla and Ru-Keng Su
Abstract: We consider issues related to tachyonic inflation with inverse-power-law potential. We find the solution of the evolution equations in the slow roll limit in FRW as well as in the brane cosmology. Using the holographic entropy bound, we estimate the quantum-gravitational discreteness of tachyonic inflation perturbations.
