Title: Gauge Fields on Tori and T-duality
Authors: Masashi Hamanaka and Hiroshige Kajiura
Abstract: We discuss gauge fields on tori in diverse dimensions, mainly in two and four dimensions. We construct various explicit gauge fields which have some topological charges and find the Dirac zero modes in the background of the gauge fields. By using the zero mode, we give new gauge fields on the dual torus, which is a gauge theoretical description of T-duality transformation of the corresponding D-brane systems including DDbar systems. From the transformation, we can easily see the duality expected from the index theorem. It is also mentioned that, for each topological charges, the corresponding constant curvature bundle can be constructed and their duality transformation can be performed in terms of Heisenberg modules.
