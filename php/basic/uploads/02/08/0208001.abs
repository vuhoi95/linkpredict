Title: The dynamics of vortices on S^2 near the Bradlow limit
Authors: J. M. Baptista and N. S. Manton
Abstract: The explicit solutions of the Bogomolny equations for N vortices on a sphere of radius R^2 > N are not known. In particular, this has prevented the use of the geodesic approximation to describe the low energy vortex dynamics. In this paper we introduce an approximate general solution of the equations, valid for R^2 close to N, which has many properties of the true solutions, including the same moduli space CP^N. Within the framework of the geodesic approximation, the metric on the moduli space is then computed to be proportional to the Fubini- Study metric, which leads to a complete description of the particle dynamics.
