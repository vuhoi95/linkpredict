Title: Axial anomaly with the overlap-Dirac operator in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Takanori Fujiwara and Keiichi Nagao and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: We evaluate for arbitrary even dimensions the classical continuum limit of the lattice axial anomaly defined by the overlap-Dirac operator. Our calculational scheme is simple and systematic. In particular, a powerful topological argument is utilized to determine the value of a lattice integral involved in the calculation. When the Dirac operator is free of species doubling, the classical continuum limit of the axial anomaly in various dimensions is combined into a form of the Chern character, as expected.
