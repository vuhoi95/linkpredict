Title: Semiclassical Theory for Two-anyon System
Authors: Jin Hur and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: The semiclassical quantization conditions for all partial waves are derived for bound states of two interacting anyons in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field. Singular Aharonov-Bohm-type interactions between the anyons are dealt with by the modified WKB method of Friedrich and Trost. For s-wave bound state problems in which the choice of the boundary condition at short distance gives rise to an additional ambiguity, a suitable generalization of the latter method is required to develop a consistent WKB approach. We here show how the related self-adjoint extension parameter affects the semiclassical quantization condition for energy levels. For some simple cases admitting exact answers, we verify that our semiclassical formulas in fact provide highly accurate results over a broad quantum number range.
