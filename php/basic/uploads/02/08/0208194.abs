Title: Star products and perturbative quantum field theory
Authors: Allen C. Hirshfeld and Peter Henselder
Abstract: We discuss the application of the deformation quantization approach to perturbative quantum field theory. We show that the various forms of Wick's theorem are a direct consequence of the structure of the star products. We derive the scattering function for a free scalar field in interaction with a spacetime-dependent source. We show that the translation to operator formalism reproduces the known relations which lead to the derivation of the Feynman rules.
