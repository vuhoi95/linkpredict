Title: Deconstruction and Gauge Theories in AdS_5
Authors: Lisa Randall and Yael Shadmi and Neal Weiner
Abstract: On a slice of AdS_5, despite having a dimensionful coupling, gauge theories can exhibit logarithmic dependence on scale. In this paper, we utilize deconstruction to analyze the scaling behavior of the theory, both above and below the AdS curvature scale, and shed light on position-dependent regularizations of the theory. We comment on applications to geometries other than AdS.
