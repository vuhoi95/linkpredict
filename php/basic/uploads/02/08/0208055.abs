Title: The primordial density perturbation in the curvaton scenario
Authors: David H. Lyth and Carlo Ungarelli and David Wands
Abstract: We analyse the primordial density perturbation when it is generated by a `curvaton' field different from the inflaton. In some cases this perturbation may have large isocurvature components, fully correlated or anti-correlated with the adiabatic component. It may also have a significant non-Gaussian component. All of these effects are calculated in a form which will enable direct comparison with current and forthcoming observational data.
