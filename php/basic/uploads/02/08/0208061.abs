Title: Strongly coupled N=1 SYM theory on the lattice
Authors: F. Berruto and M. Schwetz
Abstract: We propose a strong coupling expansion as a possible tool to obtain qualitative and quantitative informations about N=1 SYM theory. We point out the existence of a mapping between strongly coupled lattice N=1 SYM theory and a generalized SO(4) antiferromagnetic spin system.
