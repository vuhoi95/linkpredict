Title: Decay of Unstable D-branes with Electric Field
Authors: Partha Mukhopadhyay and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: Using the techniques of two dimensional conformal field theory we construct time dependent classical solutions in open string theory describing the decay of an unstable D-brane in the presence of background electric field, and explicitly evaluate the time dependence of the energy momentum tensor and the fundamental string charge density associated with this solution. The final decay product can be interpreted as a combination of stretched fundamental strings and tachyon matter.
