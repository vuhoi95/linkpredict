Title: Inequivalent Quantizations of the Rational Calogero Model
Authors: B. Basu-Mallick and Pijush K. Ghosh and Kumar S. Gupta
Abstract: We show that the rational Calogero model with suitable boundary condition admits quantum states with non-equispaced energy levels. Such a spectrum generically consists of infinitely many positive energy states and a single negative energy state. The new states appear for arbitrary number of particles and for specific ranges of the coupling constant. These states owe their existence to the self-adjoint extensions of the corresponding Hamiltonian, which are labelled by a real parameter z. Each value of z corresponds to a particular spectrum, leading to inequivalent quantizations of the model.
