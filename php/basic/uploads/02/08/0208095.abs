Title: Seiberg-Witten Description of the Deconstructed 6D (0,2) Theory
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Joshua Erlich and John Terning
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that, in a large N limit, a particular four dimensional gauge theory is indistinguishable from the six dimensional CFT with (0,2) supersymmetry compactified on a torus. We give further evidence for this correspondence by studying the Seiberg-Witten curve for the "deconstructed" theory and demonstrating that along the reduced Coulomb branch of moduli space (on the intersection of the Higgs and Coulomb branches) it describes the low energy physics on a stack of M5-branes on a torus, which is the (0,2) theory on a torus as claimed. The M-theory construction helps to clarify the enhancement of supersymmetry in the deconstructed theory at low energies, and demonstrates its stability to radiative and instanton corrections. We demonstrate the role of the theta vacuum in the deconstructed theory. We point out that by varying the theta parameters and gauge couplings in the deconstructed theory, the complex structure of the torus can be chosen arbitrarily, and the torus is not metrically S^1 x S^1 in general.
