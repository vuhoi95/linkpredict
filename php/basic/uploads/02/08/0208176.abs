Title: An Algorithm for the Microscopic Evaluation of the Coefficients of the  Seiberg-Witten Prepotential
Authors: R. Flume and R. Poghossian
Abstract: A procedure, allowing to calculate the coefficients of the SW prepotential in the framework of the instanton calculus is presented. As a demonstration explicit calculations for 2, 3 and 4- instanton contributions are carried out.
