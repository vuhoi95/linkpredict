Title: Instantons in the Double-Tensor Multiplet
Authors: Ulrich Theis and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: The double-tensor multiplet naturally appears in type IIB superstring compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, and is dual to the universal hypermultiplet. We revisit the calculation of instanton corrections to the low-energy effective action, in the supergravity approximation. We derive a Bogomolny'i bound for the double-tensor multiplet and find new instanton solutions saturating the bound. They are characterized by the topological charges and the asymptotic values of the scalar fields in the double-tensor multiplet.
