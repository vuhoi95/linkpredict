Title: DBI Action from Closed Strings and D-brane second Quantization
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Dimitri Polyakov
Abstract: Brane-like vertex operators play an important role in a worldsheet formulation of D-branes and M-theory. In this paper we derive the DBI D-brane action from NSR closed string sigma-model with brane-like states. We also show that these operators carry RR charges and define D-brane wavefunctions in a second quantized formalism.
