Title: Domain walls of N=2 supergravity in five dimensions from hypermultiplet  moduli spaces
Authors: L. Anguelova and C. I. Lazaroiu
Abstract: We study domain wall solutions in d=5, N=2 supergravity coupled to a single hypermultiplet whose moduli space is described by certain inhomogeneous, toric ESD manifolds constructed recently by Calderbank and Singer. Upon gauging a generic U(1) isometry of these spaces, we obtain an infinite family of models whose "superpotential" admits an arbitrary number of isolated critical points. By investigating the associated supersymmetric flows, we prove the existence of domain walls of Randall-Sundrum type for each member of our family, and find chains of domain walls interpolating between various AdS_5 backgrounds. Our models are described by a discrete infinity of smooth and complete one-hypermultiplet moduli spaces, which live on an open subset of the minimal resolution of certain cyclic quotient singularities. These spaces generalize the Pedersen metrics considered recently by Behrndt and Dall' Agata.
