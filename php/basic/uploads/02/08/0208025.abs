Title: Linearized gravity, Newtonian limit and light deflection in RS1 model
Authors: Mikhail N. Smolyakov and Igor P. Volobuev
Abstract: We solve exactly the equations of motion for linearized gravity in the Randall-Sundrum model with matter on the branes and calculate the Newtonian limit in it. The result contains contributions of the radion and of the massive modes, which change considerably Newton's law at small distances. The effects of "shadow" matter, which lives on the other brane, are considered and compared with those of ordinary matter for both positive and negative tension branes. We also calculate light deflection and Newton's law in the zero mode approximation and explicitly distinguish the contribution of the radion field.
