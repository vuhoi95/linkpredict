Title: Geometric Constructions of Nongeometric String Theories
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and John McGreevy and Brook Williams
Abstract: We advocate a framework for constructing perturbative closed string compactifications which do not have large-radius limits. The idea is to augment the class of vacua which can be described as fibrations by enlarging the monodromy group around the singular fibers to include perturbative stringy duality symmetries. As a controlled laboratory for testing this program, we study in detail six-dimensional (1,0) supersymmetric vacua arising from two-torus fibrations over a two-dimensional base. We also construct some examples of two-torus fibrations over four-dimensional bases, and comment on the extension to other fibrations.
