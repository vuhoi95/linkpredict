Title: Strings in the near plane wave background and AdS/CFT
Authors: Andrei Parnachev and Anton V. Ryzhov
Abstract: We study the AdS/CFT correspondence for string states which flow into plane wave states in the Penrose limit. Leading finite radius corrections to the string spectrum are compared with scaling dimensions of finite R-charge BMN-like operators. We find agreement between string and gauge theory results.
