Title: Convexity and potential sums for Salpeter-like Hamiltonians
Authors: Richard L. Hall and Wolfgang Lucha and Franz F. Schoeberl
Abstract: The semirelativistic Hamiltonian H = \beta\sqrt{m^2 + p^2} + V(r), where V(r) is a central potential in R^3, is concave in p^2 and convex in p. This fact enables us to obtain complementary energy bounds for the discrete spectrum of H. By extending the notion of 'kinetic potential' we are able to find general energy bounds on the ground-state energy E corresponding to potentials with the form V = sum_{i}a_{i}f^{(i)}(r). In the case of sums of powers and the log potential, where V(r) = sum_{q\ne 0} a(q) sgn(q)r^q + a(0)ln(r), the bounds can all be expressed in the semi-classical form E \approx \min_{r}{\beta\sqrt{m^2 + 1/r^2} + sum_{q\ne 0} a(q)sgn(q)(rP(q))^q + a(0)ln(rP(0))}. 'Upper' and 'lower' P-numbers are provided for q = -1,1,2, and for the log potential q = 0. Some specific examples are discussed, to show the quality of the bounds.
