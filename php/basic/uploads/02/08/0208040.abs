Title: Wigner's Formulation of Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Akira Kokado and Takashi Okamura and Takesi Saito
Abstract: When we have noncommutativity among coordinates (or conjugate momenta), we consider Wigner's formulation of quantum mechanics, including a new derivation of path integral formula. We also propose the Moyal star product based on the Dirac bracket in constrained systems.
