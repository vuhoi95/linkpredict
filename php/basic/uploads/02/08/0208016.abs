Title: Study of the 2d Ising Model with mixed perturbation
Authors: P. Grinza and A. Rago
Abstract: We study the thermodynamical observables of the 2d Ising model in the neighborhood of the magnetic axis by means of numerical diagonalization of the transfer matrix. In particular, we estimate the leading order corrections to the Zamolodchikov mass spectrum and find evidence of non-vanishing contributions due to the stress-energy tensor.
