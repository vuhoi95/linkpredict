Title: Brane Solitons for G_2 Structures in Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity  Re-Visited
Authors: J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We investigate the four-dimensional supergravity theory obtained from the compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity on a smooth manifold of G_2 holonomy. We give a new derivation for the Kaehler potential associated with the scalar kinetic term of the N=1 four-dimensional theory. We then examine some solutions of the four-dimensional theory which arise from wrapped M-branes.
