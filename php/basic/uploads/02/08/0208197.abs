Title: Plane Waves: To infinity and beyond!
Authors: Donald Marolf and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic boundary of the general homogeneous plane wave spacetime, using a construction of the `points at infinity' from the causal structure of the spacetime as introduced by Geroch, Kronheimer and Penrose. We show that this construction agrees with the conformal boundary obtained by Berenstein and Nastase for the maximally supersymmetric ten-dimensional plane wave. We see in detail how the possibility to go beyond (or around) infinity arises from the structure of light cones. We also discuss the extension of the construction to time-dependent plane wave solutions, focusing on the examples obtained from the Penrose limit of Dp-branes.
