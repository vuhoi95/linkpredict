Title: Suppression of Entropy Perturbations in Multi--Field Inflation on the  Brane
Authors: P. R. Ashcroft and C. van de Bruck and A. -C. Davis
Abstract: At energies higher than the brane tension, the dynamics of a scalar field rolling down a potential are modified relative to the predictions of General Relativity. The modifications imply, among other things, that steeper potentials can be used to drive an epoch of slow--roll inflation. We investigate the evolution of entropy and adiabatic modes during inflation driven by two scalar fields confined on the brane. We show that the amount of entropy perturbations produced during inflation is suppressed compared to the predictions made by General Relativity. As a consequence, the initial conditions do not matter in multiple field inflation in brane worlds if inflation is driven at energies much higher than the brane tension.
