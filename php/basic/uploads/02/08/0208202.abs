Title: Integrable aspects of the scaling q-state Potts models II: finite-size  effects
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Andrew Pocklington and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: We continue our discussion of the q-state Potts models for q <= 4, in the scaling regimes close to their critical and tricritical points. In a previous paper, the spectrum and full S-matrix of the models on an infinite line were elucidated; here, we consider finite-size behaviour. TBA equations are proposed for all cases related to phi(21) and phi(12) perturbations of unitary minimal models. These are subjected to a variety of checks in the ultraviolet and infrared limits, and compared with results from a recently-proposed nonlinear integral equation. A nonlinear integral equation is also used to study the flows from tricritical to critical models, over the full range of q. Our results should also be of relevance to the study of the off-critical dilute A models in regimes 1 and 2.
