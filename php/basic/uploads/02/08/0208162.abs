Title: On uncertainty relations in noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: Katarzyna Bolonek and Piotr Kosinski
Abstract: We discuss the uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics on noncommutative plane. In particular, we show that, for a given state at most one out of three basic nontrivial uncertainty relations can be saturated. We consider also in some detail the case of angular momentum eigenstates.
