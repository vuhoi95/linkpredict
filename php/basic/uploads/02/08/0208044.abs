Title: The non-abelian D-brane effective action through order $Î±'{}^4$
Authors: Paul Koerber and Alexander Sevrin
Abstract: Requiring the existence of certain BPS solutions to the equations of motion, we determine the bosonic part of the non-abelian D-brane effective action through order $\alpha'{}^4$. We also propose an economic organizational principle for the effective action.
