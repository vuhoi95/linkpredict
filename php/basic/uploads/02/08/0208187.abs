Title: Branes in Time-Dependent Backgrounds and AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Shahrokh Parvizi
Abstract: We study supergravity solutions of Dp-branes in the time-dependent orbifold background. We show that worldvolume theories decouple from the bulk gravity for p less than six. Along AdS/CFT correspondence, these solutions could provide the gravity description of noncommutative field theory with time-dependent noncommutative parameter. Type II NS5-brane (M5-brane) in the presence of RR n-form for n=0,..., 4 (C field) in this time-dependent background have also been studied.
