Title: Bound States in one and two Spatial Dimensions
Authors: K. Chadan and N. N. Khuri and A. Martin and T. T. Wu
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of bound states for potentials in one and two spatial dimensions. We first show that in addition to the well-known fact that an arbitrarily weak attractive potential has a bound state, it is easy to construct examples where weak potentials have an infinite number of bound states. These examples have potentials which decrease at infinity faster than expected. Using somewhat stronger conditions, we derive explicit bounds on the number of bound states in one dimension, using known results for the three-dimensional zero angular momentum. A change of variables which allows us to go from the one-dimensional case to that of two dimensions results in a bound for the zero angular momentum case. Finally, we obtain a bound on the total number of bound states in two dimensions, first for the radial case and then, under stronger conditions, for the non-central case.
