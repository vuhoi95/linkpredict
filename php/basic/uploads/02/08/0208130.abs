Title: Heat trace asymptotics defined by transfer boundary conditions
Authors: Peter Gilkey and Klaus Kirsten and Dmitri Vassilevich
Abstract: We compute the first 5 terms in the short-time heat trace asymptotics expansion for an operator of Laplace type with transfer boundary conditions using the functorial properties of these invariants.
