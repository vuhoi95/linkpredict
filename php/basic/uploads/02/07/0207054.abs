Title: Naked Singularity and Thunderbolt
Authors: Akihiro Ishibashi and Akio Hosoya
Abstract: We consider quantum theoretical effects of the sudden change of the boundary conditions which mimics the occurrence of naked singularities. For a simple demonstration, we study a massless scalar field in $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with finite spatial interval. We calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and explicitly show that singular wave or {\em thunderbolt} appears along the Cauchy horizon. The thunderbolt possibly destroys the Cauchy horizon if its backreaction on the geometry is taken into account, leading to quantum restoration of the global hyperbolicity. The result of the present work may also apply to the situation that a closed string freely oscillating is traveling to a brane and changes itself to an open string pinned-down by the ends satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the brane.
