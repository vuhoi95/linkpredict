Title: On Yang--Mills instantons over multi-centered gravitational instantons
Authors: Gabor Etesi and Tamas Hausel
Abstract: In this paper we explicitly calculate the analogue of the 't Hooft SU(2) Yang--Mills instantons on Gibbons--Hawking multi-centered gravitational instantons which come in two parallel families: the multi-Eguchi--Hanson, or A_k ALE gravitational instantons and the multi-Taub--NUT, or A_k ALF gravitational instantons. We calculate their action and find the reducible ones. Following Kronheimer we also exploit the U(1) invariance of our solutions and study the corresponding explicit singular SU(2) magnetic monopole solutions on Euclidean three-space.
