Title: More self-tuning solutions with $H_{MNPQ}$
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We find more self-tuning solutions by introducing a general form for Lagrangian of a 3-index antisymmetric tensor field $A_{MNP}$ in the RS II model. In particular, for the logarithmic Lagrangian, $\propto\log(-H^2)$, we obtained a closed form weak self-tuning solution.
