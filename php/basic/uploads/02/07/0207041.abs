Title: On the Nonlocal Equations and Nonlocal Charges Associated with the Harry  Dym Hierarchy
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and G. A. T. F. da Costa
Abstract: A large class of nonlocal equations and nonlocal charges for the Harry Dym hierarchy is exhibited. They are obtained from nonlocal Casimirs associated with its bi-Hamiltonian structure. The Lax representation for some of these equations is also given.
