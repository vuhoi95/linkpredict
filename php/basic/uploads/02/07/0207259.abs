Title: Holomorphic N=1 Special Geometry of Open--Closed Type II Strings
Authors: W. Lerche and P. Mayr and N. Warner
Abstract: We outline a general geometric structure that underlies the N=1 superpotentials of a certain class of flux and brane configurations in type II string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. This ``holomorphic N=1 special geometry'' is in many respects comparable to, and in a sense an extension of, the familiar special geometry in N=2 supersymmetric type II string compactifications. It puts the computation of the instanton-corrected superpotential W of the four-dimensional N=1 string effective action on a very similar footing as the familiar computation of the N=2 prepotential F via mirror symmetry. In this note we present some of the main ideas and results, while more details as well as some explicit computations will appear in a companion paper
