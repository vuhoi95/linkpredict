Title: Observations on the Holographic Duals of 4-D Extremal Black Holes
Authors: S. Ferrara and M. Porrati
Abstract: We argue that extremal black holes of N=4 Poincare supergravity coupled to conformal matter have a quantum-exact dual 5-d description in the maximally supersymmetric extension of the Randall-Sundrum theory. This dual is a the classical, static supergravity solution describing a string with both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond charge with respect to different antisymmetric tensor doublets. We also discuss the issue of the singularity present in a class of such supergravity solutions found by Cvetic, Lu and Pope.
