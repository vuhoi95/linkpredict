Title: On the tachyon inflation
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Dao-jun Liu and Jian-gang Hao
Abstract: Although the formulas of tachyon inflation correspond to those of the inflation driven by the ordinary scalar field, there is obvious difference between them, which can not be neglected. We calculate the scalar and tensor perturbation of the string theory inspired tachyon inflation, which has been widely studied recently. We also show, through the Hamilton-Jacobi approach, that the the rolling tachyon can essentially produce enough inflation. An exact solution with the inverse squared potential of tachyon field has been proposed and its power spectra has been analyzed.
