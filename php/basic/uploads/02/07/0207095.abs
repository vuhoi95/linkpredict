Title: Mass Generation from Lie Algebra Extensions
Authors: R. Aldrovandi and V. C. de Andrade and A. L. Barbosa and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: Applied to the electroweak interactions, the theory of Lie algebra extensions suggests a mechanism by which the boson masses are generated without resource to spontaneous symmetry breaking. It starts from a gauge theory without any additional scalar field. All the couplings predicted by the Weinberg-Salam theory are present, and a few others which are nevertheless consistent within the model.
