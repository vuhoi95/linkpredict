Title: A Non-supersymmetric Deformation of the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: James Babington and David E. Crooks and Nick Evans
Abstract: We deform the AdS/CFT Correspondence by the inclusion of a non-supersymmetric scalar mass operator. We discuss the behaviour of the dual 5 dimensional supergravity field then lift the full solution to 10 dimensions. Brane probing the resulting background reveals a potential consistent with the operator we wished to insert.
