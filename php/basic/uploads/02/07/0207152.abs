Title: Boundary One-Point Functions, Scattering, and Background Vacuum  Solutions in Toda Theories
Authors: V. A. Fateev and E. Onofri
Abstract: The parametric families of integrable boundary affine Toda theories are considered. We calculate boundary one-point functions and propose boundary S-matrices in these theories. We use boundary one-point functions and S-matrix amplitudes to derive boundary ground state energies and exact solutions describing classical vacuum configurations.
