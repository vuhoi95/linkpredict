Title: The Schwinger Model and the Physical Projector: a Nonperturbative  Quantization without Gauge Fixing
Authors: Gabriel Y. H. Avossevou and Jan Govaerts
Abstract: Based on the physical projector approach, a nonpertubative quantization of the massless Schwinger model is considered which does not require any gauge fixing. The spectrum of physical states, readily identified following a diagonalization of the operator algebra, is that of a massive pseudoscalar field, namely the electric field having acquired a mass proportional to the gauge coupling constant. The physical spectrum need not be identified with confined bound fermion-antifermion pairs, an interpretation which one is otherwise led to given whatever gauge fixing procedure but which is not void of gauge fixing artefacts.
