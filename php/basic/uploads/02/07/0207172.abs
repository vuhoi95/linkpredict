Title: Brane-induced decay of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum
Authors: K. G. Selivanov and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: The enhancement in the decay rate of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum due to the presence of a brane is studied, both in the test brane approximation and beyond it. Spontaneous brane materialization in the Kaluza-Klein vacuum is also described.
