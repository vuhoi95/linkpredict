Title: Quest for a Self-Tuning Brane-World Solution to the Cosmological  Constant Problem
Authors: James M. Cline and Hassan Firouzjahi
Abstract: It has been proposed that the geometry of an extra dimension could automatically adjust itself to compensate for an arbitrary energy density on the 3-D brane which we are presumed to inhabit, such that a static solution to Einstein's equation results. This would solve the long-standing cosmological constant problem, of why our universe is not overwhelmed by the enormous energy of the quantum vacuum fluctuations predicted by quantum field theory. I will review some of the attempts along these lines, and present a no-go theorem showing that these attempts are doomed, at least within one of the most promising classes of models.
