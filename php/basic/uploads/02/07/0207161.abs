Title: Non Abelian Magnetic Monopoles and Dynamics of Confinement
Authors: Stefano Bolognesi and Kenichi Konishi
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles having non-Abelian charges have been found recently to play a crucial role in the infrared in a class of supersymmetric gauge theories. We argue that these "dual quarks" can naturally be identified with the non-Abelian magnetic monopoles of the type first discussed by Goddard, Nuyts and Olive. Our argument is based on a few simple observations as regards to their charge structure, flavor quantum numbers, and some general properties of electromagnetic duality.
