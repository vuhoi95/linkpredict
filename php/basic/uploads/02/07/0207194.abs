Title: dS/CFT correspondence from the Brick Wall method
Authors: Kyung-Seok Cha and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We research the entropy of a black hole in curved space-times by 't Hooft`s approach, so-called the brick wall method. One of these space-time, a asymptotically dS space-time has two physical horizons; one is a black hole horizon and the other is a cosmological horizon. The others have only one horizon, a black hole horizon. Using this model, we calculate all thermodynamic quantities containing the background geometric effect and show that entropy is proportional to area of each boundary. Furthermore, we show that the Cardy-Verlinde formula can be rederived from the physical quantities of the brick wall method and this fact becomes a evidence of the dS/CFT correspondence.
