Title: Eight-Dimensional Topological Gravity and its Correspondence with  Supergravity
Authors: Laurent Baulieu and Marc Bellon and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: A topological theory for euclidean gravity in eight dimensions is built by enforcing octonionic self-duality conditions on the spin connection. The eight-dimensional manifold must be of a special type, with G_2 or Spin(7) holonomy. The resulting theory is related to a twisted version of N=1, D=8 supergravity. The situation is comparable to that of the topological Yang--Mills theory in eight dimensions, for which the SO(8) invariance is broken down to Spin(7), but is recovered after untwisting the topological theory.
