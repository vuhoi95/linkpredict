Title: Chern-Simons theory on the lattice
Authors: W. Bietenholz and J. Nishimura and P. Sodano
Abstract: We present new proposals for the representation of a Chern-Simons term on the lattice. In the first part, such a term is constructed from the fermion determinant, and in the second part directly from the Abelian gauge term. In both cases, the parity transformation is modified on the lattice without affecting its continuum limit.
