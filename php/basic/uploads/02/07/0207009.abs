Title: Kaluza-Klein States versus Winding States: Can Both Be Above the String  Scale?
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Arash Mafi
Abstract: When closed strings propagate in extra compactified dimensions, a rich spectrum of Kaluza-Klein states and winding states emerges. Since the masses of Kaluza-Klein states and winding states play a reciprocal role, it is often believed that either the lightest Kaluza-Klein states or the lightest winding states must be at or below the string scale. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conclusion is no longer true for compactifications with non-trivial shape moduli. Specifically, we demonstrate that toroidal compactifications exist for which all Kaluza-Klein states as well as all winding states are heavier than the string scale. This observation could have important phenomenological implications for theories with reduced string scales, suggesting that it is possible to cross the string scale without detecting any states associated with spacetime compactification.
