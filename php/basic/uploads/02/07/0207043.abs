Abstract: We have studied a modified Yang-Mills-Higgs system coupled to Einstein gravity. The modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action involves a direct coupling of the Higgs field to the scalar curvature. In this modified system we are able to write a Bogomol'nyi type condition in curved space and demonstrate that the positive static energy functional is bounded from below. We then investigate non-Abelian sperically symmetric static solutions in a similar fashion to the `t Hooft-Polyakov monopole. After reviewing previously studied monopole solutions of this type, we extend the formalism to included electric charge and we present dyon solutions.
