Title: Aging and fluctuation-dissipation ratio for the diluted Ising Model
Authors: Pasquale Calabrese and Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We consider the out-of-equilibrium, purely relaxational dynamics of a weakly diluted Ising model in the aging regime at criticality. We derive at first order in a $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ expansion the two-time response and correlation functions for vanishing momenta. The long-time limit of the critical fluctuation-dissipation ratio is computed at the same order in perturbation theory.
