Title: Gravity In A Model Of Multi Branes Alternated Between Minkowski And AdS  Spacetime In The Fifth Dimension
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Xinmin Zhang and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We construct in this paper a multi-brne model with Minkowski and AdS spacetime alternated in the fifth dimension and study the gravity on the brane of our universe. We will show that in this model there are both the graviton-like resonant states which generates the "quasi-localized gravity" and the resonant states of the massive KK mode. This model gives rise to gravity which deviates from the Newton gravitational potential at small and large scale which, however can be shown to be consistent with the observations in the absence of fine-tuning of the model parameters.
