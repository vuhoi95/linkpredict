Title: Confinement-Higgs transition in a disordered gauge theory and the  accuracy threshold for quantum memory
Authors: Chenyang Wang and Jim Harrington and John Preskill
Abstract: We study the +/- J random-plaquette Z_2 gauge model (RPGM) in three spatial dimensions, a three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional +/- J random-bond Ising model (RBIM). The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly chosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the ``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that terminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced symmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the temperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at rates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly from damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0}, the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding p_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding p_{c0}=.1031 +/-.0001. Our value of p_{c0} is incompatible with the value of p_c=.1093 +/-.0002 found in earlier numerical studies of the RBIM, in disagreement with the conjecture that the phase boundary of the RBIM is vertical (parallel to the T axis) below the Nishimori line.
