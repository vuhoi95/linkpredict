Title: Rolling Tachyon in Brane World Cosmology from Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Gary Shiu and S. -H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman
Abstract: The pressureless tachyonic matter recently found in superstring field theory has an over-abundance problem in cosmology. We argue that this problem is naturally solved in the brane inflationary scenario if almost all of the tachyon energy is drained (via its coupling to the inflaton and matter fields) to heating the universe, while the rest of the tachyon energy goes to a network of cosmic strings (lower-dimensional BPS D-branes) produced during the tachyon rolling at the end of inflation.
