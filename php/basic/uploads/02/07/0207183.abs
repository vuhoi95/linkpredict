Title: Stability of the non-extremal enhancon solution I: perturbation  equations
Authors: Apostolos Dimitriadis and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We consider the stability of the two branches of non-extremal enhancon solutions. We argue that one would expect a transition between the two branches at some value of the non-extremality, which should manifest itself in some instability. We study small perturbations of these solutions, constructing a sufficiently general ansatz for linearised perturbations of the non-extremal solutions, and show that the linearised equations are consistent. We show that the simplest kind of perturbation does not lead to any instability. We reduce the problem of studying the more general spherically symmetric perturbation to solving a set of three coupled second-order differential equations.
