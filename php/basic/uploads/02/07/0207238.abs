Title: The bosonic mother of fermionic D-branes
Authors: Auttakit Chattaraputi and Francois Englert and Laurent Houart and Anne Taormina
Abstract: We extend the search for fermionic subspaces of the bosonic string compactified on E8 X SO(16) lattices to include all fermionic D-branes. This extension constraints the truncation procedure previously proposed and relates the fermionic strings, supersymmetric or not, to the global structure of the SO(16) group. The specific properties of all the fermionic D-branes are found to be encoded in its universal covering, whose maximal toroid defines the configuration space torus of their mother bosonic theory.
