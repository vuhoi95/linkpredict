Title: Radius-dependent gauge unification in AdS5
Authors: Kiwoon Choi and Hyung Do Kim and Ian-Woo Kim
Abstract: We examine the relation of the 4-dimensional low energy coupling of bulk gauge boson in a slice of AdS5 to the 5-dimensional fundamental couplings as a function of the orbifold radius R. This allows us to address the gauge coupling unification in AdS5 by means of the radius running as well as the conventional momentum running. We then compute the radius dependence of 1-loop low energy couplings in generic AdS5 theory with 4-dimensional supersymmetry, and discuss the low energy predictions when the 5-dimensional couplings are assumed to be unified.
