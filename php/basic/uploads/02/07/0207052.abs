Title: Obstruction to D-brane topology change
Authors: Garnik G. Alexanian and A. P. Balachandran and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: A study of the relation between topology change, energy and Lie algebra representations for fuzzy geometry in connection to $M$-theory is presented. We encounter two different types of topology change, related to the different features of the Lie algebra representations appearing in the matrix models of $M$-theory. From these studies, we propose a new method of obtaining non-commutative solutions for the non-Abelian $D$-brane action found by Myers. This mechanism excludes one of the two topology changing processes previously found in other non-commutative solutions of many matrix-based models in $M$-theory i.e. in M(atrix) theory, Matrix string theory and non-Abelian $D$-brane physics.
