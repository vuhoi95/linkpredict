Title: Quantum power correction to the Newton law
Authors: I. B. Khriplovich and G. G. Kirilin
Abstract: We have found the graviton contribution to the one-loop quantum correction to the Newton law. This correction results in interaction decreasing with distance as 1/r^3 and is dominated numerically by the graviton contribution. The previous calculations of this contribution to the discussed effect are demonstrated to be incorrect.
