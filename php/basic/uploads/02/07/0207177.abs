Title: New Developments in the Eight Vertex Model
Authors: Klaus Fabricius and Barry M. McCoy
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Q matrix introduced in Baxter's 1972 solution of the eight vertex model has some eigenvectors which are not eigenvectors of the spin reflection operator and conjecture a new functional equation for Q(v) which both contains the Bethe equation that gives the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and computes the degeneracies of these eigenvalues.
