Title: Fermion mixing in quasi-free states
Authors: K. C. Hannabuss and D. C. Latimer
Abstract: Quantum field theoretic treatments of fermion oscillations are typically restricted to calculations in Fock space. In this letter we extend the oscillation formulae to include more general quasi-free states, and also consider the case when the mixing is not unitary.
