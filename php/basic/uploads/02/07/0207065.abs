Title: Does curvature-dilaton coupling with Kalb Ramond field lead to an  accelerating Universe ?
Authors: Soumitra SenGupta and Saurabh Sur
Abstract: In this work we show that the Universe evolving in a spacetime with torsion (originated from a second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field) and dilaton is free from any big bang singularity and can have acceleration during the evolution. Both the matter and radiation dominated era have been considered and the role of the dilaton to explain the decelerating phase in the earlier epoch has also been discussed.
