Title: Time-dependent cosmological constant in the Jackiw-Teitelboim cosmology
Authors: M. Alves and J. Barcelos-Neto and M. Novello and J. M. Salim
Abstract: We study the obtainment of a time-dependent cosmological constant at D=2 in a model based on the Jackiw-Teitelboim cosmology. We show that the cosmological term goes to zero asymptotically and can induce a nonsingular behavior at the origin.
