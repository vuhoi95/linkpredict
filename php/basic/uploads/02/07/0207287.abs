Abstract: We present the perturbative and non-perturbative QCD structure of the dipole-dipole scattering amplitude in momentum space. The perturbative contribution is described by two-gluon exchange and the non-perturbative contribution by the stochastic vacuum model which leads to confinement of the quark and antiquark in the dipole via a string of color fields. This QCD string gives important non-perturbative contributions to high-energy reactions. A new structure different from the perturbative dipole factors is found in the string-string scattering amplitude. The string can be represented as an integral over stringless dipoles with a given dipole number density. This decomposition of the QCD string into dipoles allows us to calculate the unintegrated gluon distribution of hadrons and photons from the dipole-hadron and dipole-photon cross section via kT-factorization.
