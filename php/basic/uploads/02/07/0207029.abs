Abstract: The low energy effective theory for the Randall-Sundrum two brane system is investigated with an emphasis on the role of the non-linear radion in the brane world. The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energy expansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce the effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown that the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor theory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the positive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative tension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on the positive and negative tension branes, respectively. In contrast to the usual scalar-tensor gravity, the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity couples with two kinds of matter, namely, the matters on both positive and negative tension branes, with different effective gravitational coupling constants. In particular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples with the sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes. In the course of the derivation, it has been revealed that the radion plays an essential role to convert the non-local Einstein gravity with the generalized dark radiation to the local quasi-scalar-tensor gravity. For completeness, we also derive the effective action for our theory by substituting the bulk solution into the original action. It is also shown that the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity works as holograms at the low energy in the sense that the bulk geometry can be reconstructed from the solution of the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity.
