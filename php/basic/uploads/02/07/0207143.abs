Title: Assisted Tachyonic Inflation
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Rong-Gen Cai and Xinmin Zhang and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: The model of inflation with a single tachyon field generates larger anisotropy and has difficulties in describing the formation of the Universe . In this paper we consider a model with multi tachyon fields and study the assisted inflationary solution. Our results show that this model satisfies the observation.
