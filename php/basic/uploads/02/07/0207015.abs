Abstract: Recently the construction of the non-abelian effective D-brane action was performed through order $\alpha'{}^3$ including the terms quadratic in the gauginos. This result can be tested by calculating the spectrum in the presence of constant magnetic background fields and comparing it to the string theoretic predictions. This test was already performed for the purely bosonic terms. In this note we extend the test to the fermionic terms. We obtain perfect agreement.
