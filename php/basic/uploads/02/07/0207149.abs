Title: Noncommutative Planar Particle Dynamics with Gauge Interactions
Authors: J. Lukierski and P. C. Stichel and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We consider two ways of introducing minimal Abelian gauge interactions into the model presented in [1]. They are different only if the second central charge of the planar Galilei group is nonzero. One way leads to standard gauge transformations and second to a generalized gauge theory with gauge transformations accompanied by time-dependent area-preserving coordinate transformations. Both approaches, however, are related to each other by a classical Seiberg-Witten map supplemented by the noncanonical transformation of the phase space variables for planar particles. We also formulate the two-body problem in the model with a generalized gauge symmetry and consider the case with both CS and background electromagnetic fields, as it is used in the description of fractional quantum Hall effect.
