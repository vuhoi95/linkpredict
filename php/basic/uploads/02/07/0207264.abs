Title: Deformed Matrix Theories with N=8 and Fivebranes in the PP Wave  Background
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Kimyeong M. Lee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: M(atrix) theory is known to be mass-deformed in the pp-wave background and still retains all 16 dynamical supersymmetries. We consider generalization of such deformations on super Yang-Mills quantum mechanics (SYQM) with less supersymmetry. In particular this includes N=8 U(N) SYQM with a single adjoint and any number of fundamental hypermultiplets, which is a pp-wave deformation of DLCQ matrix theory of fivebranes. With k >= 1 fivebranes, we show that a rich vacuum structure exists, with many continuous family of solutions that preserve all dynamical supersymmetries. The vacuum moduli space contains copies of CP^{k-1} of various sizes.
