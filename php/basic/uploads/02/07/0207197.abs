Title: Supersymmetric action of multiple D0-branes from Matrix theory
Authors: Masako Asano and Yasuhiro Sekino
Abstract: We study one-loop effective action of Berkooz-Douglas Matrix theory and obtain non-abelian action of D0-branes in the longitudinal 5-brane background. In this paper, we extend the analysis of hep-th/0201248 and calculate the part of the effective action containing fermions. We show that the effective action is manifestly invariant under the loop-corrected SUSY transformation, and give the explicit transformation laws. The effective action consists of blocks which are closed under the SUSY, and includes the supersymmetric completion of the couplings to the longitudinal 5-branes proposed by Taylor and Van Raamsdonk as a subset.
