Title: Quantum radiation pressure on a moving mirror at finite temperature
Authors: L. A. S. Machado and P. A. Maia Neto and C. Farina
Abstract: We compute the radiation pressure force on a moving mirror, in the nonrelativistic approximation, assuming the field to be at temperature $T.$ At high temperature, the force has a dissipative component proportional to the mirror velocity, which results from Doppler shift of the reflected thermal photons. In the case of a scalar field, the force has also a dispersive component associated to a mass correction. In the electromagnetic case, the separate contributions to the mass correction from the two polarizations cancel. We also derive explicit results in the low temperature regime, and present numerical results for the general case. As an application, we compute the dissipation and decoherence rates for a mirror in a harmonic potential well.
