Title: N=1 Super Yang-Mills from Supergravity: The UV-IR Connection
Authors: Poul Olesen and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We consider the Maldacena-Nunez supergravity solution corresponding to N=1 super Yang-Mills within the approach by Di Vecchia, Lerda and Merlatti. We show that if one uses the radial distance as a field theory scale, the corresponding beta function has an infrared fixed point. Assuming this to be a physical property for all four dimensional non-singular renormalization schemes, we use the relation between the gaugino condensate and its dual to investigate the connection between the IR and UV behaviors. Imposing the ``field theory boundary condition'' that the first two terms in the perturbative UV beta function are universal, the fixed point is found to be of first order, and the slope of the IR beta function is also fixed.
