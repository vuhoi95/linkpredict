Abstract: We find non-BPS solutions of the noncommutative CP^1 model in 2+1 dimensions. These solutions correspond to soliton anti-soliton configurations. We show that the one-soliton one-anti-soliton solution is unstable when the distance between the soliton and the anti-soliton is small. We also construct time-dependent solutions and other types of solutions.
