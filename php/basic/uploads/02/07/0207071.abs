Title: QCD/String holographic mapping and high energy scattering amplitudes
Authors: H. Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Abstract: We find a one to one mapping between low energy string dilaton states in AdS bulk and high energy glueball states on the corresponding boundary. This holographic mapping leads to a relation between bulk and boundary scattering amplitudes. From this relation and the dilaton action we find the appropriate momentum scaling for high energy QCD amplitudes at fixed angles.
