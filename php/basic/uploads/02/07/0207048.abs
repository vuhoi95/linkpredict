Title: Remarks on time-energy uncertainty relations
Authors: Romeo Brunetti and Klaus Fredenhagen
Abstract: Using a recent construction of observables characterizing the time of occurence of an effect in quantum theory, we present a rigorous derivation of the standard time-energy uncertainty relation. In addition, we prove an uncertainty relation for time measurements only.
