Title: The Centauro events as a result of induced pions emission
Authors: V. A. Karmanov and A. E. Kudryavtsev
Abstract: It is shown that only in the case of n pion production amplitude (at n > 10), which is symmetric enough relative to the momenta permutations, there is appreciable probability of events with nothing but charged or nothing but neutral pions. Significant enhancement of the probability of these events in comparison with that follows from Poisson distribution is caused by induced pions emission, in complete analogy with the phenomenon of the induced photon emission in QED.
