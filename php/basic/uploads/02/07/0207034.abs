Title: On the Spectrum of PP-Wave Matrix Theory
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Jan Plefka
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the recently proposed matrix model of DLCQ M-theory in a parallel plane (pp)-wave background. In contrast to matrix theory in a flat background this model contains mass terms, which lift the flat directions of the potential and renders its spectrum discrete. The supersymmetry algebra of the model groups the energy eigenstates into supermultiplets, whose members differ by fixed amounts of energy in great similarity to the representation of supersymmetry in AdS spaces. There is a unique and exact zero-energy groundstate along with a multitude of long and short multiplets of excited states. For large masses the quantum mechanical model may be treated perturbatively and we study the leading order energy shifts of the first excited states up to level two. Most interestingly we uncover a protected short multiplet at level two, whose energies do not receive perturbative corrections. Moreover, we conjecture the existence of an infinite series of similar protected multiplets in the pp-wave matrix model.
