Title: Does a relativistic metric generalization of Newtonian gravity exist in  2+1 dimensions?
Authors: J. L. Alonso and J. L. Cortes and V. Laliena
Abstract: It is shown that, contrary to previous claims, a scalar tensor theory of Brans-Dicke type provides a relativistic generalization of Newtonian gravity in 2+1 dimensions. The theory is metric and test particles follow the space-time geodesics. The static isotropic solution is studied in vacuum and in regions filled with an incompressible perfect fluid. It is shown that the solutions can be consistently matched at the matter vacuum interface, and that the Newtonian behavior is recovered in the weak field regime.
