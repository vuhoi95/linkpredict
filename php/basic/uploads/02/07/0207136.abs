Title: Supersymmetric Defect Expansion in CFT from AdS Supertubes
Authors: David Mateos and Selena Ng and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The AdS/dCFT correspondence is used to show that a planar q-dimensional superconformal CFT defect expands, under the addition of electric charge and angular momentum, to a supersymmetric higher-dimensional defect of geometry R^q x C, where C is an arbitrary curve. The dual string theory process is the expansion of D-branes and fundamental strings into a supertube in an AdS background.
