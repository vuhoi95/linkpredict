Title: On Time-dependent Backgrounds in Supergravity and String Theory
Authors: Alex Buchel and Peter Langfelder and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: Time-dependent solutions of supergravity and string theory are studied. The examples are obtained from de Sitter deformation of gauge/gravity dualities, analytical continuation of static solutions, and ``exactly solvable'' worldsheet models. Among other things, it is shown that turning on a Hubble parameter in the background of a confining gauge theory in four dimensions can restore chiral symmetry. Some of the solutions obtained from analytical continuation have the interpretation of a universe with a bounce separating a big bang from a big crunch singularity. In the worldsheet context, it is argued why string propagation close to a Milne-type cosmological singularity might be physically non-singular.
