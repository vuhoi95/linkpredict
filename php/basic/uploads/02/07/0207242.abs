Title: The Moyal Momentum Algebra
Authors: A. Boulahoual and M. B. Sedra
Abstract: We introduce in this short note some aspects of the Moyal momentum algebra that we call the Das-Popowicz Mm algebra. Our interest on this algebra is motivated by the central role that it can play in the formulation of integrable models and in higher conformal spin theories.
