Title: Noncommutative Scalar Field Coupled to Gravity
Authors: O. Bertolami and L. Guisado
Abstract: A model for a noncommutative scalar field coupled to gravity is proposed via an extension of the Moyal product. It is shown that there are solutions compatible with homogeneity and isotropy to first non-trivial order in the perturbation of the star-product, with the gravity sector described by a flat Robertson-Walker metric. We show that in the slow-roll regime of a typical chaotic inflationary scenario, noncommutativity has negligible impact.
