Abstract: We discuss a new family of metrics of 7-manifolds with G_2 holonomy, which are R^3 bundles over a quaternionic space. The metrics depend on five parameters and have two Abelian isometries. Certain singularities of the G_2 manifolds are related to fixed points of these isometries; there are two combinations of Killing vectors that possess co-dimension four fixed points which yield upon compactification only intersecting D6-branes if one also identifies two parameters. Two of the remaining parameters are quantized and we argue that they are related to the number of D6-branes, which appear in three stacks. We perform explicitly the reduction to the type IIA model.
