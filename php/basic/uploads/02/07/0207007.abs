Title: Numerical study for the c-dependence of fractal dimension in  two-dimensional quantum gravity
Authors: Noboru Kawamoto and Kenji Yotsuji
Abstract: We numerically investigate the fractal structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter central charge c for $-2 \leq c \leq 1$. We reformulate Q-state Potts model into the model which can be identified as a weighted percolation cluster model and can make continuous change of Q, which relates c, on the dynamically triangulated lattice. The c-dependence of the critical coupling is measured from the percolation probability and susceptibility. The c-dependence of the string susceptibility of the quantum surface is evaluated and has very good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The c-dependence of the fractal dimension based on the finite size scaling hypothesis is measured and has excellent agreement with one of the theoretical predictions previously proposed except for the region near $c\approx 1$.
