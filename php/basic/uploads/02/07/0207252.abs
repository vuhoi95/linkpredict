Title: Supersymmetries and Hopf-duality in the Penrose Limit of AdS_3 times S^3  times T^4
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Taejin Lee and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of the plane wave geometries obtained from D1/D5-brane system. We study the effect of Hopf-duality on the supersymmetries preserved by the Penrose limit of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ geometry. In type-IIB case, we first show that the Penrose limit makes the size of the `would-be' internal torus comparable to that of the other directions. Based on this observation, we consider, in taking the Penrose limit, the generalization of the null geodesic to incorporate the tilted direction between the equator of $S^3$ and one of the torus directions. For generic values of the tilting angle, supersymmetries are not preserved. When the limit is taken along the torus direction, 16 supersymmetries are preserved. For the ordinary Penrose limit, 16 generic and 8 `supernumerary' supersymmetries are observed. In the Penrose limit of Hopf-dualized type-IIA geometry, only 4 supersymmetries are preserved. We classify all the Killing spinors according to their periodic properties along some relevant coordinates.
