Title: Some Noncommutative Multi-instantons from Vortices in Curved Space
Authors: D. H. Correa and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We construct U(2) noncommutative multi-instanton solutions by extending Witten's ansatz [1] which reduces the problem of cylindrical symmetry in four dimensions to that of a set of Bogomol'nyi equations for an Abelian Higgsmodel in two dimensional curved space. Using the Fock space approach, we give explicit vortex solutions to the Bogomol'nyi equations and, from them, we present multi-instanton solutions.
