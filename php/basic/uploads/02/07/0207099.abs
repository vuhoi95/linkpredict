Title: Spectrum of boundary states in N=1 SUSY sine-Gordon theory
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs
Abstract: We consider N=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory (SSG) with supersymmetric integrable boundary conditions (boundary SSG = BSSG). We find two possible ways to close the boundary bootstrap for this model, corresponding to two different choices for the boundary supercharge. We argue that these two bootstrap solutions should correspond to the two integrable Lagrangian boundary theories considered recently by Nepomechie.
