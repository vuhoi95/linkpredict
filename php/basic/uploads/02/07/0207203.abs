Title: Using the Chern-Simons Action for a Self-Consistent Determination of the  Magnetic Screening Mass in Thermal QCD
Authors: G. M. von Hippel and R. R. Horgan
Abstract: We present a self-consistent determination of the screening mass for chromomagnetic fields in QCD within the framework of dimensional reduction. The three-dimensional Chern-Simons density is used as a mass term for a self-consistent perturbative calculation that yields a value of m ~ 1.604 g^2 N/2pi for the magnetic screening mass.
