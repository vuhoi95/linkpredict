Title: On Continuous Moyal Product Structure in String Field Theory
Authors: D. M. Belov and A. K. Konechny
Abstract: We consider a diagonalization of Witten's star product for a ghost system of arbitrary background charge and Grassmann parity. To this end we use a bosonized formulation of such systems and a spectral analysis of Neumann matrices. We further identify a continuous Moyal product structure for a combined ghosts+matter system. The normalization of multiplication kernel is discussed.
