Title: On the Behaviour and Stability of Superconducting Currents
Authors: Y. Lemperiere and E. P. S. Shellard
Abstract: We present analytic and numerical results for the evolution of currents on superconducting strings in the classical $U(1) \times U(1)$ model. We derive an energy functional for the currents and charges on these strings, establishing rigorously that minima should exist in this model for loops of finite size (vortons) if both charge and current are present on the worldsheet. We then study the stability of the currents on these strings, and we find an analytic criterion for the onset of instability (in the neutral limit). This limit specifies a lower maximal current than previous heuristic estimates. We conclude with a discussion of the evolution of loops towards their final vorton state in the model under consideration.
