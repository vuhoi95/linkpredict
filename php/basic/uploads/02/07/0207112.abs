Title: Comment on "Supersymmetry in the half-oscillator - revisited"
Authors: Ashok Das and S. Pernice
Abstract: We point out the flaw in the analysis of Gangopadhyaya and Mallow, hep-th/0206133, where it is claimed that supersymmetry is broken in the SUSY half-oscillator, even with a regularization respecting supersymmetry.
