Title: Low Energy Gauge Unification Theory
Authors: Tianjun Li and Wei Liao
Abstract: Because of the problems arising from the fermion unification in the traditional Grand Unified Theory and the mass hierarchy between the 4-dimensional Planck scale and weak scale, we suggest the low energy gauge unification theory with low high-dimensional Planck scale. We discuss the non-supersymmetric SU(5) model on $M^4\times S^1/Z_2 \times S^1/Z_2$ and the supersymmetric SU(5) model on $M^4\times S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2') \times S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2')$. The SU(5) gauge symmetry is broken by the orbifold projection for the zero modes, and the gauge unification is accelerated due to the SU(5) asymmetric light KK states. In our models, we forbid the proton decay, still keep the charge quantization, and automatically solve the fermion mass problem. We also comment on the anomaly cancellation and other possible scenarios for low energy gauge unification.
