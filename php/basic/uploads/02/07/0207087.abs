Title: Exact Solutions of Kemmer Equation for Coulomb Potential
Authors: S. Gonen and A. Havare and N. Unal
Abstract: This article illustrates the bound states of Kemmer equation for spin-1 particles. The asymptotic, exact and Coulomb field solutions are obtained by using action principle. In the conclusion the energy spectrum of spin-1 particles moving in a Coulomb potential compared with the energy spectrum of spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles.
