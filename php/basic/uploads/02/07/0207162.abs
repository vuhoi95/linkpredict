Title: Intersecting Branes in M-Theory and Chiral Matter in Four Dimensions
Authors: Charles F. Doran and Michael Faux
Abstract: We explicitly derive a complementary pair of four-dimensional M-theory brane-world models, linked by a five-dimensional bulk, each of which has a unique anomaly-free chiral spectrum. This is done via resolution of local consistency requirements, in the context of the simplest global quotient T7/G with ten-dimensional fixed-planes, for which a chiral four-dimensional spectrum could arise.
