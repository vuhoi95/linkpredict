Title: Relativistic invariant Lie algebras for kinematical observables in  quantum space-time
Authors: V. V. Khruschev and A. N. Leznov
Abstract: A deformation of the canonical algebra for kinematical observables of the quantum field theory in Minkowski space-time has been considered under the condition of Lorentz invariance. A relativistic invariant algebra obtained depends on additional fundamental constants M, L and H with the dimensions of mass, length and action, respectively. In some limiting cases the algebra goes over into the well-known Snyder or Yang algebras. In general case the algebra represents a class of Lie algebras, that consists of simple algebras and semidirect sums of simple algebras and integrable ones. Some algebras belonging to this class are noninvariant under T and C transformations. Possible applications of obtained algebras for descriptions of states of matter under extreme conditions are briefly discussed.
