Title: kappa-Deformed Kinematics and Addition Law for Deformed Velocities
Authors: Jerzy Lukierski and Anatol Nowicki
Abstract: In kappa-deformed relativistic framework we consider three different definitions of kappa-deformed velocities and introduce corresponding addition laws. We show that one of the velocities has classical relativistic addition law. The relation of velocity formulae with the coproduct for fourmomenta and noncommutative space-time structure is exhibited.
