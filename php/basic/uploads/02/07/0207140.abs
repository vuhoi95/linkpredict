Title: Brane collisions and braneworld cosmology
Authors: Uchida Gen and Akihiro Ishibashi and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a new braneworld model [GIT] in which the collision of a brane universe and a vacuum bubble coming from the extra-dimension is utilized as a trigger of brane big-bang. In this article, mainly reviewing this model, we briefly summarize cosmological braneworld scenarios in which collision of branes plays an important role.
