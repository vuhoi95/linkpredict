Title: Extra Dimensions and Nonlinear Equations
Authors: Thomas Curtright and David Fairlie
Abstract: Solutions of nonlinear multi-component Euler-Monge partial differential equations are constructed in n spatial dimensions by dimension-doubling, a method that completely linearizes the problem. Nonlocal structures are an essential feature of the method. The Euler-Monge equations may be interpreted as a boundary theory arising from a linearized bulk system such that all boundary solutions follow from simple limits of those for the bulk.
