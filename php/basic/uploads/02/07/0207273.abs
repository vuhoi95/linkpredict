Title: The Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Algebras of Logarithmic Superconformal  Field Theory
Authors: N. E. Mavromatos and R. J. Szabo
Abstract: We describe the general features of the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors of logarithmic conformal field theories with N=1 supersymmetry. Three particular systems are examined in some detail -- D-brane recoil, a superconformal extension of the c=-2 model, and the supersymmetric SU(2)_2 WZW model.
