Title: Casimir force between surfaces close to each other
Authors: H. Ahmedov and I. H. Duru
Abstract: Casimir interactions (due to the massless scalar field fluctuations) of two surfaces which are close to each other are studied. After a brief general presentation, explicit calculations for co-axial cylinders, co-centric spheres and co-axial cones are performed.
