Title: Accelerated Born-Infeld Metrics in Kerr-Schild Geometry
Authors: Metin Gurses and Ozgur Sarioglu
Abstract: We consider Einstein Born-Infeld theory with a null fluid in Kerr-Schild Geometry. We find accelerated charge solutions of this theory. Our solutions reduce to the Plebanski solution when the acceleration vanishes and to the Bonnor-Vaidya solution as the Born-Infeld parameter b goes to infinity. We also give the explicit form of the energy flux formula due to the acceleration of the charged sources.
