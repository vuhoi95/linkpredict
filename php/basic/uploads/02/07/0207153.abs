Title: A manifestly gauge invariant exact renormalization group
Authors: Stefano Arnone and Antonio Gatti and Tim R. Morris
Abstract: A manifestly gauge invariant exact renormalization group for pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is proposed, allowing gauge invariant calculations, without any gauge fixing or ghosts. The necessary gauge invariant regularisation which implements the effective cutoff, is naturally incorporated by embedding the theory into a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) super-gauge theory. This guarantees finiteness to all orders in perturbation theory.
