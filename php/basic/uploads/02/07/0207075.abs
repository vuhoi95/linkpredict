Title: Explicitly covariant light-front dynamics and some its applications
Authors: V. A. Karmanov and J. Carbonell
Abstract: The light-front dynamics is an efficient approach to study of field theory and of relativistic composite systems (nuclei at relativistic relative nucleon momenta, hadrons in the quark models). The explicitly covariant version of this approach is briefly reviewed and illustrated by some applications.
