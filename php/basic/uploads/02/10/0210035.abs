Title: Nonlocal Effects on D-branes in Plane-Wave Backgrounds
Authors: Ori J. Ganor and Uday Varadarajan
Abstract: We argue that the effective field theory on D3-branes in a plane-wave background with 3-form flux is a nonlocal deformation of Yang-Mills theory. In the case of NSNS flux, it is a dipole field theory with lightlike dipole vectors. For an RR 3-form flux the dipole theory is strongly coupled. We propose a weakly coupled S-dual description for it. The S-dual description is local at any finite order in string perturbation theory but becomes nonlocal when all perturbation theory orders are summed together.
