Title: The Static Gauge Potential with a Cutoff
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Juan Jose Manjarin
Abstract: The static potential, corresponding to the interaction of two heavy sources is computed for $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang Mills in the strong 't Hooft coupling regime by using the AdS/CFT conjecture and performing a computation of a rectangular Wilson loop at a finite distance of the boundary.
