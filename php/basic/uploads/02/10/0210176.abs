Title: Static spherisymmetric solutions, gravitational lensing and perihelion  precession in Einstein--Kalb--Ramond theory
Authors: Sayan Kar and Soumitra SenGupta and Saurabh Sur
Abstract: Static, spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein--Kalb--Ramond (KR) field equations are obtained. Besides an earlier known exact solution, we also find an approximate, asymptotically flat solution for which the metric coefficients are obtained as an infinte series in $\frac{1}{r}$. Subsequently, we study gravitational lensing and perihelion precession in these spacetimes and obtain explicit formulae which include corrections to these effects in the presence of the KR field.
