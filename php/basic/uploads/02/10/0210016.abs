Title: Limits on the Detectability of Cosmic Topology in Hyperbolic Universes
Authors: G. I. Gomero and M. J. Reboucas and R. Tavakol
Abstract: We reexamine the possibility of the detection of the cosmic topology in nearly flat hyperbolic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes by using patterns repetition. We update and extend our recent results in two important ways: by employing recent observational constraints on the cosmological density parameters as well as the recent mathematical results concerning small hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This produces new bounds with consequences for the detectability of the cosmic topology. In addition to obtaining new bounds, we also give a concrete example of the sensitive dependence of detectability of cosmic topology on the uncertainties in the observational values of the density parameters.
