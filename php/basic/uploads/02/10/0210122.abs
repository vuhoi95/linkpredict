Title: Circular Semiclassical String solutions on Confining AdS/CFT Backgrounds
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Amir E. Mosaffa
Abstract: We study multiwrapped circular string pulsating in the radial direction of AdS black hole. We compute the energy of this string as a function of a large quantum number n. One then could associate it with energy and a quantum number of states in the dual finite temperature {\cal N}=4 SYM theory as well as three dimensional pure gauge theory. We observe that the n dependence of the energy has a universal form. We have also considered pulsating string in the background of the near-extremal D4-brane solution. Circular pulsating membrane in M-theory on AdS_7\times S^4 has also been studied.
