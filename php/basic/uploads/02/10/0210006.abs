Title: Black Holes on the Brane with Induced Gravity
Authors: G. Kofinas and E. Papantonopoulos and V. Zamarias
Abstract: An analysis of a spherically symmetric braneworld configuration is performed when the intrinsic curvature scalar is included in the bulk action. In the case when the electric part of the Weyl tensor is zero, all the exterior solutions are found; one of them is of the Schwarzschild-(A)dS(4) form, which is matched to a modified Oppenheimer-Volkoff interior solution. In the case when the electric part of the Weyl tensor is non zero, the exterior Schwarzschild-(A)dS(4) black hole solution is modified receiving corrections from the non-local bulk effects. A non-universal gravitational constant arises, depending on the density of the considered object and the Newton's law is modified for small and large distances; however, the conventional limits are easily obtained.
