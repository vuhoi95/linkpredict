Title: Anti-deSitter gravitational collapse
Authors: V. Husain and G. Kunstatter and B. Preston and M. Birukou
Abstract: We describe a formalism for studying spherically symmetric collapse of the massless scalar field in any spacetime dimension, and for any value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The formalism is used for numerical simulations of gravitational collapse in four spacetime dimensions with negative $\Lambda$. We observe critical behaviour at the onset of black hole formation, and find that the critical exponent is independent of $\Lambda$.
