Title: Four classes of modified relativistic symmetry transformations
Authors: J. Lukierski and A. Nowicki
Abstract: We discuss the nonlinear transformations of standard Poincar\'{e} symmetry in the context of recently introduced Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theories. We introduce four classes of modified relativistic theories with three of them describing various DSR frameworks. We consider four examples of modified relativistic symmetries, which illustrate each of the considered class.
