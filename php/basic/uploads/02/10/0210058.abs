Title: The Reconstruction of Supersymmetric Theories at High Energy Scales
Authors: G. A. Blair and W. Porod and P. M. Zerwas
Abstract: The reconstruction of fundamental parameters in supersymmetric theories requires the evolution to high scales, where the characteristic regularities in mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking become manifest. We have studied a set of representative examples in this context: minimal supergravity and a left--right symmetric extension; gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking; and superstring effective field theories. Through the evolution of the parameters from the electroweak scale the regularities in different scenarios at the high scales can be unravelled if precision analyses of the supersymmetric particle sector at e+ e- linear colliders are combined with analyses at the LHC.
