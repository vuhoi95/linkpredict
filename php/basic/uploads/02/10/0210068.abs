Title: A Stable Supergravity Dual of Non-supersymmetric Glue
Authors: James Babington and David E. Crooks and Nick Evans
Abstract: We study non-supersymmetric fermion mass and condensate deformations of the AdS/CFT Correspondence. The 5 dimensional supergravity flows are lifted to a complete and remarkably simple 10 dimensional background. A brane probe analysis shows that when all the fermions have an equal mass a positive mass is generated for all six scalar fields leaving non-supersymmetric Yang Mills theory in the deep infra-red. We numerically determine the potential, produced by the background, in the Schroedinger equation relevant to the study of O^++ glueballs. The potential is a bounded well, providing evidence of stability and for a discrete, confined spectrum. The geometry can also describe the supergravity background around an (unstable) fuzzy 5-brane.
