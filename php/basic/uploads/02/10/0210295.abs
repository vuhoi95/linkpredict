Title: Structure of Multi-Meron Knot Action
Authors: L. S. Isaev and A. P. Protogenov
Abstract: We consider the structure of multi-meron knot action in the Yang-Mills theory and in the CP^1 Ginzburg-Landau model. Self-dual equations have been obtained without identifying orientations in the space-time and in the color space. The dependence of the energy bounds on topological parameters of coherent states in planar systems is also discussed. In particular, it is shown that a characteristic size of a knot in the Faddeev-Niemi model is determined by the Hopf invariant.
