Title: Aspects of Duality in Nodal Liquids
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos and Sarben Sarkar
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic t-J like model and a SU(2) spin-charge separation ansatz, a relativistic continuum gauge lagrangian is obtained in the vicinity of a nodal point of the Fermi surface. The excitations in the pseudogap phase are described by topological excitations in the dual model which has a Z_2 global symmetry due to the effect of instantons. Confinement of spinon and holons emerge from this picture. The adjoint and fundamental strings are associated with stripes. As the spin gap decreases a local Z_2 symmetry emerges.
