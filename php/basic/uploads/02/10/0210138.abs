Title: Finite Temperature Induced Fermion Number for Quarks in a Chiral Field
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Kumar Rao
Abstract: We compute the finite temperature correction to the induced fermion number for fermions coupled to a static SU(2) chiral background, using the derivative expansion technique. At zero temperature the induced fermion number is topological, being the winding number of the chiral background. At finite temperature however, higher order terms in the derivative expansion give nontopological corrections to the winding number. We use this result to show that the standard cancellation of the fractional parts of the fermion number inside and outside the bag in an SU(2) x SU(2) hybrid chiral bag model of the nucleon does not occur at nonzero temperature.
