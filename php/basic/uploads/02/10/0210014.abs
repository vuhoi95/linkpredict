Title: Orientation matters for NIMreps
Authors: N. Sousa and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: The problem of finding boundary states in CFT, often rephrased in terms of "NIMreps" of the fusion algebra, has a natural extension to CFT on non-orientable surfaces. This provides extra information that turns out to be quite useful to give the proper interpretation to a NIMrep. We illustrate this with several examples. This includes a rather detailed discussion of the interesting case of the simple current extension of A_2 level 9, which is already known to have a rich structure. This structure can be disentangled completely using orientation information. In particular we find here and in other cases examples of diagonal modular invariants that do not admit a NIMrep, suggesting that there does not exist a corresponding CFT. We obtain the complete set of NIMreps (plus Moebius and Klein bottle coefficients) for many exceptional modular invariants of WZW models, and find an explanation for the occurrence of more than one NIMrep in certain cases. We also (re)consider the underlying formalism, emphasizing the distinction between oriented and unoriented string annulus amplitudes, and the origin of orientation-dependent degeneracy matrices in the latter.
