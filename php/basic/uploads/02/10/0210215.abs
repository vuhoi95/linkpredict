Title: Topologizations of Chiral Representations
Authors: Florian Conrady and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: We analyze and compare two families of topologies that have been proposed for representation spaces of chiral algebras by Huang and Gaberdiel & Goddard respectively. We show, in particular, that for suitable pairs the topology of Gaberdiel & Goddard is coarser. We also give a new proof that the chiral two-point blocks are continuous in the topology of Huang.
