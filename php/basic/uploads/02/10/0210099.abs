Abstract: Charged scalar field is quantized in the background of a static d-2 - brane which is a core of the magnetic flux lines in flat d+1 - dimensional space-time. We find that vector potential of the magnetic core induces the energy-momentum tensor in the vacuum. The tensor components are periodic functions of the brane flux and holomorphic functions of space dimension. The dependence on the distance from the brane and on the coupling to the space-time curvature scalar is comprehensively analysed.
