Title: Noncommutative Topological Theories of Gravity
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez and M. Sabido
Abstract: The possibility of noncommutative topological gravity arising in the same manner as Yang-Mills theory is explored. We use the Seiberg-Witten map to construct such a theory based on a SL(2,C) complex connection, from which the Euler characteristic and the signature invariant are obtained. This gives us a way towards the description of noncommutative gravitational instantons as well as noncommutative local gravitational anomalies.
