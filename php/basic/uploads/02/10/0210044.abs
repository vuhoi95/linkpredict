Title: Les Houches lectures on supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: D. S. Berman and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We introduce simple and more advanced concepts that have played a key role in the development of supersymmetric systems. This is done by first describing various supersymmetric quantum mechanics models. Topics covered include the basic construction of supersymmetric field theories, the phase structure of supersymmetric systems with and without gauge particles, superconformal theories and infrared duality in both field theory and string theory. A discussion of the relation of conformal symmetry to a vanishing vacuum energy (cosmological constant) is included.
