Title: About maximally localized states in quantum mechanics
Authors: S. Detournay and Cl. Gabriel and Ph. Spindel
Abstract: We analyze the emergence of a minimal length for a large class of generalized commutation relations, preserving commutation of the position operators and translation invariance as well as rotation invariance (in dimension higher than one). We show that the construction of the maximally localized states based on squeezed states generally fails. Rather, one must resort to a constrained variational principle.
