Title: Global Charges of Stationary Non-Abelian Black Holes
Authors: B. Kleihaus and J. Kunz and F. Navarro-Lerida
Abstract: We consider stationary axially symmetric black holes in SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. We present a mass formula for these stationary non-Abelian black holes, which also holds for Abelian black holes. The presence of the dilaton field allows for rotating black holes, which possess non-trivial electric and magnetic gauge fields, but don't carry a non-Abelian charge.
