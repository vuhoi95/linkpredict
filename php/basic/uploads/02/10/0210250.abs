Title: Born-Again Braneworld
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Misao Sasaki and Jiro Soda
Abstract: We propose a cosmological braneworld scenario in which two branes collide and emerge as reborn branes whose tensions have signs opposite to the original tensions of the respective branes. In this scenario, gravity on each of the branes is described by a scalar-tensor-type theory in which the radion plays the role of the gravitational scalar, and the branes are assumed to be inflating. However, the whole dynamics is different from those of the usual inflation, due to the non-trivial dynamics of the radion field. Transforming the conformal frame to the Einstein frame, this born-again scenario resembles the pre-big-bang scenario. Thus, our scenario has features of both inflation and pre-big-bang scenarios. In particular, gravitational waves produced from vacuum fluctuations may have a very blue spectrum, while the inflaton field gives rise to a standard scale-invariant spectrum.
