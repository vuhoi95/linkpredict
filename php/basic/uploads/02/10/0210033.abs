Title: Fat Branes in Infinite-Volume Extra Space
Authors: Chad Middleton and George Siopsis
Abstract: We study branes residing in infinite volume space and of finite extent in the transverse directions. We calculate the graviton propagator in the harmonic gauge both inside and outside the brane and discuss its dependence on the thickness of the brane. Our treatment includes the full tensor structure of the propagator. We obtain two infinite towers of massive modes and tachyonic ghosts. In the thin-brane limit, we recover four-dimensional Einstein gravity. We compare our results to similar recent results by Dubovsky and Rubakov.
