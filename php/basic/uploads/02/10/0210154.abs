Title: Integrability and Conformal Symmetry in Higher Dimensions: A Model with  Exact Hopfion Solutions
Authors: O. Babelon and L. A. Ferreira
Abstract: We use ideas on integrability in higher dimensions to define Lorentz invariant field theories with an infinite number of local conserved currents. The models considered have a two dimensional target space. Requiring the existence of Lagrangean and the stability of static solutions singles out a class of models which have an additional conformal symmetry. That is used to explain the existence of an ansatz leading to solutions with non trivial Hopf charges.
