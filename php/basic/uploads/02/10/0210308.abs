Title: String theory and the Classical Stability of Plane Waves
Authors: D. Brecher and J. P. Gregory and P. M. Saffin
Abstract: The presence of fields with negative mass-squared typically leads to some form of instability in standard field theories. The observation that, at least in the light-cone gauge, strings propagating in plane wave spacetimes can have worldsheet scalars with such tachyon-like masses suggests that the supergravity background may itself be unstable. To address this issue, we perform a perturbative analysis around the type IIB vacuum plane wave, the solution which most obviously generates worldsheet scalars with negative mass-squared. We argue that this background is perturbatively stable.
