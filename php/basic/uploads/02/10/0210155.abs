Title: Virasoro operators in the continuous basis of string field theory
Authors: Ehud Fuchs and Michael Kroyter and Alon Marcus
Abstract: In this work we derive two important tools for working in the \kappa basis of string field theory. First we give an analytical expression for the finite part of the spectral density \rho_{fin}. This expression is relevant when both matter and ghost sectors are considered. Then we calculate the form of the matter part of the Virasoro generators L_n in the \kappa basis, which construct string field theory's derivation Q_{BRST}. We find that the Virasoro generators are given by one dimensional delta functions with complex arguments.
