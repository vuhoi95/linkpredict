Title: Naturally light invisible axion and local Z_{13} times Z_3 symmetries
Authors: Alex G. Dias and V. Pleitez and M. D. Tonasse
Abstract: We show that by imposing local $Z_{13}\otimes Z_3$ symmetries in an $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ electroweak model we can implement an invisible axion in such a way that (i) the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is an automatic symmetry of the classical Lagrangian; and (ii) the axion is protected from semi classical gravitational effects. In order to be able to implement such a large discrete symmetry, and at the same time allow a general mixing in each charge sector, we introduce right-handed neutrinos and enlarge the scalar sector of the model. The domain wall problem is briefly considered.
