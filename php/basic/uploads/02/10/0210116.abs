Title: Supersymmetric extension of the nine-dimensional continuation of the  Euler density with N=2
Authors: Mokhtar Hassaine and Rodrigo Olea and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: A local supersymmetric extension with N=2 of the dimensional continuation of the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet density from eight to nine dimensions is constructed. The gravitational sector is invariant under local Poincare translations, and the full field content is given by the vielbein, the spin connection, a complex gravitino, and an Abelian one-form. The local symmetry group is shown to be super Poincare with N=2 and a U(1) central extension, and the full supersymmetric Lagrangian can be written as a Chern-Simons form.
