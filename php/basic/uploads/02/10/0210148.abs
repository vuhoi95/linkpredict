Title: Comments on Effective Superpotentials via Matrix Models
Authors: Hiroyuki Fuji and Yutaka Ookouchi
Abstract: Dijkgraaf and Vafa have conjectured that the effective superpotentials for N=1 four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories can be given by the planar diagrams of matrix models. We examine some special models with cubic and quartic tree level superpotentials for adjoint chiral superfield \Phi. We consider the effective superpotentials for the classical vacuum \Phi=0 for U(N) and SO(N)/Sp(N) gauge theories. We evaluate the effective superpotentials exactly in terms of the matrix model and in terms of closed string theory on Calabi-Yau geometry with fluxes. As a result we find their perfect agreements.
