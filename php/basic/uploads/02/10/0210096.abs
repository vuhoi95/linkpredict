Title: The Phase Structure of Mass-Deformed SU(2)xSU(2) Quiver Theory
Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and Tom Kingaby
Abstract: The phase structure of the finite SU(2)xSU(2) theory with N=2 supersymmetry, broken to N=1 by mass terms for the adjoint-valued chiral multiplets, is determined exactly by compactifying the theory on a circle of finite radius. The exact low-energy superpotential is constructed by identifying it as a linear combination of the Hamiltonians of a certain symplectic reduction of the spin generalized elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable system. It is shown that the theory has four confining, two Higgs and two massless Coulomb vacua which agrees with a simple analysis of the tree-level superpotential of the four-dimensional theory. In each vacuum, we calculate all the condensates of the adjoint-valued scalars.
