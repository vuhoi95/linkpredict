Title: The correlation functions of the $(D_{4},A_{6})$ conformal model
Authors: S. Balaska and K. Demmouche
Abstract: In this work, we exploit the operator content of the $(D_{4}, A_{6})$ conformal algebra. By constructing a $Z_{2}$-invariants fusion rules of a chosen subalgebra and by resolving the bootstrap equations consistent with these rules, we determine the structure constants of the subalgebra.
