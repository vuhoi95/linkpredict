Title: Photon fields in a fluctuating spacetime
Authors: Jan Naudts and Maciej Kuna and Wojciech De Roeck
Abstract: We present a model of interacting quantum fields, formulated in a non-perturbative manner. One of the fields is treated semi-classically, the other is the photon field. The model has an interpretation of an electromagnetic field in a fluctuating spacetime. The model is equivalent with the quantization of electromagnetism proposed recently by Czachor. Interesting features are that standard photon theory is recovered as a limiting case, and that localized field operators for the electromagnetic field exist as unbounded operators in Hilbert space.
