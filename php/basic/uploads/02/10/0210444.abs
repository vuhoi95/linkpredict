Title: Possible cosmological implications in electrodynamics due to variations  of the fine structure constant
Authors: J. L. Martinez-Ledesma and S. Mendoza
Abstract: Astronomical observations are suggesting that the fine structure constant varies cosmologically. We present an analysis on the consequences that these variations might induce on the electromagnetic field as a whole. We show that under these circumstances the electrodynamics in vacuum could be described by two fields, the ``standard'' Maxwell's field and a new scalar field. We provide a generalised Lorentz force which can be used to test our results experimentally.
