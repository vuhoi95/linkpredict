Title: Standard Model Higgs from Higher Dimensional Gauge Fields
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Christophe Grojean and Hitoshi Murayama
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the standard model Higgs fields may originate from extra components of higher dimensional gauge fields. Theories of this type considered before have had problems accommodating the standard model fermion content and Yukawa couplings different from the gauge coupling. Considering orbifolds based on abelian discrete groups we are lead to a 6 dimensional G_2 gauge theory compactified on T^2/Z_4. This theory can naturally produce the SM Higgs fields with the right quantum numbers while predicting the value of the weak mixing angle sin^2 theta_W = 0.25 at the tree-level, close to the experimentally observed one. The quartic scalar coupling for the Higgs is generated by the higher dimensional gauge interaction and predicts the existence of a light Higgs. We point out that one can write a quadratically divergent counter term for Higgs mass localized to the orbifold fixed point. However, we calculate these operators and show that higher dimensional gauge interactions do not generate them at least at one loop. Fermions are introduced at orbifold fixed points, making it easy to accommodate the standard model fermion content. Yukawa interactions are generated by Wilson lines. They may be generated by the exchange of massive bulk fermions, and the fermion mass hierarchy can be obtained. Around a TeV, the first KK modes would appear as well as additional fermion modes localized at the fixed point needed to cancel the quadratic divergences from the Yukawa interactions. The cutoff scale of the theory could be a few times 10 TeV.
