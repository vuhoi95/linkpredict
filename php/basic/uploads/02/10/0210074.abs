Title: Thirring sine-Gordon relationship by canonical methods
Authors: V. Juricic and B. Sazdovic
Abstract: Using the canonical method developed for anomalous theories, we present the independent rederivation of the quantum relationship between the massive Thirring and the sine-Gordon models. The same method offers the possibility to obtain the Mandelstam soliton operators as a solution of Poisson brackets "equation" for the fermionic fields. We checked the anticommutation and basic Poisson brackets relations for these composite operators. The transition from the Hamiltonian to the corresponding Lagrangian variables produces the known Mandelstam's result.
