Abstract: Dressing technique is used to construct commuting Lax operators which provide an integrable (canonical) structure behind Witten--Dijkgraaf--Verlinde--Verlinde equations. The commuting flows are related to the isomonodromic flows. Examples of the canonical integrable structure are given in two- and three-dimensional cases. The three-dimensional example is associated with the rational Landau-Ginzburg potentials.
