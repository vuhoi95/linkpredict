Title: Excited D-brane decay in Cubic String Field Theory and in Bosonic String  Theory
Authors: M. R. Garousi and G. R. Maktabdaran
Abstract: In the cubic string field theory, using the gauge invariant operators corresponding to the on-shell closed string vertex operators, we have explicitly evaluated the decay amplitudes of two open string tachyons or gauge fields to one closed string tachyon or graviton up to level two. We then evaluated the same amplitudes in the bosonic string theory, and shown that the amplitudes in both theories have exactly the same pole structure. We have also expanded the decay amplitudes in the bosonic string theory around the Mandelstam variable s=0, and shown that their leading contact terms are fully consistent with a tachyonic Dirac-Born-Infeld action which includes both open string and closed string tachyon.
