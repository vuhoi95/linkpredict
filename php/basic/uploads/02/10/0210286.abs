Title: Entropy Bounds in Spherical Space
Authors: Iver Brevik and Kimball A. Milton and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: Exact calculations are given for the Casimir energy for various fields in $R\times S^3$ geometry. The Green's function method naturally gives a result in a form convenient in the high-temperature limit, while the statistical mechanical approach gives a form appropriate for low temperatures. The equivalence of these two representations is demonstrated. Some discrepancies with previous work are noted. In no case, even for ${\cal N}=4$ SUSY, is the ratio of entropy to energy found to be bounded.
