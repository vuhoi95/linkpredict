Title: GUT Precursors and Non-Trivial Fixed Points in Higher-Dimensional Gauge  Theories
Authors: Keith R. Dienes and Emilian Dudas and Tony Gherghetta
Abstract: Within the context of traditional logarithmic grand unification at M_GUT = 10^(16) GeV, we show that it is nevertheless possible to observe certain GUT states such as X and Y gauge bosons at lower scales, perhaps even in the TeV range. We refer to such states as ``GUT precursors.'' Such states offer an interesting alternative possibility for new physics at the TeV scale, even when the scale of gauge coupling unification remains high, and suggest that it may be possible to probe GUT physics directly even within the context of high-scale gauge coupling unification. More generally, our results also suggest that it is possible to construct self-consistent ``hybrid'' models containing widely separated energy scales, and give rise to a Kaluza-Klein realization of non-trivial fixed points in higher-dimensional gauge theories. We also discuss how such theories may be deconstructed at high energies.
