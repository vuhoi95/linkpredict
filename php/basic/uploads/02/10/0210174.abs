Title: Vacuum Expectation Value of the Higgs Field and Dyon Charge Quantisation  from Spacetime Dependent Lagrangians
Authors: Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya and Debashis Gangopadhyay
Abstract: The spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism of references [1-2] is used to obtain is used to obtain a classical solution of Yang-Mills theory. This is then used to obtain an estimate of the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field,{\it viz.} $\phi_{a}=A/e$, where $A$ is a constant and $e$ is the Yang-Mills coupling (related to the usual electric charge).The solution can also accommodate non-commuting coordinates on the boundary of the theory which may be used to construct $D$-brane actions. The formalism is also used to obtain the Deser-Gomberoff-Henneaux-Teitelboim results [10] for dyon charge quantisation in abelian $p$-form theories in dimensions $D=2(p+1)$ for both even and odd $p$.
