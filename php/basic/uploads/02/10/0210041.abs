Title: Green Functions of N=1 SYM and Radial/Energy-Scale Relation
Authors: Xiao-Jun Wang and Sen Hu
Abstract: We study counter-terms of one- and two-point Green functions of some special operators in ${\cal N}=1$ SYM from their SUGRA duals from the consideration of AdS/CFT or gauge/gravity correspondence. We consider both the Maldacena-Nunez solution and the Klebanov-Strassler-Tseytlin solution that are proposed to be SUGRA duals of ${\cal N}=1$ SYM. We obtain radial/energy-scale relation for each solution by comparing SUGRA calculations with the field theory results. Using these relations we evaluate the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SYM. We find that the leading order term can be accurately obtained for both solutions and the higher order terms exhibit some ambiguities. We discuss the origin of these ambiguities and conclude that more studies are needed to check whether these SUGRA solutions are exactly dual to ${\cal N}=1$ SYM.
