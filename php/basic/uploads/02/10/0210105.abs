Title: Supergravity Solution of Intersecting Branes and AdS/CFT with Flavor
Authors: Sergey A. Cherkis and Akikazu Hashimoto
Abstract: We construct the supergravity solution for fully localized D2/D6 intersection. The near horizon limit of this solution is the supergravity dual of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions with flavor. We use this solution to formulate mirror symmetry of 2+1 dimensional gauge theories in the language of AdS/CFT correspondence. We also construct the supergravity dual of a non-commutative gauge theory with fundamental matter.
