Title: On Scherk-Schwarz mechanism in gauged five-dimensional supergravity and  on its relation to bigravity
Authors: Zygmunt Lalak and Radoslaw Matyszkiewicz
Abstract: We demonstrate the relation between the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and flipped gauged brane-bulk supergravities in five dimensions. We discuss the form of supersymmetry violating Scherk-Schwarz terms in pure supergravity and in supergravity coupled to matter. We point out that brane-induced supersymmetry breakdown in 5d Horava-Witten model is not of the Scherk-Schwarz type. We discuss in detail flipped super-bigravity, which is the locally supersymmetric extension of the (++) bigravity.
