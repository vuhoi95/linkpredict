Title: Finite temperature results on the 2d Ising model with mixed perturbation
Authors: P. Grinza and A. Rago
Abstract: A numerical study of finite temperature features of thermodynamical observables is performed for the lattice 2d Ising model. Our results support the conjecture that the Finite Size Scaling analysis employed in the study of integrable perturbation of Conformal Field Theory is still valid in the present case, where a non-integrable perturbation is considered.
