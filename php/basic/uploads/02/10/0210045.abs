Title: Cosmological parameters are dressed
Authors: Thomas Buchert and Mauro Carfora
Abstract: In the context of the averaging problem in relativistic cosmology, we provide a key to the interpretation of cosmological parameters by taking into account the actual inhomogeneous geometry of the Universe. We discuss the relation between `bare' cosmological parameters determining the cosmological model, and the parameters interpreted by observers with a ``Friedmannian bias'', which are `dressed' by the smoothed-out geometrical inhomogeneities of the surveyed spatial region.
