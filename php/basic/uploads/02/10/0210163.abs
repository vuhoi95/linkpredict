Title: Comments on Noncommutative ADHM Construction
Authors: Yu Tian and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Abstract: We extend the method of matrix partition to obtain explicitly the gauge field for noncommutative ADHM construction in some general cases. As an application of this method we apply it to the U(2) 2-instanton and get explicit result for the gauge fields in the coincident instanton limit. We also easily apply it to the noncommutative 't Hooft instantons in the appendix.
