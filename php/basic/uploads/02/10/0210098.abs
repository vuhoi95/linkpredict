Title: The mass gap and vacuum energy of the Gross-Neveu model via the 2PPI  expansion
Authors: David Dudal and Henri Verschelde
Abstract: We introduce the 2PPI (2-point-particle-irreducible) expansion, which sums bubble graphs to all orders. We prove the renormalizibility of this summation. We use it on the Gross-Neveu model to calculate the mass gap and vacuum energy. After an optimization of the expansion, the final results are qualitatively good.
