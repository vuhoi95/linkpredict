Title: Wilson surfaces and higher dimensional knot invariants
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Carlo A. Rossi
Abstract: An observable for nonabelian, higher-dimensional forms is introduced, its properties are discussed and its expectation value in BF theory is described. This is shown to produce potential and genuine invariants of higher-dimensional knots.
