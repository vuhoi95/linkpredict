Title: Noncommutativity in a Time-Dependent Background
Authors: Louise Dolan and Chiara R. Nappi
Abstract: We compute a time-dependent noncommutativity parameter in a model with a time-dependent background, a space-time metric of the plane wave type supported by a Neveu-Schwarz two-form potential. This model is an open string version of the WZW model based on a non-semi-simple group previously studied by Nappi and Witten. The background we study is not conformally invariant. We consider a light-cone action for the sigma-model, compute the worldsheet propagator, and use it to derive a time-dependent noncommutativity parameter.
