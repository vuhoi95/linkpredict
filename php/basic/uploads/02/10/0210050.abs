Title: Global Monopole in Asymptotically dS/AdS Spacetime
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Jian-gang Hao
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global monopole in asymptotically dS/Ads spacetime and find that the mass of the monopole in the asymptotically dS spacetime could be positive if the cosmological constant is greater than a critical value. This shows that the gravitational field of the global monopole could be attractive or repulsive depending on the value of the cosmological constant.
