Title: Multi-leg integrable ladder models
Authors: D. Arnaudon and A. Sedrakyan and T. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We construct integrable spin chains with inhomogeneous periodic disposition of the anisotropy parameter. The periodicity holds for both auxiliary (space) and quantum (time) directions. The integrability of the model is based on a set of coupled Yang-Baxter equations. This construction yields P-leg integrable ladder Hamiltonians. We analyse the corresponding quantum group symmetry.
