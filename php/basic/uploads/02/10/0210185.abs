Title: Magnetic charge, angular momentum and negative cosmological constant
Authors: J. J. van der Bij and Eugen Radu
Abstract: We argue that there are no axially symmetric rotating monopole solutions for a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in flat spacetime background. We construct axially symmetric Yang-Mills-Higgs solutions in the presence of a negative cosmological constant, carrying magnetic charge $n$ and a nonvanishing electric charge. However, these solution are also nonrotating.
