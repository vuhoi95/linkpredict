Title: The invisible axion in a Randall-Sundrum universe
Authors: Hael Collins and R. Holman
Abstract: We study the problem of integrating an invisible axion into the Randall-Sundrum scenario as an example of how to generate new energy scales between the extremes of the Planck mass and the electroweak scale. In this scenario, the axion corresponds to the phase of complex bulk scalar field. We show how to generate an intermediate energy scale by including a third brane in the scenario. We discuss the stabilization of this brane in detail to demonstrate that no additional fine-tunings arise.
