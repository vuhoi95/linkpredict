Title: Conformal and Superconformal Mechanics Revisited
Authors: E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos and J. Niederle
Abstract: We find, at the Lagrangian off-shell level, the explicit equivalence transformation which relates the conformal mechanics of De Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to the conformal mechanics describing the radial motion of the charged massive particle in the Bertotti-Robinson AdS$_2\times S^2$ background. Thus we demonstrate the classical equivalence of these two systems which are usually regarded as essentially different ``old'' and ``new'' conformal mechanics models. We also construct a similar transformation for N=2, $SU(1,1|1)$ superconformal mechanics in N=2 superfield formulation. Performing this transformation in the action of the N=2 superconformal mechanics, we find an off-shell superfield action of N=2 superextension of Bertotti-Robinson particle. Such an action has not been given before. We show its on-shell equivalence to the AdS$_2$ superparticle action derived from the spontaneous partial breaking of $SU(1,1|1)$ superconformal symmetry treated as the N=2 AdS$_2$ supersymmetry.
