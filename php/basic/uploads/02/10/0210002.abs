Title: The Coulomb-Oscillator Relation on n-Dimensional Spheres and  Hyperboloids
Authors: E. G. Kalnins and W. Miller, Jr. and G. S. Pogosyan
Abstract: In this paper we establish a relation between Coulomb and oscillator systems on $n$-dimensional spheres and hyperboloids for $n\geq 2$. We show that, as in Euclidean space, the quasiradial equation for the $n+1$ dimensional Coulomb problem coincides with the $2n$-dimensional quasiradial oscillator equation on spheres and hyperboloids. Using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for the oscillator system, we construct the energy spectrum and wave functions for the Coulomb problem.
