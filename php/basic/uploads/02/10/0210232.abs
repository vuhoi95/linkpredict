Title: Domain Wall Lattices
Authors: Levon Pogosian and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We construct lattices with alternating kinks and anti-kinks. The lattice is shown to be stable in certain models. We consider the forces between kinks and antikinks and find that the lattice dynamics is that of a Toda lattice. Such lattices are exotic metastable states in which the system can get trapped during a phase transition.
