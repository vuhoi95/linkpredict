Title: Poincar√© algebra and space-time critical dimensions for paraspinning  strings
Authors: N. Belaloui and H. Bennacer
Abstract: In this paper, we paraquantize the spinning string theory in the Neuveu-Shwarz model. Both the center of mass variables and the excitation modes of the string verify paracommutation relations. Except the $[p^{\mu},p^{\nu}]$ commutator, the two other commutators of Poincar\'e algebra are satisfied. With the sole use of trilinear relations we find existence possibilities of spinning strings at space-time dimensions other than D=10.
