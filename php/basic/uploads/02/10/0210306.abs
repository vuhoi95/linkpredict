Title: Supersphere
Authors: D. K. Park and S. Tamaryan and H. J. W. MÃ¼ller-Kirsten
Abstract: The spherical D2-brane solution is obtained without RR external background. The solution is shown to preserve $(1/4)$ supersymmetries. The configurations obtained depend on the integration constant $R_0$. For $R_0 \neq 0$ the shape of the solution is a deformed sphere. When, however, $R_0 = 0$, the D2-brane system seems to exhibit a brane-anti-brane configuration.
