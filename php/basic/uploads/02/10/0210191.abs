Title: Poincare algebra and space-time critical dimensions for parabosonic  strings
Authors: N. Belaloui and H. Bennacer
Abstract: We construct the parabosonic string formalism based on the paraquantization of both the center of mass variables and the excitation modes of the string. A critical study of the different commutators of the Poincar\'{e} algebra based on the redefinition of its generators and the direct treatment using trilinear relations is done. Space-time critical dimensions $D$ as functions of the paraquantization order $Q$ are obtained.
