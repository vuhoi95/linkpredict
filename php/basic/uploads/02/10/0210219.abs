Title: Two-color QCD in 3D at finite baryon density
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Shinsuke M. Nishigaki
Abstract: We study the low energy phase structure of SU(2) gauge theories in three-dimensional spacetime, at finite baryon density. The pseudoreality of representations of SU(2) permits an analytic study of a real baryon chemical potential, and the restriction to 3D results in a different global symmetry breaking pattern from the corresponding 4D model studied previously by Kogut et al. We find a second-order phase transition separating the normal phase and the baryon superconducting phase. The chemical potential dependence of condensates and baryon density are computed. We find that the phase structure and the excitation spectrum are essentially the same as in 4D, despite the different symmetry groups, indicating a universality that is rooted in the properties of Riemannian symmetric spaces.
