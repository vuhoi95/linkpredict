Title: Non-Abelian T-duality in Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology
Authors: A. Bossard and N. Mohammedi
Abstract: We study the impact of non-Abelian T-duality transformations on a string based cosmological model. The implementation of the pre-big-bang scenario is investigated. We found a region of the dual phase where such a picture is possible.
