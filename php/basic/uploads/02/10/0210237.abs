Title: Yang-Mills and Born-Infeld actions on finite group spaces
Authors: P. Aschieri and L. Castellani and A. P. Isaev
Abstract: Discretized nonabelian gauge theories living on finite group spaces G are defined by means of a geometric action \int Tr F\wedge *F . This technique is extended to obtain a discrete version of the Born-Infeld action.
