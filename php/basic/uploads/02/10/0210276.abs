Title: Regular Black Holes and Confinement
Authors: Alexander Burinskii and Sergi R. Hildebrandt
Abstract: Properties of the rotating Kerr-Newman black hole solution allow to relate it with spinning particles. Singularity of black hole (BH) can be regularized by a metric deformation. In this case, as a consequence of the Einstein equations, a material source appears in the form of a relativistically rotating superconducting disk which replaces the former singular region. We show a relation of the BH regularization with confinement formation. By regularization, a phase transition occurs near the core of a charged black hole solution: from external electrovacuum to an internal superconducting state of matter. We discuss two models of such a kind, which demonstrate the appearance of a baglike structure and a mechanism of confinement based on dual Dirac's electrodynamics. First one is an approximate solution based on a supersymmetric charged domain wall, and second is an exact solution based on nonlinear electrodynamics.
