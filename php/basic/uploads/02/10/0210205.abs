Title: BPS Walls and Junctions in ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY Nonlinear Sigma Models
Authors: Masashi Naganuma and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: The ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY nonlinear sigma models in four spacetime dimensions are studied to obtain BPS walls and junctions. A nonlinear sigma model with a single chiral scalar superfield is found which has a moduli space of the topology of $S^1$ and admits BPS walls and junctions connecting arbitrary points in moduli space. New BPS junction solutions connecting $N$ discrete vacua are also found for nonlinear sigma models with several chiral scalar superfields. More detailed exposition of our results can be found in Ref.\cite{NNS}.
