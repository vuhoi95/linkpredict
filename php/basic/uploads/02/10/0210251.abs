Title: Thermodynamics of 2D string theory
Authors: Sergei Yu. Alexandrov and Vladimir A. Kazakov
Abstract: We calculate the free energy, energy and entropy in the matrix quantum mechanical formulation of 2D string theory in a background strongly perturbed by tachyons with the imaginary Minkowskian momentum $\pm i/R$ (``Sine-Liouville'' theory). The system shows a thermodynamical behaviour corresponding to the temperature $T=1/(2\pi R)$. We show that the microscopically calculated energy of the system satisfies the usual thermodynamical relations and leads to a non-zero entropy.
