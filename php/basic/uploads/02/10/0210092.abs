Title: The Role of Mass and External Field on the Fermionic Casimir Effect
Authors: J. L. Tomazelli and L. C. Costa
Abstract: The aim of this work is to investigate the role played by the fermion mass and that of an external field on the fermionic Casimir energy density under S^1 X R^3 topology. Both twisted and untwisted spin connections are considered and the exact calculation is performed using a somewhat different approach based on the combination of the analytic regularization method through alpha-representation and Euler-Maclaurin summation formula.
