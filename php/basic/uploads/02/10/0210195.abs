Title: General graviton exchange graph for four point functions in the AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: Thorsten Leonhardt and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: In this note we explicitly compute the graviton exchange graph for scalar fields with arbitrary conformal dimension \Delta in arbitrary spacetime dimension d. This results in an analytical function in \Delta as well as in d.
