Title: Duality of boundary value problems and braneworld action in curved brane  models
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and D. V. Nesterov
Abstract: Braneworld effective action is constructed by two different methods based respectively on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. The equivalence of these methods is shown due to nontrivial duality relations between special boundary operators of these two problems. Previously known braneworld action algorithms in two-brane Randall-Sundrum model are generalized to curved branes with deSitter and Anti-deSitter geometries.
