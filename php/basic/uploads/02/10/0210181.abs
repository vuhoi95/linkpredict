Title: Brane-assisted Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking in orbifolds
Authors: A. Delgado and G. v. Gersdorff and M. Quiros
Abstract: We have analyzed the interplay between Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking and general fermion (gaugino or gravitino) mass terms localized on the fixed point branes of the S^1/Z_2 orbifold. Analytic solutions for eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are found in all cases. All results are checked by numerical calculations that make use of regularized \delta-functions. Odd and generically also even fermions are discontinuous at the brane fixed points, but in all cases the combination that couples to the brane is continuous. For CP-even brane mass terms supersymmetry restoration can take place when their effects are cancelled by those of Scherk-Schwarz compactification. However such a cancellation can not occur for CP-odd brane mass terms.
