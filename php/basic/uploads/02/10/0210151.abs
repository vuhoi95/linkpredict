Title: Abelian duality in three dimensions
Authors: Boguslaw Broda and Grzegorz Duniec
Abstract: Abelian duality on the closed three-dimensional Riemannian manifold M is discussed. Partition functions for the ordinary U(1) gauge theory and a circle-valued scalar field theory on M are explicitly calculated and compared. It is shown that the both theories are mutually dual.
