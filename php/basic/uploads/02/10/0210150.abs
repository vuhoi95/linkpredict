Title: Tadpole and Anomaly Cancellation Conditions in D-brane Orbifold Models
Authors: Maria E. Angulo and David Bailin and Huan-Xiong Yang
Abstract: We derive and generalize the RR twisted tadpole cancellation conditions necessary to obtain consistent D=4, Z_N orbifold compactifications of Type IIB string theory. At least two different types of branes (or antibranes with opposite RR charges) are introduced into the construction. The matter spectra and their contribution to the non-abelian gauge anomalies are computed. Their relation with the tadpole cancellation conditions is also reviewed. The presence of tachyons is a common feature for some of the non-supersymmetric systems of branes.
