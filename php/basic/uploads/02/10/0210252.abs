Title: Holographic Thermodynamic on the Brane in Topological  Reissner-Nordstr√∂m de Sitter Space
Authors: M. R. Setare and R. Mansouri
Abstract: We consider the brane universe in the bulk background of the topological Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black holes. We show that the thermodynamic quantities (including entropy) of the dual CFT take usual special forms expressed in terms of Hubble parameter and its time derivative at the moment, when the brane crosses the black hole horizon or the cosmological horizon. We obtain the generalized Cardy-Verlinde formula for the CFT with an charge and cosmological constant, for any values of the curvature parameter $k$ in the Friedmann equations.
