Title: Varying Constants in Brane World Scenarios
Authors: Ph. Brax and C. van de Bruck and A. -C. Davis and C. S. Rhodes
Abstract: Higher-dimensional theories imply that some constants, such as the gravitational constant and the strength of the gauge-couplings, are not fundamental constants. Instead they are related to the sizes of the extra--dimensional space, which are moduli fields in the four--dimensional effective theory. We study the cosmological evolution of the moduli fields appearing in brane world scenarios and discuss the implications for varying constants.
