Title: AdS Dual of the Critical O(N) Vector Model
Authors: I. R. Klebanov and A. M. Polyakov
Abstract: We suggest a general relation between theories of infinite number of higher-spin massless gauge fields in $AdS_{d+1}$ and large $N$ conformal theories in $d$ dimensions containing $N$-component vector fields. In particular, we propose that the singlet sector of the well-known critical 3-d O(N) model with the $(\phi^a \phi^a)^2$ interaction is dual, in the large $N$ limit, to the minimal bosonic theory in $AdS_4$ containing massless gauge fields of even spin.
