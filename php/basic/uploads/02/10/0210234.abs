Title: No horizons in pp-waves
Authors: Veronika E Hubeny and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We argue that pp-wave backgrounds can not admit event horizons. We also comment on pp-wave generalizations which would admit horizons and show that there exists a black string solution which asymptotes to a five dimensional plane wave background.
