Title: 3-Form Induced Potentials, Dilaton Stabilization, and Running Moduli
Authors: Andrew R. Frey and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We study the potential induced by imaginary self-dual 3-forms in compactifications of string theory and the cosmological evolution associated with it. The potential contains exponentials of the volume moduli of the compactification, and we demonstrate that the exponential form of the potential leads to a power law for the scale factor of the universe. This power law does not support accelerated expansion. We explain this result in terms of supersymmetry and comment on corrections to the potential that could lead to inflation or quintessence.
