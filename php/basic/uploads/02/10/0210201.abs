Title: Alternative dimensional reduction via the density matrix: A test
Authors: C. A. A. de Carvalho and R. M. Cavalcanti
Abstract: We derive and analyze the perturbation series for the classical effective action in quantum statistical mechanics, treated as a toy model for the dimensionally reduced effective action in quantum field theory at finite temperature. The first few terms of the series are computed for the harmonic oscillator and the quartic potential.
