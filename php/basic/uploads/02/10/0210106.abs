Title: Calculation of Expectation Values of S$_{z}$ and S$^{2}$ operators for  spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles
Authors: S. Gonen and A. Havare
Abstract: In the present article we calculate the expectation values of of S$_{z}$ and S$^{2}$ operators for spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles by expanding a general wave function which includes all spin values. The results are same as in the stantard quantum mechanics.
