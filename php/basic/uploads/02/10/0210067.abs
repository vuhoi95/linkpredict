Title: On the Moduli Space of Noncommutative Multi-solitons at Finite Theta
Authors: Takeo Araki and Katsushi Ito
Abstract: We study the finite theta correction to the metric of the moduli space of noncommutative multi-solitons in scalar field theory in (2+1) dimensions. By solving the equation of motion up to order O(theta^{-2}) explicitly, we show that the multi-soliton solution must have the same center for a generic potential term. We examine the condition that the multi-centered configurations are allowed. Under this condition, we calculate the finite theta correction to the metric of the moduli space of multi-solitons and argue the possibility of the non right-angle scattering of two solitons. We also obtain the potential between two solitons.
