Title: Consistent deformations of dual formulations of linearized gravity: A  no-go result
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: The consistent, local, smooth deformations of the dual formulation of linearized gravity involving a tensor field in the exotic representation of the Lorentz group with Young symmetry type (D-3,1) (one column of length D-3 and one column of length 1) are systematically investigated. The rigidity of the Abelian gauge algebra is first established. We next prove a no-go theorem for interactions involving at most two derivatives of the fields.
