Title: Miracles and complementarity in de Sitter space
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Daniel Domert and Martin Olsson
Abstract: In this paper we consider a scenario, consisting of a de Sitter phase followed by a phase described by a scale factor $a(t)\sim t^{q}$, where $1/3<q<1$, which can be viewed as an inflationary toy model. It is argued that this scenario naively could lead to an information paradox. We propose that the phenomenon of Poincar\'{e} recurrences plays a crucial role in the resolution of the paradox. We also comment on the relevance of these results to inflation and the CMBR.
