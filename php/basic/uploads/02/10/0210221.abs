Title: Time evolution of rolling tachyons for a brane-antibrane pair
Authors: Haewon Lee and W. S. l'Yi
Abstract: A precise form of the time evolution of rolling tachyons corresponding to a brane-antibrane pair is investigated by solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion under the assumption that in a region far away from branes the tachyon vacuum is almost already achieved, even at the beginning of the rolling.
