Title: Simulations of Alice Electrodynamics on a Lattice
Authors: J. Striet and F. A. Bais
Abstract: In this paper we present results of numerical simulations and some (analytical) approximations of a compact $U(1)\ltimes\ZZ_2$ lattice gauge theory, including an extra bare mass term for Alice fluxes. The subtle interplay between Alice fluxes and (Cheshire) magnetic charges is analysed. We determine the phase diagram and some characteristics of the model in three and four dimensions. The results of the numerical simulations in various regimes, compare well with some analytic approximations.
