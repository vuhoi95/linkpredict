Title: PP-Wave Light-Cone Superstring Field Theory
Authors: A. Pankiewicz and B. Stefanski Jr
Abstract: We construct the cubic interaction vertex and dynamically generated supercharges in light-cone superstring field theory in the pp-wave background. We show that these satisfy the pp-wave superalgebra at first order in string coupling. The cubic interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges presented here differ from the expressions previously given in the literature. Using this vertex we compute various string theory three-point functions and comment on their relation to gauge theory in the BMN limit.
