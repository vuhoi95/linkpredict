Title: Extended Anomaly Mediation and New Physics at 10 TeV
Authors: Ann E. Nelson and Neal Weiner
Abstract: In the MSSM, an unfortunate prediction of minimal anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking is that the slepton masses squared are negative. This problem is particularly intractable because of the insensitivity of anomaly mediation to ultraviolet physics. In this paper we note that tree level couplings to the conformal compensator in the Kahler potential give 10 TeV as a natural mass scale for physics beyond the MSSM, and, moreover, that the SUSY breaking effects from physics at this scale do not generically decouple from the low-energy spectrum. We consider particular extensions, including the effects of vector-like matter at 10 TeV, and a specific model in which the leptons are placed in a triplet of an asymptotically free SU(3). We find that the features of minimal anomaly mediation are not a robust prediction of the general framework, and that the problem of negative slepton masses squared can easily be avoided.
