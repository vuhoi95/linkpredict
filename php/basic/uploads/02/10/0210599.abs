Title: Conductance from Non-perturbative Methods I
Authors: Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo and Andreas Fring
Abstract: We investigate different methods to compute the DC conductance in a quantum wire doped with some impuritied by exploiting the integrability of the theories under consideration. As an essential ingredient in all methods we evaluate the reflection and transmission amplitudes ofthe impurities for a variety of defects. When the impurities inthe wire are coupled to an external three dimensional laser field, we predict the generation of harmonic emission spectra. We propose a modified version of the well-known Kubo formula, which incorporates the impurities of the system and evaluate the current-current two-point correlation function it involves with the help of a form factor expansion. A comparison with the corresponding quantities computed in a Landauer transport theory picture is carried out in part II.
