Title: Harmonic oscillator with minimal length uncertainty relations and ladder  operators
Authors: Ivan Dadic and Larisa Jonke and Stjepan Meljanac
Abstract: We construct creation and annihilation operators for harmonic oscillators with minimal length uncertainty relations. We discuss a possible generalization to a large class of deformations of cannonical commutation relations. We also discuss dynamical symmetry of noncommutative harmonic oscillator.
