Title: Rolling Tachyons in String Cosmology
Authors: Chanju Kim and Hang Bae Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: We study the role of rolling tachyons in the cosmological model with dilatonic gravity. In the string frame, flat space solutions of both initial-stage and late-time are obtained in closed form. In the Einstein frame, we show that every expanding solution is decelerating.
