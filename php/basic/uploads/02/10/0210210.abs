Title: Hadronic string and chiral symmetry breaking
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and D. Espriu
Abstract: We assume that QCD can be effectively described with string-like variables. The hadronic string is built over the chirally non-invariant QCD vacuum by means of the boundary interaction with background chiral fields associated with pions. By making this interaction compatible with the conformal symmetry of the string and with the unitarity constraint on chiral fields we reconstruct the equations of motion for the latter ones and furthermore recover the Lagrangian of non-linear sigma model of pion interactions. The estimated chiral structural constants of Gasser and Leutwyler fit well the phenomenological values.
