Title: The Euler-Kockel-Heisenberg Lagrangian at Finite Temperature
Authors: J. L. Tomazelli and L. C. Costa
Abstract: In the present work we investigate temperature effects on the spinor and scalar effetive QED in the context of Thermo Field Dynamics. Following Weisskopf's zero-point energy method, the problem of charge renormalization is reexamined and high temperature contributions are extracted from the thermal correction for the Lagrangian densities.
