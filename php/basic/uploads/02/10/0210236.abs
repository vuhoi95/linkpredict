Title: Interaction of global and local monopoles
Authors: Eugenio R. Bezerra de Mello and Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We study the direct interaction between global and local monopoles. While in two previous papers, the coupling between the two sectors was only indirect through the coupling to gravity, we here introduce a new term in the potential that couples the Goldstone field and the Higgs field directly. We investigate the influence of this term in curved space and compare it to the results obtained previously.
