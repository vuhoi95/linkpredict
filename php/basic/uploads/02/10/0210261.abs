Title: On the quantum matrix string
Authors: Shozo Uehara and Satoshi Yamada
Abstract: We study the behavior of matrix string theory in the strong coupling region, where it is expected to reduce to discrete light-cone type IIA superstring. In the large $N$ limit, the reduction corresponds to the double-dimensional reduction from wrapped supermembranes on $R^{10}\times S^1$ to type IIA superstrings on $R^{10}$ in the light-cone gauge, which is shown classically, however it is not obvious quantum mechanically. We analyze the problem in matrix string theory by using the strong coupling ($1/g$) expansion. We find that the quantum corrections do not cancel out at $\mathcal{O}(1/g^2)$. Detailed calculations can be seen in Ref.\cite{UY}.
