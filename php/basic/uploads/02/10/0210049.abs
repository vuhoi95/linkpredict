Abstract: We present a lattice theory with an exact fermionic symmetry, which mixes the link and the fermionic variables. The staggered fermionic variables may be reconstructed into a Majorana fermion in the continuum limit. The gauge action has a novel structure. Though it is the ordinary plaquette action, two different couplings are assigned in the ``Ichimatsu pattern'' or the checkered pattern. In the naive continuum limit, the fermionic symmetry survives as a continuum (or an $O(a^0)$) symmetry. The transformation of the fermion is proportional to the field strength multiplied by the difference of the two gauge couplings in this limit. This work is an extension of our recently proposed cell model toward the realization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on lattice.
