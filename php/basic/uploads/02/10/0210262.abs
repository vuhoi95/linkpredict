Title: D-branes in PP-Waves and Massive Theories on Worldsheet with Boundary
Authors: Yasuaki Hikida and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetric D-brane configurations in the pp-wave backgrounds proposed by Maldacena and Maoz. We study the surviving supersymmetry in a D-brane configuration from the worldvolume point of view. When we restrict ourselves to the background with N=(2,2) supersymmetry and no holomorphic Killing vector term, there are two types of supersymmetric D-branes: A-type and B-type. An A-type brane is wrapped on a special Lagrangian submanifold, and the imaginary part of the superpotential should be constant on its worldvolume. On the other hand, a B-type brane is wrapped on a complex submanifold, and the superpotential should be constant on its worldvolume. The results are almost consistent with the worldsheet theory in the lightcone gauge. The inclusion of gauge fields is also discussed and found BPS D-branes with the gauge field excitations. Furthermore, we consider the backgrounds with holomorphic Killing vector terms and N=(1,1) supersymmetric backgrounds.
