Title: Correlation-consistency cartography of the double inflation landscape
Authors: Shinji Tsujikawa and David Parkinson and Bruce A. Bassett
Abstract: We show explicitly some exciting features of double-inflation: (i) it can often lead to strongly correlated adiabatic and entropy (isocurvature) power spectra. (ii) The two-field slow-roll consistency relations can be violated when the correlation is large at Hubble crossing. (iii) The spectra of adiabatic and entropy perturbations can be strongly scale-dependent and tilted toward either the red or blue. These effects are typically due to a light or time-dependent entropy mass and a non-negligible angular velocity in field space during inflation. They are illustrated via a multi-parameter numerical search for correlations in two concrete models. The correlation is found to be particularly strong in a supersymmetric scenario due to rapid growth of entropy perturbations in the tachyonic region separating the two inflationary stages. Our analysis suggests that realistic double-inflation models will provide a rich and fruitful arena for the application of future cosmic data sets and new approximation schemes which go beyond slow-roll.
