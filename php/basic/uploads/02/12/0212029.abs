Title: Entropy of Killing horizons from Virasoro algebra in D-dimensional  extended Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: M. Cvitan and S. Pallua and P. Prester
Abstract: We treat D-dimensional black holes with Killing horizon for extended Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We use Carlip method and impose boundary conditions on horizon what enables us to identify Virasoro algebra and evaluate its central charge and Hamiltonian eigenvalue. The Cardy formula allows then to calculate the number of states and thus provides for microscopic interpretation of entropy.
