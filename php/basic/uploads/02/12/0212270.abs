Title: Noncommutative gravity: fuzzy sphere and others
Authors: Yasuhiro Abe and V. P. Nair
Abstract: Gravity on noncommutative analogues of compact spaces can give a finite mode truncation of ordinary commutative gravity. We obtain the actions for gravity on the noncommutative two-sphere and on the noncommutative ${\bf CP}^2$ in terms of finite dimensional $(N\times N)$-matrices. The commutative large $N$ limit is also discussed.
