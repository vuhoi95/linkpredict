Title: Bulk and brane gauge propagator on 5d AdS black hole
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The bulk gauge fields on 5d AdS black hole are discussed. We construct the bulk (and the corresponding brane) gauge propagator when black hole has large radius. The properties of gauge and ghost propagators are studied in both, minkowski or euclidean signature. In euclidean formulation the propagator structure corresponds to the one of theory at finite temperature (which depends on coordinates). The decoupling of KK modes and localization of gauge fields on flat brane is demonstrated. We show that with such a bulk there is no natural solution of hierarchy problem.
