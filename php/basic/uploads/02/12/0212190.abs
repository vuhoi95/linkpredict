Title: Lorentz violation and Crab synchrotron emission: a new constraint far  beyond the Planck scale
Authors: T. Jacobson and S. Liberati and D. Mattingly
Abstract: Special relativity asserts that physical phenomena appear the same for all inertially moving observers. This symmetry, called Lorentz symmetry, relates long wavelengths to short ones: if the symmetry is exact it implies that spacetime must look the same at all length scales. Several approaches to quantum gravity, however, suggest that there may be a Lorentz violating microscopic structure of spacetime, for example discreteness, non-commutativity, or extra dimensions. Here we determine a very strong constraint on a type of Lorentz violation that produces a maximum electron speed less than the speed of light. We use the observation of 100 MeV synchrotron radiation from the Crab nebula to improve the previous limits by a factor of 40 million, ruling out this type of Lorentz violation, and thereby providing an important constraint on theories of quantum gravity.
