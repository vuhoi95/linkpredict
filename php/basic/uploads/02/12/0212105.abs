Title: Relating a gluon mass scale to an infrared fixed point in pure gauge QCD
Authors: A. C. Aguilar and A. A. Natale and P. S. Rodrigues da Silva
Abstract: We show that in pure gauge QCD (or any pure non-Abelian gauge theory) the condition for the existence of a global minimum of energy with a gluon (gauge boson) mass scale also implies the existence of a fixed point of the $\beta$ function. We argue that the frozen value of the coupling constant found in some solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of QCD can be related to this fixed point. We also discuss how the inclusion of fermions modifies this property.
