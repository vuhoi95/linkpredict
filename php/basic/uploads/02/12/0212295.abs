Title: Goldstone Superfield Actions in AdS5 backgrounds
Authors: S. Bellucci and E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos
Abstract: Nonlinear realizations superfield techniques, pertinent to the description of partial breaking of global N=2 supersymmetry in a flat d=4 super Minkowski background, are generalized to the case of partially broken N=1 AdS5 supersymmetry SU(2,2|1). We present, in an explicit form, off-shell manifestly N=1, d=4 supersymmetric minimal Goldstone superfield actions for two patterns of partial breaking of SU(2,2|1) supersymmetry. They correspond to two different nonlinear realizations of the latter, in the supercosets with the AdS5 and AdS5\times S1 bosonic parts. The relevant worldvolume Goldstone supermultiplets are accommodated, respectively, by improved tensor and chiral N=1, d=4 superfields. The second action is obtained from the first one by dualizing the improved tensor Goldstone multiplet into a chiral Goldstone one. In the bosonic sectors, the first and second actions yield static-gauge Nambu-Goto actions for a L3-brane on AdS5 and a scalar 3-brane on AdS5\times S1.
