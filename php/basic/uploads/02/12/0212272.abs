Title: Universal Calabi-Yau Algebra: Classification and Enumeration of  Fibrations
Authors: F. Anselmo and J. Ellis and D. V. Nanopoulos and G. Volkov
Abstract: We apply a universal normal Calabi-Yau algebra to the construction and classification of compact complex $n$-dimensional spaces with SU(n) holonomy and their fibrations. This algebraic approach includes natural extensions of reflexive weight vectors to higher dimensions and a `dual' construction based on the Diophantine decomposition of invariant monomials. The latter provides recurrence formulae for the numbers of fibrations of Calabi-Yau spaces in arbitrary dimensions, which we exhibit explicitly for some Weierstrass and K3 examples.
