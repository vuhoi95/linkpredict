Title: On-brane data for braneworld stars
Authors: Matt Visser and David L. Wiltshire
Abstract: Stellar structure in braneworlds is markedly different from that in ordinary general relativity. As an indispensable first step towards a more general analysis, we completely solve the ``on brane'' 4-dimensional Gauss and Codazzi equations for an arbitrary static spherically symmetric star in a Randall--Sundrum type II braneworld. We then indicate how this on-brane boundary data should be propagated into the bulk in order to determine the full 5-dimensional spacetime geometry. Finally, we demonstrate how this procedure can be generalized to solid objects such as planets.
