Title: BMN Operators for N=1 Superconformal Yang-Mills Theories and Associated  String Backgrounds
Authors: Vasilis Niarchos and Nikolaos Prezas
Abstract: We study a class of near-BPS operators for a complex 2-parameter family of N=1 superconformal Yang-Mills theories that can be obtained by a Leigh-Strassler deformation of N=4 SYM theory. We identify these operators in the large N and large R-charge limit and compute their exact scaling dimensions using N=1 superspace methods. From these scaling dimensions we attempt to reverse-engineer the light-cone worldsheet theory that describes string propagation on the Penrose limit of the dual geometry.
