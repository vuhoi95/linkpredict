Title: Type IIB Theory on Half-flat Manifolds
Authors: Sebastien Gurrieri and Andrei Micu
Abstract: In this note we derive the low-energy effective action of type IIB theory compactified on half-flat manifolds and we show that this precisely coincides with the low-energy effective action of type IIA theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold in the presence of NS three-form fluxes. We provide in this way a further check of the recently formulated conjecture that half-flat manifolds appear as mirror partners of Calabi-Yau manifolds when NS fluxes are turned on.
