Title: Chiral Anomaly and Ginsparg-Wilson Relation on the Noncommutative Torus
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Keiichi Nagao
Abstract: We evaluate chiral anomaly on the noncommutative torus with the overlap Dirac operator satisfying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation in arbitrary even dimensions. Utilizing a topological argument we show that the chiral anomaly is combined into a form of the Chern character with star products.
