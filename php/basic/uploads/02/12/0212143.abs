Title: Dark Radiation and Localization of Gravity on the Brane
Authors: Rui Neves and Cenalo Vaz
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of a spherically symmetric dark radiation vaccum in the Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario. Under certain natural assumptions we show that the Einstein equations on the brane form a closed system. For a de Sitter brane we determine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions which depend on the brane cosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal charge and on its initial configuration. We define the conditions leading to singular or globally regular solutions. We also analyse the localization of gravity near the brane and show that a phase transition to a regime where gravity propagates away from the brane may occur at short distances during the collapse of positive dark energy density.
