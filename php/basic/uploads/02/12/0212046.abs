Title: Axial Vector Duality in Affine NA Toda Models
Authors: J. F. Gomes and G. M. Sotkov and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: A general and systematic construction of Non Abelian affine Toda models and its symmetries is proposed in terms of its underlying Lie algebraic structure. It is also shown that such class of two dimensional integrable models naturally leads to the construction of a pair of actions related by T-duality transformations
