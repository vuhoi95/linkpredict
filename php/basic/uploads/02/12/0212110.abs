Title: Extended supersymmetry for the Bianchi-type cosmological models
Authors: J. J. Rosales and V. I. Tkach and J. Torres
Abstract: In this paper we propose a superfield description for all Bianchi-type cosmological models. The action is invariant under world-line local $n=4$ supersymmetry with $SU(2)_{local}XSU(2)_{global}$ internal symmetry. Due to the invariance of the action we obtain the constraints, which form a closed superalgebra of the $n=4$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This procedure provides the inclusion of supermatter in a sistematic way.
