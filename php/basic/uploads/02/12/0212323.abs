Title: SU(2) Reduction of Six-dimensional (1,0) Supergravity
Authors: H. Lu and C. N. Pope and E. Sezgin
Abstract: We obtain a gauged supergravity theory in three dimensions with eight real supersymmetries by means of a Scherk-Schwarz reduction of pure N=(1,0) supergravity in six dimension on the SU(2) group manifold. The SU(2) Yang-Mills fields in the model propagate, since they have an ordinary kinetic term in addition to Chern-Simons couplings. The other propagating degrees of freedom consist of a dilaton, five scalars which parameterise the coset SL(3,R)/SO(3), three vector fields in the adjoint of SU(2), and twelve spin 1/2 fermions. The model admits an AdS_3 vacuum solution. We also show how a charged black hole solution can be obtained, by performing a dimensional reduction of the rotating self-dual string of six-dimensional (1,0) supergravity.
