Title: Supersymmetric Boost on Intersecting D-branes
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We study the effect of the Born-Infeld electric field on the supersymmetric configuration of various composite D-branes. We show that the generic values of the electric field do not affect the supersymmetry but, as it approaches $1/2\pi\alpha'$ keeping the magnetic field finite, various combinations of the magnetic fields allow up to 8 supersymmetries. We also explore the unbroken supersymmetries for two intersecting D-strings which are in uniform or relative motion. For a finite uniform Lorentz boost, 16 supersymmetries are guaranteed only when they are parallel. For an infinite one, 8 supersymmetries are preserved only when both the D-strings are oriented to the forward or backward direction of the boost. Under a finite relative boost, 8 supersymmetries are preserved only when the intersecting angle is less than $\pi/2$ and the intersecting point moves at the speed of light. As for an infinite relative boost, 8 supersymmetries are preserved regardless of the values of the intersecting angle.
