Title: Three-Form Flux with N=2 Supersymmetry on AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: M. Nishimura and Y. Tanii
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence the general form of a three-form flux perturbation to the AdS_5 x S^5 solution in the type IIB supergravity which preserves N=2 supersymmetry is obtained. The arbitrary holomorphic function appearing in the N=1 case studied by Grana and Polchinski is restricted to a quadratic function of the coordinates transverse to the D3-branes.
