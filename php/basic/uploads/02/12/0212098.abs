Title: Quantum Deconstruction of a 5D SYM and its Moduli Space
Authors: Amer Iqbal and Vadim S. Kaplunovsky
Abstract: We deconstruct the fifth dimension of the 5D SYM theory with SU(M) gauge symmetry and Chern-Simons level k=M and show how the 5D moduli space follows from the non-perturbative analysis of the 4D quiver theory. The 5D coupling h=1/(g_5)^2 of the un-broken SU(M) is allowed to take any non-negative values, but it cannot be continued to h<0 and there are no transitions to other phases of the theory. The alternative UV completions of the same 5D SYM -- via M theory on the C^3/Z_2M orbifold or via the dual five-brane web in type IIB string theory -- have identical moduli spaces: h >= 0 only, and no flop transitions. We claim these are intrinsic properties of the SU(M) SYM theory with k=M.
