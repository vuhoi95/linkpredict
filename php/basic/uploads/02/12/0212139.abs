Title: Singularity Resolution in Gauged Supergravity and Conifold Unification
Authors: J. D. Edelstein and A. Paredes and A. V. Ramallo
Abstract: We obtain a unified picture for the conifold singularity resolution. We propose that gauged supergravity, through a novel prescription for the twisting, provides an appropriate framework to smooth out singularities in the context of gravity duals of supersymmetric gauge theories.
