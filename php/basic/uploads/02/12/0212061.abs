Abstract: We consider Penrose limits of the Klebanov-Strassler and Maldacena-Nunez holographic duals to N =1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. By focusing in on the IR region we obtain exactly solvable string theory models. These represent the nonrelativistic motion and low-lying excitations of heavy hadrons with mass proportional to a large global charge. We argue that these hadrons, both physically and mathematically, take the form of heavy nonrelativistic strings; we term them "annulons." A simple toy model of a string boosted along a compact circle allows us considerable insight into their properties. We also calculate the Wilson loop carrying large global charge and show the effect of confinement is quadratic, not linear, in the string tension.
