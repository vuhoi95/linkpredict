Title: Dark Energy May Probe String Theory
Authors: L. Mersini and M. Bastero-Gil
Abstract: The problem of dark energy arises due to its self-gravitating properties. Therefore explaining vacuum energy may become a question for the realm of quantum gravity, that can be addressed within string theory context. In this talk I concentrate on a recent, string-inspired model, that relies on nonlinear physics of short-distance perturbation modes, for explaining dark energy without any fine-tuning. Dark energy can be observationally probed by its equation of state, w. Different models predict different types of equations of state and string-inspired ones have a time dependent w(z) as their unique signature. Exploring the link between dark energy and string theory may provide indirect evidence for the latter, by means of precision cosmology data.
