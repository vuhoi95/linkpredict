Title: Brane-induced gravity in more than one extra dimensions: violation of  equivalence principle and ghost
Authors: S. L. Dubovsky and V. A. Rubakov
Abstract: We consider brane-induced gravity model in more than one extra dimensions, regularized by assuming that the bulk gravity is soft in ultraviolet. We study linear theory about flat multi-dimensional space-time and flat brane. We first find that this model allows for violation of equivalence between gravitational and inertial masses of brane matter. We then observe that the model has a scalar ghost field localized near the brane, as well as quasi-localized massive graviton. Pure tensor structure of four-dimensional gravity on the brane at intermediate distances is due to the cancellation between the extra polarization of the massive graviton, and the ghost. This is completely analogous to the situation in the GRS model.
