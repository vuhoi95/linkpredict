Title: On the WDVV equations in five-dimensional gauge theories
Authors: L. K. Hoevenaars and R. Martini
Abstract: It is well-known that the perturbative prepotentials of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories satisfy the generalized WDVV equations, regardless of the gauge group. In this paper we study perturbative prepotentials of the five-dimensional theories for some classical gauge groups and determine whether or not they satisfy the WDVV system.
