Title: Non-perturbative approach for the time-dependent symmetry breaking
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We present a variational method which uses a quartic exponential function as a trial wave-function to describe time-dependent quantum mechanical systems. We introduce a new physical variable $y$ which is appropriate to describe the shape of wave-packet, and calculate the effective action as a function of both the dispersion $\sqrt{< \hat{q}^2>}$ and $y$. The effective potential successfully describes the transition of the system from the false vacuum to the true vacuum. The present method well describes the long time evolution of the wave-function of the system after the symmetry breaking, which is shown in comparison with the direct numerical computations of wave-function.
