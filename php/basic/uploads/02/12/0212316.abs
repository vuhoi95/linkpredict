Title: On A-twisted moduli stack for curves from Witten's gauged linear sigma  models
Authors: Chien-Hao Liu and Kefeng Liu and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: Witten's gauged linear sigma model [Wi1] is one of the universal frameworks or structures that lie behind stringy dualities. Its A-twisted moduli space at genus 0 case has been used in the Mirror Principle [L-L-Y] that relates Gromov-Witten invariants and mirror symmetry computations. In this paper the A-twisted moduli stack for higher genus curves is defined and systematically studied. It is proved that such a moduli stack is an Artin stack. For genus 0, it has the A-twisted moduli space of [M-P] as the coarse moduli space. The detailed proof of the regularity of the collapsing morphism by Jun Li in [L-L-Y: I and II] can be viewed as a natural morphism from the moduli stack of genus 0 stable maps to the A-twisted moduli stack at genus 0. Due to the technical demand of stacks to physicists and the conceptual demand of supersymmetry to mathematicians, a brief introduction of each topic that is most relevant to the main contents of this paper is given in the beginning and the appendix respectively. Themes for further study are listed in the end.
