Title: Supersymmetric SO(N_c) Gauge Theory and Matrix Model
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: By applying the method of Dijkgraaf-Vafa, we study matrix model related to supersymmetric SO(N_c) gauge theory with N_f flavors of quarks in the vector representation found by Intriligator-Seiberg. By performing the matrix integral over tree level superpotential characterized by light meson fields (mass deformation) in electric theory, we reproduce the exact effective superpotential in the gauge theory side. Moreover, we do similar analysis in magnetic theory. It turns out the matrix descriptions of both electric and magnetic theories are the same: Seiberg duality in the gauge theory side.
