Title: Regular cosmological solutions in low energy effective action from  string theories
Authors: J. C. Fabris and R. G. Furtado and Patrick Peter and N. Pinto-Neto
Abstract: The possibility of obtaining singularity free cosmological solutions in four dimensional effective actions motivated by string theory is investigated. In these effective actions, in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, the dilatonic and the axionic fields are also considered as well as terms coming from the Ramond-Ramond sector. A radiation fluid is coupled to the field equations, which appears as a consequence of the Maxwellian terms in the Ramond-Ramond sector. Singularity free bouncing solutions in which the dilaton is finite and strictly positive are obtained for models with flat or negative curvature spatial sections when the dilatonic coupling constant is such that $\omega < - 3/2$, which may appear in the so called $F$ theory in 12 dimensions. These bouncing phases are smoothly connected to the radiation dominated expansion phase of the standard cosmological model, and the asymptotic pasts correspond to very large flat spacetimes.
