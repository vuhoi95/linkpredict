Title: Fermionic Subspaces of the Bosonic String
Authors: Auttakit Chattaraputi and Francois Englert and Laurent Houart and Anne Taormina
Abstract: A universal symmetric truncation of the bosonic string Hilbert space yields all known closed fermionic string theories in ten dimensions, their D-branes and their open descendants. We highlight the crucial role played by group theory and two-dimensional conformal field theory in the construction and emphasize the predictive power of the truncation. Such circumstantial evidence points towards the existence of a mechanism which generates space-time fermions out of bosons dynamically within the framework of bosonic string theory.
