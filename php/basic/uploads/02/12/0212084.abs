Title: K-matrices for 2D conformal field theories
Authors: E. Ardonne and P. Bouwknegt and P. Dawson
Abstract: In this paper we examine fermionic type characters (Universal Chiral Partition Functions) for general 2D conformal field theories with a bilinear form given by a matrix of the form K \oplus K^{-1}. We provide various techniques for determining these K-matrices, and apply these to a variety of examples including (higher level) WZW and coset conformal field theories. Applications of our results to fractional quantum Hall systems and (level restricted) Kostka polynomials are discussed.
