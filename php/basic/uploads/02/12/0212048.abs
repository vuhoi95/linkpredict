Title: More about the Standard Model at Intersecting Branes
Authors: D. Cremades and L. E. Ibanez and F. Marchesano
Abstract: Intersecting D-brane models seem to be one of the most promising avenues to embed the Standard Model physics within the string context. We review here different aspects of these models. Topics include the question of SUSY and quasi-SUSY in intersecting brane models, model-building, the brane recombination interpretation of the SM Higgs mechanism, Yukawa couplings, the lowering of the string scale and possible new Z's accessible to accelerators.
