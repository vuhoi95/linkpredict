Title: Vacuum Photon Splitting in Lorentz-Violating Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Austin Pickering
Abstract: Radiative corrections arising from Lorentz violation in the fermion sector induce a nonzero amplitude for vacuum photon splitting. At one loop, the on-shell amplitude acquires both CPT-even and CPT-odd contributions forbidden in conventional electrodynamics.
