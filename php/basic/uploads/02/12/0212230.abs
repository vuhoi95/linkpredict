Title: Critical Temperature of the Deconfining Phase Transition in (2+1)d  Georgi-Glashow Model
Authors: Yuri V. Kovchegov and D. T. Son
Abstract: We find the temperature of the phase transition in the (2+1)d Georgi-Glashow model. The critical temperature is shown to depend on the gauge coupling and on the ratio of Higgs and gauge boson masses. In the BPS limit of light Higgs the previous result by Dunne, Kogan, Kovner, and Tekin is reproduced.
