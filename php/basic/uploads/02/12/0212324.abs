Title: New strings with world-sheet supersymmetry
Authors: A. Nichols and R. Manvelyan and G. Savvidy
Abstract: We suggest a new model of string theory with world-sheet supersymmetry. It possesses an additional global fermionic symmetry which is similar in many ways to BRST symmetry. The spectrum consists of massless states of Rarita-Schwinger fields describing infinite tower of half-integer spins.
