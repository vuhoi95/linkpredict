Title: Derivative corrections in 10-dimensional super-Maxwell theory
Authors: Andres Collinucci and Mees de Roo and Martijn G. C. Eenink
Abstract: We construct the supersymmetric effective action at order alpha'^4 of the abelian open superstring. It includes the alpha'^4 terms in the abelian Born-Infeld action, and in particular the leading derivative correction of the form d^4F^4. Besides linear supersymmetry this sector of the open string effective action also has a nonlinear supersymmetry. The terms d^4F^4 and their fermionic partners have an arbitrary coefficient, and we discuss the possible fate of such coefficients when higher orders in alpha' are included.
