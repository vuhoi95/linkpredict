Title: Noncommutative Nonlinear Supersymmetry
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present noncommutative nonlinear supersymmetric theories. The first example is a non-polynomial Akulov-Volkov-type lagrangian with noncommutative nonlinear global supersymmetry in arbitrary space-time dimensions. The second example is the generalization of this lagrangian to Dirac-Born-Infeld lagrangian with nonlinear supersymmetry realized in dimensions D=2,3,4, 6 and 10.
