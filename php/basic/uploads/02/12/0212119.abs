Title: Asymmetric Cosets
Authors: Thomas Quella and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a general theory of coset models G/H in which different left and right actions of H on G are gauged. Our main results include a formula for their modular invariant partition function, the construction of a large set of boundary states and a general description of the corresponding brane geometries. The paper concludes with some explicit applications to the base of the conifold and to the time-dependent Nappi-Witten background.
