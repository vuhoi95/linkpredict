Title: Non-minimally Coupled Tachyon and Inflation
Authors: Yun-Song Piao and Qing-Guo Huang and Xinmin Zhang and Yuan-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a model of tachyon with a non-minimal coupling to gravity and study its cosmological effects. Regarding inflation we will show that for a specific coupling of tachyon to gravity this model satisfies observations and solves various problems which exist in the single and multi tachyon inflation models.
