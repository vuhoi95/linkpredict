Title: Commutative and noncommutative N=2 SYM in 2+1 from wrapped D6-branes
Authors: Jan Brugues and Joaquim Gomis and Toni Mateos and Toni Ramirez
Abstract: We give the supergravity duals of commutative and noncommutative non-abelian gauge theories with N=2 in 2+1 dimensions. The moduli space on the Coulomb branch of these theories is studied using supergravity.
