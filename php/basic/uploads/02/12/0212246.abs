Title: Quasiparticle picture of black holes and the entropy--area relation
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We propose an effective description of 0-brane black holes, in which the black hole is modeled as a gas of non-interacting quasi-particles in the dual quantum mechanics. This simple model is shown to account for many of the static thermodynamic properties of the black hole. It also accounts for dynamical properties, such as the rate at which energy gets thermalized by the black hole. We use the model to show that the entropy of the quantum mechanics is proportional to the black hole horizon area in Planck units.
