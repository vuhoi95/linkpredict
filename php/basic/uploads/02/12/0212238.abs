Title: Noncommutative Synchrotron
Authors: P. Castorina and A. Iorio and D. Zappala
Abstract: We study the departures from the classical synchrotron radiation due to noncommutativity of coordinates. We find that these departures are significant, but do not give tight bounds on the magnitude of the noncommutative parameter. On the other hand, these results could be used in future investigations in this direction. We also find an acausal behavior for the electromagnetic field due to the presence in the theory of two different speeds of light. This effect naturally arises even if only \theta^{12} is different from zero.
