Title: Supertubes and special holonomy
Authors: Nicolás E. Grandi and Adrián R. Lugo
Abstract: We obtain a $\frac 14$-supersymmetric 6-brane solution of IIA Supergravity by T-dualizing the supertube recently found. The resulting $C_{\it 1}$ electric charge is related to the original $D0$-brane charge. The uplifted solution to eleven dimensions results to be a purely geometrical configuration, which can be interpreted as a bound state of a Taub-NUT space and a pp-wave. Being the non trivial part of the metric pseudo-Riemannian, the resulting reduced holonomy group is non-compact and locally isomorphic to a semidirect product of an Abelian four dimensional group and SU(2).
