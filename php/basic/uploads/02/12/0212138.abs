Title: A universal result on central charges in the presence of double-trace  deformations
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Igor R. Klebanov
Abstract: We study large N conformal field theories perturbed by relevant double-trace deformations. Using the auxiliary field trick, or Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we show that in the infrared the theory flows to another CFT. The generating functionals of planar correlators in the ultraviolet and infrared CFT's are shown to be related by a Legendre transform. Our main result is a universal expression for the difference of the scale anomalies between the ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, which is of order 1 in the large N expansion. Our computations are entirely field theoretic, and the results are shown to agree with predictions from AdS/CFT. We also remark that a certain two-point function can be computed for all energy scales on both sides of the duality, with full agreement between the two and no scheme dependence.
