Title: Comments on the Hydrogen Atom Spectrum in the Noncommutative Space
Authors: M. Chaichian and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and A. Tureanu
Abstract: There has been disagreement in the literature on whether the hydrogen atom spectrum receives any tree-level correction due to noncommutativity. Here we shall clarify the issue and show that indeed a general argument on the structure of proton as a nonelementary particle leads to the appearance of such corrections. As a showcase, we evaluate the corrections in a simple nonrelativistic quark model with a result in agreement with the previous one we had obtained by considering the electron moving in the external electric field of proton. Thus the previously obtained bound on the noncommutativity parameter, $\theta < (10^4 GeV)^{-2}$, using the Lamb shift data, remains valid.
