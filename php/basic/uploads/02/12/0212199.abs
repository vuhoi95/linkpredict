Title: Calculable Corrections to Brane Black Hole Decay II: Greybody Factors  for Spin 1/2 and 1
Authors: Panagiota Kanti and John March-Russell
Abstract: The production of black holes in extra-dimensional brane-world theories can lead to detectable signals via the Hawking evaporation of the black hole to brane-localised Standard Model modes. We calculate, as a function of partial wave number and number of toroidally compactified extra dimensions, the leading correction to the energy spectrum of such Hawking radiation (the greybody factors) for decay into spin 1/2 fermions and spin 1 gauge fields localised on the Standard Model brane. We derive the associated improved differential emission rates for both types of fields. We provide both simple expressions for the leading behavior of the greybody factors in the low-energy limit $\om r_H \ll 1$, and numerical evaluation of our full analytic expressions for the emission rates, valid for $\om r_H \sim 1$. The full analytic expressions demonstrate that both the greybody factors and emission rates are enhanced as the number of extra dimensions increases.
