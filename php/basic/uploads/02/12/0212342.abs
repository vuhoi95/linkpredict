Title: On the third level descendent fields in the Bullough-Dodd model and its  reductions
Authors: P. Baseilhac and M. Stanishkov
Abstract: Exact vacuum expectation values of the third level descendent fields $<(\partial\phi)^3({\bar\partial}\phi)^3e^{a\phi}>$ in the Bullough-Dodd model are proposed. By performing quantum group restrictions, we obtain $<L_{-3}{\bar L}_{-3}{\Phi}_{lk}>$ in perturbed minimal conformal field theories.
