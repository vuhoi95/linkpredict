Title: On the energy-momentum tensor in non-commutative gauge theories
Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study the properties of the energy-momentum tensor in non-commutative gauge theories by coupling them to a weak external gravitational field. In particular, we show that the stress tensor of such a theory coincides exactly with that derived from a theory where a Seiberg-Witten map has been implemented (namely, the procedure is commutative). Various other interesting features are also discussed.
