Title: Graviton oscillations in the two-brane world
Authors: Andrei Barvinsky and Alexander Kamenshchik and Claus Kiefer and Andreas Rathke
Abstract: We study the braneworld effective action in the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model. In the framework of this essentially-nonlocal action we reveal the origin of an infinite sequence of gravitational wave modes -- the usual massless one as well as the tower of Kaluza-Klein massive ones. Mixing of the modes, which parametrically depends on the background value of the modulus of the extra dimension, can be interpreted as radion-induced gravitational-wave oscillations, a classical analogue to meson and neutrino oscillations. We show that these oscillations arising in M-theory-inspired braneworld setups could lead to effects detectable by gravitational-wave interferometers.
