Title: New Supergravity Solutions for Branes in AdS_3 x S^3
Authors: Jason Kumar and Arvind Rajaraman
Abstract: We find explicit supergravity solutions which describe branes in the AdS_3 x S^3 background. These solutions preserve 8 of the 16 supersymmetries of this background, and are consistent with kappa-symmetry. These represent new 1/2-BPS states of string theory.
