Title: The Elliptic Solutions to the Friedmann equation and the Verlinde's Maps
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and L. Alejandro Correa-Borbonet
Abstract: We considered the solutions of the Friedmann equation in several setups, arguing that the Weierstra$\ss$ form of the solutions leads to connections with some Conformal Field Theory on a torus. Thus a link with the Cardy entropy formula is obtained in a quite natural way. The argument is shown to be valid in a four dimensional radiation dominated universe with a cosmological constant as well as in four further different Universes.
