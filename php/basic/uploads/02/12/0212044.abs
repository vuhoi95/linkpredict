Title: Note on a Closed String Field Theory from Bosonic IIB Matrix Model
Authors: Daiji Ennyu and Hiroshi Kawabe and Naohito Nakazawa
Abstract: We apply stochastic quantization method to the bosonic part of IIB matrix model, i.e., a naive zero volume limit of large N Yang-Mills theory, to construct a collective field theory of Wilson loops. The Langevin equation for Wilson loops can be interpreted as the time evolution of closed string fields. The corresponding Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces a closed string field theory which describes interacting Wilson loops with manifest Lorentz invariance.
