Title: AdS_2/CFT_1, Canonical Transformations and Superconformal Mechanics
Authors: S. Bellucci and A. Galajinsky and E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos
Abstract: We propose a simple conformal mechanics model which is classically equivalent to a charged massive particle propagating near the AdS_2\times S^2 horizon of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. The equivalence holds for any finite value of the black hole mass and with both the radial and angular degrees of freedom of the particle taken into account. It is ensured by the existence of a canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian formalism. Using this transformation, we construct the Hamiltonian of a N=4 superparticle on AdS_2\times S^2 background.
