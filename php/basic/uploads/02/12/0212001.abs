Title: Diffeomorphisms and spin foam models
Authors: Laurent Freidel and David Louapre
Abstract: We study the action of diffeomorphisms on spin foam models. We prove that in 3 dimensions, there is a residual action of the diffeomorphisms that explains the naive divergences of state sum models. We present the gauge fixing of this symmetry and show that it explains the original renormalization of Ponzano-Regge model. We discuss the implication this action of diffeomorphisms has on higher dimensional spin foam models and especially the finite ones.
