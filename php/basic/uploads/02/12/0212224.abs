Title: Clockwork SUSY: Supersymmetric Ward and Slavnov-Taylor Identities At  Work in Green's Functions and Scattering Amplitudes
Authors: Thorsten Ohl and Juergen Reuter
Abstract: We study the cancellations among Feynman diagrams that implement the Ward and Slavnov-Taylor identities corresponding to the conserved supersymmetry current in supersymmetric quantum field theories. In particular, we show that the Faddeev-Popov ghosts of gauge- and supersymmetries never decouple from the physical fields, even for abelian gauge groups. The supersymmetric Slavnov-Taylor identities provide efficient consistency checks for automatized calculations and can verify the supersymmetry of Feynman rules and the numerical stability of phenomenological predictions simultaneously.
