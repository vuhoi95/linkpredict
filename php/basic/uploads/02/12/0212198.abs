Title: Cosmology with tachyon field as dark energy
Authors: J. S. Bagla and H. K. Jassal and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: We present a detailed study of cosmological effects of homogeneous tachyon matter coexisting with non-relativistic matter and radiation, concentrating on the inverse square potential and the exponential potential for the tachyonic scalar field. A distinguishing feature of these models (compared to other cosmological models) is that the matter density parameter and the density parameter for tachyons remain comparable even in the matter dominated phase. For the exponential potential, the solutions have an accelerating phase, followed by a phase with a(t) ~ t^{2/3} as t goes to infinity. This eliminates the future event horizon present in LCDM models and is an attractive feature from the string theory perspective. A comparison with supernova Ia data shows that for both the potentials there exists a range of models in which the universe undergoes an accelerated expansion at low redshifts and are also consistent with requirements of structure formation. They do require fine tuning of parameters but not any more than in the case of LCDM or quintessence models.
