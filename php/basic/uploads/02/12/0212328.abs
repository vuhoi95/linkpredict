Title: ADHMN boundary conditions from removing monopoles
Authors: Xingang Chen and Erick J. Weinberg
Abstract: Boundary conditions play an important role in the ADHMN construction of BPS monopole solutions. In this paper we show how different types of boundary conditions can be related to each other by removing monopoles to spatial infinity. In particular, we use this method to show how the jumping data naturally emerge. The results can be interpreted in the D-brane picture and provide a better understanding of the derivation of the ADHMN construction from D-branes. We comment briefly on the cases with non-Abelian unbroken symmetry and massless monopoles.
