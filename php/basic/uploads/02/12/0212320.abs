Title: Hall Effect on Noncommutative Phase Space
Authors: Akira Kokado and Takashi Okamura and Takesi Saito
Abstract: When phase space coordinates are noncommutative, especially including arbitrarily noncommutative momenta, the Hall effect is reinvestigated. A minimally gauge-invariant coupling of electromagnetic field is introduced by making use of Faddeev-Jackiw formulation for unconstrained and constrained systems. We find that the parameter of noncommutative momenta makes an important contribution to the Hall conductivity.
