Title: Post-inflationary thermalization with hadronization scenario
Authors: Prashanth Jaikumar and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We study thermalization of the early Universe when the inflaton can decay into the Standard Model (SM) quarks and gluons, using QCD arguments. We describe the possible formation of the thermal plasma of soft gluons and quarks well before the completion of reheating. Relevant interaction rates of leading order processes and the corresponding thermalization time scale is presented. We discuss hadronization while thermalizing the decay products of the inflaton, when the reheat temperature of the Universe is below the QCD phase transition but above the temperature of the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
