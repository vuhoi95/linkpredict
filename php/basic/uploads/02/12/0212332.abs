Title: Stable Neutral Fermi Ball
Authors: K. Ogure and T. Yoshida and J. Arafune
Abstract: Fermi Ball is a kind of nontopological soliton with fermions trapped in its domain wall, and is suggested to arises from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the approximate $Z_2$ symmetry in the early universe. We find that the neutral thin-wall Fermi Ball is stable in the limited region of the scalar self-coupling constant $\lambda$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $G$. We find that the Fermi Ball is stabilized due to the curvature effect of the domain wall caused by the fermion sector. We also discuss whether such stable Fermi Balls may contribute to the cold dark matter.
