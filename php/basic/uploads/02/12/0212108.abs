Title: Rotating black holes at future colliders: Greybody factors for brane  fields
Authors: Daisuke Ida and Kin-ya Oda and Seong Chan Park
Abstract: We study theoretical aspects of the rotating black hole production and evaporation in the extra dimension scenarios with TeV scale gravity, within the mass range in which the higher dimensional Kerr solution provides good description. We evaluate the production cross section of black holes taking their angular momenta into account. We find that it becomes larger than the Schwarzschild radius squared, which is conventionally utilized in literature, and our result nicely agrees with the recent numerical study by Yoshino and Nambu within a few percent error for higher dimensional case. In the same approximation to obtain the above result, we find that the production cross section becomes larger for the black hole with larger angular momentum. Second, we derive the generalized Teukolsky equation for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 brane fields in the higher dimensional Kerr geometry and explicitly show that it is separable in any dimensions. For five-dimensional (Randall-Sundrum) black hole, we obtain analytic formulae for the greybody factors in low frequency expansion and we present the power spectra of the Hawking radiation as well as their angular dependence. Phenomenological implications of our result are briefly sketched.
