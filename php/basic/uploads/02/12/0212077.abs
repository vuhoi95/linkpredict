Title: Spectra of Length and Area in 2+1 Lorentzian Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Laurent Freidel and Etera R. Livine and Carlo Rovelli
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the length and area operators in Lorentzian loop quantum gravity, in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. We find that the spectrum of spacelike intervals is continuous, whereas the spectrum of timelike intervals is discrete. This result contradicts the expectation that spacelike intervals are always discrete. On the other hand, it is consistent with the results of the spin foam quantization of the same theory.
