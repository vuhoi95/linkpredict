Title: Courant Algebroids
Authors: Paul Bressler and Alexander Chervov
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying some properties of the Courant algebroids: we explain the so-called "conducting bundle construction" and use it to attach the Courant algebroid to Dixmier-Douady gerbe (following ideas of P. Severa). We remark that WZNW-Poisson condition of Klimcik and Strobl (math.SG/0104189) is the same as Dirac structure in some particular Courant algebroid. We propose the construction of the Lie algebroid on the loop space starting from the Lie algebroid on the manifold and conjecture that this construction applied to the Dirac structure above should give the Lie algebroid of symmetries in the WZNW-Poisson $\sigma$-model, we show that it is indeed true in the particular case of Poisson $\sigma$-model.
