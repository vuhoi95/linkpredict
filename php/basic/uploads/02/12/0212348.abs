Title: Unification in 5D SO(10)
Authors: Hyung Do Kim and Stuart Raby
Abstract: Gauge unification in a five dimensional supersymmetric SO(10) model compactified on an orbifold $S^1/(Z_2 \times Z_2^{\prime})$ is studied. One orbifolding reduces N=2 supersymmetry to N=1, and the other breaks SO(10) to the Pati-Salam gauge group $\ps$. Further breaking to the standard model gauge group is made through the Higgs mechanism on one of the branes. The differences of the three gauge couplings run logarithmically even in five dimensions and we can keep the predictability for unification as in four dimensional gauge theories. We obtain an excellent prediction for gauge coupling unification with a cutoff scale $M_* \sim 3 \times 10^{17}$ GeV and a compactification scale $M_c \sim 1.5 \times 10^{14}$ GeV. Finally, although proton decay due to dimension 5 operators may be completely eliminated, the proton decay rate in these models is sensitive to the placement of matter multiplets in the 5th dimension, as well as to the unknown physics above the cutoff scale.
