Title: Large Gauge Invariance in NonAbelian Finite Temperature Effective  Actions
Authors: S. Deser and L. Griguolo and D. Seminara
Abstract: We analyze large gauge invariance in combined nonabelian and thermal QFT and their physical consequences for D=3 effective actions. After briefly reviewing the structure of bundles and large gauge transformations that arise in non-simply connected 3-manifolds and gauge groups, we discuss their connections to Chern-Simons terms and Wilson-Polyakov loops. We then provide an invariant characterization of the ``abelian'' fluxes encountered in explicit computations of finite temperature effective actions. In particular we relate, and provide explicit realizations of, these fluxes to a topological index that measures the obstruction to global diagonalization of the loops around compactified time. We also explore the fate of, and exhibit some everywhere smooth, large transformations for non-vanishing index in various topologies.
