Title: Open strings in the plane wave background II: Superalgebras and Spectra
Authors: Kostas Skenderis and Marika Taylor
Abstract: In hep-th/0211011 we started a systematic investigation of open strings in the plane wave background. In this paper we continue the analysis by discussing the superalgebras of conserved charges, the spectra of open strings, and the spectra of DBI fluctuations around D-brane embeddings. We also derive the gluing conditions for corresponding boundary states and analyze their symmetries. All results are consistent with each other, and confirm the existence of additional supersymmetries as previously discussed. We further show that for every symmetry current one can construct a (countably) infinite number of related currents that contain more worldsheet derivatives, and discuss non-local symmetries.
