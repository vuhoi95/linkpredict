Title: A Closed Integral Form for the Background Gauge Connection
Authors: Emmanuel T. Rodulfo and Joseph Ambrose G. Pagaran
Abstract: By the appropriate use of the Fock-Schwinger gauge properties, we derive the closed integral form of the `point-split' non-local background gauge connection originally expressed as a finite sum. This is achieved in the limit when the finite sum becomes infinite. With this closed integral form of the connection, we obtain the same exact results in the calculation of one-loop effective Lagrangian accommodating arbitrary orders of covariant field derivatives in quantum field theory of arbitrary spacetime dimensions and of arbitrary gauge group. Particularly, we display the one-loop effective Lagrangian for real boson fields up to 8 mass dimensions-the same result obtained when the connection was yet in the finite sum form.
