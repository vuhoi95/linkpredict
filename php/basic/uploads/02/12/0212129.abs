Title: Invariance quantum group of the fermionic oscillator
Authors: M. Arik and S. Gun and A. Yildiz
Abstract: The fermionic oscillator defined by the algebraic relations cc^*+c^*c=1 and c^{2}=0 admits the homogeneous group O(2) as its invariance group. We show that, the structure of the inhomogeneous invariance group of this oscillator is a quantum group.
