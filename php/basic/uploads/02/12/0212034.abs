Title: Algebra of chiral currents on the physical surface
Authors: Alexis Amezaga and Carlos Leiva
Abstract: Using a particular structure for the Lagrangian action in a one-dimensional Thirring model and performing the Dirac's procedure, we are able to obtain the algebra for chiral currents which is entirely defied on the constraint surface in the corresponding hamiltonian description of the theory.
