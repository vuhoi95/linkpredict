Title: Field-theory results for three-dimensional transitions with complex  symmetries
Authors: Pasquale Calabrese and Andrea Pelissetto and Paolo Rossi and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We discuss several examples of three-dimensional critical phenomena that can be described by Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theories. We present an overview of field-theoretical results obtained from the analysis of high-order perturbative series in the frameworks of the $\epsilon$ and of the fixed-dimension d=3 expansions. In particular, we discuss the stability of the O(N)-symmetric fixed point in a generic N-component theory, the critical behaviors of randomly dilute Ising-like systems and frustrated spin systems with noncollinear order, the multicritical behavior arising from the competition of two distinct types of ordering with symmetry O($n_1$) and O($n_2$) respectively.
