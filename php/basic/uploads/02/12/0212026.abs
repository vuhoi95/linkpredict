Title: Second order SUSY transformations with `complex energies'
Authors: David J. Fernandez C. and Rodrigo Munoz and Arturo Ramos
Abstract: Second order supersymmetry transformations which involve a pair of complex conjugate factorization energies and lead to real non-singular potentials are analyzed. The generation of complex potentials with real spectra is also studied. The theory is applied to the free particle, one-soliton well and one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
