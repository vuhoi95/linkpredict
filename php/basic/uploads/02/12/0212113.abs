Title: Multi-graviton theory, a latticized dimension, and the cosmological  constant
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: Beginning with the Pauli-Fierz theory, we construct a model for multi-graviton theory. Couplings between gravitons belonging to nearest-neighbor ``theory spaces'' lead to a discrete mass spectrum. Our model coincides with the Kaluza-Klein theory whose fifth dimension is latticized. We evaluate one-loop vacuum energy in models with a circular latticized extra dimension as well as with compact continuous dimensions. We find that the vacuum energy can take a positive value, if the dimension of the continuous space time is $6, 10,...$. Moreover, since the amount of the vacuum energy can be an arbitrary small value according to the choice of parameters in the model, our models is useful to explain the small positive dark energy in the present universe.
