Title: Braneworld reheating in the bulk inflaton model
Authors: Yoshiaki Himemoto and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: In the context of the braneworld inflation driven by a bulk scalar field, we study the energy dissipation from the bulk scalar field into the matter on the brane in order to understand the reheating after inflation. Deriving the late-time behavior of the bulk field with dissipation by using the Green's function method, we give a rigorous justification of the statement that the standard reheating process is reproduced in this bulk inflaton model as long as the Hubble parameter on the brane and the mass of the bulk scalar field are much smaller than the 5-dimensional inverse curvature scale. Our result supports the idea that the brane inflation model caused by a bulk scalar field is expected to be a viable alternative scenario of the early universe.
