Title: Exact N=2 Supergravity Solutions With Polarized Branes
Authors: Iosif Bena and Calin Ciocarlie
Abstract: We construct several classes of exact supersymmetric supergravity solutions describing D4 branes polarized into NS5 branes and F-strings polarized into D2 branes. These setups belong to the same universality class as the perturbative solutions used by Polchinski and Strassler to describe the string dual of N=1* theories. The D4-NS5 setup can be interpreted as a string dual to a confining 4+1 dimensional theory with 8 supercharges, whose properties we discuss. By T-duality, our solutions give Type IIB supersymmetric backgrounds with polarized branes.
