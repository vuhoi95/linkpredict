Title: Varying Fine Structure Constant and Black Hole Physics
Authors: Saurya Das and Gabor Kunstatter
Abstract: Recent astrophysical observations suggest that the value of fine structure constant $\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ may be slowly increasing with time. This may be due to an increase of $e$ or a decrease of $c$, or both. In this article, we argue from model independent considerations that this variation should be considered adiabatic. Then, we examine in detail the consequences of such an adiabatic variation in the context of a specific model of quantized charged black holes. We find that the second law of black hole thermodynamics is obeyed, regardless of the origin of the variation, and that interesting constraints arise on the charge and mass of black holes. Finally, we estimate the work done on a black hole of mass $M$ due to the proposed $\alpha$ variation.
