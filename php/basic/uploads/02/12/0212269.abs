Abstract: In the context of the brane-world scenarios with compactified large extra dimensions, we study the production of the possible massive brane oscillations (branons) in electron-positron colliders. We compute their contribution to the electroweak gauge bosons decay width and to the single-photon and single-Z processes. With LEP-I results and assuming non observation at LEP-II, we present exclusion plots for the brane tension $\tau = f^4$ and the branon mass $M$. Prospects for the next generation of electron-positron colliders are also considered.
