Title: Supersymmetry in quantum mechanics with point interactions
Authors: Tomoaki Nagasawa and Makoto Sakamoto and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We investigate supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics with point interactions. We clarify a class of point interactions compatible with supersymmetry and present N=2 supersymmetric models on a circle with two point interactions as well as a superpotential. A hidden su(2) structure inherent in the system plays a crucial role to construct the N=2 supercharges. Spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry due to point interactions and an extension to higher N-extended supersymmetry are also discussed.
