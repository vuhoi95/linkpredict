Title: From Dynamical to Numerical R-Matrices: A Case Study for the Calogero  Models
Authors: Michael Forger and Axel Winterhalder
Abstract: Within the class of integrable Calogero models associated with (semi-)simple Lie algebras and with symmetric pairs of Lie algebras identified in a previous paper, we analyze whether and to what extent it is possible to find a gauge transformation that takes the traditional Lax pair with its dynamical R-matrix to a new Lax pair with a numerical R-matrix.
