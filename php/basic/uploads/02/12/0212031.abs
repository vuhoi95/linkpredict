Title: The physical graviton two-point function in de Sitter spacetime with S^3  spatial sections
Authors: Atsushi Higuchi and Richard H. Weeks
Abstract: We compute the physical graviton two-point function in de Sitter spacetime with three-sphere spatial sections. We demonstrate that the large-distance growth present in the corresponding two-point function in spatially flat de Sitter spacetime is absent. We verify that our two-point function agrees with that in Minkowski spacetime in the zero cosmological constant limit.
