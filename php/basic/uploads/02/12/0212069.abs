Title: The Accelerated Universe and the Moon
Authors: Gia Dvali and Andrei Gruzinov and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: Cosmologically motivated theories that explain small acceleration rate of the Universe via modification of gravity at very large, horizon or super-horizon distances, can be tested by precision gravitational measurements at much shorter scales, such as the Earth-Moon distance. Contrary to the naive expectation the predicted corrections to the Einsteinian metric near gravitating sources are so significant that fall within sensitivity of the proposed Lunar Ranging experiments. The key reason for such corrections is the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity present in linearized versions of all such theories, and its subsequent absence at the non-linear level ala Vainshtein.
