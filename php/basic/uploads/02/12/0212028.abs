Title: Grand Unification in RS1
Authors: Kaustubh Agashe and Antonio Delgado and Raman Sundrum
Abstract: We study unification in the Randall-Sundrum scenario for solving the hierarchy problem, with gauge fields and fermions in the bulk. We calculate the one-loop corrected low-energy effective gauge couplings in a unified theory, broken at the scale M_GUT in the bulk. We find that, although this scenario has an extra dimension, there is a robust (calculable in the effective field theory) logarithmic dependence on M_GUT, strongly suggestive of high-scale unification, very much as in the (4D) Standard Model. Moreover, bulk threshold effects are naturally small, but volume-enhanced, so that we can accommodate the measured gauge couplings. We show in detail how excessive proton decay is forbidden by an extra U(1) bulk gauge symmetry. This mechanism requires us to further break the unified group using boundary conditions. A 4D dual interpretation, in the sense of the AdS/CFT correspondence, is provided for all our results. Our results show that an attractive unification mechanism can combine with a non-supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem.
