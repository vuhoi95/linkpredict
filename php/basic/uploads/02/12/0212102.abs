Title: Gauge symmetry and cosmological constant on a brane
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Nobuhiro Uekusa
Abstract: We have examined the localization of gauge bosons on the three-brane embedded in 5D bulk space-time, and we find two kinds of branes on which both graviton and gauge bosons can be trapped. One is the dS brane with a positive cosmological constant, and the other is the one with zero cosmological constant or 4D Minkowski brane. Then, which brane is realized would depend on the observation of the cosmological constant of our world.
