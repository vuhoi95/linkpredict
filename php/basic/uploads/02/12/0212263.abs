Title: Flop Transitions in M-theory Cosmology
Authors: Matthias Brandle and Andre Lukas
Abstract: We study flop-transitions for M-theory on Calabi-Yau three-folds and their applications to cosmology in the context of the effective five-dimensional supergravity theory. In particular, the additional hypermultiplet which becomes massless at the transition is included in the effective action. We find the potential for this hypermultiplet which includes quadratic and quartic terms as well as additional dependence on the Kahler moduli. By constructing explicit cosmological solutions, it is demonstrated that a flop-transition can indeed by achieved dynamically, as long as the hypermultiplet is set to zero. Once excitations of the hypermultiplet are taken into account we find that the transition is generically not completed but the system is stabilised close to the transition region. Regions of moduli space close to flop-transitions can, therefore, be viewed as preferred by the cosmological evolution.
