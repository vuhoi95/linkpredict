Title: An effective Hamiltonian for 2D black hole Physics
Authors: D. G. Delfrate and F. P. Devecchi and D. F. Marchioro
Abstract: In another application of the methods of Henneaux, Teitelboim, and Vergara developed for diffeomorphisms invariant models, the CGHS theory of 2D black holes is focused in order to obtain the true degrees of freedom, the simplectic structure and the {\it effective} Hamiltonian that rules the dynamics in reduced phase-space.
