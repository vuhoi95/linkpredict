Title: Solving String Field Equations: New Uses for Old Tools
Authors: Alexander Kling and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexander D. Popov and Sebastian Uhlmann
Abstract: It is argued that the (NS-sector) superstring field equations are integrable, i.e. their solutions are obtainable from linear equations. We adapt the 25-year-old solution-generating "dressing" method and reduce the construction of nonperturbative superstring configurations to a specific cohomology problem. The application to vacuum superstring field theory is outlined.
