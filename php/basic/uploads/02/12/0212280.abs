Title: Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory - II. Relativistic Resonances from  S-Matrix Poles
Authors: A. Bohm and H. Kaldass and S. Wickramasekara
Abstract: Relativistic resonances and decaying states are described by representations of Poincar\'e transformations, similar to Wigner's definition of stable particles. To associate decaying state vectors to resonance poles of the $S$-matrix, the conventional Hilbert space assumption (or asymptotic completeness) is replaced by a new hypothesis that associates different dense Hardy subspaces to the in- and out-scattering states. Then one can separate the scattering amplitude into a background amplitude and one or several ``relativistic Breit-Wigner'' amplitudes, which represent the resonances per se. These Breit-Wigner amplitudes have a precisely defined lineshape and are associated to exponentially decaying Gamow vectors which furnish the irreducible representation spaces of causal Poincar\'e transformations into the forward light cone.
