Authors: J. G. KÃ¶rner and Chun Liu
Abstract: A supersymmetric model with two copies of the Standard Model gauge groups is constructed in the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario. The supersymmetry breaking messengers are in a simple form. The Standard Model is obtained after first step gauge symmetry breaking. In the case of one copy of the gauge interactions being strong, a scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking is discussed, and the gauginos are generally predicted to be heavier than the sfermions.
