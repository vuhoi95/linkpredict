Abstract: We construct globally regular as well as non-abelian black hole solutions of a higher order curvature Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) model in $d=5$ dimensions. This model consists of the superposition of the first two members of the gravitational hierarchy (Einstein plus first Gauss-Bonnet(GB)) interacting with the superposition of the first two members of the $SO(d)$ Yang--Mills hierarchy.
