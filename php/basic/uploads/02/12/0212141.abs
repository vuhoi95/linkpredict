Title: Gauged extended supergravity without cosmological constant: no-scale  structure and supersymmetry breaking
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: We consider the interplay of duality symmetries and gauged isometries of supergravity models giving N-extended, spontaneously broken supergravity with a no-scale structure. Some examples, motivated by superstring and M-theory compactifications are described.
