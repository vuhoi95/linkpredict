Title: A Conjecture about Hadrons
Authors: Silas R. Beane and Martin J. Savage
Abstract: We conjecture that in the chiral limit of QCD the spectrum of hadrons is comprised of decoupled, reducible chiral multiplets. A simple rule is developed which identifies the chiral representations filled out by the ground-state hadrons. Our arguments are based on the algebraic structure of superconvergence relations derived by Weinberg from the high-energy behavior of pion-hadron scattering amplitudes.
