Title: Improved Epstein-Glaser Renormalization II. Lorentz invariant framework
Authors: J. M. Gracia-Bondia and S. Lazzarini
Abstract: The Epstein--Glaser type T-subtraction introduced by one of the authors in a previous paper is extended to the Lorentz invariant framework. The advantage of using our subtraction instead of Epstein and Glaser's standard W-subtraction method is especially important when working in Minkowski space, as then the counterterms necessary to keep Lorentz invariance are simplified. We show how T-renormalization of primitive diagrams in the Lorentz invariant framework directly relates to causal Riesz distributions. A covariant subtraction rule in momentum space is found, sharply improving upon the BPHZL method for massless theories.
