Title: Octonionic M-theory and D=11 generalized conformal and superconformal  algebras
Authors: Jerzy Lukierski and Francesco Toppan
Abstract: Following [1] we further apply the octonionic structure to supersymmetric D=11 $M$-theory. We consider the octonionic $2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1}$ Dirac matrices describing the sequence of Clifford algebras with signatures ($9+n,n$) ($n=0,1,2, ...$) and derive the identities following from the octonionic multiplication table. The case $n=1$ ($4\times 4$ octonion-valued matrices) is used for the description of the D=11 octonionic $M$ superalgebra with 52 real bosonic charges; the $n=2$ case ($8 \times 8$ octonion-valued matrices) for the D=11 conformal $M$ algebra with 232 real bosonic charges. The octonionic structure is described explicitly for $n=1$ by the relations between the 528 Abelian O(10,1) tensorial charges $Z_\mu Z_{\mu\nu}, Z_{\mu \gt... \mu_5}$ of the $M$-superalgebra. For $n=2$ we obtain 2080 real non-Abelian bosonic tensorial charges $Z_{\mu\nu}, Z_{\mu_1 \mu_2 \mu_3}, Z_{\mu_1 ... \mu_6}$ which, suitably constrained describe the generalized D=11 octonionic conformal algebra. Further, we consider the supersymmetric extension of this octonionic conformal algebra which can be described as D=11 octonionic superconformal algebra with a total number of 64 real fermionic and 239 real bosonic generators.
