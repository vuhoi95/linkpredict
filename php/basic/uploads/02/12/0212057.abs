Title: Asymptotically non-flat rotating dilaton black holes
Authors: Tanwi Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: Dilaton black hole solutions which are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter but reduce to asymptotically flat solutions in some special limits have been known for a Liouville type dilatonic potential. It is shown how, by solving a pair of coupled differential equations, infinitesimally small angular momentum can be added to these static solutions to produce rotating black hole solutions.
