Title: Ghost-Matter Mixing and Feigenbaum Universality in String Theory
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Dimitri Polyakov
Abstract: Brane-like vertex operators, defining backgrounds with the ghost-matter mixing in NSR superstring theory, play an important role in a world-sheet formulation of D-branes and M theory, being creation operators for extended objects in the second quantized formalism. In this paper we show that dilaton's beta function in ghost-matter mixing backgrounds becomes stochastic. The renormalization group (RG) equations in ghost-matter mixing backgrounds lead to non-Markovian Fokker-Planck equations which solutions describe superstrings in curved space-times with brane-like metrics.We show that Feigenbaum universality constant $\delta=4,669...$ describing transitions from order to chaos in a huge variety of dynamical systems, appears analytically in these RG equations. We find that the appearance of this constant is related to the scaling of relative space-time curvatures at fixed points of the RG flow. In this picture the fixed points correspond to the period doubling of Feigenbaum iterational schemes.
