Title: Gravity and Form Scattering and Renormalisation of Gravity in Six and  Eight Dimensions
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Nicolaus W. P. Turner
Abstract: We calculate one-loop scattering amplitudes for gravitons and two-forms in dimensions greater than four. The string based Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relationships allow gravitons and two-forms to be treated in a unified manner. We use the results to determine the ultra-violet infinities present in these amplitudes and show how these determine the renormalised one-loop action in six and eight dimensions.
