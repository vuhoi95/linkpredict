Title: A Converse Hawking-Unruh Effect and dS^2/CFT Correspondance
Authors: Daniele Guido and Roberto Longo
Abstract: Given a local quantum field theory net A on the de Sitter spacetime dS^d, where geodesic observers are thermalized at Gibbons-Hawking temperature, we look for observers that feel to be in a ground state, i.e. particle evolutions with positive generator, providing a sort of converse to the Hawking-Unruh effect. Such positive energy evolutions always exist as noncommutative flows, but have only a partial geometric meaning, yet they map localized observables into localized observables. We characterize the local conformal nets on dS^d. Only in this case our positive energy evolutions have a complete geometrical meaning. We show that each net has a unique maximal expected conformal subnet, where our evolutions are thus geometrical. In the two-dimensional case, we construct a holographic one-to-one correspondence between local nets A on dS^2 and local conformal non-isotonic families (pseudonets) B on S^1. The pseudonet B gives rise to two local conformal nets B(+/-) on S^1, that correspond to the H(+/-)-horizon components of A, and to the chiral components of the maximal conformal subnet of A. In particular, A is holographically reconstructed by a single horizon component, namely the pseudonet is a net, iff the translations on H(+/-) have positive energy and the translations on H(-/+) are trivial. This is the case iff the one-parameter unitary group implementing rotations on dS^2 has positive/negative generator.
