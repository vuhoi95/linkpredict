Title: Gravity solutions for the D1-D5 system with angular momentum
Authors: Oleg Lunin and Juan Maldacena and Liat Maoz
Abstract: We construct a large family of supergravity solutions that describe BPS excitations on AdS_3 x S^3 with angular momentum on S^3. These solutions take into account the full backreaction on the metric. We find that as we increase the energy of the excitation, the energy gap to the next non-BPS excitation decreases. These solutions can be viewed as Kaluza-Klein monopole ``supertubes'' which are completely non-singular geometries. We also make some remarks on supertubes in general.
