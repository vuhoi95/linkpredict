Title: Decomposing the SU(N) Connection and the Wu-Yang Potential
Authors: Yi-shi Duan and Peng-ming Zhang
Abstract: Based on the decomposition of SU(2) gauge field, we derive a generalization of the decomposition theory for the SU(N) gauge field. We thus obtain the invariant electro-magnetic tensors of SU(N) groups and the extended Wu-Yang potentials. The sourceless solutions are also discussed.
