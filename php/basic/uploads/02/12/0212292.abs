Title: Energy in Generic Higher Curvature Gravity Theories
Authors: S. Deser and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We define and compute the energy of higher curvature gravity theories in arbitrary dimensions. Generically, these theories admit constant curvature vacua (even in the absence of an explicit cosmological constant), and asymptotically constant curvature solutions with non-trivial energy properties. For concreteness, we study quadratic curvature models in detail. Among them, the one whose action is the square of the traceless Ricci tensor always has zero energy, unlike conformal (Weyl) gravity. We also study the string-inspired Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model and show that both its flat and Anti-de-Sitter vacua are stable.
