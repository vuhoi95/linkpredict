Title: Randall-Sundrum black holes and strange stars
Authors: Malcolm Fairbairn and Veronique Van Elewyck
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the existence of bare strange stars is incompatible with low scale gravity scenarios. It has been claimed that in such models, high energy neutrinos incident on the surface of a bare strange star would lead to catastrophic black hole growth. We point out that for the flat large extra dimensional case, the parts of parameter space which give rise to such growth are ruled out by other methods. We then go on to show in detail how black holes evolve in the the Randall-Sundrum two brane scenario where the extra dimensions are curved. We find that catastrophic black hole growth does not occur in this situation either. We also present some general expressions for the growth of five dimensional black holes in dense media.
