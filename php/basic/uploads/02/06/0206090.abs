Title: Branes from Matrix Theory in PP-Wave Background
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: Based on the recently proposed action for Matrix theory describing the DLCQ M theory in the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background, we obtain the supersymmetry algebra of supercharge density. Using supersymmetry transformation rules for fermions, we identify BPS states with the central charges in the supersymmetry algebra, which can be activated only in the large N limit. They preserve some fraction of supersymmetries and correspond to rotating transverse membranes and longitudinal five branes.
