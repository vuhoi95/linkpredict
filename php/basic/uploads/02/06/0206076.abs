Title: Hecke algebraic approach to the reflection equation for spin chains
Authors: A Doikou and P P Martin
Abstract: We use the structural similarity of certain Coxeter Artin Systems to the Yang--Baxter and Reflection Equations to convert representations of these systems into new solutions of the Reflection Equation. We construct certain Bethe ansatz states for these solutions, using a parameterisation suggested by abstract representation theory.
