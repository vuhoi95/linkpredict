Title: Confined quantum fields under the influence of a uniform magnetic field
Authors: E. Elizalde and F. C. Santos and A. C. Tort
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a uniform magnetic field on the zero-point energy of charged fields of two types, namely, a massive charged scalar field under Dirichlet boundary conditions and a massive fermion field under MIT boundary conditions. For the first, exact results are obtained, in terms of exponentially convergent functions, and for the second, the limits for small and for large mass are analytically obtained too. Coincidence with previously known, partial result serves as a check of the procedure. For the general case in the second situation --a rather involved one-- a precise numerical analysis is performed.
