Title: D1/D5 system and Wilson Loops in (Non-)commutative Gauge Theories
Authors: Hidenori Takahashi and Tadahito Nakajima and Kenji Suzuki
Abstract: We study the behavior of the Wilson loop in the (5+1)-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the presence of the solitonic object. Using the dual string description of the Yang-Mills theory that is given by the D1/D5 system, we estimate the Wilson loops both in the temporal and spatial cases. For the case of the temporal loop, we obtain the velocity dependent potential. For the spatial loop, we find that the area law is emerged due to the effect of the D1-branes. Further, we consider D1/D5 system in the presence of the constant B field. It is found that the Wilson loop obeys the area law for the effect of the noncommutativity.
