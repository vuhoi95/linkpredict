Title: New supersymmetric source of neutrino masses and mixings
Authors: J. A. Casas and J. R. Espinosa and I. Navarro
Abstract: Conventionally, neutrino masses in a supersymmetric theory arise from non-renormalizable lepton-number (L)-violating operators in the superpotential. The alternative possibility of having such operators in the Kahler potential as the dominant source of neutrino masses has very interesting implications and differences with respect to the standard scenario: first, the scale of L-violation can be lowered dramatically and neutrino masses have a different tan beta-dependence; second, the renormalization of these operators has remarkable properties: in many cases it improves drastically the stability of neutrino textures against radiative corrections, while in others it makes possible to generate radiatively large mixing angles in a natural way. In particular, the mass splitting and mixing angle of solar neutrinos (LAMSW solution) can be explained as a purely radiative effect.
