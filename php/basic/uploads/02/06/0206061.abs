Title: The Invariant Charges of the Nambu-Goto String Theory: Quantization of  Non-Additive Composition Laws
Authors: K. Pohlmeyer and M. Trunk
Abstract: We examine and implement the concept of non-additive composition laws in the quantum theory of closed bosonic strings moving in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. Such laws supply exact selection rules for the merging and splitting of closed strings.
