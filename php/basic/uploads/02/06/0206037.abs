Title: Recursion operators of the N=2 supersymmetric unconstrained matrix GNLS  hierarchies
Authors: F. Delduc and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: A super-algebraic formulation of the N=2 supersymmetric unconstrained matrix (k|n,m)-MGNLS hierarchies (nlin.SI/0201026) is established. Recursion operators, fermionic and bosonic symmetries as well as their superalgebra are constructed for these hierarchies.
