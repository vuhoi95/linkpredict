Title: New brane solutions in higher order gravity
Authors: A. Jakobek and K. A. Meissner and M. Olechowski
Abstract: We consider the higher order gravity with dilaton and with the leading string theory corrections taken into account. The domain wall type solutions are investigated for arbitrary number of space-time dimensions. The explicit formulae for the fixed points and asymptotic behavior of generic solutions are given. We analyze and classify solutions with finite effective gravitational constant. There is a class of such solutions which have no singularities. We discuss in detail the relation between fine tuning and self tuning and clarify in which sense our solutions are fine-tuning free. The stability of such solutions is also discussed.
