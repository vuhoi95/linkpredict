Title: Hamiltonian cohomological derivation of four-dimensional nonlinear gauge  theories
Authors: C. Bizdadea and E. M. Cioroianu and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: Consistent couplings among a set of scalar fields, two types of one-forms and a system of two-forms are investigated in the light of the Hamiltonian BRST cohomology, giving a four-dimensional nonlinear gauge theory. The emerging interactions deform the first-class constraints, the Hamiltonian gauge algebra, as well as the reducibility relations.
