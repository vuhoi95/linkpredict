Title: Special Holonomy Spaces and M-theory
Authors: M. Cvetic and G. W. Gibbons and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We review the construction of regular p-brane solutions of M-theory and string theory with less than maximal supersymmetry whose transverse spaces have metrics with special holonomy, and where additional fluxes allow for brane resolutions via transgression terms. We summarize properties of resolved M2-branes and fractional D2-branes, whose transverse spaces are Ricci flat eight-dimensional and seven-dimensional spaces of special holonomy. Recent developments in the construction of new G_2 holonomy spaces are also reviewed.
