Title: Uniqueness and non-uniqueness of static black holes in higher dimensions
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Daisuke Ida and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We prove a uniqueness theorem for asymptotically flat static charged dilaton black hole solutions in higher dimensional space-times. We also construct infinitely many non-asymptotically flat regular static black holes on the same space-time manifold with the same spherical topology. An application to the uniqueness of a certain class of flat $p$-branes is also given.
