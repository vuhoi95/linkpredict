Abstract: We consider relativistic coherent states for a spin-0 charged particle that satisfy the next additional requirements: (i) the expected values of the standard coordinate and momentum operators are uniquely related to the real and imaginary parts of the coherent state parameter; (ii) these states contain only one charge component. Three cases are considered: free particle, relativistic rotator, and particle in a constant homogeneous magnetic field. For the rotational motion of the two latter cases, such a description leads to the appearance of the so-called nonlinear coherent states.
