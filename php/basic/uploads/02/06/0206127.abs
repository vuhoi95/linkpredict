Title: Stability of Monopole Condensation in SU(2) QCD
Authors: Y. M. Cho and M. L. Walker
Abstract: We propose to resolve the controversy regarding the stability of the monopole condensation in QCD by calculating the imaginary part of the one-loop effective action perturbatively. We calculate the imaginary part perturbatively to the order $g^2$ with two different methods, with Fyenman diagram and with Schwinger's method. Our result shows that with the magnetic background the effective action has no imaginary part, but with the electric background it acquires a negative imaginary part. This strongly indicates a stable monopole condensation in QCD.
