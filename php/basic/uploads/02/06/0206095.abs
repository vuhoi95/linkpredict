Title: W-Infinity Algebras from Noncommutative Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: A. Pinzul and A. Stern
Abstract: We examine Chern-Simons theory written on a noncommutative plane with a `hole', and show that the algebra of observables is a nonlinear deformation of the $w_\infty$ algebra. The deformation depends on the level (the coefficient in the Chern-Simons action), and the noncommutativity parameter, which were identified, respectively, with the inverse filling fraction and the inverse density in a recent description of the fractional quantum Hall effect. We remark on the quantization of our algebra. The results are sensitive to the choice of ordering in the Gauss law.
