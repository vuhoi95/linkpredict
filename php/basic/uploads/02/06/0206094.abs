Title: pp-wave limits and orientifolds
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Howard J. Schnitzer and Niclas Wyllard
Abstract: We study the pp-wave limits of various elliptic models with orientifold planes and D7-branes, as well as the pp-wave limit of an orientifold of adS_5 x T^{11}. Many of the limits contain both open and closed strings. We also present pp-wave limits of theories which give rise to a compact null direction and contain open strings. Maps between the string theory states and gauge theory operators are proposed.
