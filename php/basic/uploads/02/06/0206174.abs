Title: D-branes, Orientifolds and K-theory
Authors: B. Stefanski and jr
Abstract: The complete D-brane spectrum in $\Zop_2$ orientifolds is computed. Stable non-BPS D-branes with both integral and torsion charges are found. The relation to K-theory is discussed and a new K-theory relevant to orientifolds is suggested.
