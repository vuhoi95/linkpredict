Title: Reply to "Comments on Bouda and Djama's 'Quantum Newton's Law'"
Authors: A. Bouda and T. Djama
Abstract: In this reply, we hope to bring clarifications about the reservations expressed by Floyd in his comments, give further explanations about the choice of the approach and show that our fundamental result can be reproduced by other ways. We also establish that Floyd's trajectories manifest some ambiguities related to the mathematical choice of the couple of solutions of Schr\"odinger's equation.
