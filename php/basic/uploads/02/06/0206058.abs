Title: Dispersion relations for the self-energy in non-commutative field  theories
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study the IR/UV connection in non-commutative $\phi^{3}$ theory as well as in non-commutative QED from the point of view of the dispersion relation for the self-energy. We show that, although the imaginary part of the self-energy is well behaved as the parameter of non-commutativity vanishes, the real part becomes divergent as a consequence of the high energy behavior of the dispersion integral. Some other interesting features that arise from this analysis are also briefly discussed.
