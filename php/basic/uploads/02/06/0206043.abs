Title: Asymptotic Factorisation of the Ground-State for SU(N)-invariant  Supersymmetric Matrix-Models
Authors: D. Hasler and J. Hoppe
Abstract: We give a simple - straightforward and rigorous - derivation that when the eigenvalues of one of the $d=9 (5,3,2)$ matrices in the SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix model become large (and well separated from each other) the ground-state wavefunction (resp. asymptotic zero-energy solution of the corresponding differential equation) factorizes, for all $N>1$, into a product of supersymmetric harmonic oscillator wavefunctions (involving the `off-diagonal' degrees of freedom) and a wavefunction $\psi$ that is annihilated by the free supercharge formed out of all `diagonal' (Cartan sub-algebra) degrees of freedom.
