Title: Supergravity Duals of Matrix String Theory
Authors: Jose F. Morales and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We study the holographic duals of type II and heterotic matrix string theories described by warped AdS_3 supergravities. By explicitly solving the linearized equations of motion around near horizon D-string geometries, we determine the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein primaries for type I, II supergravities on warped AdS_3 x S^7. The results match those coming from the dual two-dimensional gauge theories living on the D-string worldvolumes. We briefly discuss the connections with the N=(8,8), N=(8,0) orbifold superconformal field theories to which type IIB / heterotic matrix strings flow in the infrared. In particular, we associate the dimension (3/2, 3/2) twisted operator which brings the matrix string theories out from the conformal point (R^8)^N / S_N with the dilaton profile in the supergravity background. The familiar dictionary between masses and scaling dimensions of fields and operators are modified by the presence of non-trivial warp factors and running dilatons. These modifications are worked out for the general case of domain wall / QFT correspondences between supergravities on warped AdS_{d+1} x S^q geometries and super Yang-Mills theories with 16 supercharges.
