Title: World-sheet Instantons via the Myers Effect and N=1^* Quiver  Superpotentials
Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and S. Prem Kumar
Abstract: In this note we explore the stringy interpretation of non-perturbative effects in N=1^* deformations of the A_{k-1} quiver models. For certain types of deformations we argue that the massive vacua are described by Nk fractional D3-branes at the orbifold polarizing into k concentric 5-brane spheres each carrying fractional brane charge. The polarization of the D3-branes induces a polarization of D-instantons into string world-sheets wrapped on the Myers spheres. We show that the superpotentials in these models are indeed generated by these world-sheet instantons. We point out that for certain parameter values the condensates yield the exact superpotential for a relevant deformation of the Klebanov-Witten conifold theory.
