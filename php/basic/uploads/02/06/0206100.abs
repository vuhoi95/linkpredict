Title: Cosmological perturbations in a generalized gravity including tachyonic  condensation
Authors: J. Hwang and H. Noh
Abstract: We present unified ways of handling the cosmological perturbations in a class of gravity theory covered by a general action in eq. (1). This gravity includes our previous generalized $f(\phi,R)$ gravity and the gravity theory motivated by the tachyonic condensation. We present general prescription to derive the power spectra generated from vacuum quantum fluctuations in the slow-roll inflation era. An application is made to a slow-roll inflation based on the tachyonic condensation with an exponential potential.
