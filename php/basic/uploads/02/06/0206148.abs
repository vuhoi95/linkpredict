Title: Kappa-symmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld actions in three dimensions
Authors: J. M. Drummond and P. S. Howe and U. Lindstrom
Abstract: A superembedding construction of general non-abelian Born-Infeld actions in three dimensions is described. These actions have rigid target space and local worldvolume supersymmetry(i.e. kappa symmetry). The standard abelian Born-Infeld gauge multiplet is augmented with an additional worldvolume SU(N) gauge supermultiplet. It is shown how to construct single-trace actions and in particular a kappa-supersymmetric extension of the symmetrised trace action.
