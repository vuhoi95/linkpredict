Title: Representation of SU(infinity) Algebra for Matrix Models
Authors: Naofumi Kitsunezaki and Shozo Uehara
Abstract: We investigate how the matrix representation of SU(N) algebra approaches that of the Poisson algebra in the large N limit. In the adjoint representation, the (N^2-1) times (N^2-1) matrices of the SU(N) generators go to those of the Poisson algebra in the large N limit. However, it is not the case for the N times N matrices in the fundamental representation.
