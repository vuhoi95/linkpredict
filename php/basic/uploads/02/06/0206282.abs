Title: Schwinger-Dyson Analysis of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking on a Brane with  Bulk Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Tomohiro Inagaki
Abstract: The dynamically generated fermion mass is investigated in the flat brane world with (4+delta)-dimensional bulk space-time, and in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane world. We consider the bulk Yang-Mills theory interacting with the fermion confined on a four-dimensional brane. Based on the effective theory below the reduced cutoff scale on the brane, we formulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the brane fermion propagator. By using the improved ladder approximation we numerically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equation and find that the dynamical fermion mass is near the reduced cutoff scale on the brane for the flat brane world with delta >= 3 and for the RS brane world. In RS brane world KK excited modes of the bulk gauge field localized around the y = pi R brane and it enhances the dynamical symmetry breaking on the brane. The decay constant of the fermion and the anti-fermion composite operator can be taken to be the order of the electroweak scale much smaller than the Planck scale. Therefore electroweak mass scale can be realized from only the Planck scale in the RS brane world due to the fermion and the anti-fermion pair condensation. That is a dynamical realization of Randall-Sundrum model which solves the weak-Planck hierarchy problem.
