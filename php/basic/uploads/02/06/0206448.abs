Title: Age Constraints on Brane Models of Dark Energy
Authors: J. S. Alcaniz and Deepak Jain and Abha Dev
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in particle physics, the so-called brane world cosmology seems to provide an alternative explanation for the present dark energy problem. In this paper, we use the estimated age of high-$z$ objects to constrain the value of the cosmological parameters in some particular scenarios based on this large scale modification of gravity. We show that such models are compatible with these observations for values of the crossover distance between the 4 and 5 dimensions of the order of $r_c \leq 1.67H_o^{-1}$.
