Title: Superstring Interactions in a pp-wave Background II
Authors: Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: In type IIB light-cone superstring field theory, the cubic interaction has two pieces: a delta-functional overlap and an operator inserted at the interaction point. In this paper we extend our earlier work hep-th/0204146 by computing the matrix elements of this operator in the oscillator basis of pp-wave string theory for all mu p^+ alpha'. By evaluating these matrix elements for large mu p^+ alpha', we check a recent conjecture relating matrix elements of the light-cone string field theory Hamiltonian (with prefactor) to certain three-point functions of BMN operators in the gauge theory. We also make several explicit predictions for gauge theory.
