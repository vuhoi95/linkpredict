Abstract: We introduce the hypothesis that the matter content of the universe can be a product of the decay of primordial vector bosons. The effect of the intensive cosmological creation of these primordial vector $W, ~Z $ bosons from the vacuum is studied in the framework of General Relativity and the Standard Model where the relative standard of measurement identifying conformal quantities with the measurable ones is accepted. The relative standard leads to the conformal cosmology with the z-history of masses with the constant temperature, instead of the conventional z-history of the temperature with constant masses in inflationary cosmology. In conformal cosmology both the latest supernova data and primordial nucleosynthesis are compatible with a stiff equation of state associated with one of the possible states of the infrared gravitation field. The distribution function of the created bosons in the lowest order of perturbation theory exposes a cosmological singularity as a consequence of the theorem about the absence of the massless limit of massive vector fields in quantum theory. This singularity can be removed by taking into account the collision processes leading to a thermalization of the created particles. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature T=(M_W^2H_0)^{1/3} ~ 2.7 K occurs as an integral of motion for the universe in the stiff state. We show that this temperature can be attained by the CMB radiation being the final product of the decay of primordial bosons. The effect of anomalous nonconservation of baryon number due to the polarization of the Dirac sea vacuum by these primordial bosons is considered.
