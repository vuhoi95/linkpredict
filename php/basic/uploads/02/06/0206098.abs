Title: Non-supersymmetric deformations of the dual of a confining gauge theory
Authors: Vadim Borokhov and Steven S. Gubser
Abstract: We introduce a computational technique for studying non-supersymmetric deformations of domain wall solutions of interest in AdS/CFT. We focus on the Klebanov-Strassler solution, which is dual to a confining gauge theory. From an analysis of asymptotics we find that there are three deformations that leave the ten-dimensional supergravity solution regular and preserve the global bosonic symmetries of the supersymmetric solution. Also, we show that there are no regular near-extremal deformations preserving the global symmetries, as one might expect from the existence of a gap in the gauge theory.
