Title: Long-distance asymptotics of spin-spin correlation functions for the XXZ  spin chain
Authors: Sergei Lukyanov and Veronique Terras
Abstract: We study asymptotic expansions of spin-spin correlation functions for the XXZ Heisenberg chain in the critical regime. We use the fact that the long-distance effects can be described by the Gaussian conformal field theory. Comparing exact results for form factors in the XYZ and sine-Gordon models, we determine correlation amplitudes for the leading and main sub-leading terms in the asymptotic expansions of spin-spin correlation functions. We also study the isotropic (XXX) limit of these expansions.
