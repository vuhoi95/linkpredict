Title: Curved Membrane Solutions in D=11 Supergravity
Authors: Sandip Bhattacharyya and Alok Kumar and Subir Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: We present a class of static membrane solutions, with non-flat worldvolume geometry, in the eleven dimensional supergravity with source terms. This class of solutions contains supersymmetric as well as a large class of non-supersymmetric configurations. We comment about near horizon limit and stability of these solutions and point out an interesting relation with certain two dimensional dilaton gravity system.
