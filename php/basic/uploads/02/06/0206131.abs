Title: Assisting pre-big bang phenomenology through short-lived axions
Authors: V. Bozza and M. Gasperini and M. Giovannini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We present the results of a detailed study of how isocurvature axion fluctuations are converted into adiabatic metric perturbations through axion decay, and discuss the constraints on the parameters of pre-big bang cosmology needed for consistency with present CMB-anisotropy data. The large-scale normalization of temperature fluctuations has a non-trivial dependence both on the mass and on the initial value of the axion. In the simplest, minimal models of pre-big bang inflation, consistency with the COBE normalization requires a slightly tilted (blue) spectrum, while a strictly scale-invariant spectrum requires mild modifications of the minimal backgrounds at large curvature and/or string coupling.
