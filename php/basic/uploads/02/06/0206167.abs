Title: PP-wave string interactions from n-point correlators of BMN operators
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Valentin V. Khoze and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: BMN operators are characterized by the fact that they have infinite R-charge and finite anomalous dimension in the BMN double scaling limit. Using this fact, we show that the BMN operators close under operator product expansion and form a sector in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We then identify short-distance limits of general BMN n-point correlators, and show how they correspond to the pp-wave string interactions. We also discuss instantons in the light of the pp-wave/SYM correspondence.
