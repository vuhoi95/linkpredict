Title: Aspects of Semiclassical Strings in AdS$_5$
Authors: Gautam Mandal and Nemani V. Suryanarayana and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We find an infinite number of conserved currents and charges in the semiclassical limit $\lambda \to \infty$ of string theory in AdS$_5 \times S^5$ and remark on their relevance to conserved charges in the dual gauge theory. We establish a general procedure of exploring the semiclassical limit by viewing the classical motion as collective motion in the relevant part of the configuration space. We illustrate the procedure for semiclassical expansion around solutions of string theory on AdS$_5 \times (S^5/Z_M)$.
