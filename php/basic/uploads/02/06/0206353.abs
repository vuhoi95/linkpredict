Title: On the probability of ferromagnetic strings in antiferromagnetic spin  chains
Authors: Alexander G. Abanov and Vladimir E. Korepin
Abstract: We study the probability of formation of ferromagnetic string in the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXZ chain. We show that in the limit of long strings with weak magnetization per site the bosonization technique can be used to address the problem. At zero temperature the obtained probability is Gaussian as a function of the length of the string. At finite but low temperature there is a crossover from the Gaussian behavior at intermediate lengths of strings to the exponential decay for very long strings. Although the weak magnetization per site is a necessary small parameter justifying our results, the extrapolation of obtained results to the case of maximally ferromagnetic strings is in qualitative agreement with known numerics and exact results. The effect of an external magnetic field on the probability of formation of ferromagnetic strings is also studied.
