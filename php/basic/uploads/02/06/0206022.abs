Title: Covariant Effective Action for Quantum Particle with  Coordinate-Dependent Mass
Authors: H. Kleinert and A. Chervyakov
Abstract: Using a covariant background field method we calculate the one-loop quantum effective action for a particle with coordinate-dependent mass moving slowly through a one-dimensional configuration space. The procedure can easily be extended to any desired loop order.
