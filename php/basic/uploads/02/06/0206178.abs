Title: Twistorial superparticle with tensorial central charges
Authors: S. Fedoruk and V. G. Zima
Abstract: A twistorial formulation of the N=1 D=4 superparticle with tensorial central charges describing massive and massless cases in uniform manner is given. The twistors resolve energy-momentum vector whereas the tensorial central charges are written in term of spinor Lorentz harmonics. The model makes possible to describe states preserving all allowed fractions of target-space supersymmetry. The full analysis of the number of conserved supersymmetries in models with N=1 D=4 superalgebra with tensorial central charges has been carried out.
