Title: Brane World Cosmologies and Statistical Properties of Gravitational  Lenses
Authors: D. Jain and A. Dev and J. S. Alcaniz
Abstract: Brane world cosmologies seem to provide an alternative explanation for the present accelerated stage of the Universe with no need to invoke either a cosmological constant or an exotic \emph{quintessence} component. In this paper we investigate statistical properties of gravitational lenses for some particular scenarios based on this large scale modification of gravity. We show that a large class of such models are compatible with the current lensing data for values of the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm{m}} \leq 0.94$ ($1\sigma$). If one fixes $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ to be $\simeq 0.3$, as suggested by most of the dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter in the Universe, the predicted number of lensed quasars requires a slightly open universe with a crossover distance between the 4 and 5-dimensional gravities of the order of $1.76 H_o^{-1}$.
