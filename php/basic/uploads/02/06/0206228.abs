Title: Instability of Spacelike and Null Orbifold Singularities
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: Time dependent orbifolds with spacelike or null singularities have recently been studied as simple models of cosmological singularities. We show that their apparent simplicity is an illusion: the introduction of a single particle causes the spacetime to collapse to a strong curvature singularity (a Big Crunch), even in regions arbitrarily far from the particle.
