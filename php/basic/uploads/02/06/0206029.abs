Title: The deconfinement transition in SU(N) gauge theories
Authors: B. Lucini and M. Teper and U. Wenger
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the deconfinement transition in SU(4) and SU(6) gauge theories. We find that it is a `normal' first order transition in both cases, from which we conclude that the transition is first order in the N->infinity limit. Comparing our preliminary estimates of the continuum values of Tc/sqrt(K) with existing values for SU(2) and SU(3) demonstrates a weak dependence on N for all values of N.
