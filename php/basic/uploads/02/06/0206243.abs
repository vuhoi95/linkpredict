Title: Calibrations, Monopoles and Fuzzy Funnels
Authors: Neil R. Constable and Neil D. Lambert
Abstract: We present new non-Abelian solitonic configurations in the low energy effective theory describing a collection of N parallel D1--branes. These configurations preserve 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/32 of the spacetime supersymmetry. They are solutions to a set of generalised Nahm's equations which are related to self-duality equations in eight dimensions. Our solutions represent D1--branes which expand into fuzzy funnel configurations ending on collections of intersecting D3--branes. Supersymmetry dictates that such intersecting D3--branes must lie on a calibrated three-surface of spacetime and we argue that the generalised Nahm's equations encode the data for the construction of magnetic monopoles on the relevant three-surfaces.
