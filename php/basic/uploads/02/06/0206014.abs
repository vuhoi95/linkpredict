Title: Algebraic Geometry and Hofstadter Type Model
Authors: Shao-shiung Lin and Shi-shyr Roan
Abstract: In this report, we study the algebraic geometry aspect of Hofstadter type models through the algebraic Bethe equation. In the diagonalization problem of certain Hofstadter type Hamiltonians, the Bethe equation is constructed by using the Baxter vectors on a high genus spectral curve. When the spectral variables lie on rational curves, we obtain the complete and explicit solutions of the polynomial Bethe equation; the relation with the Bethe ansatz of polynomial roots is discussed. Certain algebraic geometry properties of Bethe equation on the high genus algebraic curves are discussed in cooperation with the consideration of the physical model.
