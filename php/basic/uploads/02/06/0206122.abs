Title: Linearization of N = 2 Nonlinear Supersymmetry and Spontaneous  Supersymmetry Breaking Parameters
Authors: K. Shima and M. Tsuda
Abstract: We show explicitly by the heuristic and practical arguments that for $N = 2$ supersymmetry (SUSY) a SUSY invariant relation between component fields of a vector supermultiplet of linear SUSY and Nambu-Goldstone fermions of the Volkov-Akulov model of nonlinear SUSY is written by using only three arbitrary dimensionless parameters, which can be recasted as the vacuum expectation values of auxiliary fields in the vector supermultiplet.
