Title: Regular Poisson structures on massive non-rotating BTZ black holes
Authors: P. Bieliavsky and M. Rooman and Ph. Spindel
Abstract: We revisit the non-rotating massive BTZ black hole within a pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space context. Using classical symmetric space techniques we find that every such space intrinsically carries a regular Poisson structure whose symplectic leaves are para-hermitian symmetric surfaces. We also obtain a global expression of the metric yielding a dynamical description of the black hole from its initial to its final singularity.
