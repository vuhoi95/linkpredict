Title: Critical phenomena of gravitating monopoles in the spacetime of a global  monopole
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: We present a numerical study of critical phenomena (including the Lue-Weinberg phenomenon) arising for gravitating monopoles in a global monopole spacetime. The equations of this model have been recently studied by Spinelly et al. in a domain of parameter space away from the critical points.
