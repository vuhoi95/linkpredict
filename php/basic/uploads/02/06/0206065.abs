Title: Quantum stabilization of dilatonic Anti-de Sitter Universe
Authors: John Quiroga Hurtado and Yulia A. Shaido
Abstract: The possibility of quantum creation of a dilatonic AdS Universe is discussed.Without dilaton it is known that quantum effects lead to the annihilation of AdS Universe. We consider the role of the form for the dilatonic potential in the quantum creation of a dilatonic AdS Universe. Using the conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled scalar, the anomaly induced action and the equations of motion are obtained. The anomaly induced action is added to classical dilaton gravity action. The solutions of the full theory which correspond to quantum-corrected AdS Universe are given for number of dilatonic potentials.
