Title: The Qubits of Qunivac
Authors: James Baugh and David Finkelstein and Andrei Galiautdinov
Abstract: We formulate a theory of quantum processes, extend it to a generic quantum cosmology, formulate a reversible quantum logic for the Quantum Universe As Computer, or Qunivac. Qunivac has an orthogonal group of cosmic dimensionality. It has a Clifford algebra of ``cosmonions,'' extending the quaternions to a cosmological number of anticommuting units. Its qubits obey Clifford-Wilczek statistics and are associated with unit cosmonions. This makes it relatively easy to program the Dirac equation on Qunivac in a Lorentz-invariant way. Qunivac accommodates a field theory and a gauge theory. Its gauge group is necessarily a quantum group.
