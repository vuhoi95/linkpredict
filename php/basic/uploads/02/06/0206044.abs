Title: N=(1|1) supersymmetric dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy
Authors: V. G. Kadyshevsky and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: Generalizing the graded commutator in superalgebras, we propose a new bracket operation on the space of graded operators with an involution. We study properties of this operation and show that the Lax representation of the two-dimensional N=(1|1) supersymmetric Toda lattice hierarchy can be realized via the generalized bracket operation; this is important in constructing the semiclassical (continuum) limit of this hierarchy. We construct the continuum limit of the N=(1|1) Toda lattice hierarchy, the dispersionless N=(1|1) Toda hierarchy. In this limit, we obtain the Lax representation, with the generalized graded bracket becoming the corresponding Poisson bracket on the graded phase superspace. We find bosonic symmetries of the dispersionless N=(1|1) supersymmetric Toda equation.
