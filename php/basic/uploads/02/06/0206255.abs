Title: Matrix Models, Topological Strings, and Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We show that B-model topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds are large N duals of matrix models, which in the planar limit naturally give rise to special geometry. These matrix models directly compute F-terms in an associated N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory, obtained by deforming N=2 theories by a superpotential term that can be directly identified with the potential of the matrix model. Moreover by tuning some of the parameters of the geometry in a double scaling limit we recover (p,q) conformal minimal models coupled to 2d gravity, thereby relating non-critical string theories to type II superstrings on Calabi-Yau backgrounds.
