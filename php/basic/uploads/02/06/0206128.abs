Title: Origin of Small Cosmological Constant in Brane-World
Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: We address the relation among the parameters of accelerating brane-universe embedded in five dimensional bulk space. It is pointed out that the tiny cosmological constant of our world can be obtained as quantum corrections around a given brane-solution in the bulk theory or in the field theory on the boundary from the holographic viewpoint.Some implications to the cosmology and constarints on the parameters are also given.
