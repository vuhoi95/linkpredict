Title: Instantons and Wormholes In Minkowski and (A)dS Spaces
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Wafic Sabra
Abstract: Instanton and wormhole solutions are constructed in a d-dimensional gravity theory with an axion-dilaton pair of scalar fields. We discuss the cases of vanishing, positive and negative cosmological constant.
