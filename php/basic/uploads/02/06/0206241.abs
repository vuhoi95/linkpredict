Title: N=4 gauged supergravity and a IIB orientifold with fluxes
Authors: Riccardo D'Auria and Sergio Ferrara and Silvia Vaula'
Abstract: We analyze the properties of a spontaneously broken D=4, N=4 supergravity without cosmological constant, obtained by gauging translational isometries of its classical scalar manifold. This theory offers a suitable low energy description of the super-Higgs phases of certain Type-IIB orientifold compactifications with 3-form fluxes turned on. We study its N=3,2,1,0 phases and their classical moduli spaces and we show that this theory is an example of no-scale extended supergravity.
