Title: Supersymmetry on a Spatial Lattice
Authors: David B. Kaplan and Emanuel Katz and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: We construct a variety of supersymmetric gauge theories on a spatial lattice, including N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 3+1 dimensions. Exact lattice supersymmetry greatly reduces or eliminates the need for fine tuning to arrive at the desired continuum limit in these examples.
