Title: Inflationary Theory and Alternative Cosmology
Authors: Lev Kofman and Andrei Linde and V. Mukhanov
Abstract: Recently Hollands and Wald argued that inflation does not solve any of the major cosmological problems. We explain why we disagree with their arguments. They also proposed a new speculative mechanism of generation of density perturbations. We show that in their scenario the inhomogeneities responsible for the large scale structure observed today were generated at an epoch when the energy density of the hot universe was 10^{95} times greater than the Planck density. The only way to avoid this problem is to assume that there was a stage of inflation in the early universe.
