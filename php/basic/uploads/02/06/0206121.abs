Title: Optimized post Gaussian approximation in the background field method
Authors: A. Rakhimov and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We have extended the variational perturbative theory based on the back ground field method to include the optimized expansion of Okopinska and the post Gaussian effective potential of Stansu and Stevenson. This new method provides much simpler way to compute the correction terms to the Gausssian effective action (or potential). We have also renormalized the effective potential in 3+1 dimensions by introducing appropriate counter terms in the lagrangian
