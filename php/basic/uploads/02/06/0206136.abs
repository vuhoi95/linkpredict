Title: Uniqueness of (dilatonic) charged black holes and black p-branes in  higher dimensions
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Daisuke Ida and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of higher dimensional (dilatonic) charged black holes in static and asymptotically flat spacetimes for arbitrary vector-dilaton coupling constant. An application to the uniqueness of a wide class of black p-branes is also given.
