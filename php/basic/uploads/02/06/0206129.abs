Title: Duality for symmetric second rank tensors.(I): the massive case
Authors: H. Casini and R. Montemayor and Luis F. Urrutia
Abstract: A generalization of duality transformations for arbitrary Lorentz tensors is presented, and a systematic scheme for constructing the dual descriptions is developed. The method, a purely Lagrangian approach, is based on a first order parent Lagrangian, from which the dual partners are generated. In particular, a family of theories which are dual to the massive spin two Fierz-Pauli field, both free and coupled to an external source, is constructed in terms of a third rank tensor which is taken as the basic configuration variable.
