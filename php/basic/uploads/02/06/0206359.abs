Title: Logarithmic corrections to finite size spectrum of SU(N) symmetric  quantum chains
Authors: Kingshuk Majumdar and Manash Mukherjee
Abstract: We consider SU(N) symmetric one dimensional quantum chains at finite temperature. For such systems the correlation lengths, ground state energy, and excited state energies are investigated in the framework of conformal field theory. The possibility of different types of excited states are discussed. Logarithmic corrections to the ground state energy and different types of excited states in the presence of a marginal opeartor, are calculated. Known results for SU(2) and SU(4) symmetric systems follow from our general formula.
