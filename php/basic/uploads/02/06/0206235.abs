Title: Exact uncertainty properties of bosonic fields
Authors: Michael J. W. Hall and Kailash Kumar and Marcel Reginatto
Abstract: (A) The momentum density conjugate to a bosonic quantum field splits naturally into the sum of a classical component and a nonclassical component. It is shown that the field and the nonclassical component of the momentum density satisfy an_exact_ uncertainty relation, i.e., an equality, which underlies the Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for fields. (B) The above motivates a new approach to deriving and interpreting bosonic quantum fields, based on an exact uncertainty principle. In particular, the postulate that an ensemble of classical fields is subject to nonclassical momentum fluctuations, of a strength determined by the field uncertainty, leads from the classical to the quantum field equations. Examples include scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields. For the latter case the exact uncertainty principle specifies a unique (non-Laplacian) operator ordering for the Wheeler-deWitt equation.
