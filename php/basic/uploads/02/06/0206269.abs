Title: Coherent State Transforms and Vector Bundles on Elliptic Curves
Authors: C. Florentino and J. Mourao and J. P. Nunes
Abstract: We extend the coherent state transform (CST) of Hall to the context of the moduli spaces of semistable holomorphic vector bundles with fixed determinant over elliptic curves. We show that by applying the CST to appropriate distributions, we obtain the space of level k, rank n and genus one non-abelian theta functions with the unitarity of the CST transform being preserved. Furthermore, the shift k -> k+n appears in a natural way in this finite-dimensional framework.
