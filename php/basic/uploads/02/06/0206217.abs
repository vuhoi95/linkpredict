Title: Braneworld physics from the analog-gravity perspective: finiteness  effects
Authors: Carlos Barcelo and Antonio Campos
Abstract: We study Randall-Sundrum brane models from the viewpoint of condensed matter/quantum optics. Following the idea of analog gravity we obtain effective metrics in fluid and Bose-Einstein-condensate systems mimicking those in the brane framework. We find that the effect of warp factors in the bulk geometry translates into finiteness of the analog systems. As an illustration of this identification we give a new interpretation of the peculiar behaviour of the critical temperature for the splitting of thick branes in warped spacetimes.
