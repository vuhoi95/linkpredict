Title: Noncommutative Gauge Theory without Lorentz Violation
Authors: Carl E. Carlson and Christopher D. Carone and Nahum Zobin
Abstract: The most popular noncommutative field theories are characterized by a matrix parameter theta^(mu,nu) that violates Lorentz invariance. We consider the simplest algebra in which the theta-parameter is promoted to an operator and Lorentz invariance is preserved. This algebra arises through the contraction of a larger one for which explicit representations are already known. We formulate a star product and construct the gauge-invariant Lagrangian for Lorentz-conserving noncommutative QED. Three-photon vertices are absent in the theory, while a four-photon coupling exists and leads to a distinctive phenomenology.
