Title: On d=4,5,6 Vacua with 8 Supercharges
Authors: Ernesto Lozano-Tellechea and Patrick Meessen and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We show how all known N=2, d=4,5,6 maximally supersymmetric vacua (Hpp-waves and aDSxS solutions) are related through dimensional reduction/oxidation preserving all the unbroken supersymmetries. In particular we show how the N=2, d=5 family of vacua (which are the near-horizon geometry of supersymmetric rotating black holes) interpolates between aDS_2xS^3 and aDS_3xS^2 in parameter space and how it can be dimensionally reduced to an N=2, d=4 dyonic Robinson-Bertotti solution with geometry aDS_2xS^2 and oxidized to an N=2, d=6 solution with aDS_3xS^3 geometry (which is the near-horizon of the self-dual string).
