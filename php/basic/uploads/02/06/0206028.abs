Title: SLE_k growth processes and conformal field theories
Authors: M. Bauer and D. Bernard
Abstract: SLE_k stochastic processes describe growth of random curves which, in some cases, may be identified with boundaries of two dimensional critical percolating clusters. By generalizing SLE_k growths to formal Markov processes on the central extension of the 2d conformal group, we establish a connection between conformal field theories with central charges c_k=(3k-8)(6/k-1)/2 and zero modes -- observables which are conserved in mean -- of the SLE_k stochastic processes.
