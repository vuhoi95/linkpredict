Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Reflectionless Scattering Data
Authors: M. Bordag and A. Yurov
Abstract: We consider the question which potentials in the action of a (1+1) dimensional scalar field theory allowing for spontaneous symmetry breaking have quantum fluctuations corresponding to reflectionless scattering data. The general problem of restoration from known scattering data is formulated and a number of explicit examples is given. Only certain sets of reflectionless scattering data correspond to symmetry breaking and all restored potentials are similar either to the Phi**4-model or to the sine-Gordon model.
