Title: On Smooth Time-Dependent Orbifolds and Null Singularities
Authors: Michal Fabinger and John McGreevy
Abstract: We study string theory on a non-singular time-dependent orbifold of flat space, known as the `null-brane'. The orbifold group, which involves only space-like identifications, is obtained by a combined action of a null Lorentz transformation and a constant shift in an extra direction. In the limit where the shift goes to zero, the geometry of this orbifold reproduces an orbifold with a light-like singularity, which was recently studied by Liu, Moore and Seiberg (hep-th/0204168). We find that the backreaction on the geometry due to a test particle can be made arbitrarily small, and that there are scattering processes which can be studied in the approximation of a constant background. We quantize strings on this orbifold and calculate the torus partition function. We construct a basis of states on the smooth orbifold whose tree level string interactions are nonsingular. We discuss the existence of physical modes in the singular orbifold which resolve the singularity. We also describe another way of making the singular orbifold smooth which involves a sandwich pp-wave.
