Title: Phenomenological equation of state and late-time cosmic acceleration
Authors: Golam Mortuza Hossain and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: Assuming a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with a single perfect fluid, we propose a pressure-density ratio that evolves as a specific universal function of the scale parameter. We show that such a ratio can indeed be consistent with several observational constraints including those pertaining to late-time accelerated expansion. Generic dynamical scalar field models of Dark energy (with quadratic kinetic terms in their Lagrange density) are shown to be in accord with the proposed equation-of-state ratio, provided the current matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0} < 0.23$ - a value {\it not} in agreement with recent measurements.
