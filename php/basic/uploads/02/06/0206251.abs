Title: Ghost Condensates and Dynamical Breaking of SL(2,R) in Yang-Mills in the  Maximal Abelian Gauge
Authors: V. E. R. Lemes and M. S. Sarandy and S. P. Sorella
Abstract: Ghost condensates of dimension two in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory quantized in the Maximal Abelian Gauge are discussed. These condensates turn out to be related to the dynamical breaking of the SL(2,R) symmetry present in this gauge
