Abstract: We construct the nonlocal braneworld action in the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model in a holographic setup alternative to Kaluza-Klein description: the action is written as a functional of the two metric and radion fields on the branes. This action effectively describes the dynamics of the gravitational field both on the branes and in the bulk in terms of the brane geometries directly accessible for observations. Its nonlocal form factors incorporate the cumulative effect of the bulk Kaluza-Klein modes. We also consider the reduced version of this action obtained by integrating out the fields on the negative-tension brane invisible from the viewpoint of the Planckian brane observer. This effective action features a nontrivial transition (AdS flow) between the local and nonlocal phases of the theory associated with the limits of small and large interbrane separation. Our results confirm a recently proposed braneworld scenario with diverging (repulsive) branes and suggest possible new implications of this phase transition in brane cosmology.
