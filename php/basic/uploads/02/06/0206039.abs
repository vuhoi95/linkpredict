Title: Four-dimensional anti-de Sitter black holes from a three-dimensional  perspective: Full complexity
Authors: Vilson T. Zanchin and Antares Kleber and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: The dimensional reduction of black hole solutions in four-dimensional (4D) general relativity is performed and new 3D black hole solutions are obtained. Considering a 4D spacetime with one spacelike Killing vector, it is possible to split the Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action with a cosmological term in terms of 3D quantities. Definitions of quasilocal mass and charges in 3D spacetimes are reviewed. The analysis is then particularized to the toroidal charged rotating anti-de Sitter black hole. The reinterpretation of the fields and charges in terms of a three-dimensional point of view is given in each case, and the causal structure analyzed.
