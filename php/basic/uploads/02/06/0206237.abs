Title: Orbiting Membranes in M-theory on AdS_7 x S^4 Background
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Masumeh Ghasemkhani
Abstract: We study classical solutions describing rotating and boosted membranes on AdS_7 x S^4 background in M-theory. We find the dependence of the energy on the spin and R-charge of these solutions. In the flat space limit we get E ~ S^{2/3}, while for AdS at leading order E-S grows as S^{1/3}. The membranes on AdS_4 x S^7 background have briefly been studied as well.
