Title: Toward Construction of Exact Operator Solution of $A_N$-Toda Field  Theory
Authors: Y. Takimoto and T. Fujiwara
Abstract: Quantum $A_N$-Toda field theory in two dimensions is investigated based on the method of quantizing canonical free field. Toda exponential operator associated with the fundamental weight $\lambda^1$ is constructed.
