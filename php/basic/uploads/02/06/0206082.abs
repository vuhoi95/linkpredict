Title: A Geometric Approach to Massive p-form Duality
Authors: Pio J. Arias and Lorenzo Leal and Jean Carlos Perez-Mosquera
Abstract: Massive theories of abelian p-forms are quantized in a generalized path-representation that leads to a description of the phase space in terms of a pair of dual non-local operators analogous to the Wilson Loop and the 't Hooft disorder operators. Special atention is devoted to the study of the duality between the Topologically Massive and the Self-Dual models in 2+1 dimensions. It is shown that these models share a geometric representation in which just one non local operator suffices to describe the observables.
