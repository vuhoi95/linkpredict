Title: Exciting AdS Orbifolds
Authors: Emil J. Martinec and Will McElgin
Abstract: The supersymmetric $(AdS_3\times S^3)/Z_N$ orbifold constructed by the authors in hep-th/0106171 is shown to describe AdS fragmentation, where fivebranes are emerging from the F1-NS5 background. The twisted sector moduli of the orbifold are the collective coordinates of groups of $n_5/N$ fivebranes. We discuss the relation between the descriptions of this background as a perturbative string orbifold and as a BPS state in the dual spacetime CFT. Finally, we attempt to apply the lessons learned to the description of BTZ black holes as $AdS_3$ orbifolds and to related big crunch/big bang cosmological scenarios.
