Title: Phenomenology of heterotic M-theory with five-branes
Authors: D. G. Cerdeno and C. Munoz
Abstract: We analyze some phenomenological implications of heterotic M-theory with five-branes. Recent results for the effective 4-dimensional action are used to perform a systematic analysis of the parameter space, finding the restrictions that result from requiring the volume of the Calabi-Yau to remain positive. Then the different scales of the theory, namely, the 11-dimensional Planck mass, the compactification scale and the orbifold scale, are evaluated. The expressions for the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms are computed and discussed in detail for the whole parameter space. With this information we study the theoretical predictions for the supersymmetric contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, using the recent experimental result as a constraint on the parameter space. We finally analyze the neutralino as a dark matter candidate in this construction. In particular, the neutralino-nucleon cross-section is computed and compared with the sensitivities explored by present dark matter detectors.
