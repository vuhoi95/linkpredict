Title: Supertubes connecting D4 branes
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: We find and explore a class of dyonic instanton solutions which can be identified as the supertubes connecting two D4 branes. They correspond to a single monopole string and a pair of monopole antimonopole strings from the worldvolume view point of D4 branes.
