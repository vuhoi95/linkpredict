Title: Scattering and Resonances in QCD_2
Authors: Yitzhak Frishman and Marek Karliner
Abstract: Extending previous works on the spectrum of QCD_2, we now investigate the 2D analogue of meson-baryon scattering. We use semi-classical methods, perturbing around classical soliton solutions. We start with the abelian case, corresponding to one flavor,and find that in this case the effective potential is reflectionless. We obtain an explicit expression for the forward phase shift. In the non-abelian case of several flavors, the method yields a potential which depends on the momentum of the incoming particle. In this case there is both transmission and reflection. In both cases no resonances appear. As a byproduct, we derive the general conditions for a 2D quantum field theoretical action to yield a reflectionless effective potential when one expands in small fluctuations about the classical solution.
