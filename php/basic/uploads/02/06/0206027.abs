Title: On the Fock Space Realizations of Nonlinear Algebras Describing the High  Spin Fields in AdS Spaces
Authors: C. Burdik and O. Navratil and A. Pashnev
Abstract: The method of construction of Fock space realizations of Lie algebras is generalized for nonlinear algebras. We consider as an example the nonlinear algebra of constraints which describe the totally symmetric fields with higher spins in the AdS space-time.
