Title: N=1 Supersymmetric Theory of Higher Spin Gauge Fields in AdS(5) at the  Cubic Level
Authors: K. B. Alkalaev and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We formulate gauge invariant interactions of totally symmetric tensor and tensor-spinor higher spin gauge fields in AdS(5) that properly account for higher-spin-gravitational interactions at the action level in the first nontrivial order.
