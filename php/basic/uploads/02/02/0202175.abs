Title: S^1-wrapped D3-branes on Conifolds
Authors: H. Lu and J. F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We construct a D3-brane wrapped on S^1, which is fibred over the resolved conifold as its transverse space. Whereas a fractional D3-brane on the resolved conifold is not supersymmetric and has a naked singularity, our solution is supersymmetric and regular everywhere. We also consider an $S^1$-wrapped D3-brane on the resolved cone over T^{1,1}/Z_2, as well as on the deformed conifold. In the former case, we obtain a regular supergravity dual to a certain four-dimensional field theory whose Lorentz and conformal symmetries are broken in the IR region and restored in the UV limit.
