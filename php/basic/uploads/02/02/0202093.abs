Abstract: We analyse the IR-singularities that appear in a noncommutative scalar quantum field theory on $\mathcal{E}_4$. We demonstrate with the help of the quadratic one-loop effective action and an appropriate field redefinition that no IR-singularities exist. No new degrees of freedom are needed to describe the UV/IR-mixing.
