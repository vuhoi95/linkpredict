Title: A model for time-dependent cosmological constant and its consistency  with the present Friedmann universe
Authors: M. Novello and J. Barcelos-Neto and J. M. Salim
Abstract: We use a model where the cosmological term can be related to the chiral gauge anomaly of a possible quantum scenario of the initial evolution of the universe. We show that this term is compatible with the Friedmann behavior of the present universe.
