Title: The role of the field redefinition in noncommutative Maxwell theory
Authors: I. Fruhwirth and J. M. Grimstrup and Z. Morsli and L. Popp and M. Schweda
Abstract: We discuss $\theta$-deformed Maxwell theory at first order in $\theta$ with the help of the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map. With an appropriate field redefinition consistent with the SW-map we analyse the one-loop corrections of the vacuum polarization of photons. We show that the radiative corrections obtained in a previous work may be described by the Ward-identity of the BRST-shift symmetry corresponding to a field redefinition.
