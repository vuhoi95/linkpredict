Title: An eight-dimensional approach to G_2 manifolds
Authors: Rafael Hernandez and Konstadinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to G_2 holonomy manifolds with an SU(2)xSU(2) isometry using maximal eight-dimensional gauged supergravity to describe D6-branes wrapped on deformed three-spheres. A quite general metric ansatz that generalizes the celebrated Bryant-Salamon metric involves nine functions. We show that only six of them are the independent ones and derive the general first order system of differential equations that they obey. As a byproduct of our analysis, we generalize the notion of the twist that relates the spin and gauge connections in a way that involves non-trivially the scalar fields.
