Title: Ground state energy in a wormhole space-time
Authors: Nail R. Khusnutdinov and Sergey V. Sushkov
Abstract: The ground state energy of the massive scalar field with non-conformal coupling $\xi$ on the short-throat flat-space wormhole background is calculated by using zeta renormalization approach. We discuss the renormalization and relevant heat kernel coefficients in detail. We show that the stable configuration of wormholes can exist for $\xi > 0.123$. In particular case of massive conformal scalar field with $\xi=1/6$, the radius of throat of stable wormhole $a\approx 0.16/m$. The self-consistent wormhole has radius of throat $a\approx 0.0141 l_p $ and mass of scalar boson $m\approx 11.35 m_p$ ($l_p$ and $m_p$ are the Planck length and mass, respectively).
