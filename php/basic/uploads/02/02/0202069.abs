Title: Kasner-like behaviour for subcritical Einstein-matter systems
Authors: Thibault Damour and Marc Henneaux and Alan D. Rendall and Marsha Weaver
Abstract: Confirming previous heuristic analyses \`a la Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz, it is rigorously proven that certain ``subcritical'' Einstein-matter systems exhibit a monotone, generalized Kasner behaviour in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity. The D-dimensional coupled Einstein-dilaton-p-form system is subcritical if the dilaton couplings of the p-forms belong to some dimension dependent open neighbourhood of zero, while pure gravity is subcritical if D is greater than or equal to 11. Our proof relies, like the recent theorem dealing with the (always subcritical) Einstein-dilaton system, on the use of Fuchsian techniques, which enable one to construct local, analytic solutions to the full set of equations of motion. The solutions constructed are ``general'' in the sense that they depend on the maximal expected number of free functions.
