Title: Nonlinear Holomorphic Supersymmetry on Riemann Surfaces
Authors: Sergey M. Klishevich and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry for quantum-mechanical systems on Riemann surfaces subjected to an external magnetic field. The realization is shown to be possible only for Riemann surfaces with constant curvature metrics. The cases of the sphere and Lobachevski plane are elaborated in detail. The partial algebraization of the spectrum of the corresponding Hamiltonians is proved by the reduction to one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable sl(2,R) families. It is found that these families possess the "duality" transformations, which form a discrete group of symmetries of the corresponding 1D potentials and partially relate the spectra of different 2D systems. The algebraic structure of the systems on the sphere and hyperbolic plane is explored in the context of the Onsager algebra associated with the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry. Inspired by this analysis, a general algebraic method for obtaining the covariant form of integrals of motion of the quantum systems in external fields is proposed.
