Title: Hamilton - Jacobi treatment of front-form Schwinger model
Authors: D. Baleanu and Y. Guler
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi formalism was applied to quantize the front-form Schwinger model. The importance of the surface term is discussed in detail. The BRST-anti-BRST symmetry was analyzed within Hamilton-Jacobi formalism.
