Title: QCD-Like Behaviour of High-Temperature Confining Strings
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We show that, contrary to previous string models, the high-temperature behaviour of the recently proposed confining strings reproduces exactly the correct large-N QCD result, a {\it necessary} condition for any string model of confinement.
