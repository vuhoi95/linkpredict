Title: Quantum dilaton gravity as a linear dilaton conformal field theory
Authors: M. Cadoni and P. Carta and S. Mignemi
Abstract: A model of matter-coupled gravity in two dimensions is quantized. The crucial requirement for performing the quantization is the vanishing of the conformal anomaly, which is achieved by tuning a parameter in the interaction potential. The spectrum of the theory is determined by mapping the model first onto a field theory with a Liouville interaction, then onto a linear dilaton conformal field theory. In absence of matter fields a pure gauge theory with massless ground state is found; otherwise it is possible to minimally couple up to 11 matter scalar fields: in this case the ground state is tachyonic and the matter sector decouples, like the transverse oscillators in the critical bosonic string.
