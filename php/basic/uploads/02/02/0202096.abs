Title: Stability of quantum states of finite macroscopic systems
Authors: Akira Shimizu and Takayuki Miyadera and Akihisa Ukena
Abstract: We study the stabilities of quantum states of macroscopic systems, against noises, against perturbations from environments, and against local measurements. We show that the stabilities are closely related to the cluster property, which describes the strength of spatial correlations of fluctuations of local observables, and to fluctuations of additive operators. The present theory has many applications, among which we discuss the mechanism of phase transitions in finite systems and quantum computers with a huge number of qubits.
