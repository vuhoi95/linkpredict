Abstract: On noncommutative spacetime, the Standard Model allows new, usually Standard Model forbidden, triple gauge boson interactions. In this letter we propose the Standard Model strictly forbidden Z -> gamma gamma and Z -> gg decay modes coming from the gauge sector of the Noncommutative Standard Model as a place where noncommutativity could be experimentally discovered.
