Title: Exact One-Point Function of N=1 super-Liouville Theory with Boundary
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Chaiho Rim and Marian Stanishkov
Abstract: In this paper, exact one-point functions of N=1 super-Liouville field theory in two-dimensional space-time with appropriate boundary conditions are presented. Exact results are derived both for the theory defined on a pseudosphere with discrete (NS) boundary conditions and for the theory with explicit boundary actions which preserves super conformal symmetries. We provide various consistency checks. We also show that these one-point functions can be related to a generalized Cardy conditions along with corresponding modular $S$-matrices. Using this result, we conjecture the dependence of the boundary two-point functions of the (NS) boundary operators on the boundary parameter.
