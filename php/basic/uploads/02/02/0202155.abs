Title: The Wilson-Polchinski Renormalization Group Equation in the Planar Limit
Authors: C. Becchi and S. Giusto and C. Imbimbo
Abstract: We derive the Wilson-Polchinski RG equation in the planar limit. We explain that the equation necessarily involves also non-planar amplitudes with sphere topology, which represent multi-trace contributions to the effective action. The resulting RG equation turns out to be of the Hamilton-Jacobi type since loop effects manifest themselves through terms which are linear in first order derivatives of the effective action with respect to the sources. We briefly outline applications to renormalization of non-commutative field theories, matrix models with external sources and holography.
