Title: Solitons in a Grassmannian sigma-model Coupled to Chern-Simons Term
Authors: Jin-Ho Cho and Phillial Oh and Jeong-Hyuck Park
Abstract: We propose an exactly solvable Grassmannian sigma-model coupled to the Chern-Simons theory. In the presence of a novel topological term our model admits exact self-dual vortex solutions which are identical to those of pure Grassmannian model, but the topological charge has a physical meaning as a magnetic flux since the gauge field is no longer auxiliary. We also extend the theory to a noncommutative plane and analyze the BPS solutions.
