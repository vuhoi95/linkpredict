Title: Marginal and Scalar Solutions in Cubic Open String Field Theory
Authors: Tomohiko Takahashi and Seriko Tanimoto
Abstract: We find marginal and scalar solutions in cubic open string field theory by using left-right splitting properties of a delta function. The marginal solution represents a marginal deformation generated by a U(1) current, and it is a generalized solution of the Wilson lines one given by the present authors. The scalar solution has a well-defined universal Fock space expression, and it is expressed as a singular gauge transform of the trivial vacuum. The expanded theory around it is unable to be connected with the original theory by the string field redefinition. Errors in hep-th/0112124 are corrected in this paper.
