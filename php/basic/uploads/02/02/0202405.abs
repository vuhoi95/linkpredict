Title: Energy Spectrum of Neutral Collective Excitations in Striped Hall States
Authors: T. Aoyama and K. Ishikawa and Y. Ishizuka and N. Maeda
Abstract: We investigate neutral collective excitations in the striped Hall state. In the striped Hall state, the magnetic translation and rotation symmetries are spontaneously broken. Using the commutation relation between charges and currents corresponding to the broken and unbroken symmetry, the existence of the gapless neutral excitation is proved. The spectrum of the neutral collective excitation at the half-filled third Landau level is obtained in the single mode approximation. We find the periodic line nodes in the spectrum. The spectrum is compared with the particle-hole excitation spectrum in the Hartree-Fock approximation.
