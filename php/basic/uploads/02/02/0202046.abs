Title: Quantum Multipole Noise and Generalized Quantum Stochastic Equations
Authors: A. N. Pechen and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: A notion of quantum multipole (in particular, dipole) noise is considered. Quantum dipole noise is an analogue of quantum white noise but it acts in a Fock space with indefinite metric. Quantum {\it white} noise describes the leading term in the stochastic limit approximation to quantum dynamics while quantum {\it multipole} noise describes the corrections to the leading term. We obtain and study the generalized quantum stochastic equations describing corrections to the stochastic limit which include quantum dipole noise.
