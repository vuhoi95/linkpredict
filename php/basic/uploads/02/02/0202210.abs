Title: Classification of 6-dimensional real Drinfeld doubles
Authors: L. Snobl and L. Hlavaty
Abstract: Starting from the classification of real Manin triples done in a previous paper we look for those that are isomorphic as 6-dimensional Lie algebras with the ad-invariant form used for construction of the Manin triples. We use several invariants of the Lie algebras to distinguish the non-isomorphic structures and give explicit form of maps between Manin triples that are decompositions of isomorphic Drinfeld doubles. The result is a complete list of 6-dimensional real Drinfeld doubles. It consists of 22 classes of non-isomorphic Drinfeld doubles.
