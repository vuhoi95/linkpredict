Title: Some Irrational Generalised Moonshine from Orbifolds
Authors: Rossen I. Ivanov and Michael P. Tuite
Abstract: We verify the Generalised Moonshine conjectures for some irrational modular functions for the Monster centralisers related to the Harada-Norton, Held, $M_{12}$ and $L_3(3)$ simple groups based on certain orbifolding constraints. We find explicitly the fixing groups of the hauptmoduls arising in each case.
