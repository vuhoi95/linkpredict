Title: Quantum effects in the scattering by the magnetic field of a solenoid
Authors: Gabriela Murguia and Matias Moreno
Abstract: We present a relativistic quantum calculation at first order in perturbation theory of the differential cross section for a Dirac particle scattered by the magnetic field of a solenoid. The resulting cross section is symmetric in the scattering angle as those obtained by Aharonov and Bohm (AB) in the string limit and by Landau and Lifshitz (LL) for the non relativistic case. We show that taking pr_0 sin(theta/2) << 1 in our expression of the differential cross section it reduces to that one reported by AB, and if additionally we assume theta << 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL. However, these limits are explicitly singular in hbar as opposed to our initial result. We analyse the singular behavior in hbar and show that the perturbative Planck limit (hbar -> 0) is consistent, contrarily to those of the AB and LL expressions.
