Title: An integrable system on the moduli space of rational functions and its  variants
Authors: Kanehisa Takasaki and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: We study several integrable Hamiltonian systems on the moduli spaces of meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces (the Riemann sphere, a cylinder and a torus). The action-angle variables and the separated variables (in Sklyanin's sense) are related via a canonical transformation, the generating function of which is the Abel-Jacobi type integral of the Seiberg-Witten differential over the spectral curve.
