Title: String inspired braneworld cosmology
Authors: Cristiano Germani and Carlos F. Sopuerta
Abstract: We consider braneworld scenarios including the leading correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action suggested by superstring theory, the Gauss-Bonnet term. We obtain and study the complete set of equations governing the cosmological dynamics. We find they have the same form as those in Randall-Sundrum scenarios but with time-varying four-dimensional gravitational and cosmological constants. Studying the bulk geometry we show that this variation is produced by bulk curvature terms parameterized by the mass of a black hole. Finally, we show there is a coupling between these curvature terms and matter that can be relevant for early universe cosmology.
