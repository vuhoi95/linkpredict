Abstract: Braneworld cosmology for a domain wall embedded in the charged (Anti)-de Sitter-Schwarzschildblack hole of the five--dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell theory is considered. The effective Friedmann equation for the brane is derived by introducing the necessary surface counterterms required for a well-defined variational principlein the Gauss--Bonnet theory and for the finiteness of the bulk space. The asymptotic dynamics of the brane cosmology is determined and it is found that solutions with vanishingly small spatial volume are unphysical. The finiteness of the bulk action is related to the vanishing of the effective cosmological constant on the brane. An analogy between the Friedmann equation and a generalized Cardy--Verlinde formula is drawn.
