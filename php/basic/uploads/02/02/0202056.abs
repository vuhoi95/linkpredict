Title: A Gravity Dual of the Chiral Anomaly
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Peter Ouyang and Edward Witten
Abstract: We study effects associated with the chiral anomaly for a cascading $SU(N+M)\times SU(N)$ gauge theory using gauge/gravity duality. In the gravity dual the anomaly is a classical feature of the supergravity solution, and the breaking of the U(1) R-symmetry down to ${\bf Z}_{2M}$ proceeds via the Higgs mechanism.
