Title: On Signatures of Short Distance Physics in the Cosmic Microwave  Background
Authors: Robert H. Brandenberger and Jerome Martin
Abstract: Following a self-contained review of the basics of the theory of cosmological perturbations, we discuss why the conclusions reached in the recent paper by Kaloper et al are too pessimistic estimates of the amplitude of possible imprints of trans-Planckian (string) physics on the spectrum of cosmic microwave anisotropies in an inflationary Universe. It is shown that the likely origin of large trans-Planckian effects on late time cosmological fluctuations comes from nonadiabatic evolution of the state of fluctuations while the wavelength is smaller than the Planck (string) scale, resulting in an excited state at the time that the wavelength crosses the Hubble radius during inflation.
