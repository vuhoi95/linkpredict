Title: Two-Time Correlation Functions: Stochastic and Conventional Quantum  Mechanics
Authors: L. Feligioni and O. Panella and Y. N. Srivastava and A. Widom
Abstract: An investigation of two-time correlation functions is reported within the framework of (i) Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and (ii) conventional Heisenberg-Schr\"odinger Quantum Mechanics. The spectral functions associated with the two-time electric dipole correlation functions are worked out in detail for the case of the hydrogen atom. While the single time averages are identical for stochastic and conventional quantum mechanics, differences arise in the two approaches for multiple time correlation functions.
