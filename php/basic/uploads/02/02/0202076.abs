Title: Black hole area quantization
Authors: Saurya Das and P. Ramadevi and U. A. Yajnik
Abstract: It has been argued by several authors that the quantum mechanical spectrum of black hole horizon area must be discrete. This has been confirmed in different formalisms, using different approaches. Here we concentrate on two approaches, the one involving quantization on a reduced phase space of collective coordinates of a Black Hole and the algebraic approach of Bekenstein. We show that for non-rotating, neutral black holes in any spacetime dimension, the approaches are equivalent. We introduce a primary set of operators sufficient for expressing the dynamical variables of both, thus mapping the observables in the two formalisms onto each other. The mapping predicts a Planck size remnant for the black hole.
