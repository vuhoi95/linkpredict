Title: Generalized Superfield Lagrangian Quantization
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and L. A. Malysheva and P. Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We consider an extension of the gauge-fixing procedure in the framework of the Lagrangian superfield BRST and BRST-antiBRST quantization schemes for arbitrary gauge theories, taking into account the possible ambiguity in the choice of the superfield antibracket. We show that this ambiguity is fixed by the algebraic properties of the antibracket and the form of the BRST and antiBRST transformations, realized in terms of superspace translations. The Ward identities related to the generalized gauge-fixing procedure are obtained.
