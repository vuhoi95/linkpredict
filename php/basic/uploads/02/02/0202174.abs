Title: Diluting Cosmological Constant In Infinite Volume Extra Dimensions
Authors: Gia Dvali and Gregory Gabadadze and M. Shifman
Abstract: We argue that the cosmological constant problem can be solved in a braneworld model with infinite-volume extra dimensions, avoiding no-go arguments applicable to theories that are four-dimensional in the infrared. Gravity on the brane becomes higher-dimensional at super-Hubble distances, which entails that the relation between the acceleration rate and vacuum energy density flips upside down compared to the conventional one. The acceleration rate decreases with increasing the energy density. The experimentally acceptable rate is obtained for the energy density larger than (1 TeV)$^4$. The results are stable under quantum corrections because supersymmetry is broken only on the brane and stays exact in the bulk of infinite volume extra space. Consistency of 4D gravity and cosmology on the brane requires the quantum gravity scale to be around $10^{-3}$ eV. Testable predictions emerging within this approach are: (i) simultaneous modifications of gravity at sub-millimeter and the Hubble scales; (ii) Hagedorn-type saturation in TeV energy collisions due to the Regge spectrum with the spacing equal to $10^{-3}$ eV.
