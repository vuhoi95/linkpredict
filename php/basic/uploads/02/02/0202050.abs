Title: Exciton in Matrix Formulation of Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Yuko Kobashi and Bhabani Prasad Mandal and Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect is studied by introducing two different matrix variables for electrons and holes, having Chern-Simons type interactions. By generalizing the constraint condition proposed by Susskind to realize the Pauli's exclusion principle in this two component matrix model, the classical exciton solution having excitation of both quasi-electron and quasi-hole is obtained. The constraint condition is also solved quantum mechanically in the infinite-sized matrix case, giving the examples of the physical states. Using these quantum states, the corrections of the exciton energy, coming from the noncommutativity of space (Pauli principle) and from the quantum effects of the background state, are estimated in the lowest order perturbation expansion. As a result, the dispersion relation of exciton is obtained.
