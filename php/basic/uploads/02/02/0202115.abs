Title: An unconventional supergravity
Authors: Dimitry Leites and Pavel Grozman
Abstract: We introduce and completely describe the analogues of the Riemann curvature tensor for the curved supergrassmannian of the passing through the origin (0|2)-dimensional subsupermanifolds in the (0|4)-dimensional supermanifold with the preserved volume form. The underlying manifold of this supergrassmannian is the conventional Penrose's complexified and compactified version of the Minkowski space, i.e., the Grassmannian of 2-dimensional subspaces in the 4-dimensional space. The result provides with yet another counterexample to Coleman-Mandula's theorem.
