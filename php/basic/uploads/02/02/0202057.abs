Title: Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds
Authors: Anamaria Font and Alexis Hernandez
Abstract: We study compact non-supersymmetric Z_N orbifolds in various dimensions. We compute the spectrum of several tachyonic type II and heterotic examples and partially classify tachyon-free heterotic models. We also discuss the relation to compactification on K3 and Calabi-Yau manifolds.
