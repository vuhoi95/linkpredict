Title: On the Spectrum of Holonomy Algebras
Authors: Maria Cristina Abbati and Alessandro Mania`
Abstract: Connections on a trivial bundle MxG can be identified with their holonomy maps, i.e. with homomorphisms of a groupoid of paths in M into the gauge group G. For a connected compact G, various algebras depending on the set of the smooth connections through their holonomy maps have been introduced in the literature, called cylindrical and holonomy algebras. We discuss the relations between these algebras and the consistence of their spectra.
