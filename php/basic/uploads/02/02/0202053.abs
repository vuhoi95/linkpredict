Title: Topological gauge theories with antisymmetric tensor matter fields
Authors: B. Geyer and D. M"ulsch
Abstract: A new type of topological matter interactions involving second-rank antisymmetric tensor matter fields with an underlying $N_T \geq 1$ topological supersymmetry are proposed. The construction of the 4-dimensional, $N_T = 1$ Donaldson-Witten theory, the $N_T = 1$ super-BF model and the $N_T = 2$ topological B-model with tensor matter are explicitly worked out.
