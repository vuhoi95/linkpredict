Title: Geometric Origin of CP Violation in an Extra-Dimensional Brane World
Authors: David Dooling and Damien A. Easson and Kyungsik Kang
Abstract: The fermion mass hierarchy and finding a predictive mechanism of the flavor mixing parameters remain two of the least understood puzzles facing particle physics today. In this work, we demonstrate how the realization of the Dirac algebra in the presence of two extra spatial dimensions leads to complex fermion field profiles in the extra dimensions. Dimensionally reducing to four dimensions leads to complex quark mass matrices in such a fashion that CP violation necessarily follows. We also present the generalization of the Randall-Sundrum scenario to the case of a multi-brane, six-dimensional brane-world and discuss how multi-brane worlds may shed light on the generation index of the SM matter content.
