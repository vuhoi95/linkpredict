Title: Near-Extremal Black Hole Evaporation in Asymptotically Flat Spacetime
Authors: Kamran Diba and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We study black hole evaporation of near-extremal black holes in spherically reduced models with asymptotically Minkowskian spacetime, with the effects of the back-reaction on the geometry included semi-classically. The stress-energy tensor is calculated for null in-falling observers. It is shown that the evaporation proceeds smoothly and there are no instabilities of the outer or inner apparent horizon before the endpoint of evaporation.
