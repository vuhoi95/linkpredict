Title: Gravitational radiation from collisions at the speed of light: a  massless particle falling into a Schwarzschild black hole
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We compute spectra, waveforms, angular distribution and total gravitational energy of the gravitiational radiation emitted during the radial infall of a massless particle into a Schwarzschild black hole. Our fully relativistic approach shows that (i) less than 50% of the total energy radiated to infinity is carried by quadrupole waves, (ii) the spectra is flat, and (iii) the zero frequency limit agrees extremely well with a prediction by Smarr. This process may be looked at as the limiting case of collisions between massive particles traveling at nearly the speed of light, by identifying the energy $E$ of the massless particle with $m_0 \gamma$, $m_0$ being the mass of the test particle and $\gamma$ the Lorentz boost parameter. We comment on the implications for the two black hole collision at nearly the speed of light process, where we obtain a 13.3% wave generation efficiency, and compare our results with previous results by D'Eath and Payne.
