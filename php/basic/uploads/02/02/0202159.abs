Authors: Jae-weon Lee and Eok Kyun Lee and Hae Myoung Kwon and In-gyu Koh and Yeong Deok Han
Abstract: The equation describing the stochastic motion of a classical particle in 1+1-dimensional space-time is connected to the Dirac equation with external gauge fields. The effects of assigning different turning probabilities to the forward and the backward moving particles in time are discussed.
