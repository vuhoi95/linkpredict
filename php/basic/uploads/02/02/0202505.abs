Title: Strong Primordial Inhomogeneities and Galaxy Formation
Authors: M. Yu. Khlopov and S. G. Rubin and A. S. Sakharov
Abstract: The new element of theory of galaxy formation, strong primordial inhomogeneities, is shown to be a reflection of unstable large scale structures of topological defects, created in second order phase transitions in the inflationary Universe. In addition to {\it archioles-like} large scale correlation of the primordial inhomogeneity of energy density of coherent scalar field oscillations, the same mechanism, based on the second order phase transitions on the inflational stage and the domain wall formation upon the end of inflation, leads to the formation of massive black hole clusters that can serve as nuclei for the future galaxies. The number of black holes with $M \sim 100M_{\odot}$ and above is comparable with the number of galaxies within the modern cosmological horizon. The primordial fractal structure of galaxies can find natural grounds in the framework of model we developed . The proposed approach offers the physical basis for new scenarios of galaxy formation in the Big Bang Universe.
