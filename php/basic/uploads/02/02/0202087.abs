Title: Open String Star as a Continuous Moyal Product
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Hong Liu and Gregory Moore and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: We establish that the open string star product in the zero momentum sector can be described as a continuous tensor product of mutually commuting two dimensional Moyal star products. Let the continuous variable $\kappa \in [~0,\infty)$ parametrize the eigenvalues of the Neumann matrices; then the noncommutativity parameter is given by $\theta(\kappa) =2\tanh(\pi\kappa/4)$. For each $\kappa$, the Moyal coordinates are a linear combination of even position modes, and the Fourier transform of a linear combination of odd position modes. The commuting coordinate at $\kappa=0$ is identified as the momentum carried by half the string. We discuss the relation to Bars' work, and attempt to write the string field action as a noncommutative field theory.
