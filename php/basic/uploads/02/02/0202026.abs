Title: Nonlinear QM as a fractal Brownian motion with complex diffusion  constant
Authors: Carlos Castro and Jorge Mahecha and Boris Rodriguez
Abstract: A new nonlinear Schroedinger equation is obtained explicitly from the fractal Brownian motion of a massive particle with a complex-valued diffusion constant. Real-valued energy (momentum) plane wave and soliton solutions are found in the free particle case. The hydro-dynamical model analog yields another (new) nonlinear QM wave equation with physically meaningful soliton solutions. One remarkable feature of this nonlinear Schroedinger equation based on a fractal Brownian motion model, over all the other nonlinear QM models, is that the quantum-mechanical energy functional coincides with the field theory one.
