Title: Graviton correlator and metric perturbations in de Sitter brane-world
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Sachiko Ogushi
Abstract: We consider de Sitter brane-world motivated by dS/CFT correspondence where both bulk and brane are de Sitter spaces. The brane tension is fixed by holographic RG. The 4d effective action for metric perturbations and 4d graviton correlator are explicitly found. The induced values of cosmological and Newton constants are calculated. The short distance behaviour of the graviton correlator (when no brane matter presents) turns out to be significally stronger than in the case of General Relativity. It is shown that quantum brane CFT gives the dominant contribution to graviton correlator on small scales like in Brane New World scenario.
