Title: From Super-AdS_5xS^5 Algebra to Super-pp-wave Algebra
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Makoto Sakaguchi
Abstract: The isometry algebras of the maximally supersymmetric solutions of IIB supergravity are derived by the Inonu-Wigner contractions of the super-AdS_5xS^5 algebra. The super-AdS_5xS^5 algebra allows introducing two contraction parameters; the one for the Penrose limit to the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave algebra and the AdS_5xS^5 radius for the flat limit. The fact that the Jacobi identity of three supercharges holds irrespectively of these parameters reflects the fact that the number of supersymmetry is not affected under both contractions.
