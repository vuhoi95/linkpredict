Title: Classification of 6-dimensional real Manin triples
Authors: L. Hlavaty and L. Snobl
Abstract: We present a complete list of 6-dimensional Manin triples or, equivalently, of 3-dimensional Lie bialgebras. We start from the well known classification of 3-dimensional real Lie algebras and assume the canonical bilinear form on the 6-dimensional Drinfeld double. Then we solve the Jacobi identities for the dual algebras. Finally we find mutually non-isomorphic Manin triples. The complete list consists of 78 classes of Manin triples, or 44 Lie bialgebras if one considers dual bialgebras equivalent.
