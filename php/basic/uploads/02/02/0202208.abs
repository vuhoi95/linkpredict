Title: Orientifolds, Mirror Symmetry and Superpotentials
Authors: Bobby Acharya and Mina Aganagic and Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We consider orientifolds of Calabi-Yau 3-folds in the context of Type IIA and Type IIB superstrings. We show how mirror symmetry can be used to sum up worldsheet instanton contributions to the superpotential for Type IIA superstrings. The relevant worldsheets have the topology of the disc and ${\bf RP^2}$.
