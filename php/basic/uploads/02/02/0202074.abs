Title: Quantum solution to the Newcomb's paradox
Authors: E. W. Piotrowski and J. Sladkowski
Abstract: We show that quantum game theory offers solution to the famous Newcomb's paradox (free will problem). Divine foreknowledge is not necessary for successful completion of the game because quantum theory offers a way to discern human intentions in such way that the human retain her/his free will but cannot profit from changing decision. Possible interpretation in terms of quantum market games is proposed.
