Title: Quantum tunneling of superconducting string currents
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Ken D. Olum and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: We investigate the decay of current on a superconducting cosmic string through quantum tunneling. We construct the instanton describing tunneling in a simple bosonic string model, and estimate the decay rate. The tunneling rate vanishes in the limit of a chiral current. This conclusion, which is supported by a symmetry argument, is expected to apply in general. It has important implications for the stability of chiral vortons.
