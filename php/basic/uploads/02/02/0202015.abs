Title: On the Berezin Description of Kahler Quotients
Authors: Iliana Carrillo-Ibarra and Hugo Garcia-Compean
Abstract: We survey geometric quantization of finite dimensional affine Kahler manifolds. Its corresponding prequantization and the Berezin's deformation quantization formulation, as proposed by Cahen et al., is used to quantize their corresponding Kahler quotients. Equivariant formalism greatly facilitates the description.
