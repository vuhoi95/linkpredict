Title: Noncoaxial multivortices in the complex sine-Gordon theory on the plane
Authors: I. V. Barashenkov and V. S. Shchesnovich and R. Adams
Abstract: We construct explicit multivortex solutions for the complex sine-Gordon equation (the Lund-Regge model) in two Euclidean dimensions. Unlike the previously found (coaxial) multivortices, the new solutions comprise $n$ single vortices placed at arbitrary positions (but confined within a finite part of the plane.) All multivortices, including the single vortex, have an infinite number of parameters. We also show that, in contrast to the coaxial complex sine-Gordon multivortices, the axially-symmetric solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau model (the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equation) {\it do not} belong to a broader family of noncoaxial multivortex configurations.
