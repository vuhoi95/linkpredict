Title: Microlocal analysis of quantum fields on curved spacetimes: Analytic  wavefront sets and Reeh-Schlieder theorems
Authors: Alexander Strohmaier and Rainer Verch and Manfred Wollenberg
Abstract: We show in this article that the Reeh-Schlieder property holds for states of quantum fields on real analytic spacetimes if they satisfy an analytic microlocal spectrum condition. This result holds in the setting of general quantum field theory, i.e. without assuming the quantum field to obey a specific equation of motion. Moreover, quasifree states of the Klein-Gordon field are further investigated in this work and the (analytic) microlocal spectrum condition is shown to be equivalent to simpler conditions. We also prove that any quasifree ground- or KMS-state of the Klein-Gordon field on a stationary real analytic spacetime fulfills the analytic microlocal spectrum condition.
