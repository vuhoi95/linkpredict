Title: Positivity of High Density Effective Theory
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Stephen D. H. Hsu
Abstract: We show that the effective field theory of low energy modes in dense QCD has positive Euclidean path integral measure. The complexity of the measure of QCD at finite chemical potential can be ascribed to modes which are irrelevant to the dynamics at sufficiently high density. Rigorous inequalities follow at asymptotic density. Lattice simulation of dense QCD should be possible using the quark determinant calculated in the effective theory.
