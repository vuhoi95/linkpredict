Title: Microscopic Black Holes as a Source of Ultrahigh Energy gamma-rays
Authors: Roberto Casadio and Benjamin Harms and Octavian Micu
Abstract: We investigate the idea that ultrahigh energy gamma-rays (E>10 TeV) can be produced when charged particles are accelerated by microscopic black holes. We begin by showing that microscopic black holes may exist as remnants of primordial black holes or as products of the collisions in the large extra dimensions scenario of high energy cosmic rays with atmospheric particles. We then solve Maxwell's equations on curved spacetime backgrounds in 4, 5 and 6 dimensions and use the solutions to calculate the energy distributions. From the latter we obtain the black hole parameters needed to produce the energies of the observed gamma-rays.
