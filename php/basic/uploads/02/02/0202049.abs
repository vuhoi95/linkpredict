Title: Brane-Bulk Interaction in Topological Theory
Authors: A. Boyarsky and B. Kulik
Abstract: In this letter we address the problem of inducing boundary degrees of freedom from a bulk theory whose action contains higher-derivative corrections. As a model example we consider a topological theory with an action that has only a ``higher-derivative'' term. By choosing specific coupling of the brane to the bulk we show that the boundary action contains gravity action along with some higher-derivative corrections. The co-dimension of the brane is more than one. In this sense the boundary is singular.
