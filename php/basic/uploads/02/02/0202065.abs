Title: Duality in non-commutative gauge theories as a non-perturbative  Seiberg-Witten map
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Corneliu Sochichiu
Abstract: We study the equivalence/duality between various non-commutative gauge models at the classical and quantum level. The duality is realised by a linear Seiberg-Witten-like map. The infinitesimal form of this map is analysed in more details.
