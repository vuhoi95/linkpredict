Title: Strings in flat space and pp waves from ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang Mills
Authors: David Berenstein and Juan Maldacena and Horatiu Nastase
Abstract: We explain how the string spectrum in flat space and pp-waves arises from the large $N$ limit, at fixed $g^2_{YM}$, of U(N) ${\cal N} =4$ super Yang Mills. We reproduce the spectrum by summing a subset of the planar Feynman diagrams. We give a heuristic argument for why we can neglect other diagrams. We also discuss some other aspects of pp-waves and we present a matrix model associated to the DLCQ description of the maximally supersymmetric eleven dimensional pp-waves.
