Title: Dynamical Behavior of dilaton in de Sitter space
Authors: H. W. Lee and Y. S. Myung
Abstract: We study the dynamical behavior of the dilaton in the background of three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space which is inspired from the low-energy string effective action. The perturbation analysis around the cosmological horizon of Kerr-de Sitter space reveals a mixing between the dilaton and other fields. Introducing a gauge (dilaton gauge), we can disentangle this mixing completely and obtain one decoupled dilaton equation. However it turns out that this belongs to the tachyon. The stability of de Sitter solution with J=0 is discussed. Finally we compute the dilaton absorption cross section to extract information on the cosmological horizon of de Sitter space.
