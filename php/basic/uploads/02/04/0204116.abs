Title: Time-dependent driven anharmonic oscillator and the adiabaticity
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We use the Liouville-von Neumann (LvN) approach to study the dynamics and the adiabaticity of a time-dependent driven anharmonic oscillator as an eample of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that the adiabaticity is minimally broken in the sense that a gaussian wave-packet at the past infinity evolves to coherent states, however slowly the potential changes, its coherence factor is order of the coupling. We also show that the dynamics are governed by an equation of motion similar to the Kepler motion which satisfies the angular momentum conservation.
