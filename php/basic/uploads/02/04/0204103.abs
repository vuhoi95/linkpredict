Title: Aspects of supertubes
Authors: Martin Kruczenski and Robert C. Myers and Amanda W. Peet and David J. Winters
Abstract: We find supersymmetric solutions of the D4 brane Born-Infeld action describing D2 supertubes ending on an arbitrary curve inside a D4 brane. From the D4 brane point of view, these are dyonic strings. We also consider various higher dimensional extensions of the usual supertubes, involving expanded D4 and D3 brane configurations. Finally, considering the worldsheet theory for open strings on a supertube, we show that this configuration is an exact solution to all orders in alpha'. Further the causal structure of the open-string metric provides new insight into the arbitrary cross-section of the supertube solutions. From this point of view, it is similar to the arbitrary profile that appears for certain null plane waves.
