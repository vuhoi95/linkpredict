Title: One-loop renormalization of the Yang-Mills theory with BRST-invariant  mass term
Authors: E. Andriyash and K. Stepanyantz
Abstract: Divergent part of the one-loop effective action for the Yang-Mills theory in a special gauge containing forth degrees of ghost fields and allowing addition of BRST-invariant mass term is calculated by the generalized t'Hooft-Veltman technique. The result is BRST-invariant and defines running mass, coupling constant and parameter of the gauge.
