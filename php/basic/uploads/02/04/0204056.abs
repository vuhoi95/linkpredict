Title: Marginal perturbations of N=4 Yang-Mills as deformations of AdS$_5\times  S^5$
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Subir Mukhopadhyay
Abstract: We study constant dilaton supersymmetric solutions of type IIB Supergravity with 5-form and 3-form flux with isometry group U(1) $\times$$Z_3$. Some of these solutions correspond to marginal perturbations of N=4 Yang-Mills. We find one line of solutions in particular of AdS$_5$ fibred over an $S^5$. This line is described by a single complex parameter. AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ is obtained when this partameter is tuned to zero.
