Title: Matrix models on the fuzzy sphere
Authors: Brian P. Dolan and Denjoe O'Connor and Peter Presnajder
Abstract: Field theory on a fuzzy noncommutative sphere can be considered as a particular matrix approximation of field theory on the standard commutative sphere. We investigate from this point of view the scalar $\phi^4$ theory. We demonstrate that the UV/IR mixing problems of this theory are localized to the tadpole diagrams and can be removed by an appropiate (fuzzy) normal ordering of the $\phi^4$ vertex. The perturbative expansion of this theory reduces in the commutative limit to that on the commutative sphere.
