Title: Representation Theory and the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method: The  Open Toda Chain and the Hyperbolic Sutherland Model
Authors: A. Gerasimov and S. Kharchev and D. Lebedev
Abstract: Using the representation theory of $\frak{gl}(N,\RR)$, we express the wave function of the $GL(N,\RR)$ Toda chain, which two of us recently obtained by the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method, in terms of multiple integrals. The main tool is our generalization of the Gelfand-Zetlin method to the case of infinite-dimensional representations of $\frak{gl}(N,\RR)$. The interpretation of this generalized construction in terms of the coadjoint orbits is given and the connection with the Yangian $Y(\frak{gl}(N))$ is discussed. We also give the hyperbolic Sutherland model eigenfunctions expressed in terms of integrals in the Gelfand-Zetlin representation. Using the example of the open Toda chain, we discuss the connection between the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and Representation Theory.
