Title: Stability of the Higgs mass in theories with extra dimensions
Authors: D. M. Ghilencea and H. P. Nilles
Abstract: We analyze the ultraviolet stability of the Higgs mass in recently proposed Kaluza-Klein models compactified on S_1/Z_2 or S_1/(Z_2\times Z_2'), both at the field theory and string theory level. Fayet-Iliopoulos terms of U(1) hypercharge are shown to be of vital importance for this discussion. Models with a single Higgs doublet seem to be generically affected by quadratic divergences.
