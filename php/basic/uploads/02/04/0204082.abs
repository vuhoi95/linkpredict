Title: Finite Temperature Induced Fermion Number In The Nonlinear sigma Model  In (2+1) Dimensions
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Justo Lopez-Sarrion and Kumar Rao
Abstract: We compute the finite temperature induced fermion number for fermions coupled to a static nonlinear sigma model background in (2+1) dimensions, in the derivative expansion limit. While the zero temperature induced fermion number is well known to be topological (it is the winding number of the background), at finite temperature there is a temperature dependent correction that is nontopological -- this finite T correction is sensitive to the detailed shape of the background. At low temperature we resum the derivative expansion to all orders, and we consider explicit forms of the background as a CP^1 instanton or as a baby skyrmion.
