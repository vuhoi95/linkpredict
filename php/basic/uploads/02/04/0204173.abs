Title: Noncommutative gravity in three dimensions coupled to spinning sources
Authors: Kiyoshi Shiraishi and Kenji Sakamoto and Nahomi Kan
Abstract: Noncommutative gravity in three dimensions with vanishing cosmological constant is examined. We find a solution which describes a spacetime in the presence of a torsional source. We estimate the phase shift for each partial wave of a scalar field in the spacetime by the Born approximation.
