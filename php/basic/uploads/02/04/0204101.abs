Title: Axisymmetric Gravitational Solutions as Possible Classical Backgrounds  around Closed String Mass Distributions
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: By studying singularities in stationary axisymmetric Kerr and Tomimatsu-Sato solutions with distortion parameter \d = 2, 3, ... in general relativity, we conclude that these singularities can be regarded as nothing other than closed string-like circular mass distributions. We use two different regularizations to identify \d-function type singularities in the energy-momentum tensor for these solutions, realizing a regulator independent result. This result gives supporting evidence that these axisymmetric exact solutions may well be the classical solutions around closed string-like mass distributions, just like Schwarzschild solution corresponding to a point mass distribution. In other words, these axisymmetric exact solutions may well provide the classical backgrounds around closed strings.
