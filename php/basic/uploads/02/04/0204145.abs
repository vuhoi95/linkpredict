Title: Duality and Spontaneously Broken Supergravity in Flat Backgrounds
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and M. A. Lledo
Abstract: It is shown that the super Higgs mechanism that occurs in a wide class of models with vanishing cosmological constant (at the classical level) is obtained by the gauging of a flat group which must be an electric subgroup of the duality group. If the residual massive gravitinos which occur in the partial supersymmetry breaking are BPS saturated, then the flat group is non abelian. This is so for all the models obtained by a Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking mechanism. If gravitinos occur in long multiplets, then the flat groups may be abelian. This is the case of supersymmetry breaking by string compactifications on an orientifold T^6/Z_2 with non trivial brane fluxes.
