Title: Possible Effects of Noncommutative Geometry on Weak CP Violation and  Unitarity Triangles
Authors: Zhe Chang and Zhi-zhong Xing
Abstract: Possible effects of noncommutative geometry on weak CP violation and unitarity triangles are discussed by taking account of a simple version of the momentum-dependent quark mixing matrix in the noncommutative standard model. In particular, we calculate nine rephasing invariants of CP violation and illustrate the noncommutative CP-violating effect in a couple of charged D-meson decays. We also show how inner angles of the deformed unitarity triangles are related to CP-violating asymmetries in some typical B_d and B_s transitions into CP eigenstates. B-meson factories are expected to help probe or constrain noncommutative geometry at low energies in the near future.
