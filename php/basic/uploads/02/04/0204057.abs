Title: Bosonization and Duality in Arbitrary Dimensions: New Results
Authors: M. Botta Cantcheff and J. A. HelayÃ«l-Neto
Abstract: A generic massive Thirring Model in three space-time dimensions exhibits a correspondence with a topologically massive bosonized gauge action associated to a self-duality constraint, and we write down a general expression for this relationship. We also generalize this structure to $d$ dimensions, by adopting the so-called doublet approach, recently introduced. In particular, a non- conventional formulation of the bosonization technique in higher dimensions (in the spirit of $d=3$), is proposed and, as an application, we show how fermionic (Thirring-like) representations for bosonic topologically massive models in four dimensions may be built up.
