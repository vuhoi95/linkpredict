Title: N=2-Supersymmetric Dynamics of a Spin-1/2 Particle in an Extended  External Field
Authors: G. S. Dias and J. A. Helayel-Neto
Abstract: One considers the quantum dynamics of a charged spin-1/2 particle in an extended external eletromagnetic field that arises from the reduction of a 5-dimensional Abelian gauge theory. The non-relativistic regime of the reduced 4D-dynamics is worked out and one identifies the system as a sector of an N=2-supersymmetric quantum-mechanical dynamics. The full supersymmetric model is studied and one checks the algebra of the fermionic charges; the conclusion is that no central charge drops out. The possible r\^ole of the extra external fields, a scalar and a magnetic-like field, is discussed.
