Title: Inflation from a Tachyon Fluid?
Authors: Malcolm Fairbairn and Michel H. G. Tytgat
Abstract: Motivated by recent works of Sen and Gibbons, we study the evolution of a flat and homogeneous universe dominated by tachyon matter. In particular, we analyse the necessary conditions for inflation in the early roll of a single tachyon field.
