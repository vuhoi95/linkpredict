Title: Conservation laws in the teleparallel theory with a positive  cosmological constant
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: We study the conservation laws in the teleparallel theory with a positive cosmological constant, an extension of the teleparallel theory possessing solutions with de Sitter asymptotics. Demanding that the canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetry are well defined, we obtain their improved form, which defines the conserved charges of the theory. The physical interpretation of the results is discussed.
