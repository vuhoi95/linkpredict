Title: On Decoupling of Massless Modes in NCOS Theories
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Sangmin Lee and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: We revisit the decoupling phenomenon of massless modes in the noncommutative open string (NCOS) theories. We check the decoupling by explicit computation in (2+1) or higher dimensional NCOS theories and recapitulate the validity of the decoupling to all orders in perturbation theory.
