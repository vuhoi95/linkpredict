Title: Sine-Gordon breather form factors and quantum field equations
Authors: H. Babujian and M. Karowski
Abstract: Using the results of previous investigations on sine-Gordon form factors exact expressions of all breather matrix elements are obtained for several operators: all powers of the fundamental bose field, general exponentials of it, the energy momentum tensor and all higher currents. Formulae for the asymptotic behavior of bosonic form factors are presented which are motivated by Weinberg's power counting theorem in perturbation theory. It is found that the quantum sine-Gordon field equation holds and an exact relation between the ``bare'' mass and the renormalized mass is obtained. Also a quantum version of a classical relation for the trace of the energy momentum is proven. The eigenvalue problem for all higher conserved charges is solved. All results are compared with perturbative Feynman graph expansions and full agreement is found.
