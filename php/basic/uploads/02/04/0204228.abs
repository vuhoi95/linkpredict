Title: Phenomenology of Randall-Sundrum Black Holes
Authors: Luis A. Anchordoqui and Haim Goldberg and Alfred D. Shapere
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of microscopic black holes in the $S^1/Z_2$ Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We consider the canonical framework in which both gauge and matter fields are confined to the brane and only gravity spills into the extra dimension. The model is characterized by two parameters, the mass of the first massive graviton $(m_1)$, and the curvature $1/\ell$ of the RS anti-de Sitter space. We compute the sensitivity of present and future cosmic ray experiments to various regions of $\ell$ and $m_1,$ and compare with that of Runs I and II at the Tevatron. As part of our phenomenological analysis, we examine constraints placed on $\ell$ by AdS/CFT considerations.
