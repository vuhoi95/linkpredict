Title: Strings in a Time-Dependent Orbifold
Authors: Hong Liu and Gregory Moore and Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We consider string theory in a time dependent orbifold with a null singularity. The singularity separates a contracting universe from an expanding universe, thus constituting a big crunch followed by a big bang. We quantize the theory both in light-cone gauge and covariantly. We also compute some tree and one loop amplitudes which exhibit interesting behavior near the singularity. Our results are compatible with the possibility that strings can pass through the singularity from the contracting to the expanding universe, but they also indicate the need for further study of certain divergent scattering amplitudes.
