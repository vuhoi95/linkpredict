Title: Torus Chiral n-Point Functions for Free Boson and Lattice Vertex  Operator Algebras
Authors: Geoffrey Mason and Michael P. Tuite
Abstract: We obtain explicit expressions for all genus one chiral n-point functions for free bosonic and lattice vertex operator algebras. We also consider the elliptic properties of these functions.
