Title: Open Superstring Star as a Continuous Moyal Product
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and A. A. Giryavets
Abstract: By diagonalizing the three-string vertex and using a special coordinate representation the matter part of the open superstring star is identified with the continuous Moyal product of functions of anti-commuting variables. We show that in this representation the identity and sliver have simple expressions. The relation with the half-string fermionic variables in continuous basis is given.
