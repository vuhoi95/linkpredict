Title: Triplication of SU(5) monopoles
Authors: Levon Pogosian and Daniele A. Steer and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We investigate all spherically symmetric fundamental monopole solutions with fixed topological charge in the SU(5) --> SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)/Z_3xZ_2 symmetry breaking. We find that there is three-fold replication of the monopoles. The three copies correspond to bound states with ``monopole clouds'' arising from the non-Abelian nature of the SU(3) factor. The triplication of monopoles could help us understand the observed family structure of standard model particles.
