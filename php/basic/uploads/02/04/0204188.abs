Title: Symplectic quantization of self-dual master Lagrangian
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park and Klaus D. Rothe
Abstract: We consider the master Lagrangian of Deser and Jackiw, interpolating between the self-dual and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Lagrangian, and quantize it following the symplectic approach, as well as the traditional Dirac scheme. We demonstrate the equivalence of these procedures in the subspace of the second-class constraints. We then proceed to embed this mixed first- and second-class system into an extended first-class system within the framework of both approaches, and construct the corresponding generator for this extended gauge symmetry in both formulations.
