Title: Comment on Field Redefinitions in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Masafumi Fukuma and So Matsuura
Abstract: We carry out field redefinitions in ten-dimensional Type IIB supergravity and show that they do not give rise to any physical corrections to the holographic renormalization group structure in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We in particular show that the holographic Weyl anomaly of the N=4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory does not change under the field redefinition of the ten-dimensional metric of the form G_{MN} -> G_{MN}+\alpha R G_{MN}+\beta R_{MN}. These results are consistent with the fact that classical supergravity represents the on-shell structure of massless modes of superstrings, which should not change under redefinitions of fields.
