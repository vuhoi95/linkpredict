Title: Strings in PP-Waves and Worldsheet Deconstruction
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Mohammad M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: Based on the observation that $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_k$ orbifolds have a maximal supersymmetric PP-wave limit, the description of strings in PP-waves in terms of ${\cal N}=2$ quiver gauge theories is presented. We consider two different, small and large $k$, cases and show that the operators in the gauge theory which correspond to stringy excitations are labelled by two integers, the excitation and winding or momentum numbers. For the large $k$ case, the relation between the space-time and worldsheet deconstructions is discussed. We also comment on the possible duality between these two cases.
