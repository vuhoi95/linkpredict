Title: A comment on the dual field in the AdS-CFT correspondence
Authors: M. Duetsch and K. -H. Rehren
Abstract: In the perturbative AdS-CFT correspondence, the dual field whose source are the prescribed boundary values of a bulk field in the functional integral, and the boundary limit of the quantized bulk field are the same thing. This statement is due to the fact that Witten graphs are boundary limits of the corresponding Feynman graphs for the bulk fields, and hence the dual conformal correlation functions are limits of bulk correlation functions. This manifestation of duality is analyzed in terms of the underlying functional integrals of different structure.
