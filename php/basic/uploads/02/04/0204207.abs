Title: Massive IIA Supergravity as a Non-linear Realisation
Authors: Igor Schnakenburg and Peter West
Abstract: A description of the bosonic sector of massive IIA supergravity as a non-linear realisation is given. An essential feature of this construction is that the momentum generators have non-trivial commutation relations with the generators associated with the gauge fields.
