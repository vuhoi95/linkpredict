Title: Partition functions for Matrix Models and Isomonodromic Tau functions
Authors: M. Bertola and B. Eynard and J. Harnad
Abstract: For one-matrix models with polynomial potentials, the explicit relationship between the partition function and the isomonodromic tau function for the 2x2 polynomial differential systems satisfied by the associated orthogonal polynomials is derived.
