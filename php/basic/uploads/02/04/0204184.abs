Title: Quantum Field Theory of three flavor neutrino mixing and oscillations  with CP violation
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Antonio Capolupo and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We study in detail the Quantum Field Theory of mixing among three generations of Dirac fermions (neutrinos). We construct the Hilbert space for the flavor fields and determine the generators of the mixing transformations. By use of these generators, we recover all the known parameterizations of the three-flavor mixing matrix and we find a number of new ones. The algebra of the currents associated with the mixing transformations is shown to be a deformed $su(3)$ algebra, when CP violating phases are present. We then derive the exact oscillation formulas, exhibiting new features with respect to the usual ones. CP and T violation are also discussed.
