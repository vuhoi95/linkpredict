Title: On the Dyadosphere of Black Hole
Authors: Giuliano Preparata and Remo Ruffini and She-Sheng Xue
Abstract: Basic energy requirements of Gamma Ray Burst(GRB) sources can be easily accounted for by a pair creation process occurring in the "Dyadosphere" of a Black Hole endowed with an electromagnetic field (abbreviated to EMBH for "electromagnetic Black Hole"). This includes the recent observations of GRB971214 by Kulkarni et al. The "Dyadosphere" is defined as the region outside the horizon of an EMBH where the electromagnetic field exceeds the critical value for e^+ e^- pair production. In a very short time $\sim O(hbar mc^2}), very large numbers of pairs are created there. Further evolution then leads naturally to a relativistically expanding pair-electromagnetic-pulse (PEM-pulse). Specific examples of Dyadosphere parameters are given for 10 and 10^5 solar mass EMBH's. This process does occur for EMBH with charge-to-mass ratio larger than 2.210^{-5} and strictly smaller than one. From a fundamental point of view, this process represents the first mechanism proved capable of extracting large amounts of energy from a Black Hole with an extremely high efficiency (close to 100%).
