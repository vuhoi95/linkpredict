Title: Noncommutative AdS Supergravity in three Dimensions
Authors: S. Cacciatori and L. Martucci
Abstract: In this paper we propose a generalization of N=4 three dimensional AdS supergravity to the noncommutative case. This is a supersymmetric version of the results presented in hep-th/0201103. We show that it continues to admit an N=4 supersymmetric solution which is the noncommutative couterpart of AdS_3 space. Some other solutions are also discussed.
