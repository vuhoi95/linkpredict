Title: Unusual Transition Patterns in Bose-Einstein Condensation
Authors: Marcus B. Pinto and Rudnei O. Ramos and Frederico F. de Souza Cruz
Abstract: We analyze the possible transition patterns exhibited by an effective non-relativistic field model describing interacting binary homogeneous dilute Bose gases whose overall potential is repulsive. We evaluate the temperature dependence of all couplings and show that at intermediate temperatures the crossed interaction, which is allowed to be attractive, dominates, leading to smooth re-entrant phases. At higher temperatures this interaction suffers a sudden sign inversion leading to an abrupt discontinuous transition back to the normal gas phase. This situation may suggest an alternative way to observe collapsing and exploding condensates. Our results also suggest that such binary systems may offer the possibility of observing Bose-Einstein condensation at higher critical temperatures.
