Abstract: By considering the Higgs mechanism in the framework of a parity-preserving Planar Quantum Electrodynamics, one shows that an attractive electron-electron interaction may come out. The e-e interaction potential emerges as the non-relativistic limit of the Moller scattering amplitude and it may result attractive with a suitable choice of parameters. Numerical values of the e-e binding energy are obtained by solving the two-dimensional Schrodinger equation. The existence of bound states is to be viewed as an indicative that this model may be adopted to address the pairing mechanism in some systems endowed with parity-preservation.
