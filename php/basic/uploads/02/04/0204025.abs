Title: D-Brane Solutions in pp-wave Background
Authors: Alok Kumar and Rashmi R. Nayak and Sanjay
Abstract: We present classical solutions for a D5 and NS5-branes in a pp-wave background. The worldvolume coordinates for these branes lie along a six dimensional pp-wave configuration obtained from $AdS_3 \times S_3$ in a Penrose limit. One in addition has nontrivial R-R 3-form field strength as well as a dilaton background. Classical solutions for Dp-branes (p> 5), as well as their bound states, are then generated in both IIA and IIB string theories by using T-duality symmetries. We also briefly discuss the construction of Dp-branes in pp-wave backgrounds, obtained from string theories on $AdS_m\times S^m$. Finally, the construction of the above D5-brane solution is presented from the point of view of the Green-Schwarz worldsheet string theory and its low lying spectrum is discussed.
