Abstract: We analyse of the effective action of the tachyon field on a D-brane, of both bosonic as well as superstring theory. We find that the non-standard kinetic term of the tachyon field requires a correction to the Born-Infeld type Lagrangian. The cosmological significance of the resulting dynamics is explored. We also examine if the rolling tachyon can provide an effective cosmological constant and contrast its behaviour with quintessence.
