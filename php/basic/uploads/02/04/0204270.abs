Title: Reheating as a surface effect
Authors: Kari Enqvist and Shinta Kasuya and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We describe a new mechanism for reheating the Universe through evaporation of a surface charge of a fragmented inflaton condensate. We show that for a range of Yukawa coupling of the inflaton to the matter sector evaporation gives rise to a much smaller reheat temperature compared to the standard perturbative decay. As a consequence, reheating through a surface effect could solve the gravitino and moduli over production problem in inflationary models without fine tuning the Yukawa sector.
