Title: The strength of small-instanton amplitudes in gauge theories with  compact extra dimensions
Authors: E. Poppitz and Y. Shirman
Abstract: We study instanton effects in theories with compact extra dimensions. We perform an instanton calculation in a 5d theory on a circle of radius R, with gauge, scalar, and fermion fields in the bulk of the extra dimension. We show that, depending on the matter content, instantons of size rho << R can dominate the amplitude. Using deconstruction as an ultraviolet definition of the theory allows us to show, in a controlled approximation, that for a small number of bulk fermions, the amplitude for small size instantons exponentially grows as e^{O(1)R/rho}.
