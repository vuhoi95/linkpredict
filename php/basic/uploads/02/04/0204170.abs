Title: The Star Product on the Fuzzy Supersphere
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and S. Kurkcuoglu and E. Rojas
Abstract: The fuzzy supersphere $S_F^{(2,2)}$ is a finite-dimensional matrix approximation to the supersphere $S^{(2,2)}$ incorporating supersymmetry exactly. Here the star-product of functions on $S_F^{(2,2)}$ is obtained by utilizing the OSp(2,1) coherent states. We check its graded commutative limit to $S^{(2,2)}$ and extend it to fuzzy versions of sections of bundles using the methods of [1]. A brief discussion of the geometric structure of our star-product completes our work.
