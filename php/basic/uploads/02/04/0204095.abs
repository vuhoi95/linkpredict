Title: Radiation from a charge circulating inside a waveguide with dielectric  filling
Authors: Anna S. Kotanjyan and Aram A. Saharian
Abstract: The emitted power of the radiation from a charged particle moving uniformly on a circle inside a cylindrical waveguide is considered. The expressions for the energy flux of the radiation passing through the waveguide cross-section are derived for both TE and TM waves. The results of the numerical evaluation are presented for the number of emitted quanta depending on the waveguide radius, the radius of the charge rotation orbit and dielectric permittivity of the filling medium. These results are compared with the corresponding quantities for the synchrotron radiation in a homogeneous medium.
