Authors: Wolfgang Hollik and Elisabeth Kraus and Markus Roth and Christian Rupp and Klaus Sibold and Dominik St√∂ckinger
Abstract: The renormalization of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model of electroweak interactions is presented to all orders of perturbation theory using the algebraic method. Special attention is directed to the issues of soft supersymmetry breaking, gauge fixing, and infrared finiteness. We discuss the implications of $\hbar$-dependent field parametrizations on the counterterm structure and provide a complete set of on-shell normalization conditions.
