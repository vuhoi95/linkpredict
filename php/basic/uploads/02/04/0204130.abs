Title: Solving Single and Many-body Quantum Problems: A Novel Approach
Authors: N. Gurappa and Prasanta K. Panigrahi and R. Atre and T. Shreecharan
Abstract: A unified approach, for solving a wide class of single and many-body quantum problems, commonly encountered in literature is developed based on a recently proposed method for finding solutions of linear differential equations. Apart from dealing with exactly and quasi-exactly solvable problems, the present approach makes transparent various properties of the familiar orthogonal polynomials and also the construction of their respective ladder operators. We illustrate the procedure for finding the approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of non-exactly solvable problems.
