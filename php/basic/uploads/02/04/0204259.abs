Title: Vanishing magnetic mass in QED$_{3}$ with a Chern-Simons term
Authors: Ashok Das and Silvana Perez
Abstract: We show that, at one loop, the magnetic mass vanishes at finite temperature in QED in any dimension. In QED$_{3}$, even the zero temperature part can be regularized to zero. We calculate the two loop contributions to the magnetic mass in QED$_{3}$ with a Chern-Simons term and show that it vanishes. We give a simple proof which shows that the magnetic mass vanishes to all orders at finite temperature in this theory. This proof also holds for QED in any dimension.
