Title: Supergravity S-Branes
Authors: Martin Kruczenski and Robert C. Myers and Amanda W. Peet
Abstract: We construct supergravity solutions corresponding to space-like branes in string theory. Our approach is to apply the usual solution generating techniques to an appropriate time-dependent solution of the eleven dimensional vacuum Einstein equations. In this way all SDp-brane solutions are obtained, as well as the NS and M-theory space branes. Bound states of SDp/SD(p-2)- and SDp/SD(p-4)-branes are also constructed. Finally, we begin an investigation of the near-brane regions and singularity structure of these solutions.
