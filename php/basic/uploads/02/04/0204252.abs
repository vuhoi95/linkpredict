Title: Can Quintessence Be The Rolling Tachyon?
Authors: Xin-zhou Li and Jian-gang Hao and Dao-jun Liu
Abstract: In light of the recent work by Sen and Gibbons, we present a phase-plane analysis on the cosmology containing a rolling tachyon field in a potential resulted from string theory. We show that there is no stable point on the phase-plane, which indicated that there is a coincidence problem if one consider tachyon as a candidate of quintessence. Furthermore, we also analyze the phase-plane of the cosmology containing a rolling tachyon field for an exactly solvable toy potential in which the critical point is stable. Therefore, it is possible for rolling tachyon to be quintessence if one give up the strict constraint on the potential or find a more appropriate effective potential for the tachyon from M/string theory.
