Title: Asymptotic states in brane cosmology with a nonlocal anisotropic stress
Authors: N. Yu. Savchenko and S. V. Savchenko and A. V. Toporensky
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a Bianchi I brane Universe in the presence of a nonlocal anisotropic stress ${\cal P}_{\mu\nu}$ proportional to a "dark energy" ${\cal U}$. Using this ansatz for the case ${\cal U} > 0$ we prove that if a matter on a brane satisfies the equation of state $p=(\gamma-1)\rho$ with $\gamma \le 4/3$ then all such models isotropize. For $\gamma > 4/3$ anisotropic future asymptotic states are found. We also describe the past asymptotic regimes for this model.
