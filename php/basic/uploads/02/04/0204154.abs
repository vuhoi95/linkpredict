Title: Boundary States in c=-2 Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Andreas Bredthauer and Michael Flohr
Abstract: Starting from first principles, a constructive method is presented to obtain boundary states in conformal field theory. It is demonstrated that this method is well suited to compute the boundary states of logarithmic conformal field theories. By studying the logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge c=-2 in detail, we show that our method leads to consistent results. In particular, it allows to define boundary states corresponding to both, indecomposable representations as well as their irreducible subrepresentations.
