Title: Distribution of the first particle in discrete orthogonal polynomial  ensembles
Authors: Alexei Borodin and Dmitriy Boyarchenko
Abstract: We show that the distribution function of the first particle in a discrete orthogonal polynomial ensemble can be obtained through a certain recurrence procedure, if the (difference or q-) log-derivative of the weight function is rational. In a number of classical special cases the recurrence procedure is equivalent to the difference and q-Painleve equations of chao-dyn/9507010, [Sakai]. Our approach is based on the formalism of discrete integrable operators and discrete Riemann--Hilbert problems developed in math.CO/9912093, math-ph/0111008.
