Title: Alternative dispersionless limit of N=2 supersymmetric KdV-type  hierarchies
Authors: Ashok Das and Sergey Krivonos and Ziemowit Popowicz
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure for obtaining the dispersionless limit of a class of N=1 supersymmetric systems starting from the Lax description of their dispersive counterparts. This is achieved by starting with an N=2 supersymmetric system and scaling the fields in an alternative manner so as to maintain N=1 supersymmetry. We illustrate our method by working out explicitly the examples of the dispersionless supersymmetric two boson hierarchy and the dispersionless supersymmetric Boussinesq hierarchy.
