Title: Dynamical mass generation in quantum field theory : some methods with  application to the Gross-Neveu model and Yang-Mills theory
Authors: D. Dudal and K. Van Acoleyen and H. Verschelde
Abstract: We introduce some techniques to investigate dynamical mass generation. The Gross-Neveu model (GN) is used as a toy model, because the GN mass gap is exactly known, making it possible to check reliability of the various methods. Very accurate results are obtained. Also application to SU(N) Yang-Mills (YM) is discussed.
