Title: Low Energy Theorem for SUSY Breaking with Gauge Supermultiplets
Authors: Norisuke Sakai and Ryo Sugisaka
Abstract: Low energy theorems of Nambu-Goldstone fermion associated with spontaneously broken supersymmetry are studied for gauge supermultiplets. Two possible terms in the effective Lagrangian are needed to deal with massless gaugino and/or massless gauge boson. As an illustrative example, a concrete model is worked out which can interpolate massless as well as massive gaugino and/or gauge boson to examine the low energy effective interaction of NG-fermion.
