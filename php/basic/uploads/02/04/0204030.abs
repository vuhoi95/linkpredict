Title: Support of dS/CFT correspondence from perturbations of three dimensional  spacetime
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and Bin Wang and A. Lima-Santos and W. G. Qiu
Abstract: We discuss the relation between bulk de Sitter three-dimensional spacetime and the corresponding conformal field theory at the boundary, in the framework of the exact quasinormal mode spectrum. We show that the quasinormal mode spectrum corresponds exactly to the spectrum of thermal excitations of Conformal Field Theory at the past boundary I^-, together with the spectrum of the Conformal Field Theory at the future boundary I^+.
