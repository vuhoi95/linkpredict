Title: Diff-invariant Kinetic Terms in Arbitrary Dimensions
Authors: J. Fernando Barbero G and Eduardo J. S. Villase√±or
Abstract: We study the physical content of quadratic diff-invariant Lagrangians in arbitrary dimensions by using covariant symplectic techniques. This paper extends previous results in dimension four. We discuss the difference between the even and odd dimensional cases.
