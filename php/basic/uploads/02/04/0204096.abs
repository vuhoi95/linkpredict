Title: A note on noncommutative scalar multisolitons
Authors: Bergfinnur Durhuus and Thordur Jonsson
Abstract: We prove that there do not exist multisoliton solutions of noncommutative scalar field theory in the Moyal plane which interpolate smoothly between $n$ overlapping solitons and $n$ solitons with an infinite separation.
