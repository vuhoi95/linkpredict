Title: Current correlators and AdS/CFT away from the conformal point
Authors: A. Brandhuber and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we study vacua of N=4 SYM for which part of the gauge symmetry is broken by expectation values of scalar fields. A specific subclass of such vacua can be analyzed with gauged supergravity and the corresponding domain wall solutions lift to continuous distributions of D3-branes in type IIB string theory. Due to the non-trivial expectation value of the scalars, the SO(6) R-symmetry is spontaneously broken and field theory predicts the existence of Goldstone bosons. We explicitly show that, in the dual supergravity description, these emerge as massless poles in the current two-point functions, while the bulk gauge fields which are dual to the broken currents become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We find agreement with field theory expectations and, hence, provide a non-trivial test of the AdS/CFT correspondence far away from the conformal point.
