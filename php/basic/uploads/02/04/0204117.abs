Authors: F. Ardalan and H. Arfaei and M. R. Garousi and A. Ghodsi
Abstract: The effective action for the low energy scattering of two gravitons with a D-brane in the presence of a constant antisytmetric $B$ field in bosonic string theory is calculated and the modification to the standard D-brane action to first order in $\alpha'$ is obtained.
