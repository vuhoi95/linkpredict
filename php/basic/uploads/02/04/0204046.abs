Title: Optimized Rayleigh-Schr√∂dinger Expansion of the Effective Potential
Authors: Wen-Fa Lu and Chul Koo Kim and Kyun Nahm
Abstract: An optimized Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger expansion scheme of solving the functional Schr\"odinger equation with an external source is proposed to calculate the effective potential beyond the Gaussian approximation. For a scalar field theory whose potential function has a Fourier representation in a sense of tempered distributions, we obtain the effective potential up to the second order, and show that the first-order result is just the Gaussian effective potential. Its application to the $\lambda\phi^4$ field theory yields the same post-Gaussian effective potential as obtained in the functional integral formalism.
