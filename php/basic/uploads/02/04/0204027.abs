Title: New Observational Bounds to Quantum Gravity Signals
Authors: Daniel Sudarsky and Luis Urrutia and Hector Vucetich
Abstract: We consider a new set of effects arising from the quantum gravity corrections to the propagation of fields, associated with fluctuations of the spacetime geometry. Using already existing experimental data, we can put bounds on these effects that are more stringent by several orders of magnitude than those expected to be obtained in astrophysical observations. In fact these results can be already interpreted as questioning the whole scenario of linear (in $l_P$) corrections to the dispersion relations for free fields in Lorentz violating theories.
