Title: Black Brane Entropy from Brane-Antibrane Systems
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Alberto Guijosa and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: In the context of string theory, it is possible to explain the microscopic origin of the entropy of certain black holes in terms of D-brane systems. To date, most of the cases studied in detail refer to extremal (supersymmetric) or near-extremal black holes. In this work we propose a microscopic model for certain black branes (extended versions of black holes) which would apply to cases arbitrarily far from extremality, including the Schwarzschild case. The model is based on a system of D-branes and anti-D-branes, and is able to reproduce several properties of the corresponding supergravity solution. In particular, the microscopic entropy agrees with supergravity, except for a factor of 2^{p/p+1}, where p is the dimension of the brane.
