Title: The thermal energy of a scalar field in a one-dimensional compact space
Authors: E. Elizalde and A. C. Tort
Abstract: We discuss some controverted aspects of the evaluation of the thermal energy of a scalar field in a one-dimensional compact space. The calculations are carried out using a generalised zeta function approach.
