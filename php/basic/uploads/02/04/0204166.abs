Title: Transport Coefficients and Analytic Continuation in Dual 1+1 Dimensional  Models at Finite Temperature
Authors: T. S. Evans and A. Gomez Nicola and R. J. Rivers and D. A. Steer
Abstract: The conductivity of a finite temperature 1+1 dimensional fermion gas described by the massive Thirring model is shown to be related to the retarded propagator of the dual boson sine-Gordon model. Duality provides a natural resummation which resolves infra-red problems, and the boson propagator can be related to the fermion gas at non-zero temperature and chemical potential or density. In addition, at high temperatures, we can apply a dimensional reduction technique to find resummed closed expressions for the boson self-energy and relate them to the fermion conductivity. Particular attention is paid to the discussion of analytic continuation. The resummation implicit in duality provides a powerful alternative to the standard diagrammatic evaluation of transport coefficients at finite temperature.
