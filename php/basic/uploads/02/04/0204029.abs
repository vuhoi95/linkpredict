Title: Supersymmetry of gravitational ground states
Authors: Rodrigo Aros and Cristian Martinez and Ricardo Troncoso and Jorge Zanelli
Abstract: A class of black objects which are solutions of pure gravity with negative cosmological constant are classified through the mapping between the Killing spinors of the ground state and those of the transverse section. It is shown that these geometries must have transverse sections of constant curvature for spacetime dimensions d below seven. For d > 6, the transverse sections can also be Euclidean Einstein manifolds. In even dimensions, spacetimes with transverse section of nonconstant curvature exist only in d = 8 and 10. This classification goes beyond standard supergravity and the eleven dimensional case is analyzed. It is shown that if the transverse section has negative scalar curvature, only extended objects can have a supersymmetric ground state. In that case, some solutions are explicitly found whose ground state resembles a wormhole.
