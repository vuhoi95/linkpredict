Title: Tales of D0 on D6 Branes: Matrix Mechanics of Identical Particles
Authors: Chanju Kim and Kimyeong Lee and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We investigate a class of matrix model which describes the dynamics of identical particles in even dimentional space. We show that the degrees of freedom after some constraints are implimented is proportional to particle number and consist of those for positions and internal degrees. The particle dynamics is given by the metric on the smooth moduli space. The moduli space metric for two particles is found. The size of tightly packed $N$ particles grows like $\sqrt{N}$. Our matrix model is related to the matrix model for fractional quantum Hall effect, the ADHM formalism of U(1) instantons on noncommutative space, and supersymmetric D0 branes on D6 branes with nonzero B-field in type IIA theory.
