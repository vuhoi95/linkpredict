Title: Gauge Invariant Monopoles in SU(2) Gluodynamics
Authors: F. V. Gubarev and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We introduce a gauge invariant topological definition of monopole charge in pure SU(2) gluodynamics. The non-trivial topology is provided by hedgehog configurations of the non-Abelian field strength tensor on the two-sphere surrounding the monopole. It is shown that this definition can be formulated entirely in terms of Wilson loops which makes the gauge invariance manifest. Moreover, it counts correctly the monopole charge in case of spontaneously broken gauge symmetry and of pure Abelian gauge fields.
