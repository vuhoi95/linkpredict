Authors: Hou Bo-yu and Shi Kangjie and Yang Zhan-ying
Abstract: Following the construction of the projection operators on $T^2$ presented by Gopakumar, Headrick and Spradlin, we construct a set of projection operators on the integral noncommutative orbifold $T^2/G (G=Z_N, N=2, 3, 4, 6)$ which correspond to a set of solitons on $T^2/Z_N$ in noncommutative field theory. In this way, we derive an explicit form of projector on $T^2/Z_6$ as an example. We also construct a complete set of projectors on $T^2/Z_N$ by series expansions for integral case.
