Title: High-energy head-on collisions of particles and hoop conjecture
Authors: Hirotaka Yoshino and Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We investigate the apparent horizon formation for high-energy head-on collisions of particles in multi-dimensional spacetime. The apparent horizons formed before the instance of particle collision are obtained analytically. Using these solutions, we discuss the feature of the apparent horizon formation in the multi-dimensional spacetime from the viewpoint of the hoop conjecture.
