Title: Any compact group is a gauge group
Authors: Sergio Doplicher and Gherardo Piacitelli
Abstract: The assignment of local observables in the vacuum sector, fulfilling the standard axioms of local quantum theory, is known to determine uniquely a compact group G of gauge transformations of the first kind together with a central involutive element k of G, and a complete normal algebra of fields carrying the localizable charges, on which k defines the Bose/Fermi grading. We show here that any such pair {G,k}, where G is compact metrizable, does actually appear. The corresponding model can be chosen to fulfill also the split property. This is not a dynamical phenomenon: a given {G,k} arises as the gauge group of a model where the local algebras of observables are a suitable subnet of local algebras of a possibly infinite product of free field theories.
