Title: Non-Perturbative Renormalization Group Analysis of the Ohmic Quantum  Dissipation
Authors: Ken-Ichi Aoki and Atsushi Horikoshi
Abstract: We analyze quantum tunneling with the Ohmic dissipation by the non-perturbative renormalization group method. We calculate the localization susceptibility to evaluate the critical dissipation for the quantum-classical transition, and find considerably larger critical dissipation compared to the previous semi-classical arguments.
