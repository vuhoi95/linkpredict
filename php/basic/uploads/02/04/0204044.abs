Title: Energy and Efficiency of Adiabatic Quantum Search Algorithms
Authors: Saurya Das and Randy Kobes and Gabor Kunstatter
Abstract: We present the results of a detailed analysis of a general, unstructured adiabatic quantum search of a data base of $N$ items. In particular we examine the effects on the computation time of adding energy to the system. We find that by increasing the lowest eigenvalue of the time dependent Hamiltonian {\it temporarily} to a maximum of $\propto \sqrt{N}$, it is possible to do the calculation in constant time. This leads us to derive the general theorem which provides the adiabatic analogue of the $\sqrt{N}$ bound of conventional quantum searches. The result suggests that the action associated with the oracle term in the time dependent Hamiltonian is a direct measure of the resources required by the adiabatic quantum search.
