Title: Critical statistics in quantum chaos and Calogero-Sutherland model at  finite temperature
Authors: A. M. Garcia-Garcia and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of a generalized GOE (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) capable of describing critical statistics. The joint distribution of eigenvalues of this model is expressed as the diagonal element of the density matrix of a gas of particles governed by the Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian (C-S). Taking advantage of the correspondence between C-S particles and eigenvalues, we show that the number variance of our random matrix model is asymptotically linear with a slope depending on the parameters of the model. Such linear behavior is a signature of critical statistics. This random matrix model may be relevant for the description of spectral correlations of complex quantum systems with a self-similar/fractal Poincar\'e section of its classical counterpart. This is shown in detail for two examples: the anisotropic Kepler problem and a kicked particle in a well potential. In both cases the number variance and the $\Delta_3$-statistic is accurately described by our analytical results.
