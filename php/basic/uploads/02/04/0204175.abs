Title: On the Scalar Potential Models from the Isospectral Potential Class
Authors: V. Gomes Lima and V. Silva Santos and R. de Lima Rodrigues
Abstract: Static field classical configurations in (1+1)-dimensions for new non-linear potential models are investigated from an isospectral potential class and the concept of bosonic zero- mode solution. One of the models here considered has a static non-topological configuration with a single vacuum state that breaks supersymmetry.
