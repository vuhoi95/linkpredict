Title: Light-Cone Gauge for N=2 Strings
Authors: Olaf Lechtenfeld and Warren Siegel
Abstract: Covariant quantization of self-dual strings in 2+2 flat dimensions reduces them to their zero modes, a consequence of extended world-sheet supersymmetry. We demonstrate how to arrive at the same result more directly by employing a `double' light-cone gauge. An unconventional feature of this gauge is the removal of anticommuting degrees of freedom by commuting symmetries and vice versa. The reducibility of the N=4 string and its equivalence with the N=2 string become apparent.
