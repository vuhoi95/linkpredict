Title: A generic estimate of trans-Planckian modifications to the primordial  power spectrum in inflation
Authors: Richard Easther and Brian R. Greene and William H. Kinney and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the power spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations generated during inflation given an arbitrary choice of boundary condition for the mode function at a short distance. We assume that the boundary condition is specified at a short-distance cutoff at a scale $M$ which is independent of time. Using a particular prescription for the boundary condition at momentum $p = M$, we find that the modulation to the power spectra of density and gravitational wave fluctuations is of order $(H/M)$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, and we argue that this behavior is generic, although by no means inevitable. With fixed boundary condition, we find that the shape of the modulation to the power spectra is determined entirely by the deviation of the background spacetime from the de Sitter limit.
