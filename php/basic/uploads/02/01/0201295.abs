Title: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the D-brane realization of  the Standard Model
Authors: E. Kiritsis and P. Anastasopoulos
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is evaluated in the D-brane realization of the Standard Model. It is pointed out that the massive anomalous U(1) gauge bosons predicted, give extra contributions that are compatible with current experimental data.
