Title: On quantization of singular varieties and applications to D-branes
Authors: D. Melnikov and A. Solovyov
Abstract: We calculate the ring of differential operators on some singular affine varieties (intersecting stacks, a point on a singular curve or an orbifold). Our results support the proposed connection of the ring of differential operators with geometry of D-branes in (bosonic) string theory. In particular, the answer does know about the resolution of singularities in accordance with the string theory predictions.
