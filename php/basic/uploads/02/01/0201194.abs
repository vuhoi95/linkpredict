Title: Velocity-Dependent Forces and an Accelerating Universe
Authors: Ramzi R. Khuri and Andriy Pokotilov
Abstract: In recent work, it was shown that velocity-dependent forces between parallel fundamental strings moving apart in a D-dimensional spacetime implied an expanding universe in D-1-dimensional spacetime. Here we expand on this work to obtain exact solutions for various string/brane cosmological toy models.
