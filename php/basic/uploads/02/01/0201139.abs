Authors: G. Barnich and F. Brandt and M. Grigoriev
Abstract: The formulation of Seiberg-Witten maps from the point of view of consistent deformations of gauge theories in the context of the Batalin-Vilkovisky antifield formalism is reviewed. Some additional remarks on noncommutative Yang-Mills theory are made.
