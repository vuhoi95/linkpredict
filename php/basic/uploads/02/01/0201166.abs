Title: Higgs-graviscalar mixing in type I string theory
Authors: I. Antoniadis and R. Sturani
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of mixing between open and closed string excitations in D-brane models with the fundamental string scale at the TeV. The open string modes describe the Standard Model Higgs, while closed strings describe graviscalars living in the bulk. This provides a string setup for computing the Higgs-graviscalar mixing, that leads to a phenomenologically interesting invisible width of the Higgs in low scale quantum gravity models, as suggested previously by Giudice, Rattazzi and Wells.
