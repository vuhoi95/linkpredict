Title: Some semi-classical issues in boundary sine-Gordon model
Authors: M. Kormos and L. Palla
Abstract: The semi-classical quantisation of the two lowest energy static solutions of boundary sine-Gordon model is considered. A relation between the Lagrangian and bootstrap parameters is established by comparing their quantum corrected energy difference and the exact one. This relation is also confirmed by studying the semi-classical limit of soliton reflections on the boundary.
