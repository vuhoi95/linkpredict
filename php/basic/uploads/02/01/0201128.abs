Title: Constraints on Large Extra Dimensions from Neutrino Oscillation  Experiments
Authors: H. Davoudiasl and P. Langacker and M. Perelstein
Abstract: The existence of bulk sterile neutrinos in theories with large extra dimensions can naturally explain small 4-dimensional Dirac masses for the active neutrinos. We study a model with 3 bulk neutrinos and derive various constraints on the size of the extra dimensions from neutrino oscillation experiments. Our analysis includes recent solar and atmospheric data from SNO and Super-Kamiokande, respectively, as well as various reactor and accelerator experiments. In addition, we comment on possible extensions of the model that could accommodate the LSND results, using natural parameters only. Our most conservative bound, obtained from the atmospheric data in the hierarchical mass scheme, constrains the largest extra dimension to have a radius R < 0.82 microns. Thus, in the context of the model studied here, future gravitational experiments are unlikely to observe the effects of extra dimensions.
