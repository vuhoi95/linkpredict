Title: PT-symmetric non-polynomial oscillators and hyperbolic potential with  two known real eigenvalues in a SUSY framework
Authors: B. Bagchi and C. Quesne
Abstract: Extending the supersymmetric method proposed by Tkachuk to the complex domain, we obtain general expressions for superpotentials allowing generation of quasi-exactly solvable PT-symmetric potentials with two known real eigenvalues (the ground state and first-excited state energies). We construct examples, namely those of complexified non-polynomial oscillators and of a complexified hyperbolic potential, to demonstrate how our scheme works in practice. For the former we provide a connection with the sl(2) method, illustrating the comparative advantages of the supersymmetric one.
