Title: The Kink variety in systems of two coupled scalar fields in two  space-time dimensions
Authors: A. Alonso Izquierdo and M. A. Gonzalez Leon and J. Mateos Guilarte
Abstract: In this paper we describe the moduli space of kinks in a class of systems of two coupled real scalar fields in (1+1) Minkowskian space-time. The main feature of the class is the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry of (real) Ginzburg-Landau type that guarantees the existence of kink topological defects.
