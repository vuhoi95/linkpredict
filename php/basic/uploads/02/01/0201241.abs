Title: Inhomogeneous Near-extremal Black Branes
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Kengo Maeda
Abstract: It has recently been shown that there exist stable inhomogeneous neutral black strings in higher dimensional gravity. These solutions were motivated by the fact that the corresponding homogeneous solutions are unstable. We show that there exist new inhomogeneous black string and black p-brane solutions even when the corresponding translationally invariant solutions are stable. In particular, we show there exist inhomogeneous near-extremal black strings and p-branes. Some of these solutions remain inhomogeneous even when the size of the compact direction (at infinity) is very small.
