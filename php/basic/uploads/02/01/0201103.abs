Title: Noncommutative Einstein-AdS Gravity in three Dimensions
Authors: S. Cacciatori and D. Klemm and L. Martucci and D. Zanon
Abstract: We present a Lorentzian version of three-dimensional noncommutative Einstein-AdS gravity by making use of the Chern-Simons formulation of pure gravity in 2+1 dimensions. The deformed action contains a real, symmetric metric and a real, antisymmetric tensor that vanishes in the commutative limit. These fields are coupled to two abelian gauge fields. We find that this theory of gravity is invariant under a class of transformations that reduce to standard diffeomorphisms once the noncommutativity parameter is set to zero.
