Title: 3d Lorentzian, Dynamically Triangulated Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: The model of Lorentzian three-dimensional dynamical triangulations provides a non-perturbative definition of three-dimensional quantum gravity. The theory has two phases: a weak-coupling phase with quantum fluctuations around a ``semiclassical'' background geometry which is generated dynamically despite the fact that the formulation is explicitly background-independent, and a strong-coupling phase where ``classical'' space disintegrates into a foam of baby universes.
