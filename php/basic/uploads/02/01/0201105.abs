Title: Effective Action for Self-Interacting Scalar Field in 3-dimensional Ball
Authors: M. R. Setare and Kh. Saaidi
Abstract: In this paper we have considered the renormalized one-loop effective action for massless self-interacting scalar field in the 3-dimensional ball. The scalar field satisfies Dirichlet boundary condition on the ball. Using heat kernel expansion method we calculate the divergent part of effective action, then by bag model renormalization procedure we obtain the renormalized one-loop effective action.
