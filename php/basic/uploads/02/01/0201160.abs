Title: Slightly generalized Maxwell classical electrodynamics can be applied to  inneratomic phenomena
Authors: V. M. Simulik and I. Yu. Krivsky
Abstract: In order to extend the limits of classical theory application in the microworld some weak generalization of Maxwell electrodynamics is suggested. It is shown that slightly generalized classical Maxwell electrodynamics can describe the intraatomic phenomena with the same success as relativistic quantum mechanics can do. Group-theoretical grounds for the description of fermionic states by bosonic system are presented briefly. The advantages of generalized electrodynamics in intraatomic region in comparison with standard Maxwell electrodynamics are demonstrated on testing example of hydrogen atom. We are able to obtain some results which are impossible in the framework of standard Maxwell electrodynamics. The Sommerfeld - Dirac formula for the fine structure of the hydrogen atom spectrum is obtained on the basis of such Maxwell equations without appealing to the Dirac equation. The Bohr postulates and the Lamb shift are proved to be the consequences of the equations under consideration. The relationship of the new model with the Dirac theory is investigated. Possible directions of unification of such electrodynamics with gravity are mentioned.
