Title: Non-abelian action of D0-branes from Matrix theory in the longitudinal  5-brane background
Authors: Masako Asano and Yasuhiro Sekino
Abstract: We study one-loop effective action of Berkooz-Douglas Matrix theory and obtain non-abelian action of D0-branes in the background field produced by longitudinal 5-branes. Since these 5-branes do not have D0-brane charge and are not present in BFSS Matrix theory, our analysis can be regarded as an independent test for the coupling of D-branes to general weak backgrounds proposed by Taylor and Van Raamsdonk, and also as a check of consistency between the two versions of Matrix theory. The coupling to the 5-branes which we obtain is basically consistent with the previous proposal, but we point out subtleties in the ordering of matrices for the multipole moments.
