Title: Second Virial Coefficient for Noncommutative Space
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Hendrik B. Geyer
Abstract: The second virial coefficient $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ for non-interacting particles moving in a two-dimensional noncommutative space and in the presence of a uniform magnetic field $\vec B$ is presented. The noncommutativity parameter $\te$ can be chosen such that the $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ can be interpreted as the second virial coefficient for anyons of statistics $\al$ in the presence of $\vec B$ and living on the commuting plane. In particular in the high temperature limit $\be\lga 0$, we establish a relation between the parameter $\te$ and the statistics $\al$. Moreover, $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ can also be interpreted in terms of composite fermions.
