Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and Daniel Z. Freedman
Abstract: In these lecture notes we first assemble the basic ingredients of supersymmetric gauge theories (particularly N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory), supergravity, and superstring theory. Brane solutions are surveyed. The geometry and symmetries of anti-de Sitter space are discussed. The AdS/CFT correspondence of Maldacena and its application to correlation functions in the the conformal phase of N=4 SYM are explained in considerable detail. A pedagogical treatment of holographic RG flows is given including a review of the conformal anomaly in four-dimensional quantum field theory and its calculation from five-dimensional gravity. Problem sets and exercises await the reader.
