Title: Radiative Processes of the DeWitt-Takagi Detector
Authors: D. E. Diaz and J. Stephany
Abstract: We examine the excitation of a uniformly accelerated DeWitt-Takagi detector coupled quadratically to a Majorana-Dirac field. We obtain the transition probability from the ground state of the detector and the vacuum state of the field to an excited state with the emission of a Minkowski pair of quanta, in terms of elementary processes of absorption and scattering of Rindler quanta from the Fulling-Davies-Unruh thermal bath in the co-accelerated frame.
