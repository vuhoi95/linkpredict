Title: Relating the Cosmological Constant and Supersymmetry Breaking in Warped  Compactifications of IIB String Theory
Authors: P. Berglund and T. Hubsch and D. Minic
Abstract: It has been suggested that the observed value of the cosmological constant is related to the supersymmetry breaking scale M_{susy} through the formula Lambda \sim M_p^4 (M_{susy}/M_p)^8. We point out that a similar relation naturally arises in the codimension two solutions of warped space-time varying compactifications of string theory in which non-isotropic stringy moduli induce a small but positive cosmological constant.
