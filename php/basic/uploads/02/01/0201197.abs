Title: Construction of the Vacuum String Field Theory on a non-BPS Brane
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and D. M. Belov and A. A. Giryavets
Abstract: In the framework of the Sen conjectures a construction of vacuum superstring field theory on a non-BPS brane is discussed. A distinguished feature of this theory is a presence of a ghost kinetic operator mixing GSO+/- sectors. A candidate for such kinetic operator with zero cohomology is discussed.
