Title: W-(infinity)-algebras in n complex dimensions and Kodaira-Spencer  deformations : a symplectic approach
Authors: G. Bandelloni and S. Lazzarini
Abstract: It is shown that the notion of W_\infty-algebra originally carried out over a (compact) Riemann surface can be extended to n complex dimensional (compact) manifolds within a symplectic geometrical setup. The relationships with the Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory of complex structures are discussed. Subsequently, some field theoretical aspects at the classical level are briefly underlined.
