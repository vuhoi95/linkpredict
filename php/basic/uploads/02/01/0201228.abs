Title: Non-relativistic anyons, exotic Galilean symmetry and noncommutative  plane
Authors: Peter A. Horvathy and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: We show that the Lukierski et al. model, invariant with respect to the two-fold centrally extended Galilei group, can be decomposed into an infinite number of independent copies (differing in their spin) of the ``exotic'' particle of Duval et al. The difference between the two models is found to be sensitive to electromagnetic coupling. The nature of the noncommutative plane coordinates is discussed in the light of the exotic Galilean symmetry. We prove that the first model, interpreted as describing a non-relativistic anyon, is the non-relativistic limit of a particle with torsion related to relativistic anyons.
