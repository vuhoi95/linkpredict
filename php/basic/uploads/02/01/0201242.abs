Title: Supersymmetric Classical Mechanics: Free Case
Authors: R. de Lima Rodrigues and W. Pires de Almeida and I. Fonseca Neto
Abstract: We present a review work on Supersymmetric Classical Mechanics in the context of a Lagrangian formalism, with $N=1-$supersymmetry. We show that the N=1 supersymmetry does not allow the introduction of a potential energy term depending on a single commuting supercoordinate, $\phi (t;\Theta)$.
