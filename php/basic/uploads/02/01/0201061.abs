Title: Bi-Hamiltonian structure of the N=2 supersymmetric Î±=1 KdV  hierarchy
Authors: P. H. M. Kersten and A. S. Sorin
Abstract: The N=2 supersymmetric {\alpha}=1 KdV hierarchy in N=2 superspace is considered and its rich symmetry structure is uncovered. New nonpolynomial and nonlocal, bosonic and fermionic symmetries and Hamiltonians, bi-Hamiltonian structure as well as a recursion operator connecting all symmetries and Hamiltonian structures of the N=2 {\alpha}=1 KdV hierarchy are constructed in explicit form. It is observed that the algebra of symmetries of the N=2 supersymmetric {\alpha}=1 KdV hierarchy possesses two different subalgebras of N=2 supersymmetry.
