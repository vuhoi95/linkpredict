Title: Deformation Quantization: Genesis, Developments and Metamorphoses
Authors: Giuseppe Dito and Daniel Sternheimer
Abstract: We start with a short exposition of developments in physics and mathematics that preceded, formed the basis for, or accompanied, the birth of deformation quantization in the seventies. We indicate how the latter is at least a viable alternative, autonomous and conceptually more satisfactory, to conventional quantum mechanics and mention related questions, including covariance and star representations of Lie groups. We sketch Fedosov's geometric presentation, based on ideas coming from index theorems, which provided a beautiful frame for developing existence and classification of star-products on symplectic manifolds. We present Kontsevich's formality, a major metamorphosis of deformation quantization, which implies existence and classification of star-products on general Poisson manifolds and has numerous ramifications. Its alternate proof using operads gave a new metamorphosis which in particular showed that the proper context is that of deformations of algebras over operads, while still another is provided by the extension from differential to algebraic geometry. In this panorama some important aspects are highlighted by a more detailed account.
