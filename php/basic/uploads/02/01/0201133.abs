Title: Semiclassical zero temperature black holes in spherically reduced  theories
Authors: C. Barbachoux and A. Fabbri
Abstract: We numerically integrate the semiclassical equations of motion for spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell theory with a dilaton coupled scalar field and look for zero temperature configurations. The solution we find is studied in detail close to the horizon and comparison is made with the corresponding one in the minimally coupled case.
