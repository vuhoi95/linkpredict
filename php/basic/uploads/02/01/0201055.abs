Title: Dual Description of Brane World Cosmological Constant with $H_{MNPQ}$
Authors: Kang-Sin Choi and Jihn E. Kim and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We present a short review of the recent 5D self-tuning solution of the cosmological constant problem with $1/H^2$ term, and present the dual description of the solution. In the dual description, we show that the presence of the coupling of the dual field($\sigma$) to the brane(which is a bit different from the original theory) maintains the self-tuning property.
