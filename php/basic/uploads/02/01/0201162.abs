Title: Scalar Synchrotron Radiation in the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter  Geometry
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We present a complete relativistic analysis for the scalar radiation emitted by a particle in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole. If the black hole is large, then the radiation is concentrated in narrow angles- high multipolar distribution- i.e., the radiation is synchrotronic. However, small black holes exhibit a totally different behavior: in the small black hole regime, the radiation is concentrated in low multipoles. There is a transition mass at $M=0.427 R$, where $R$ is the AdS radius. This behavior is new, it is not present in asymptotically flat spacetimes.
