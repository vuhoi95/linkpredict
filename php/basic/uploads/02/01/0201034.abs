Title: Classical Black Hole Production in High-Energy Collisions
Authors: Douglas M. Eardley and Steven B. Giddings
Abstract: We investigate classical formation of a D-dimensional black hole in a high energy collision of two particles. The existence of an apparent horizon is related to the solution of an unusual boundary-value problem for Poisson's equation in flat space. For sufficiently small impact parameter, we construct solutions giving such apparent horizons in D=4. These supply improved estimates of the classical cross-section for black hole production, and of the mass of the resulting black holes. We also argue that a horizon can be found in a region of weak curvature, suggesting that these solutions are valid starting points for a semiclassical analysis of quantum black hole formation.
