Title: Large N limit of SO(N) scalar gauge theory
Authors: E. Toprak and O. T. Turgut
Abstract: In this paper we study the large $N_c$ limit of SO(N_c) gauge theory coupled to a real scalar field following ideas of Rajeev. We see that the phase space of this resulting classical theory is Sp_1(H)/U(H_+) which is the analog of the Siegel disc in infinite dimensions. The linearized equations of motion give us a version of the well-known 't Hooft equation of two dimensional QCD.
