Title: Boundary States of c=1 and 3/2 Rational Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Andrea Cappelli and Giuseppe D'Appollonio
Abstract: We study the boundary states for the rational points in the moduli spaces of c=1 conformal and c=3/2 superconformal field theories, including the isolated Ginsparg points. We use the orbifold and simple-current techniques to relate the boundary states of different theories and to obtain symmetry-breaking, non-Cardy boundary states. We show some interesting examples of fractional and twisted branes on orbifold spaces.
