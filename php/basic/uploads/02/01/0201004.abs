Title: Slicing and Brane Dependence of the (A)dS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: A. M. Ghezelbash and D. Ida and R. B. Mann and T. Shiromizu
Abstract: We investigate the slicing dependence of the relationship between conserved quantities in the (A)dS/CFT correspondence. Specifically, we show that the Casimir energy depends upon the topology and geometry of spacetime foliations of the bulk near the conformal boundary. We point out that the determination of the brane location in brane-world scenarios exhibits a similar slicing dependence, and we comment on this in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture.
