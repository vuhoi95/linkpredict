Title: Implications of Superconformal Symmetry for Interacting (2,0) Tensor  Multiplets
Authors: G. Arutyunov and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We study the structure of the four-point correlation function of the lowest-dimension 1/2 BPS operators (stress-tensor multiplets) in the (2,0) six-dimensional theory. We first discuss the superconformal Ward identities and the group-theoretical restrictions on the corresponding OPE. We show that the general solution of the Ward identities is expressed in terms of a single function of the two conformal cross-ratios ("prepotential"). Using the maximally extended gauged seven-dimensional supergravity, we then compute the four-point amplitude in the supergravity approximation and identify the corresponding prepotential. We analyze the leading terms in the OPE by performing a conformal partial wave expansion and show that they are in agreement with the non-renormalization theorems following from representation theory. The investigation of the (2,0) theory is carried out in close parallel with the familiar four-dimensional N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory.
