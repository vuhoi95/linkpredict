Title: Duality, generalized Chern-Simons terms and gauge transformations in a  high-dimensional curved spacetime
Authors: Hisashi Echigoya and Tadashi Miyazaki and Tomohiko Shibuya
Abstract: With two typical parent actions we have two kinds of dual worlds: i) one of which contains an electric as well as magnetic current, and ii) the other contains (generalized) Chern-Simons terms. All these fields are defined on a curved spacetime of arbitrary (odd) dimensions. A new form of gauge transformations is introduced and plays an essential role in defining the interaction with a magnetic monopole or in defining the generalized Chern-Simons terms.
