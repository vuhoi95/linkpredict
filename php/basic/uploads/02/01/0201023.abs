Title: Operator Representations on Quantum Spaces
Authors: Claudia Bauer and Hartmut Wachter
Abstract: In this article we present explicit formulae for q-differentiation on quantum spaces which could be of particular importance in physics, i.e., q-deformed Minkowski space and q-deformed Euclidean space in three or four dimensions. The calculations are based on the covariant differential calculus of these quantum spaces. Furthermore, our formulae can be regarded as a generalization of Jackson's q-derivative to three and four dimensions.
