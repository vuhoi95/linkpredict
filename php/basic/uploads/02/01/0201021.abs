Title: On explicit solutions for completely integrable classical Calogero-Moser  systems in external fields
Authors: D. V. Meshcheryakov and T. D. Meshcheryakova
Abstract: Explicit solutions for one completely-integrable system of Calogero-Moser type in external fields are found in case of three and four interacting particles. Relation between coupling constant, initial values of coordinates and time of falling into the singularity of potential is derived.
