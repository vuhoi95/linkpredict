Title: On the absence of simultaneous reflection and transmission in integrable  impurity systems
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and A. Fring and F. GÃ¶hmann
Abstract: We establish that the Yang-Baxter equations in the presence of an impurity can in general only admit solutions of simultaneous tranmission and reflection when the transmission and reflection amplitudes commute in the defect degrees of freedom with an additional exchange of the corresponding rapidities. In the absence of defect degrees of freedom we show in complete generality, that the only exceptions to this are theories which possess rapidity independent bulk scattering matrices. In particular bulk theories with diagonal scattering matrices, can only be the free Boson and Fermion, the Federbush model and their generalizations. These anyonic solutions do not admit the possibility of excited impurity states.
