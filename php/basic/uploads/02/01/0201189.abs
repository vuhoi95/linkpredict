Title: The Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation and trans-Planckian inflation
Authors: Jerome Martin and Robert H. Brandenberger
Abstract: In this Letter we study the dependence of the spectrum of fluctuations in inflationary cosmology on possible effects of trans-Planckian physics, using the Corley/Jacobson dispersion relations as an example. We compare the methods used in previous work [1] with the WKB approximation, give a new exact analytical result, and study the dependence of the spectrum obtained using the approximate method of Ref. [1] on the choice of the matching time between different time intervals. We also comment on recent work subsequent to Ref. [1] on the trans-Planckian problem for inflationary cosmology.
