Title: Localized Fermions and Anomaly Inflow via Deconstruction
Authors: Witold Skiba and David Smith
Abstract: We study fermion localization in gauge theory space. We consider four dimensional product gauge groups in which light chiral fermions transform under different gauge factors of the product group. This construction provides a suppression of higher dimensional operators. For example, it can be used to suppress dangerous proton decay operators. The anomalies associated with the light chiral fermions are compensated by Wess-Zumino terms, which in the continuum limit reproduce the five dimensional Chern-Simons term.
