Title: An application of supersymmetric quantum mechanics to a planar physical  system
Authors: R. de Lima Rodrigues and V. B. Bezerra and A. N. Vaidya
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM) is applied to a 2-dimensional physical system: a neutron in an external magnetic field. The superpotential and the two-component wave functions of the ground state are found out.
