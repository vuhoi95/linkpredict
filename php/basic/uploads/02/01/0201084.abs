Abstract: A method for describing the quantum kink states in the semi-classical limit of several (1+1)-dimensional field theoretical models is developed. We use the generalized zeta function regularization method to compute the one-loop quantum correction to the masses of the kink in the sine-Gordon and cubic sinh-Gordon models and another two ${\rm P}(\phi)_2$ systems with polynomial self-interactions.
