Abstract: We present new exact solutions (in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions) of relativistic wave equations (Klein-Gordon and Dirac) in external electromagnetic fields of special form. These fields are combinations of Aharonov-Bohm solenoid field and some additional electric and magnetic fields. In particular, as such additional fields, we consider longitudinal electric and magnetic fields, some crossed fields, and some special non-uniform fields. The solutions obtained can be useful to study Aharonov-Bohm effect in the corresponding electromagnetic fields.
