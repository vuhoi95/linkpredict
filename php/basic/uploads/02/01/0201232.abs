Title: Correlators of open D-string theory from supergravity
Authors: Somdatta Bhattacharya and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: We consider a minimally coupled massless scalar propagating in the background of NS5-branes in the presence of a 2-form RR electric field. The supergravity solution also called the (NS5,D1) bound state in the appropriate decoupling limit is the holographic dual of Open D-string (OD1) theory. Using this information, we compute the two-point function of the operators in OD1 theory which couples to the massless string states such as the dilaton. We will indicate how to obtain the absorption cross-section of a scalar on NS5-branes (i.e. Little String Theory (LST)) obtained earlier, from our results in the low-energy limit.
