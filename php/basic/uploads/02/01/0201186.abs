Title: Classical Solutions of SU(3) Pure Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: O. Oliveira and R. A. Coimbra
Abstract: Regular classical solutions of pure SU(3) gauge theories, in Minkowsky spacetime, are computed in the Landau gauge. The classical fields have an intrinsic energy scale and produce quark confinement if interpreted in the sense of a nonrelativistic potential. Moreover, the quark propagator in the background of these fields vanishes at large positive and negative time and space separations.
