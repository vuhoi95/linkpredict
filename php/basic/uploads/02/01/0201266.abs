Title: Effective Field Theories of QCD
Authors: Johan Bijnens and Ulf-G. Mei√üner and Andreas Wirzba
Abstract: These are the proceedings of the workshop on ``Effective Field Theories of QCD'' held at the Physikzentrum Bad Honnef of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, Bad Honnef, Germany from November 26 to 30, 2001. The workshop concentrated on Chiral Perturbation Theory in its various settings, its relations with lattice QCD and dispersion theory and the use of effective field theories in systems with one, two or more nucleons as well as at high baryon densities. Included are a short contribution per talk and a listing of some review papers on the subject.
