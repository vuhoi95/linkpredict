Title: Null string evolution in black hole and cosmological spacetimes
Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Izabela Prochnicka
Abstract: We discuss the problem of the motion of classical strings in some black hole and cosmological spacetimes. In particular, the null string limit (zero tension) of tensile strings is considered. We present some new exact string solutions in Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background as well as in the Einstein Static Universe and in the Einstein-Schwarzschild (a black hole in the Einstein Static Universe) spacetime. These solutions can give some insight into a general nature of propagation of strings (cosmic and fundamental) in curved backgrounds.
