Title: Some aspects of collisional sources for electroweak baryogenesis
Authors: Kimmo Kainulainen and Tomislav Prokopec and Michael G. Schmidt and Steffen Weinstock
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of fermions with a spatially varying mass which couple to bosons through a Yukawa interaction term and perform a consistent weak coupling truncation of the relevant kinetic equations. We then use a gradient expansion and derive the CP-violating source in the collision term for fermions which appears at first order in gradients. The collisional sources together with the semiclassical force constitute the CP-violating sources relevant for baryogenesis at the electroweak scale. We discuss also the absence of sources at first order in gradients in the scalar equation, and the limitations of the relaxation time approximation.
