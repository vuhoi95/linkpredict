Title: Curved BPS domain walls and RG flow in five dimensions
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Gianguido Dall'Agata and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We determine, in the context of five-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity with vector and hypermultiplets, the conditions under which curved (non Ricci flat) supersymmetric domain wall solutions may exist. These curved BPS domain wall solutions may, in general, be supported by non-constant vector and hyper scalar fields. We establish our results by a careful analysis of the BPS equations as well as of the associated integrability conditions and the equations of motion. We construct an example of a curved BPS solution in a gauged supergravity model with one hypermultiplet. We also discuss the dual description of curved BPS domain walls in terms of RG flows.
