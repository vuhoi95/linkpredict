Title: Determinant Calculations with Random Walk Worldline Loops
Authors: Michael G. Schmidt and Ion-Olimpiu Stamatescu
Abstract: We propose to calculate bosonic and fermionic determinants with some general field background, and the corresponding 1-loop effective actions by evaluating random walk worldline loops generated statistically on the lattice. This is illustrated by some numerical calculations for constant gauge field backgrounds and then discussed for the general case.
