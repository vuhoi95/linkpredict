Title: Baryogenesis by Brane-Collision
Authors: Mar Bastero-Gil and Edmund J. Copeland and James Gray and Andre Lukas and Michael Plumacher
Abstract: We present a new scenario for baryogenesis in the context of heterotic brane-world models. The baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated at a small-instanton phase transition which is initiated by a moving brane colliding with the observable boundary. We demonstrate, in the context of a simple model, that reasonable values for the baryon asymmetry can be obtained. As a byproduct we find a new class of moving-brane cosmological solutions in the presence of a perfect fluid.
