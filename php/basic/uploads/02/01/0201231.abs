Title: A non-rational CFT with central charge 1
Authors: I. Runkel and G. M. T. Watts
Abstract: Two dimensional conformal field theories with central charge one are discussed. After a short review of theories based on one free boson, a different CFT is described, which is obtained as a limit of minimal models.
