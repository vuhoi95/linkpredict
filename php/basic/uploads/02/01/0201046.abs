Title: Radiation reaction and renormalization in classical electrodynamics of  point particle in any dimension
Authors: P. O. Kazinski and S. L. Lyakhovich and A. A. Sharapov
Abstract: The effective equations of motion for a point charged particle taking account of radiation reaction are considered in various space-time dimensions. The divergencies steaming from the pointness of the particle are studied and the effective renormalization procedure is proposed encompassing uniformly the cases of all even dimensions. It is shown that in any dimension the classical electrodynamics is a renormalizable theory if not multiplicatively beyond d=4. For the cases of three and six dimensions the covariant analogs of the Lorentz-Dirac equation are explicitly derived.
