Title: Quantum Radion on de Sitter branes
Authors: Gen Uchida and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: The quantum fluctuation of the relative location of two (n-1)-dimensional de Sitter branes (i.e., of n spacetime dimensions) embedded in the (n+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk, which we shall call the quantum radion, is investigated at the linear perturbation level. The quantization of the radion is done by deriving the effective action of the radion. Assuming the positive tension brane is our universe, the effect of the quantum radion is evaluated by using the effective Einstein equations on the brane in which the radion contributes to the effective energy momentum tensor at the linear order of the radion amplitude. Specifically, the rms effective energy density arising from the quantum radion is compared with the background energy density. It is found out that this ratio remains small for reasonable values of the parameters of the model even without introducing a stabilizing mechanism for radion, although the radion itself has a negative mass squared and is unstable. The reason behind this phenomenon is also discussed.
