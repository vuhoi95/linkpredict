Title: Condensation of Localized Tachyons and Spacetime Supersymmetry
Authors: Soonkeon Nam and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We consider condensation of localized closed string tachyons by examining the recent proposal of Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec, and Moore. We first observe that the $g_{\rm cl}$ defined by HKMM does not reflect the space-time supersymmetry when the model has the SUSY. Especially for ${\bf C}^2/{\bf Z}_N$ models, $g_{\rm cl}$ defined by them is highly peaked along the supersymmetric points in the space of orbifolds, which is unsatisfactory property of the "potential" of the RG-flow. We give the modified definition of the $g_{\rm cl}$ in type II cases such that it has a valley along the supersymmetric points in the orbifold moduli space. New definition predicts that the processes suggested by Adams, Polchinski and Silverstein and was argued to be forbidden by HKMM are in fact allowed.
