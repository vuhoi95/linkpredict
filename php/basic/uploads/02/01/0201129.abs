Title: Seeking experimental probes of string unification
Authors: Claudio Coriano and Alon E. Faraggi
Abstract: A general prediction of string unification is the existence of exotic states with fractional charges under the free unbroken Abelian generators of the underlying GUT symmetry. Such states may be long-lived due to the existence of weakly broken gauge, or local discrete, symmetries, and may serve as experimental probes of string theory in forthcoming cosmic ray and dark matter experiments.
