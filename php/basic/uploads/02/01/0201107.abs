Title: Chern-Simons Couplings for Dielectric F-Strings in Matrix String Theory
Authors: Dominic Brecher and Bert Janssen and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: We compute the non-abelian couplings in the Chern-Simons action for a set of coinciding fundamental strings in both the type IIA and type IIB Matrix string theories. Starting from Matrix theory in a weakly curved background, we construct the linear couplings of closed string fields to type IIA Matrix strings. Further dualities give a type IIB Matrix string theory and a type IIA theory of Matrix strings with winding.
