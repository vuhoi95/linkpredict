Title: B field and squeezed states in Vacuum String Field Theory
Authors: L. Bonora and D. Mamone and M. Salizzoni
Abstract: We show that squeezed state solutions for solitonic lumps in Vacuum String Field Theory still exist in the presence of a constant B field. We show in particular that, just as in the B=0 case, we can write down a compact explicit form for such solutions.
