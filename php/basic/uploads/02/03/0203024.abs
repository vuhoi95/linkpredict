Title: String and Brane Models with Spontaneously/Dynamically Induced Tension
Authors: Eduardo Guendelman and Alexander Kaganovich and Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: We study in some detail the properties of a previously proposed new class of string and brane models whose world-sheet (world-volume) actions are built with a modified reparametrization-invariant measure of integration and which do not contain any ad hoc dimensionfull parameters. The ratio of the new and the standard Riemannian integration measure densities plays the role of a dynamically generated string/brane tension. The latter is identified as (the magnitude of) an effective (non-Abelian) electric field-strength on the world-sheet/world-volume obeying the standard Gauss-law constraint. As a result a simple classical mechanism for confinement via strings is proposed.
