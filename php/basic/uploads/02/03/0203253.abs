Title: Approximate analytical solutions of the baby Skyrme model
Authors: T. A. Ioannidou and V. B. Kopeliovich and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: In present paper we show that many properties of the baby skyrmions, which have been determined numerically, can be understood in terms of an analytic approximation. In particular, we show that this approximation captures properties of the multiskyrmion solutions (derived numerically) such as their stability towards decay into various channels, and that it is more accurate for the "new baby Skyrme model" which describes anisotropic physical systems in terms of multiskyrmion fields with axial symmetry. Some universal characteristics of configurations of this kind are demonstrated, which do not depend on their topological number.
