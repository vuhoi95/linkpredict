Title: Long-lived oscillons from asymmetric bubbles
Authors: Artur B. Adib and Marcelo Gleiser and Carlos A. S. Almeida
Abstract: The possibility that extremely long-lived, time-dependent, and localized field configurations (``oscillons'') arise during the collapse of asymmetrical bubbles in 2+1 dimensional phi^4 models is investigated. It is found that oscillons can develop from a large spectrum of elliptically deformed bubbles. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence that such oscillons are: a) circularly symmetric; and b) linearly stable against small arbitrary radial and angular perturbations. The latter is based on a dynamical approach designed to investigate the stability of nonintegrable time-dependent configurations that is capable of probing slowly-growing instabilities not seen through the usual ``spectral'' method.
