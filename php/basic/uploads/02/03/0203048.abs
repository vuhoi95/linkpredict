Title: Microscopic Formulation of Black Holes in String Theory
Authors: Justin R. David and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: In this Report we review the microscopic formulation of the five dimensional black hole of type IIB string theory in terms of the D1-D5 brane system. The emphasis here is more on the brane dynamics than on supergravity solutions. We show how the low energy brane dynamics, combined with crucial inputs from AdS/CFT correspondence, leads to a derivation of black hole thermodynamics and the rate of Hawking radiation. Our approach requires a detailed exposition of the gauge theory and conformal field theory of the D1-D5 system. We also discuss some applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in the context of black hole formation in three dimensions by thermal transition and by collision of point particles.
