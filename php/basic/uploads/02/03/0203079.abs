Title: Strong Dynamics and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Christopher T. Hill and Elizabeth H. Simmons
Abstract: The breaking of the electroweak symmetry, and origin of the associated ``weak scale,'' may be due to a new strong interaction. Theoretical developments over the past decade have led to viable models and mechanisms that are consistent with current experimental data. Many of these schemes feature a privileged role for the top quark, and third generation, and are natural in the context of theories of extra space dimensions at the weak scale. We review various models and their phenomenological implications which will be subject to definitive tests in future collider runs at the Tevatron, the LHC, and future linear electron-positron colliders, as well as sensitive studies of rare processes.
