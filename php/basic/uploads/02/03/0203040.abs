Title: Doubly Special Relativity theories as different bases of  $κ$--Poincaré algebra
Authors: J. Kowalski-Glikman and S. Nowak
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theory is a theory with two observer-independent scales, of velocity and mass (or length). Such a theory has been proposed by Amelino--Camelia as a kinematic structure which may underline quantum theory of relativity. Recently another theory of this kind has been proposed by Magueijo and Smolin. In this paper we show that both these theories can be understood as particular bases of the $\kappa$--Poincar\'e theory based on quantum (Hopf) algebra. This observation makes it possible to construct the space-time sector of Magueijo and Smolin DSR. We also show how this construction can be extended to the whole class of DSRs. It turns out that for all such theories the structure of space-time commutators is the same. This results lead us to the claim that physical predictions of properly defined DSR theory should be independent of the choice of basis.
