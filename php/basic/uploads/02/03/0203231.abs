Title: Dp Branes in PP-wave Background
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Shahrokh Parvizi
Abstract: Dirichlet p-branes in the background of pp waves are constructed using the massive Green-Schwarz worldsheet action for open strings. These branes are localized at the origin and only for $p=7, 5, 3$ preserve half the supersymmetries. The spectrum of the brane theory is analyzed and is found to be in agreement with the spectrum of the small fluctuations of the world-volume super Yang-Mills theory in this background. These branes are expected to correspond to objects that are nonperturbative in $N$ in the dual gauge theory.
