Title: Conformally coupled supermultiplets in four and five dimensions
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We obtain by superfield methods the exceptional representations of the OSp(2N/4,R) and SU(2,2/1) superalgebras which extend to supersingletons of SU(2,2/2N) and F(4), respectively. These representations describe superconformally coupled multiplets and appear in three- and four-dimensional superconformal field theories which are holographic descriptions of certain anti-de Sitter supergravities.
