Title: RS1 Cosmology as Brane Dynamics in an AdS/Schwarzschild Bulk
Authors: Hael Collins and R. Holman and Matthew R. Martin
Abstract: We explore various facets of the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario with two branes by considering the dynamics of the branes moving in a bulk AdS/Schwarzschild geometry. This approach allows us both to understand in more detail and from a different perspective the role of the stabilization of the hierarchy in the brane cosmology, as well as to extend to the situation where the metric contains a horizon. In particular, we explicitly determine how the Goldberger-Wise stabilization mechanism perturbs the background bulk geometry to produce a realistic cosmology.
