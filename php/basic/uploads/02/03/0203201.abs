Title: q-Deformed Orthogonal and Pseudo-Orthogonal Algebras and Their  Representations
Authors: A. M. Gavrilik and A. U. Klimyk
Abstract: Deformed orthogonal and pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebras are constructed which differ from deformations of Lie algebras in terms of Cartan subalgebra and root vectors and which make it possible to construct representations by operators acting according to Gel'fand--Tsetlin-type formulas. Unitary representations of the q-deformed algebras U_q(so_{n,1}) are found.
