Title: Approximate BPS states
Authors: J. R. Hiller and S. S. Pinsky and U. Trittmann
Abstract: We consider dimensionally reduced three-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory. Although the N=1 supersymmetry of this theory does not allow true massive Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states, we find approximate BPS states which have non-zero masses that are almost independent of the Yang-Mills coupling constant and which are a reflection of the massless BPS states of the underlying N=1 super Yang-Mills theory. The masses of these states at large Yang-Mills coupling are exactly at the n-particle continuum thresholds. This leads to a relation between their masses at zero and large Yang-Mills coupling.
