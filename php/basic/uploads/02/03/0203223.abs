Title: Calculable Corrections to Brane Black Hole Decay I: The Scalar Case
Authors: Panagiota Kanti and John March-Russell
Abstract: In the context of brane-world theories, the production cross-section for black holes may be greatly enhanced. Such black holes can in principle lead to detectable signals via their Hawking evaporation to brane-localized modes. We calculate, in the semiclassical approximation, the leading corrections to the energy spectrum (the greybody factors) for decay into scalar fields, as a function of the number of toroidally compactified extra dimensions, and partial wave number.
