Title: Non-extremal fractional branes
Authors: M. Bertolini and T. Harmark and N. A. Obers and A. Westerberg
Abstract: We construct non-extremal fractional D-brane solutions of type-II string theory at the Z_2 orbifold point of K3. These solutions generalize known extremal fractional-brane solutions and provide further insights into N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories and dual descriptions thereof. In particular, we find that for these solutions the horizon radius cannot exceed the non-extremal enhancon radius. As a consequence, we conclude that a system of non-extremal fractional branes cannot develop into a black brane. This conclusion is in agreement with known dual descriptions of the system.
