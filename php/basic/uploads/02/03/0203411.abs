Title: Response of non-equilibrium systems with long-range initial correlations
Authors: Alan Picone and Malte Henkel
Abstract: The long-time dynamics of the $d$-dimensional spherical model with a non-conserved order parameter and quenched from an initial state with long-range correlations is studied through the exact calculation of the two-time autocorrelation and autoresponse functions. In the aging regime, these are given in terms of non-trivial universal scaling functions of both time variables. At criticality, five distinct types of aging are found, depending on the form of the initial correlations, while at low temperatures only a single type of aging exists. The autocorrelation and autoreponse exponents are shown to be generically different and to depend on the initial conditions. The scaling form of the two-time response functions agrees with a recent prediction coming from local scale invariance.
