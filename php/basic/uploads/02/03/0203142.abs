Title: The large radius limit for coherent states on spheres
Authors: Brian C. Hall and Jeffrey J. Mitchell
Abstract: This paper concerns the coherent states on spheres studied by the authors in [J. Math. Phys. 43 (2002), 1211-1236]. We show that in the odd-dimensional case the coherent states on the sphere approach the classical Gaussian coherent states on Euclidean space as the radius of the sphere tends to infinity.
