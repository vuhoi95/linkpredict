Title: A Non-Perturbative Study of Gauge Theory on a Non-Commutative Plane
Authors: W. Bietenholz and F. Hofheinz and J. Nishimura
Abstract: We perform a non-perturbative study of pure gauge theory in a two dimensional non-commutative (NC) space. On the lattice, it is equivalent to the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model, which we simulated at N ranging from 25 to 515. We observe a clear large-N scaling for the 1- and 2-point function of Wilson loops, as well as the 2-point function of Polyakov lines. The 2-point functions agree with a universal wave function renormalization. Based on a Morita equivalence, the large-N double scaling limit corresponds to the continuum limit of NC gauge theory, so the observed large-N scaling demonstrates the non-perturbative renormalizability of this NC field theory. The area law for the Wilson loops holds at small physical area as in commutative 2d planar gauge theory, but at large areas we find an oscillating behavior instead. In that regime the phase of the Wilson loop grows linearly with the area. This agrees with the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the presence of a constant magnetic field, identified with the inverse non-commutativity parameter.
