Title: Noncommutativity in open string: New results in a gauge independent  analysis
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Biswajit Chakraborty and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: Noncommutativity in an open string moving in a background Neveu-Schwarz field is investigated in a gauge independent Hamiltonian approach, leading to new results. The noncommutativity is shown to be a direct consequence of the non-trivial boundary conditions, which, contrary to several approaches, are not treated as constraints. We find that the noncommutativity persists for all string points. In the conformal gauge our results reduce to the usual noncommutativity at the boundaries only.
