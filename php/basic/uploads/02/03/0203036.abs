Title: Reducibility and bosonization of parasupersymmetric and  orthosupersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: C. Quesne and N. Vansteenkiste
Abstract: Order-$p$ parasupersymmetric and orthosupersymmetric quantum mechanics are shown to be fully reducible when they are realized in terms of the generators of a generalized deformed oscillator algebra and a ${\rm Z}_{p+1}$-grading structure is imposed on the Fock space. The irreducible components provide $p+1$ sets of bosonized operators corresponding to both unbroken and broken cases. Such a bosonization is minimal.
