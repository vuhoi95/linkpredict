Title: On Decomposing N=2 Line Bundles as Tensor Products of N=1 Line Bundles
Authors: Fausto Ongay and Jeffrey M. Rabin
Abstract: We obtain the existence of a cohomological obstruction to expressing N=2 line bundles as tensor products of N=1 bundles. The motivation behind this paper is an attempt at understanding the N=2 super KP equation via Baker functions, which are special sections of line bundles on supercurves.
