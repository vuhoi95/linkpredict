Title: A Stuckelberg formalism for the gravitino from warped extra dimensions
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric theories with a warped extra dimension where supersymmetry is broken by boundary conditions that preserve an R-symmetry. It is shown that this supersymmetry breaking mechanism naturally invokes the Stuckelberg formalism for the gravitino in order to give a four-dimensional theory with a smooth massless limit.
