Title: Radial Dimensional Reduction: (Anti) de Sitter Theories from Flat
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We propose a new form of dimensional reduction that constrains dilatation instead of a component of momentum. It corresponds to replacing toroidal compactification in a Cartesian coordinate with that in the logarithm of the radius. Massive theories in de Sitter or anti de Sitter space are thus produced from massless (scale invariant) theories in one higher space or time dimension. As an example, we derive free massive actions for arbitrary representations of the (anti) de Sitter group in arbitrary dimensions. (Previous general results were restricted to symmetric tensors.) We also discuss generalizations to interacting theories.
