Title: Band structure in classical field theory
Authors: Michael Salem and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: Stability and instability bands in classical mechanics are well-studied in connection with systems such as described by the Mathieu equation. We examine whether such band structure can arise in classical field theory in the context of an embedded kink in 1+1 dimensions. The static embedded kink is unstable to perturbations but we show that if the kink is dynamic it can exhibit stability in certain parameter bands. Our results are relevant for estimating the lifetimes of various embedded defects and, in particular, loops of electroweak Z-string.
