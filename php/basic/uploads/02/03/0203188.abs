Title: Vacuum String Field Theory with B field
Authors: L. Bonora and D. Mamone and M. Salizzoni
Abstract: We continue the analysis of Vacuum String Field Theory in the presence of a constant B field. In particular we give a proof of the ratio of brane tensions is the expected one. On the wake of the recent literature we introduce wedge-like states and orthogonal projections. Finally we show a few examples of the smoothing out effects of the B field on some of the singularities that appear in VSFT.
