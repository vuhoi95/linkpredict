Abstract: We deform two-dimensional topological gravity by making use of its gauge theory formulation. The obtained noncommutative gravity model is shown to be invariant under a class of transformations that reduce to standard diffeomorphisms once the noncommutativity parameter is set to zero. Some solutions of the deformed model, like fuzzy AdS_2, are obtained. Furthermore, the transformation properties of the model under the Seiberg-Witten map are studied.
