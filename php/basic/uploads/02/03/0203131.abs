Title: Boundary One-Point Functions, Scattering Theory and Vacuum Solutions in  Integrable Systems
Authors: V. A. Fateev and E. Onofri
Abstract: Integrable boundary Toda theories are considered. We use boundary one-point functions and boundary scattering theory to construct the explicit solutions corresponding to classical vacuum configurations. The boundary ground state energies are conjectured.
