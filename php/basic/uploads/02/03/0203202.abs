Title: Type IIB Seven-brane Solutions from Nine-dimensional Domain Walls
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and U. Gran and D. Roest
Abstract: We investigate half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions of four maximally supersymmetric D=9 massive supergravity theories obtained by Scherk-Schwarz reduction of D=10 IIA and IIB supergravity. One of the theories does not have a superpotential and does not allow domain wall solutions preserving any supersymmetry. The other three theories have superpotentials leading to half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions, one of which has zero potential but non-zero superpotential. The uplifting of these domain wall solutions to ten dimensions leads to three classes of half-supersymmetric Type IIB 7-brane solutions. All solutions within each class are related by SL(2,R) transformations. The three classes together contain solutions carrying all possible (quantised) 7-brane charges. One class contains the well-known D7-brane solution and its dual partners and we provide the explicit solutions for the other two classes. The domain wall solution with zero potential lifts up to a half-supersymmetric conical space-time.
