Title: Towards a Realistic Picture of CP Violation in Heterotic String Models
Authors: Oleg Lebedev and Stephen Morris
Abstract: We find that dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking and spontaneous CP violation can be achieved in heterotic string models with superpotentials singular at the fixed points of the modular group. A semi--realistic picture of CP violation emerges in such models: the CKM phase appears due to a complex VEV of the T-modulus, while the soft supersymmetric CP phases are absent due to an axionic--type symmetry.
