Title: One-loop surface tensions of (supersymmetric) kink domain walls from  dimensional regularization
Authors: A. Rebhan and P. van Nieuwenhuizen and R. Wimmer
Abstract: We consider domain walls obtained by embedding the 1+1-dimensional $\phi^4$-kink in higher dimensions. We show that a suitably adapted dimensional regularization method avoids the intricacies found in other regularization schemes in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories. This method allows us to calculate the one-loop quantum mass of kinks and surface tensions of kink domain walls in a very simple manner, yielding a compact d-dimensional formula which reproduces many of the previous results in the literature. Among the new results is the nontrivial one-loop correction to the surface tension of a 2+1 dimensional N=1 supersymmetric kink domain wall with chiral domain-wall fermions.
