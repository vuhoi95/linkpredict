Abstract: All possible Bogoliubov operators that generate the thermal transformations in the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) form a SU(1,1) group. We discuss this contruction in the bosonic string theory. In particular, the transformation of the Fock space and string operators generated by the most general SU(1,1) unitary Bogoliubov transformation and the entropy of the corresponding thermal string are computed. Also, we construct the thermal $D$-brane solution generated by the SU(1,1) transformation in a constant Kalb-Ramond field and compute its entropy.
