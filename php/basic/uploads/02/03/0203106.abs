Title: Stability of quantum states of finite macroscopic systems against  classical noises, perturbations from environments, and local measurements
Authors: Akira Shimizu and Takayuki Miyadera
Abstract: We study the stability of quantum states of macroscopic systems of finite volume V, against weak classical noises (WCNs), weak perturbations from environments (WPEs), and local measurements (LMs). We say that a pure state is `fragile' if its decoherence rate is anomalously great, and `stable against LMs' if the result of a LM is not affected by another LM at a distant point. By making full use of the locality and huge degrees of freedom, we show the following: (i) If square fluctuation of every additive operator is O(V) or less for a pure state, then it is not fragile in any WCNs or WPEs. (ii) If square fluctuations of some additive operators are O(V^2) for a pure state, then it is fragile in some WCNs or WPEs. (iii) If a state (pure or mixed) has the `cluster property,' then it is stable against LMs, and vice versa. These results have many applications, among which we discuss the mechanism of symmetry breaking in finite systems.
