Title: Comments on M Theory Dynamics on G2 Holonomy Manifolds
Authors: Harald Ita and Yaron Oz and Tadakatsu Sakai
Abstract: We study the dynamics of M-theory on G2 holonomy manifolds, and consider in detail the manifolds realized as the quotient of the spin bundle over S^3 by discrete groups. We analyse, in particular, the class of quotients where the triality symmetry is broken. We study the structure of the moduli space, construct its defining equations and show that three different types of classical geometries are interpolated smoothly. We derive the N=1 superpotentials of M-theory on the quotients and comment on the membrane instanton physics. Finally, we turn on Wilson lines that break gauge symmetry and discuss some of the implications.
