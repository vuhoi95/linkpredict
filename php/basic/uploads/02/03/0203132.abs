Title: New nonlocal effective action
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and V. F. Mukhanov
Abstract: We suggest a new method for the calculation of the nonlocal part of the effective action. It is based on resummation of perturbation series for the heat kernel and its functional trace at large values of the proper time parameter. We derive a new, essentially nonperturbative, nonlocal contribution to the effective action in spacetimes with dimensions $d>2$.
