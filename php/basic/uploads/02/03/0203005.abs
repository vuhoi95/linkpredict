Title: Proposal for the numerical solution of planar QCD
Authors: J. Kiskis and R. Narayanan and H. Neuberger
Abstract: Using quenched reduction, we propose a method for the numerical calculation of meson correlation functions in the planar limit of QCD. General features of the approach are outlined, and an example is given in the context of two-dimensional QCD.
