Title: Superstring on PP-Wave Orbifold from Large-N Quiver Gauge Theory
Authors: Nakwoo Kim and Ari Pankiewicz and Soo-Jong Rey and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We extend the proposal of Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase to Type IIB superstring propagating on pp-wave over ${\bf R}^4/{\bf Z}_k$ orbifold. We show that first-quantized free string theory is described correctly by the large $N$, fixed gauge coupling limit of ${\cal N}=2$ $[U(N)]^k$ quiver gauge theory. We propose a precise map between gauge theory operators and string states for both untwisted and twisted sectors. We also compute leading-order perturbative correction to the anomalous dimensions of these operators. The result is in agreement with the value deduced from string energy spectrum, thus substantiating our proposed operator-state map.
