Authors: Jing-bo Chen and Han-Ying Guo and Ke Wu
Abstract: Discrete Mechanics based on finite element methods is presented in this paper. We also explore the relationship between this discrete mechanics and Veselov discrete mechanics. High order discretizations are constructed in terms of high order interpolations.
