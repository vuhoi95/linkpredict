Title: Uniqueness and non-uniqueness of static vacuum black holes in higher  dimensions
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Daisuke Ida and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness theorem for asymptotically flat static vacuum black hole solutions in higher dimensional space-times. We also construct infinitely many non-asymptotically flat regular static black holes on the same spacetime manifold with the same spherical topology.
