Title: Noncommutative effective theory of vortices in a complex scalar field
Authors: C. D. Fosco and A. Lopez
Abstract: We derive a noncommutative theory description for vortex configurations in a complex field in 2+1 dimensions. We interpret the Magnus force in terms of the noncommutativity, and obtain some results for the quantum dynamics of the system of vortices in that context.
