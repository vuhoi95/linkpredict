Title: The Gravity Dual of Softly Broken N=1 Super Yang-Mills
Authors: N. Evans and M. Petrini and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: Starting from the Maldacena-Nunez supergravity dual of N=1 super Yang-Mills theory we study the inclusion of a supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass term. We consider a class of non supersymmetric deformations of the MN solutions which have been recently proposed in the literature. We show that they can be interpreted as corresponding to the inclusion of both a mass and a condensate. We calculate the vacuum energy of the supergravity solutions showing that the N-fold vacuum degeneracy of the N=1 theory is lifted by the inclusion of a mass term.
