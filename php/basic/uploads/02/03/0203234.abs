Abstract: We have devoted an effort to study some nonlinear actions, characteristics of the ${\cal W}$-theories, in the framework of the soldering formalism. We have disclosed interesting new results concerning the embedding of the original chiral ${\cal W}$-particles in different metrical spaces in the final soldered action, i.e., the metric gets modified by the soldering interference process. The results are presented in a weak field approximation for the ${\cal W}_N$ case when N is greater than 3 and also in an exact way for ${\cal W}_2$. We have promoted a generalization of the interference phenomena to ${\cal W}_N$-theories of different chiralities and shown that the geometrical features introduced can yield a new understanding about the interference formalism in quantum field theories.
