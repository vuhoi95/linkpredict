Title: An Approach to ${\cal N}=4$ ADE Gauge Theory on K3
Authors: Masao Jinzenji and Toru Sasaki
Abstract: We propose a recipe for determination of the partition function of ${\cal N}=4$ $ADE$ gauge theory on $K3$ by generalizing our previous results of the SU(N) case. The resulting partition function satisfies Montonen-Olive duality for $ADE $ gauge group.
