Title: Clifford Algebra of Spacetime and the Conformal Group
Authors: C. Castro and M. Pavsic
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of the conformal group SO(4,2) from the Clifford algebra of spacetime. The latter algebra is a manifold, called Clifford space, which is assumed to be the arena in which physics takes place. A Clifford space does not contain only points (events), but also lines, surfaces, volumes, etc..., and thus provides a framework for description of extended objects. A subspace of the Clifford space is the space whose metric is invariant with respect to the conformal group SO(4,2) which can be given either passive or active interpretation. As advocated long ago by one of us, active conformal transformations, including dilatations, imply that sizes of physical objects can change as a result of free motion, without the presence of forces. This theory is conceptually and technically very different from Weyl's theory and provides when extended to a curved conformal space a resolution of the long standing problem of realistic masses in Kaluza-Klein theories.
