Title: Limit cycles in quantum theories
Authors: Stanislaw D. Glazek and Kenneth G. Wilson
Abstract: Renormalization group limit cycles may be a commonplace for quantum Hamiltonians requiring renormalization, in contrast to experience to date with classical models of critical points, where fixed points are far more common. We discuss the simplest model Hamiltonian identified to date that exhibits a renormalization group limit cycle. The model is a discrete Hamiltonian with two coupling constants and a non-perturbative renormalization group that involves changes in only one of these couplings and is soluble analytically. The Hamiltonian is the discrete analog to a continuum Hamiltonian previously proposed by us.
