Title: Dp-brane Tension from Tachyons and B-field in Vacuum String Field Theory
Authors: P. Matlock and R. C. Rashkov and K. S. Viswanathan and Y. Yang
Abstract: We consider tachyonic string-field fluctuations about a Dp-brane background in the geometrical (CFT) formulation of Vacuum String Field Theory. We then extend this analysis to the case of a background B-field. We find that the standard results for D-brane tension are reproduced in both cases.
