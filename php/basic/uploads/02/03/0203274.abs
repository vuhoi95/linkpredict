Title: On the Friedmann Equation in Brane-World Scenarios
Authors: J. Khoury and R. -J. Zhang
Abstract: The Friedmann law on the brane generically depends quadratically on the brane energy density and involves a ``dark radiation'' term due to the bulk Weyl tensor. Despite its unfamiliar form, we show how it can be derived from a standard four-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory at low energy. In particular, the dark radiation term is found to depend linearly on the brane energy densities. For any equation of state on the branes, the radion evolves such as to generate radiation-dominated cosmology. The radiation-dominated era is conventional and consistent with nucleosynthesis.
