Title: Graphical and Kinematical Approach to Cosmological Horizons
Authors: L. J. Boya and M. A. Per and A. J. Segui
Abstract: We study the apparition of event horizons in accelerated expanding cosmologies. We give a graphical and analytical representation of the horizons using proper distances to coordinate the events. Our analysis is mainly kinematical. We show that, independently of the dynamical equations, all the event horizons tend in the future infinity to a given expression depending on the scale factor that we call asymptotic horizon. We also encounter a subclass of accelerating models without horizon. When the ingoing null geodesics do not change concavity in its cosmic evolution we recover the de Sitter and quintessence-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models.
