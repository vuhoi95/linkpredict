Title: Open Strings on Plane waves and their Yang-Mills duals
Authors: D. Berenstein and E. Gava and J. Maldacena and K. S. Narain and H. Nastase
Abstract: We study the plane wave limit of $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_2$ which arises as the near horizon geometry of D3-branes at an orientifold 7-plane in type I' theory. We analyze string theory in the resulting plane wave background which contains open strings. We identify gauge invariant operators in the dual $Sp(N)$ gauge theory with unoriented closed and open string states.
