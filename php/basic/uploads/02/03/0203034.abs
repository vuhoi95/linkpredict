Title: The Effective Lagrangian in the Randall-Sundrum Model and Electroweak  Physics
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Joshua Erlich and John Terning
Abstract: We consider the two-brane Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with bulk gauge fields. We carefully match the bulk theory to a 4D low-energy effective Lagrangian. In addition to the four-fermion operators induced by KK exchange we find that large negative S and T parameters are induced in the effective theory. This is a tree-level effect and is a consequence of the shapes of the W and Z wave functions in the bulk. Such effects are generic in extra dimensional theories where the standard model (SM) gauge bosons have non-uniform wave functions along the extra dimension. The corrections to precision electroweak observables in the RS model are mostly dominated by S. We fit the parameters of the RS model to the experimental data and find somewhat stronger bounds than previously obtained; however, the standard model bound on the Higgs mass from precision measurements can only be slightly relaxed in this theory.
