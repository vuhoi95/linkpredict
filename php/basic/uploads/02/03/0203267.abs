Title: IIA String Theory on Calabi-Yau Fourfolds with Background Fluxes
Authors: Sergei Gukov and Michael Haack
Abstract: Looking for string vacua with fixed moduli, we study compactifications of type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds in the presence of generic Ramond-Ramond fields. We explicitly derive the (super)potential induced by Ramond-Ramond fluxes performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensional effective action. This can be conveniently achieved in a formulation of the massive type IIA supergravity where all Ramond-Ramond fields appear in a democratic way. The result agrees with the general formula for the superpotential written in terms of calibrations. We further notice that for generic Ramond-Ramond fluxes all geometric moduli are stabilized and one finds non-supersymmetric vacua at positive values of the scalar potential.
