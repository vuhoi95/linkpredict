Title: Brane Interaction as the Origin of Inflation
Authors: Nicholas Jones and Horace Stoica and S. -H. Henry Tye
Abstract: We reanalyze brane inflation with brane-brane interactions at an angle, which include the special case of brane-anti-brane interaction. If nature is described by a stringy realization of the brane world scenario today (with arbitrary compactification), and if some additional branes were present in the early universe, we find that an inflationary epoch is generically quite natural, ending with a big bang when the last branes collide. In an interesting brane inflationary scenario suggested by generic string model-building, we use the density perturbation observed in the cosmic microwave background and the coupling unification to find that the string scale is comparable to the GUT scale.
