Title: Confining Strings at High Temperature
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We show that the high-temperature behaviour of the recently proposed confining strings reproduces exactly the correct large-N QCD result, for a large class of truncations of the long-range interaction between surface elements.
