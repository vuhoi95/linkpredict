Title: An approach to solve Slavnov-Taylor identities in nonsupersymmetric  non-Abelian gauge theories
Authors: Igor Kondrashuk and Gorazd Cvetic and Ivan Schmidt
Abstract: We present a way to solve Slavnov--Taylor identities in a general nonsupersymmetric theory. The solution can be parametrized by a limited number of functions of spacetime coordinates, so that all the effective fields are dressed by these functions via integral convolution. The solution restricts the ghost part of the effective action and gives predictions for the physical part of the effective action.
