Title: D-branes on Calabi-Yau Manifolds and Superpotentials
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Suresh Govindarajan and T. Jayaraman and Alessandro Tomasiello
Abstract: We show how to compute terms in an expansion of the world-volume superpotential for fairly general D-branes on the quintic Calabi-Yau using linear sigma model techniques, and show in examples that this superpotential captures the geometry and obstruction theory of bundles and sheaves on this Calabi-Yau.
