Title: World-Volume Description of M2-branes Ending on an M5-brane and  Holography
Authors: N. S. Deger and A. Kaya
Abstract: We consider world-volume description of M2-branes ending on an M5-brane. The system can be described either as a solitonic solution of the M5-brane field equations or in terms of an effective string propagating in 6-dimensions. We show that the zeroth order scalar scattering amplitudes behave similarly in both pictures. The soliton solution appears to have a horizon-like throat region. Due to the underlying geometric structure of the M5-brane theory, modes propagating near the horizon are subject to a large red-shift. This allows one to define a decoupling limit and implies a holographic duality between two theories which do not contain dynamical gravity.
