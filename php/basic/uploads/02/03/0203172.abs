Title: Dynamics of Black Hole Formation in an Exactly Solvable Model
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Jesse Thaler
Abstract: We consider the process of black hole formation in particle collisions in the exactly solvable framework of 2+1 dimensional Anti de Sitter gravity. An effective Hamiltonian describing the near horizon dynamics of a head on collision is given. The Hamiltonian exhibits a universal structure, with a formation of a horizon at a critical distance. Based on it we evaluate the action for the process and discuss the semiclassical amplitude for black hole formation. The derived amplitude is seen to contain no exponential suppression or enhancement. Coments on the CFT description of the process are made.
