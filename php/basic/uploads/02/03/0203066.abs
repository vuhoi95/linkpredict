Abstract: We apply zeta-function regularization to the kink and susy kink and compute its quantum mass. We fix ambiguities by the renormalization condition that the quantum mass vanishes as one lets the mass gap tend to infinity while keeping scattering data fixed. As an alternative we write the regulated sum over zero point energies in terms of the heat kernel and apply standard heat kernel subtractions. Finally we discuss to what extent these procedures are equivalent to the usual renormalization conditions that tadpoles vanish.
