Title: RSOS revisited
Authors: G. Takacs and G. Watts
Abstract: We investigate the issues of unitarity and reality of the spectrum for the imaginary coupled affine Toda field theories based on a_1(1) and a_2(2) and the perturbed minimal models that arise from their various RSOS restrictions. We show that while all theories based on a_1(1) have real spectra in finite volume, the spectra of a_2(2) models is in general complex, with some exceptions. We also correct the S matrices conjectured earlier for the phi(1,5) perturbations of minimal models and give evidence for a conjecture that the RSOS spectra can be obtained as suitable projections of the folded ATFTs in finite volume.
