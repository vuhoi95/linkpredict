Title: Quantum entropy and special relativity
Authors: Asher Peres and Petra F. Scudo and Daniel R. Terno
Abstract: We consider a single free spin 1/2 particle. The reduced density matrix for its spin is not covariant under Lorentz transformations. The spin entropy is not a relativistic scalar and has no invariant meaning.
