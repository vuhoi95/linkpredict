Title: Noncommutative D-brane and Open String in pp-wave Background with  B-field
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho
Abstract: The open string ending on a D-brane with a constant B-field in a pp-wave Ramond-Ramond background is exactly solvable. The theory is controlled by three dimensionful parameters: alpha', the mass parameter (RR background times the lightcone momentum) and the B-field. We quantize the open string theory and determine the full noncommutative structure. In particular, we find a fully noncommutative phase space whose noncommutativity depends on all these parameters. The lightcone Hamiltionian is obtained, and as a consequence of the nontrivial commutation relations of the theory, new features of the spectrum are noted. Various scaling limits of the string results are considered. Physical implications are discussed.
