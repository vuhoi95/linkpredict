Abstract: We solve the problem of finding all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Neumann matrix of the matter sector of open bosonic string field theory, including the zero modes, and switching on a background B-field. We give the discrete eigenvalues as roots of transcendental equations, and we give analytical expressions for all the eigenvectors.
