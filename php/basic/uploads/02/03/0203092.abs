Title: Branes in Special Holonomy Backgrounds
Authors: Amit Loewy and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We study the flow from the theory of D2-branes in a G2 holonomy background to M2-branes in a Spin(7) holonomy background. We consider in detail the UV and IR regimes, and the effect of topology change of the background on the field theory. We conjecture a non-Abelian N=1 mirror symmetry.
