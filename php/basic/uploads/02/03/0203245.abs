Title: Algebra of the observables in the Calogero model and in the Chern-Simons  matrix model
Authors: L. Jonke and S. Meljanac
Abstract: The algebra of observables of an N-body Calogero model is represented on the S_N-symmetric subspace of the positive definite Fock space. We discuss some general properties of the algebra and construct four different realizations of the dynamical symmetry algebra of the Calogero model. Using the fact that the minimal algebra of observables is common to the Calogero model and the finite Chern-Simons (CS) matrix model, we extend our analysis to the CS matrix model. We point out the algebraic similarities and distinctions of these models.
