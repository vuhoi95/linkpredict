Title: Cooper pairing and single particle properties of trapped Fermi gases
Authors: G. M. Bruun and H. Heiselberg
Abstract: We calculate the elementary excitations and pairing of a trapped atomic Fermi gas in the superfluid phase. The level spectra and pairing gaps undergo several transitions as the strength of the interactions between and the number of atoms are varied. For weak interactions, the Cooper pairs are formed between particles residing in the same harmonic oscillator shell. In this regime, the nature of the paired state is shown to depend critically on the position of the chemical potential relative to the harmonic oscillator shells and on the size of the mean field. For stronger interactions, we find a region where pairing occur between time-reversed harmonic oscillator states in different shells also.
