Title: Geometrical Construction of Heterogeneous Loop Amplitudes in 2D Gravity
Authors: Masahiro Anazawa and Atushi Ishikawa
Abstract: We study a disk amplitude which has a complicated heterogeneous matter configuration on the boundary in a system of the (3,4) conformal matter coupled to two-dimensional gravity. It is analyzed using the two-matrix chain model in the large N limit. We show that the disk amplitude calculated by Schwinger-Dyson equations can completely be reproduced through purely geometrical consideration. From this result, we speculate that all heterogeneous loop amplitudes can be derived from the geometrical consideration and the consistency among relevant amplitudes.
