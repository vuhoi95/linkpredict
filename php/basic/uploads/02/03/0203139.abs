Title: The complex sine-Gordon model on a half line
Authors: P. Bowcock and G. Tzamtzis
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the complex sine-Gordon model in the presence of a boundary, and derive boundary conditions that preserve integrability. We present soliton and breather solutions, investigate the scattering of particles and solitons off the boundary and examine the existence of classical solutions corresponding to boundary bound states.
