Title: Elliptic Fibrations and Elliptic Models
Authors: Amy E. Ksir and Stephen G. Naculich
Abstract: We study the Seiberg-Witten curves for N=2 SUSY gauge theories arising from type IIA string configurations with two orientifold sixplanes. Such theories lift to elliptic models in M-theory. We express the M-theory background for these models as a nontrivial elliptic fibration over C. We discuss singularities of this surface, and write the Seiberg-Witten curve for several theories as a subvariety of this surface.
