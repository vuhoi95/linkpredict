Title: A New Approach to Personal Income Distribution
Authors: Atushi Ishikawa and Tadao Suzuki and Masashi Tomoyose
Abstract: The results of R^2 dynamical random surface model (2-dimensional quantum gravity with a $R^2$ term) are applied to explain the personal income distribution. A scale invariance exists if there is not the $R^2$ term in the action. The R^2 term provides a typical scale and breaks the scale invariance explicitly in the low and middle income range. A new distribution, Weibull distribution, is deduced from the action analytically in the low income range, and a consistent fitting is obtained in the whole income range. Also, we show that the lognormal distribution in the middle income range can be understood in this framework.
