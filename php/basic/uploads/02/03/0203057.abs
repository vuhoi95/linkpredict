Title: Orbifolds and Flows from Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Richard Corrado and Murat Gunaydin and Nicholas P. Warner and Marco Zagermann
Abstract: We examine orbifolds of the IIB string via gauged supergravity. For the gravity duals of the A_{n-1} quiver gauge theories, we extract the massless degrees of freedom and assemble them into multiplets of N=4 gauged supergravity in five dimensions. We examine the embedding of the gauge group into the isometry group of the scalar manifold, as well as the symmetries of the scalar potential. From this we find that there is a large SU(1,n) symmetry group which relates different RG flows in the dual quiver gauge theory. We find that this symmetry implies an extension of the usual duality between ten-dimensional IIB solutions which involves exchanging geometric moduli with background fluxes.
