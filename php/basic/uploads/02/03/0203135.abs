Title: Fermion Schwinger's function for the SU(2)-Thirring model
Authors: B. Doyon and S. Lukyanov
Abstract: We study the Euclidean two-point function of Fermi fields in the SU(2)-Thirring model on the whole distance (energy) scale. We perform perturbative and renormalization group analyses to obtain the short-distance asymptotics, and numerically evaluate the long-distance behavior by using the form factor expansion. Our results illustrate the use of bosonization and conformal perturbation theory in the renormalization group analysis of a fermionic theory, and numerically confirm the validity of the form factor expansion in the case of the SU(2)-Thirring model.
