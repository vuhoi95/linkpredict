Title: A quantum algebraic description of D-branes on group manifolds
Authors: Jacek Pawelczyk and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We propose an algebraic description of (untwisted) D-branes on compact group manifolds $G$ using quantum algebras related to $U_q(\mg)$. It reproduces the known characteristics of stable branes in the WZW models, in particular their configurations in $G$, energies as well as the set of harmonics. Both generic and degenerate branes are covered.
