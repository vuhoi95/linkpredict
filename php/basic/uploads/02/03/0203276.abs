Title: Superconformal Tensor Calculus on an Orbifold in 5D
Authors: Taichiro Kugo and Keisuke Ohashi
Abstract: Superconformal tensor calculus on an orbifold S^1/Z_2 is given in five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. The four-dimensional superconformal Weyl multiplet and various matter multiplets are induced on the boundary planes from the 5D supermultiplets in the bulk. We identify those induced 4D supermultiplets and clarify a general method for coupling the bulk fields to the matter fields on the boundaries in a superconformal invariant manner.
