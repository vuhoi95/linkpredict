Title: Space Dependence of Entangled States and Franson-type EPR Experiments
Authors: A. A. Baranov and A. N. Pechen and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: We analyze some aspects of recently performed Franson-type experiments with entangled photon pairs aimed to test Bell's inequalities. We point out that quantum theory leads to the coincidence rate between detectors which includes in fact a dependence on the distance. We study this dependence and obtain that for large distances the correlation function vanishes. Therefore with taking into account the space parts of wave functions of photons for large distances quantum mechanical predictions are consistent with Bell's inequalities. We propose an experimental study of space dependence of correlation functions in Bell-type experiments.
