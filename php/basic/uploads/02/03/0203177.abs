Title: Transport coefficients, spectral functions and the lattice
Authors: Gert Aarts and Jose Maria Martinez Resco
Abstract: Transport coefficients are determined by the slope of spectral functions of composite operators at zero frequency. We study the spectral function relevant for the shear viscosity for arbitrary frequencies in weakly-coupled scalar and nonabelian gauge theories at high temperature and compute the corresponding correlator in euclidean time. We discuss whether nonperturbative values of transport coefficients can be extracted from euclidean lattice simulations.
