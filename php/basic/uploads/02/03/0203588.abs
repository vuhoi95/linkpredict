Title: Phase transition and critical behaviour of the d=3 Gross-Neveu model
Authors: F. Hoefling and C. Nowak and C. Wetterich
Abstract: A second order phase transition for the three dimensional Gross-Neveu model is established for one fermion species N=1. This transition breaks a paritylike discrete symmetry. It constitutes its peculiar universality class with critical exponent \nu = 0.63 and scalar and fermionic anomalous dimension \eta_\sigma = 0.31 and \eta_\psi = 0.11, respectively. We also compute critical exponents for other N. Our results are based on exact renormalization group equations.
