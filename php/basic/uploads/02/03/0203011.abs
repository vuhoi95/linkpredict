Title: Inertial forces in the Casimir effect with two moving plates
Authors: L. A. S. Machado and P. A. Maia Neto
Abstract: We combine linear response theory and dimensional regularization in order to derive the dynamical Casimir force in the low frequency regime. We consider two parallel plates moving along the normal direction in $D-$dimensional space. We assume the free-space values for the mass of each plate to be known, and obtain finite, separation-dependent mass corrections resulting from the combined effect of the two plates. The global mass correction is proportional to the static Casimir energy, in agreement with Einstein's law of equivalence between mass and energy for stressed rigid bodies.
