Title: Symmetry Breaking Boundary States and Defect Lines
Authors: Thomas Quella and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We present a large and universal class of new boundary states which break part of the chiral symmetry in the underlying bulk theory. Our formulas are based on coset constructions and they can be regarded as a non-abelian generalization of the ideas that were used by Maldacena, Moore and Seiberg to build new boundary states for SU(N). We apply our expressions to construct defect lines joining two conformal field theories with possibly different central charge. Such defects can occur e.g. in the AdS/CFT correspondence when branes extend to the boundary of the AdS-space.
