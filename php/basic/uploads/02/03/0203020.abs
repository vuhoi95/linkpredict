Title: Four-Dimensional Superconformal Theories with Interacting Boundaries or  Defects
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Zachary Guralnik and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: We study four-dimensional superconformal field theories coupled to three-dimensional superconformal boundary or defect degrees of freedom. Starting with bulk N=2, d=4 theories, we construct abelian models preserving N=2, d=3 supersymmetry and the conformal symmetries under which the boundary/defect is invariant. We write the action, including the bulk terms, in N=2, d=3 superspace. Moreover we derive Callan-Symanzik equations for these models using their superconformal transformation properties and show that the beta functions vanish to all orders in perturbation theory, such that the models remain superconformal upon quantization. Furthermore we study a model with N=4 SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the bulk coupled to a N=4, d=3 hypermultiplet on a defect. This model was constructed by DeWolfe, Freedman and Ooguri, and conjectured to be conformal based on its relation to an AdS configuration studied by Karch and Randall. We write this model in N=2, d=3 superspace, which has the distinct advantage that non-renormalization theorems become transparent. Using N=4, d=3 supersymmetry, we argue that the model is conformal.
