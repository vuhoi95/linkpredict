Title: Binding Energy of Scalar Bound State by Topologically Massive  Interaction: Fermion and Anti-fermion System with Heavy Mass
Authors: Toyoki Matsuyama and Hideko Nagahiro
Abstract: A bound state problem in a topologically massive quantum electrodynamics is investigated by using a non-perturbative method. We formulate the Bethe- Salpeter equation for scalar bound states composed of massive fermion and anti-fermion pair under the lowest ladder approximation. In a large mass expansion for the (anti-) fermion, we derive the Schr{\"o}dinger equation and solve it by a numerical method. The energy eigenvalues of bound states are evaluated for various values of a topological mass and also a fermion mass. Then we find a novel logarithmic scaling behaviour of the binding energy in varying the topological mass, fermion mass and also a quantum number. There exists a critical value of the topological mass, beyond which the bound states disappear. As the topological mass decreases, the energy eigenvalues of the bound states, which are negative, also decrease with a logarithmic dependence on the topological mass. A Chern-Simons term gives the bound system a repulsive effect.
