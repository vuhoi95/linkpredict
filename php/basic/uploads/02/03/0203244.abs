Title: A Comment on Curvature Effects In CFTs And The Cardy-Verlinde Formula
Authors: Arshad Momen and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We examine the Cardy-Verlinde formula for finite temperature N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory on $R\times S^3$, and its AdS dual. We find that curvature effects introduce non-trivial corrections to thermodynamic quantities computed on both sides. We find a modified version of the Cardy-Verlinde formula for the SYM theory, incorporating these. On the gravity side, these corrections imply that the Cardy-Verlinde formula is exact.
