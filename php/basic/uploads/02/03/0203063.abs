Title: On the fermion-boson correspondence for correlation functions of  disorder operators
Authors: G. Delfino and P. Grinza and G. Mussardo
Abstract: When a quantum field theory possesses topological excitations in a phase with spontaneously broken symmetry, these are created by operators which are non-local with respect to the order parameter. Due to non-locality, such disorder operators have non-trivial correlation functions even in free massive theories. In two dimensions, these correlators can be expressed exactly in terms of solutions of non-linear differential equations. The correlation functions of the one-parameter family of non-local operators in the free charged bosonic and fermionic models are the inverse of each other. We point out a simple derivation of this correspondence within the form factor approach
