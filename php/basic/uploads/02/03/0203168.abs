Title: A Note on Multi-trace Deformations and AdS/CFT
Authors: Amit Sever and Assaf Shomer
Abstract: We derive the general formula, at a finite cutoff, for the change in the boundary condition of a scalar field in AdS under a Multiple-trace deformation of the dual CFT. Our analysis suggests that fluctuations around the classical solution in AdS should not be constrained by boundary conditions.
