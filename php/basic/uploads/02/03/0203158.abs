Title: Discussing the Spectrum of the Kalb-Ramond Field Coupled to 3D-Gravity
Authors: J. L. Boldo and J. A. Helayel-Neto and N. Panza
Abstract: The mechanism of dynamical mass generation for the gauge field is studied through 1-loop. We find out that torsion is an obstruction to the appearance of a 1-loop mass correction. Contrary, if torsion is not present, a mass gap is generated for the 2-form field.
