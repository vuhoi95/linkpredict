Title: Stress Energy Tensor in c=0 Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: I. I. Kogan and A. Nichols
Abstract: We discuss the partners of the stress energy tensor and their structure in Logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular we draw attention to the fundamental differences between theories with zero and non-zero central charge. We analyze the OPE for T, \bar{T} and the logarithmic partners t and \bar{t} for c=0 theories.
