Title: Cosmological perturbations and short distance physics from  Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Fedele Lizzi and Gianpiero Mangano and Gennaro Miele and Marco Peloso
Abstract: We investigate the possible effects on the evolution of perturbations in the inflationary epoch due to short distance physics. We introduce a suitable non local action for the inflaton field, suggested by Noncommutative Geometry, and obtained by adopting a generalized star product on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. In particular, we study how the presence of a length scale where spacetime becomes noncommutative affects the gaussianity and isotropy properties of fluctuations, and the corresponding effects on the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum.
