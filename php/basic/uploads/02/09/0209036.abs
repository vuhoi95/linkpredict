Title: Stable, Time-Dependent, Exact Solutions for Brane Models with a Bulk  Scalar Field
Authors: Panagiota Kanti and Seokcheon Lee and Keith A. Olive
Abstract: We derive two classes of brane-world solutions arising in the presence of a bulk scalar field. For static field configurations, we adopt a time-dependent, factorizable metric ansatz that allows for radion stabilization. The solutions are characterized by a non-trivial warping along the extra dimension, even in the case of a vanishing bulk cosmological constant, and lead to a variety of inflationary, time-dependent solutions of the 3D scale factor on the brane. We also derive the constraints necessary for the stability of these solutions under time-dependent perturbations of the radion field, and we demonstrate the existence of phenomenologically interesting, stable solutions with a positive cosmological constant on the brane.
