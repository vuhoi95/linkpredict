Title: I-balls
Authors: S. Kasuya and M. Kawasaki and Fuminobu Takahashi
Abstract: We find that there exists a soliton-like solution ``I-ball'' in theories of a real scalar field if the scalar potential satisfies appropriate conditions. Although the I-ball does not have any topological or global U(1) charges, its stability is ensured by the adiabatic invariance for the oscillating field.
