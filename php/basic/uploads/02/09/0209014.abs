Title: String Model with Dynamical Geometry and Torsion
Authors: M. O. Katanaev and I. V. Volovich
Abstract: A string model with dynamical metric and torsion is proposed. The geometry of the string is described by an effective Lagrangian for the scalar and vector fields. The path integral quantization of the string is considered.
