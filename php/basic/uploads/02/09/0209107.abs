Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of mechanical model obtained from the light-cone version of SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory under the supposition of gauge potential dependence only on ``time'' along the light-cone direction. The computer algebra system Maple was used strongly to compute and separate the complete set of constraints. In contrast to the instant form of Yang-Mills mechanics the constraints here represent a mixed form of first and second-class constraints and reduce the number of the physical degrees of freedom up to four canonical one.
