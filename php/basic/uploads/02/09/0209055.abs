Title: Induced quantum gravity on a Riemann Surface
Authors: G. Bandelloni and S. Lazzarini
Abstract: Induced quantum gravity dynamics built over a Riemann surface is studied in arbitrary dimension. Local coordinates on the target space are given by means of the Laguerre-Forsyth construction. A simple model is proposed and pertubatively quantized. In doing so, the classical W-symmetry turns out to be preserved on-shell at any order of the $\hbar$ perturbative expansion. As a main result, due to quantum corrections, the target coordinates acquire a non-trivial character.
