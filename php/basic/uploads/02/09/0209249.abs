Title: Black holes may not constrain varying constants
Authors: S. Carlip and S. Vaidya
Abstract: New and rather controversial observations hint that the fine structure constant \alpha may have been smaller in the early universe, suggesting that some of the fundamental ``constants'' of physics may be dynamical. In a recent paper, Davies, Davis, and Lineweaver have argued that black hole thermodynamics favors theories in which the speed of light c decreases with time, and disfavors those in which the fundamental electric charge e increases. We show that when one considers the full thermal environment of a black hole, no such conclusion can be drawn: thermodynamics is consistent with an increase in \alpha whether it comes from a decrease in c, an increase in e, or a combination of the two.
