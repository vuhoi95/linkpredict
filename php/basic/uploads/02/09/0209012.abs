Title: Heat content asymptotics for spectral boundary conditions
Authors: Peter Gilkey and Klaus Kirsten and JeongHyeong Park
Abstract: We study the short time heat content asymptotics for spectral boundary conditions. The heat content coefficients are shown to be non-local and some preliminary results concerning the structure of the first few terms are given.
