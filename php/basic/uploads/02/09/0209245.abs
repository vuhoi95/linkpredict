Title: Nonperturbative flipped SU(5) vacua in Horava-Witten theory
Authors: A. E. Faraggi and R. Garavuso and J. M. Isidro
Abstract: There is good support for the embedding of the Standard Model fermions in the chiral 16 representation of SO(10). Such an embedding is provided by the realistic free fermionic heterotic-string models. In this talk we demonstrate the existence of solutions with 3 generations and SO(10) observable gauge group, in the case of compactification on a torus-fibred Calabi-Yau space over a Hirzebruch base surface. The SO(10)symmetry is broken to SU(5)xU(1) by a Wilson line. The overlap with the realistic free fermionic heterotic-string models is discussed.
