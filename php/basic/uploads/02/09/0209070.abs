Abstract: The latest astrophysical data on the Supernova luminosity--distance -- redshift relations, primordial nucleosynthesis, value of Cosmic Microwave Background--temperature, and baryon asymmetry are considered as an evidence of relative measurement standard, field nature of time, and conformal symmetry of the physical world. We show how these principles of description of the universe help modern quantum field theory to explain the creation of the universe, time, and matter from the physical vacuum as a state with the lowest energy.
