Title: Curved-space classical solutions of a massive supermatrix model
Authors: Takehiro Azuma and Maxime Bagnoud
Abstract: We investigate here a supermatrix model with a mass term and a cubic interaction. It is based on the super Lie algebra osp(1|32,R), which could play a role in the construction of the eleven-dimensional M-theory. This model contains a massive version of the IIB matrix model, where some fields have a tachyonic mass term. Therefore, the trivial vacuum of this theory is unstable. However, this model possesses several classical solutions where these fields build noncommutative curved spaces and these solutions are shown to be energetically more favorable than the trivial vacuum. In particular, we describe in details two cases, the SO(3) \times SO(3) \times SO(3) (three fuzzy 2-spheres) and the SO(9) (fuzzy 8-sphere) classical backgrounds.
