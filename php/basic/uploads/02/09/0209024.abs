Title: Discrete-Time Quantum Field Theory and the Deformed Super Virasoro  Algebra
Authors: Masud Chaichian and Peter Presnajder
Abstract: We show that the deformations of Virasoro and super Virasoro algebra, constructed earlier on an abstract mathematical background, emerge after Wick rotation, within an exact treatment of discrete-time free field models on a circle. The deformation parameter is $e^\lambda$, where $\lambda=\tau/\rho$ is the ratio of the discrete-time scale $\tau$ and the radius $\rho$ of the compact space.
