Title: Ginsparg-Wilson Relation, Topological Invariants and Finite  Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Hajime Aoki and Satoshi Iso and Keiichi Nagao
Abstract: We show that the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) relation can play an important role to define chiral structures in {\it finite} noncommutative geometries. Employing GW relation, we can prove the index theorem and construct topological invariants even if the system has only finite degrees of freedom. As an example, we consider a gauge theory on a fuzzy two-sphere and give an explicit construction of a noncommutative analog of the GW relation, chirality operator and the index theorem. The topological invariant is shown to coincide with the 1st Chern class in the commutative limit.
