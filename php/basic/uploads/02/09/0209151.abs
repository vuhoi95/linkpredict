Title: Vanishing of the Bare Coupling in Four Dimensions
Authors: V. Elias and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: We examine two restructurings of the series relationship between the bare and renormalized coupling constant in dimensional regularization. In one of these restructurings, we are able to demonstrate via all-orders summation of leading and successive epsilon = 0 (dimensionality = 4) poles that the bare coupling vanishes in the dimension-4 limit.
