Title: Spin-Statistics and CPT Theorems in Noncommutative Field Theory
Authors: M. Chaichian and K. Nishijima and A. Tureanu
Abstract: We show that Pauli's spin-statistics relation remains valid in noncommutative quantum field theories (NC QFT), with the exception of some peculiar cases of noncommutativity between space and time. We also prove that, while the individual symmetries C and T, and in some cases also P, are broken, the CPT theorem still holds in general for noncommutative field theories, in spite of the inherent nonlocality and violation of Lorentz invariance.
