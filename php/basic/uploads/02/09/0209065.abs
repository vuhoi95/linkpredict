Title: Some Aspects of Scattering in (Non) Commutative Gauge Theories
Authors: Zafar Ahmed and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We study almost-forward scattering in the context of usual and non-commutative QED. We study the semi-classical behaviour of particles undergoing this scattering process in the two theories, and show that the shock wave picture, effective in QED fails for NCQED. Further, we show that whereas in QED, there are no leading logarithmic contributions to the amplitude upto sixth order, uncancelled logarithms appear in NCQED.
