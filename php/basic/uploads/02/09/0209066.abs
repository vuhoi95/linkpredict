Title: Newton potential in deSitter braneworld
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: Using graviton correlator on deSitter (dS) brane in 5d AdS or dS bulk we calculate the four-dimensional Newton potential. For flat brane in AdS bulk the Randall-Sundrum result is recovered. For flat brane in dS bulk the sign of subleading ($1/r^3$) term in Newton potential is negative if compare with AdS bulk. In accordance with dS/CFT correspondence this indicates that dual CFT should be non-unitary (for example, higher derivative conformal theory).
