Title: Almost No-Scale Supergravity
Authors: Markus A. Luty and Nobuchika Okada
Abstract: We construct an explicit 5-dimensional supergravity model that realizes the "no scale" mechanism for supersymmetry breaking with no unstable moduli. Supersymmetry is broken by a constant superpotential localized on a brane, and the radion is stabilized by Casimir energy from supergravity and massive hypermultiplets. If the standard model gauge and matter fields are localized on a brane, then visible sector supersymmetry breaking is dominated by gravity loops and flavor-violating hypermultiplet loops, and gaugino masses are smaller than scalar masses. We present a realistic model in which the the standard model gauge fields are partly localized. In this model visible sector supersymmetry breaking is naturally gaugino mediated, while masses of the gravitino and gravitational moduli are larger than the weak scale.
