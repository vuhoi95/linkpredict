Title: Time and space dependent backgrounds from nonsupersymmetric strings
Authors: E. Dudas and J. Mourad and C. Timirgaziu
Abstract: We investigate maximally symmetric backgrounds in nonsupersymmetric string vacua with D-branes and O-planes localized in the compact space. We find a class of solutions with a perturbative string coupling constant in all regions of spacetime. Depending on the particular model, we find either a time evolution with a big-bang type singularity or a space dependent background with generically orbifold singularities. We show that the result can be interpreted as a supersymmetric bulk with some symmetries broken by the boundaries. We also discuss an interesting connection to Lorentzian and Euclidian orbifolds.
