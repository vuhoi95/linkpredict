Title: A proposal for a manifestly gauge invariant and universal calculus in  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Stefano Arnone and Antonio Gatti and Tim R. Morris
Abstract: We uncover a method of calculation that proceeds at every step without fixing the gauge or specifying details of the regularisation scheme. Results are obtained by iterated use of integration by parts and gauge invariance identities. The initial stages can even be computed diagrammatically. The method is formulated within the framework of an exact renormalization group for SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge theory, incorporating an effective cutoff through a manifest spontaneously broken SU(N|N) gauge invariance. We demonstrate the technique with a compact calculation of the one-loop beta function, achieving a manifestly universal result, and without gauge fixing, for the first time at finite N.
