Title: Generalized Eulerian Coordinates for Relativistic Fluids: Hamiltonian  Rest-Frame Instant Form, Relative Variables, Rotational Kinematics
Authors: David Alba and Luca Lusanna
Abstract: We study the rest-frame instant form of a new formulation of relativistic perfect fluids in terms of new generalized Eulerian configuration coordinates. After the separation of the relativistic center of mass from the relative variables on the Wigner hyper-planes, we define orientational and shape variables for the fluid, viewed as a relativistic extended deformable body, by introducing dynamical body frames. Finally we define Dixon's multipoles for the fluid.
