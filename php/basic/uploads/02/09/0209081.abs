Title: Ground State of Supermembrane on PP-wave
Authors: Noriko Nakayama and Katsuyuki Sugiyama and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We consider the ground state of supermembrane on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background by using the quantum-mechanical procedure of de Wit-Hoppe-Nicolai. In the pp-wave case the ground state has non-trivial structure even in the zero-mode Hamiltonian, which is identical with that of superparticles on the pp-wave and resembles supersymmetric harmonic oscillators. The supergravity multiplet in the flat case is splitting with a certain energy difference. We explicitly construct the unique supersymmetric ground-state wave function of the zero-mode Hamiltonian, which is obviously normalizable. Moreover, we discuss the nonzero-mode Hamiltonian and construct an example for the ground-state wave function with a truncation of the variables. This special solution seems non-normalizable but its L^2-norm can be represented by an asymptotic series.
