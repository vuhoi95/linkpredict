Abstract: We construct five different two-parameter massive deformations of the unique nine-dimensional N=2 supergravity. All of these deformations have a higher-dimensional origin via Scherk-Schwarz reduction and correspond to gauged supergravities. The gauge groups we encounter are SO(2), SO(1,1)^+, R, R^+ and the two-dimensional non-Abelian Lie group A(1), which consists of scalings and translations in one dimension. We make a systematic search for half-supersymmetric domain walls and non-supersymmetric de Sitter space solutions. Furthermore, we discuss in which sense the supergravities we have constructed can be considered as low-energy limits of compactified superstring theory.
