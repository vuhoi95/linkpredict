Title: Holographic View of Cosmological Perturbations
Authors: Jiro Soda and Sugumi Kanno
Abstract: The cosmological perturbation theory is revisited from the holographic point of view. In the case of the single brane model, it turns out that the AdS/CFT correspondence plays an important role. In the case of the two-brane model, it is shown that the effective equations of motion becomes the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity. It is also demonstrated that the radion anisotropy gives the CMB fluctuations through the Sachs-Wolfe effect.
