Title: Deconstructing Scalar QED at Zero and Finite Temperature
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Kenji Sakamoto and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We calculate the effective potential for the WLPNGB in a world with a circular latticized extra dimension. The mass of the WLPNGB is calculated from the one-loop quantum effect of scalar fields at zero and finite temperature. We show that a series expansion by the modified Bessel functions is useful to calculate the one-loop effective potentials.
