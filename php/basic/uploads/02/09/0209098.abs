Title: N=2 Boundary conditions for non-linear sigma models and Landau-Ginzburg  models
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We study N=2 nonlinear two dimensional sigma models with boundaries and their massive generalizations (the Landau-Ginzburg models). These models are defined over either Kahler or bihermitian target space manifolds. We determine the most general local N=2 superconformal boundary conditions (D-branes) for these sigma models. In the Kahler case we reproduce the known results in a systematic fashion including interesting results concerning the coisotropic A-type branes. We further analyse the N=2 superconformal boundary conditions for sigma models defined over a bihermitian manifold with torsion. We interpret the boundary conditions in terms of different types of submanifolds of the target space. We point out how the open sigma models correspond to new types of target space geometry. For the massive Landau-Ginzburg models (both Kahler and bihermitian) we discuss an important class of supersymmetric boundary conditions which admits a nice geometrical interpretation.
