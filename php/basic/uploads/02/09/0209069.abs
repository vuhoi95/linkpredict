Authors: N. Alonso-Alberca and E. Lozano-Tellechea and T. Ortin
Abstract: We show that the spacetime of the near-horizon limit of the extreme rotating d=5 black hole, which is maximally supersymmetric in N=2,d=5 supergravity for any value of the rotation parameter j in [-1,1], is locally isomorphic to a homogeneous non-symmetric spacetime corresponding to an element of the 1-parameter family of coset spaces SO(2,1)x SO(3)/SO(2)_j in which the subgroup SO(2)_j is a combination of the two SO(2) subgroups of SO(2,1) and SO(3).
