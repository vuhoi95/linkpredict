Title: 5 Dimensional Spacetime with q-deformed Extra Space
Authors: S. Naka and H. Toyoda
Abstract: An attempt to get a non-trivial-mass structure of particles in a Randall-Sundrum type of 5-dimensional spacetime with q-deformed extra dimension is discussed. In this spacetime, the fifth dimensional space is boundary free, but there areises an elastic potential preventing free motion toward the fifth direction. The q-deformation is, then, introduced in such a way that the spacetime coordinates become non-commutative between 4-dimensional components and the fifth component. As a result of this q-deformation, there arises naturally an ultraviolet-cutoff effect for the propagators of particles embedded in this spacetime.
