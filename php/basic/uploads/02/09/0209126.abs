Title: Shape of Deconstruction
Authors: Kiyoshi Shiraishi and Kenji Sakamoto and Nahomi Kan
Abstract: We construct a six-dimensional Maxwell theory using a latticized extra space, the continuum limit of which is a shifted torus recently discussed by Dienes. This toy model exhibits the correspondence between continuum theory and discrete theory, and give a geometrical insight to theory-space model building.
