Title: BT Worldsheet for Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Skuli Gudmundsson and Charles B. Thorn and Tuan A. Tran
Abstract: We extend the Bardakci-Thorn (BT) worldsheet formalism to supersymmetric non-abelian gauge theory. Our method covers the cases of N =1,2,4 extended supersymmetry. This task requires the introduction of spinor valued Grassmann variables on the worldsheet analogous to those of the supersymmetric formulation of superstring theory. As in the pure Yang-Mills case, the worldsheet formalism automatically generates the correct quartic vertices from the cubic vertices. We also discuss coupling renormalization to one loop order.
