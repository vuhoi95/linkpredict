Title: Penrose Limit and String Theories on Various Brane Backgrounds
Authors: Hiroyuki Fuji and Katsushi Ito and Yasuhiro Sekino
Abstract: We investigate the Penrose limit of various brane solutions including Dp-branes, NS5-branes, fundamental strings, (p,q) fivebranes and (p,q) strings. We obtain special null geodesics with the fixed radial coordinate (critical radius), along which the Penrose limit gives string theories with constant mass. We also study string theories with time-dependent mass, which arise from the Penrose limit of the brane backgrounds. We examine equations of motion of the strings in the asymptotic flat region and around the critical radius. In particular, for (p,q) fivebranes, we find that the string equations of motion in the directions with the B field are explicitly solved by the spheroidal wave functions.
