Title: Casimir interaction between two concentric cylinders: exact versus  semiclassical results
Authors: Francisco D. Mazzitelli and María J. Sánchez and Norberto N. Scoccola and Javier von Stecher
Abstract: The Casimir interaction between two perfectly conducting, infinite, concentric cylinders is computed using a semiclassical approximation that takes into account families of classical periodic orbits that reflect off both cylinders. It is then compared with the exact result obtained by the mode-by-mode summation technique. We analyze the validity of the semiclassical approximation and show that it improves the results obtained through the proximity theorem.
