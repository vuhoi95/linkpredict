Title: Intertwining Relations for the Matrix Calogero-like Models:  Supersymmetry and Shape Invariance
Authors: M. V. Ioffe and A. I. Neelov
Abstract: Intertwining relations for $N$-particle Calogero-like models with internal degrees of freedom are investigated. Starting from the well known Dunkl-Polychronakos operators, we construct new kind of local (without exchange operation) differential operators. These operators intertwine the matrix Hamiltonians corresponding to irreducible representations of the permutation group $S_N$. In particular cases, this method allows to construct a new class of exactly solvable Dirac-like equations and a new class of matrix models with shape invariance. The connection with approach of multidimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics is established.
