Title: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real and complex eigenvalues: An sl(2,C)  approach
Authors: B. Bagchi and C. Quesne
Abstract: Potential algebras are extended from Hermitian to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and shown to provide an elegant method for studying the transition from real to complex eigenvalues for a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians associated with the complex Lie algebra A$_1$.
