Title: Covariant Perturbations of Schwarzschild Black Holes
Authors: Chris A. Clarkson and Richard K. Barrett
Abstract: We present a new covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation formalism for dealing with spacetimes having spherical symmetry (or some preferred spatial direction) in the background, and apply it to the case of gravitational wave propagation in a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. The 1+3 covariant approach is extended to a `1+1+2 covariant sheet' formalism by introducing a radial unit vector in addition to the timelike congruence, and decomposing all covariant quantities with respect to this. The background Schwarzschild solution is discussed and a covariant characterisation is given. We give the full first-order system of linearised 1+1+2 covariant equations, and we show how, by introducing (time and spherical) harmonic functions, these may be reduced to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations and algebraic constraints for the 1+1+2 variables which may be solved straightforwardly. We show how both the odd and even parity perturbations may be unified by the discovery of a covariant, frame- and gauge-invariant, transverse-traceless tensor describing gravitational waves, which satisfies a covariant wave equation equivalent to the Regge-Wheeler equation for both even and odd parity perturbations. We show how the Zerilli equation may be derived from this tensor, and derive a similar transverse traceless tensor equivalent to this equation. The so-called `special' quasinormal modes with purely imaginary frequency emerge naturally. The significance of the degrees of freedom in the choice of the two frame vectors is discussed, and we demonstrate that, for a certain frame choice, the underlying dynamics is governed purely by the Regge-Wheeler tensor. The two transverse-traceless Weyl tensors which carry the curvature of gravitational waves are discussed.
