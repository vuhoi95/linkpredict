Title: Instantons in the nonperturbative QCD vacuum
Authors: Nikita O. Agasian and Sergei M. Fedorov
Abstract: The influence of nonperturbative fields on instantons in quantum chromodynamics is studied. Nonperturbative vacuum is described in terms of nonlocal gauge invariant vacuum averages of gluon field strength.Effective action for instanton is derived in bilocal approximation and it is demonstrated that stochastic background gluon fields are responsible for infra-red (IR) stabilization of instantons. Dependence of characteristic instanton size on gluon condensate and correlation length in nonperturbative vacuum is found. Comparison of obtained instanton size distribution with lattice data is made.
