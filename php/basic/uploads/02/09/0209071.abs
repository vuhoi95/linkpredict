Title: Riemann surfaces, separation of variables and classical and quantum  integrability
Authors: O. Babelon and M. Talon
Abstract: We show that Riemann surfaces, and separated variables immediately provide classical Poisson commuting Hamiltonians. We show that Baxter's equations for separated variables immediately provide quantum commuting Hamiltonians. The construction is simple, general, and does not rely on the Yang--Baxter equation.
