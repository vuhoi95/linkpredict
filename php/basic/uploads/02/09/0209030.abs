Title: Generalizations of some integrals over the unitary group
Authors: B. Schlittgen and T. Wettig
Abstract: Using the character expansion method, we generalize several well-known integrals over the unitary group to the case where general complex matrices appear in the integrand. These integrals are of interest in the theory of random matrices and may also find applications in lattice gauge theory.
