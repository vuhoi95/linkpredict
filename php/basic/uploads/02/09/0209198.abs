Title: Noncommutative Geometry, Extended W(infty) Algebra and Grassmannian  Solitons in Multicomponent Quantum Hall Systems
Authors: Z. F. Ezawa and G. Tsitsishvili and K. Hasebe
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry governs the physics of quantum Hall (QH) effects. We introduce the Weyl ordering of the second quantized density operator to explore the dynamics of electrons in the lowest Landau level. We analyze QH systems made of $N$-component electrons at the integer filling factor $\nu=k\leq N$. The basic algebra is the SU(N)-extended W$_{\infty}$. A specific feature is that noncommutative geometry leads to a spontaneous development of SU(N) quantum coherence by generating the exchange Coulomb interaction. The effective Hamiltonian is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ sigma model, and the dynamical field is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ field, describing $k(N-k)$ complex Goldstone modes and one kind of topological solitons (Grassmannian solitons).
