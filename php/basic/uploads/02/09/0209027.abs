Title: Deformed Defects
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. M. C. Malbouisson
Abstract: We introduce a method to obtain deformed defects starting from a given scalar field theory which possesses defect solutions. The procedure allows the construction of infinitely many new theories that support defect solutions, analytically expressed in terms of the defects of the original theory. The method is general, valid for both topological and non-topological defects, and we show how it extends to quantum mechanics, and how it works when the scalar field couples to fermions. We illustrate the general procedure with several examples, which support kink-like or lump-like defects.
