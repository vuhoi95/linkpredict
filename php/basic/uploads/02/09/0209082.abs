Title: Fuzzy Algebrae of the General Kaehler Coset Space G/H\otimesU(1)^k
Authors: Shogo Aoyama and Takahiro Masuda
Abstract: We study the fuzzy structure of the general Kaehler coset space G/S\otimes{U(1)}^k deformed by the Fedosov formalism. It is shown that the Killing potentials satisfy the fuzzy algebrae working in the Darboux coordinates.
