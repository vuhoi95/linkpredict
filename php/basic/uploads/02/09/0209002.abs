Title: Operator Mixing and the BMN Correspondence
Authors: Neil R. Constable and Daniel Z. Freedman and Matthew Headrick and Shiraz Minwalla
Abstract: In this note we update the discussion of the BMN correspondence and string interactions in hep-th/0205089 to incorporate the effects of operator mixing. We diagonalize the matrix of two point functions of single and double trace operators, and compute the eigen-operators and their anomalous dimensions to order g_2^2 \lambda'. Surprisingly, operators in different R symmetry multiplets remain degenerate at this order. We also calculate the corresponding energy shifts in string theory, and find a discrepancy with field theory results, indicating possible new effects in light-cone string field theory.
