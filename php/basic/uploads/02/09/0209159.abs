Title: Interacting Quantum Field Theory in de Sitter Vacua
Authors: Martin B. Einhorn and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We discuss interacting quantum field theory in de Sitter space and argue that the Mottola-Allen vacuum ambiguity is an artifact of free field theory. The nature of the nonthermality of the MA-vacua is also clarified. We propose analyticity of correlation functions as a fundamental requirement of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. In de Sitter space, this principle determines the vacuum unambiguously and facilitates the systematic development of perturbation theory.
