Title: Quantum Modified Mooses
Authors: Spencer Chang and Howard Georgi
Abstract: We summarize our findings on the quantum moduli constraints and superpotentials of an infinite family of moose extensions of $n_f = n_c$ SUSY QCD. For $n_c=2$, we perform concrete calculations using traditional integrating out techniques as well as Intriligator's ``integrating in'' technique. Checking the constraints and superpotentials in the limits of setting $\Lambda$'s to zero or integrating out mass terms, we find that the quantum moduli constraints are local in theory space and are equivalent to a consistent structure of ``splitting relations'' amongst the different theories. Extending the results to arbitrary $n_c$, we show that the splitting relations, along with a set of rules for flowing from a high energy theory to a low energy theory, incorporate much of the physics of the moose chain. The relations can be used both to simplify perturbative calculations of symmetry breaking and to incorporate nonperturbative effects.
