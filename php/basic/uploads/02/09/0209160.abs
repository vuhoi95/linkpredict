Title: Notes on Giant Gravitons on PP-waves
Authors: Hiromitsu Takayanagi and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We investigate the giant gravitons in the maximally supersymmetric IIB pp-wave from several viewpoints: (i) the dynamics of D3-branes, (ii) the world-sheet description and (iii) the correlation functions in the dual N=4 Yang-Mills theory. In particular, we derive the BPS equation of a D3-brane with magnetic flux, which is equivalent to multiple D-strings, and discuss the behavior of solutions in the presence of RR-flux. We find solutions which represent the excitations of the giant gravitons in that system.
