Title: SU(2) gauged Skyrme-monopoles in scalar-tensor gravity
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann
Abstract: Considering a Skyrme model with a peculiar gauging of the symmetry, monopole-like solutions exist through a topological lower bound. However, it was recently shown that these objects cannot form bound states in the limit of vanishing Skyrme coupling. Here we consider these monopoles in scalar-tensor gravity. A numerical study of the equations reveals that neither the coupling to gravity nor to the scalar dilaton nor to dilaton-gravity leads to bound multimonopole states.
