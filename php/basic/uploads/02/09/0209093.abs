Title: K-essential Leptogenesis
Authors: Mingzhe Li and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: K-essence is a possible candidate for dark energy of the Universe. In this paper we consider couplings of k-essence to the matter fields of the standard electroweak theory and study the effects of the cosmological CPT violation induced by the CPT violating {\bf Ether} during the evolution of the k-essence scalar field on the laboratory experiments and baryogenesis. Our results show that the matter and antimatter asymmetry can be naturally explained {\it via} leptogenesis without conflicting with the experimental limits on CPT violation test. The mechanism for baryogenesis proposed in this paper provides a unified picture for dark energy and baryon matter of our Universe and allows an almost degenerate neutrino mass pattern with a predicted rate on the neutrinoless double beta decays accessible to the experimental sensitivity in the near future.
