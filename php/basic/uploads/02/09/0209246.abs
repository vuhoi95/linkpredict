Authors: H. E. Boos and V. E. Korepin and F. A. Smirnov
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional XXX spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet at zero temperature and zero magnetic field. We are interested in a probability of formation of a ferromagnetic string in the antiferromagnetic ground-state. We call it emptiness formation probability [EFP]. We suggest a new technique for computation of EFP in the inhomogeneous case. It is based on quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We evalauted EFP for strings of the length six in the inhomogeneous case. The homogeneous limit confirms our hypothesis about the relation of quantum correlations to number theory. We also make a conjecture about a general structure of EFP for arbitrary lenght of the string \.
