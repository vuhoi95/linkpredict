Abstract: Simulations of SU(2) lattice gauge theory are used to establish a relation between the IR properties of Green functions and confinement. Using Landau gauge where the gauge configurations are restricted to the first Gribov regime, results on the ghost-, gluon form-factor and the running coupling constant are presented. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the ghost form-factor of the de-confined phase at high temperatures.
