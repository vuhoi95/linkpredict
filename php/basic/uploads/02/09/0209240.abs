Abstract: We obtain a new explicit expression for the noncommutative (star) product on the fuzzy two-sphere which yields a unitary representation. This is done by constructing a star product, $\star_{\lambda}$, for an arbitrary representation of SU(2) which depends on a continuous parameter $\lambda$ and searching for the values of $\lambda$ which give unitary representations. We will find two series of values: $\lambda = \lambda^{(A)}_j=1/(2j)$ and $\lambda=\lambda^{(B)}_j =-1/(2j+2)$, where j is the spin of the representation of SU(2). At $\lambda = \lambda^{(A)}_j$ the new star product $\star_{\lambda}$ has poles. To avoid the singularity the functions on the sphere must be spherical harmonics of order $\ell \leq 2j$ and then $\star_{\lambda}$ reduces to the star product $\star$ obtained by Preusnajder. The star product at $\lambda=\lambda^{(B)}_j$, to be denoted by $\bullet$, is new. In this case the functions on the fuzzy sphere do not need to be spherical harmonics of order $\ell \leq 2j$. Because in this case there is no cutoff on the order of spherical harmonics, the degrees of freedom of the gauge fields on the fuzzy sphere coincide with those on the commutative sphere. Therefore, although the field theory on the fuzzy sphere is a system with finite degrees of freedom, we can expect the existence of the Seiberg-Witten map between the noncommutative and commutative descriptions of the gauge theory on the sphere. We will derive the first few terms of the Seiberg-Witten map for the U(1) gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere by using power expansion around the commutative point $\lambda=0$.
