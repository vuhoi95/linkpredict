Title: Renormalization Conditions and the Sliding Scale in the Implicit  Regularization Scheme: A Simple Connection
Authors: A. Brizola and S. R. Gobira and Marcos Sampaio and M. C. Nemes
Abstract: We describe in detail how a sliding scale is introduced in the renormalization of a QFT according to integer-dimensional implicit regularization scheme. We show that since no regulator needs to be specified at intermediate steps of the calculation, the introduction of a mass scale is a direct consequence of a set of renormalization conditions. As an illustration the one loop beta-function for QED and lambda*phi^4 theories are derived. They are given in terms of derivatives of appropriately systematized functions (related to definited parts of the amplitudes) with respect to a mass scale mu. Our formal scheme can be easily generalized to higher loop calculations.
