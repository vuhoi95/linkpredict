Title: Energy Spectrum for Neutral Collective Excitations in Striped Hall  States
Authors: N. Maeda and T. Aoyama and Y. Ishizuka and K. Ishikawa
Abstract: Neutral collective excitations in the striped Hall state are studied by using the single mode approximation and Hartree-Fock approximation at the half-filled third and fourth Landau level. We find that the spectrum includes anisotropic NG modes and periodic line nodes.
