Title: Phase Structure of Supersymmetric Models at Finite Temperature
Authors: Moshe Moshe and Jean Zinn-Justin
Abstract: We study O(N) symmetric supersymmetric models in three dimensions at finite temperature. These models are known to have an interesting phase structures. In particular, in the limit $N \to \infty$ one finds spontaneous breaking of scale invariance with no explicit breaking. Supersymmetry is softly broken at finite temperature and the peculiar phase structure and properties seen at T=0 are studied here at finite temperature.
