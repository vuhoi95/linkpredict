Title: Are there really any AdS_2 branes in the euclidean (or not) AdS_3?
Authors: Benedicte Ponsot and Sebastian Silva
Abstract: We do not find any AdS_2 branes, neither in the H_3^+ WZNW model nor the SL(2,R) WZNW model. We then reexamine the case of the branes that possess a su(2) symmetry: we speculate that they would have to live on the boundary of AdS_3. This cannot be realized in an euclidean spacetime, but in the SL(2,R) WZNW model by analytical continuation.
