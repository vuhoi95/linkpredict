Abstract: All purely bosonic supersymmetric solutions of minimal supergravity in five dimensions are classified. The solutions preserve either one half or all of the supersymmetry. Explicit examples of new solutions are given, including a large family of plane-fronted waves and a maximally supersymmetric analogue of the G\"odel universe which lifts to a solution of eleven dimensional supergravity that preserves 20 supersymmetries.
