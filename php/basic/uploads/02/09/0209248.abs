Title: The clash between de Sitter and anti-de Sitter space
Authors: Hassan Firouzjahi and Frederic Leblond
Abstract: We investigate solutions that are dynamically evolving between asymptotically de Sitter and asymptotically anti-de Sitter regions in the context of Einstein gravity coupled to general matter fields in d dimensions. We demonstrate the existence of a no go theorem whenever the matter content of the theory is 'reasonable', i.e. such that the weak energy condition is satisfied. We show that there exist solutions for which the energy conditions are violated in a finite region of the spacetime. We speculate on the holographic interpretation of these gravitational backgrounds by combining ideas from the AdS/CFT and the dS/CFT dualities.
