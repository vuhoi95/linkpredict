Title: Five dimensional supergravity in N = 1 superspace
Authors: W. D. Linch III and Markus A. Luty and J. Phillips
Abstract: We give a formulation of linearized minimal 5-dimensional supergravity in N = 1 superspace. Infinitesimal local 5D diffeomorphisms, local 5D Lorentz transformations, and local 5D supersymmetry are all realized as off-shell superfield transformations. Compactification on an S^1 / Z_2 orbifold and couplings to brane-localized supermultiplets are very simple in this formalism. We use this to show that 5-dimensional supergravity can naturally generate mu and B mu terms of the correct size in gaugino- or radion-mediated supersymmetry breaking. We also include a self-contained review of linearized minimal 4D supergravity in superspace.
