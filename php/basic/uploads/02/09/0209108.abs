Title: Impact of Low-Energy Constraints on Lorentz Violation
Authors: J. Ellis and E. Gravanis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We extend previous analyses of the violation of Lorentz invariance induced in a non-critical string model of quantum space-time foam, discussing the propagation of low-energy particles through a distribution of non-relativistic D-particles.We argue that nuclear and atomic physics experiments do not constitute sensitive probes of this approach to quantum gravity due to a difference in the dispersion relations for massive probes as compared to those for massless ones, predicted by the model.
