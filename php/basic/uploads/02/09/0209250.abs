Title: An Alternative Construction of the Quantum Action for Supergravity
Authors: N. Djeghloul and M. Tahiri
Abstract: We develop a method to derive the on-shell invariant quantum action of the supergravity in such a way that the quartic ghost interaction term is explicity determined. First, we reinvestigate the simple supergravity in terms of a principal superfibre bundle. This gives rise to the closed geometrical BRST algebra. Therefore we determine the open BRST algebra, which realizes the invariance of the classical action. Then, given a prescription to build the full quantum action, we obtain the quantum BRST algebra. Together with the constructed quantum action this allows us to recover the auxiliary fields and the invariant extension of the classical action.
