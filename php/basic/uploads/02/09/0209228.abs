Title: Unhiggsing the del Pezzo
Authors: Bo Feng and Sebastian Franco and Amihay Hanany and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: We develop an unhiggsing procedure for finding the D-brane probe world volume gauge theory for blowups of geometries whose gauge theory data are known. As specific applications we unhiggs the well-studied theories for the cone over the third del Pezzo surface. We arrive at what we call pseudo del Pezzos and these will constitute a first step toward the understanding of higher, non toric del Pezzos. Moreover, our methods and results give further support for toric duality as well as obtaining superpotentials from global symmetry considerations.
