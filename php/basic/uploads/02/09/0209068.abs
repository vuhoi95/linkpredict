Title: Impulsive waves in electrovac direct product spacetimes with Lambda
Authors: Marcello Ortaggio and Jiri Podolsky
Abstract: A complete family of non-expanding impulsive waves in spacetimes which are the direct product of two 2-spaces of constant curvature is presented. In addition to previously investigated impulses in Minkowski, (anti-)Nariai and Bertotti-Robinson universes, a new explicit class of impulsive waves which propagate in the exceptional electrovac Plebanski-Hacyan spacetimes with a cosmological constant Lambda is constructed. In particular, pure gravitational waves generated by null particles with an arbitrary multipole structure are described. The metrics are impulsive members of a more general family of the Kundt spacetimes of type II. The well-known pp-waves are recovered for Lambda=0.
