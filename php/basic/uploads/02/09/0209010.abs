Title: Multi-Caloron solutions
Authors: Falk Bruckmann and Pierre van Baal
Abstract: We discuss the construction of multi-caloron solutions with non-trivial holonomy, both as approximate superpositions and exact self-dual solutions. The charge k SU(n) moduli space can be described by kn constituent monopoles. Exact solutions help us to understand how these constituents can be seen as independent objects, which seems not possible with the approximate superposition. An "impurity scattering" calculation provides relatively simple expressions. Like at zero temperature an explicit parametrization requires solving a quadratic ADHM constraint, achieved here for a class of axially symmetric solutions. We will discuss the properties of these exact solutions in detail, but also demonstrate that interesting results can be obtained without explicitly solving for the constraint.
