Title: Tadpole Analysis of Orientifolded Plane-Waves
Authors: Aninda Sinha and Nemani V Suryanarayana
Abstract: We study orientifolds of type IIB string theory in the plane-wave background supported by null RR 3-form flux F^{(3)}. We describe how to extract the RR tadpoles in the Green-Schwarz formalism in a general setting. Two models with orientifold groups {1, \Omega} and {1,\Omega I_4}, which are T-dual to each other, are considered. Consistency of these backgrounds requires 32 D9 branes for the first model and 32 D5 branes for the second one. We study the spectra and comment on the heterotic duals of our models.
