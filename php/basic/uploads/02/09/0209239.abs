Title: Tubular D3-branes and their Dualities
Authors: S. Tamaryan and D. K. Park and H. J. W. Muller-Kirsten
Abstract: A tubular D3-brane with electromagnetic flux is considered. It is verified that the quantized electric and magnetic charges are the F-string and D-string charges of the brane, respectively. The D3-brane with parallel electric and magnetic fields collapses to the bound state of strings. A D3-brane with nonzero Poynting vector can be viewed as expanded FD strings. A fundamental string is viewed as a collapsed D3-brane and mapped to the (n,m) strings via electric-magnetic duality rotations. This mapping is the same as a weak-strong duality transformation and therefore reveals the equivalence of the electric-magnetic and weak-strong dualities.
