Title: Exact Superpotentials from Matrix Models
Authors: Nick Dorey and Timothy J. Hollowood and S. Prem Kumar and Annamaria Sinkovics
Abstract: Dijkgraaf and Vafa (DV) have conjectured that the exact superpotential for a large class of N=1 SUSY gauge theories can be extracted from the planar limit of a certain holomorphic matrix integral. We test their proposal against existing knowledge for a family of deformations of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills theory involving an arbitrary polynomial superpotential for one of the three adjoint chiral superfields. Specifically, we compare the DV prediction for these models with earlier results based on the connection between SUSY gauge theories and integrable systems. We find complete agreement between the two approaches. In particular we show how the DV proposal allows the extraction of the exact eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar in the confining vacuum and hence computes all related condensates of the finite-N gauge theory. We extend these results to include Leigh-Strassler deformations of the N=4 theory.
