Title: Black hole formation in the grazing collision of high-energy particles
Authors: Hirotaka Yoshino and Yasusada Nambu
Abstract: We numerically investigate the formation of D-dimensional black holes in high-energy particle collision with the impact parameter and evaluate the total cross section of the black hole production. We find that the formation of an apparent horizon occurs when the distance between the colliding particles is less than 1.5 times the effective gravitational radius of each particles. Our numerical result indicates that although both the one-dimensional hoop and the (D-3)-dimensional volume corresponding to the typical scale of the system give a fairly good condition for the horizon formation in the higher-dimensional gravity, the (D-3)-dimensional volume provide a better condition to judge the existence of the horizon.
