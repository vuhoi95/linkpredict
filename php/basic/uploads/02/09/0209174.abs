Title: Generalized Weyl systems and kappa-Minkowski space
Authors: Alessandra Agostini and Fedele Lizzi and Alessandro Zampini
Abstract: We introduce the notion of generalized Weyl system, and use it to define *-products which generalize the commutation relations of Lie algebras. In particular we study in a comparative way various *-products which generalize the k-Minkowski commutation relations.
