Abstract: We study the phenomenological implications of the classical limit of the "stringy" commutation relations [x_i,p_j]=i hbar[(1+beta p^2) delta_{ij} + beta' p_i p_j]. In particular, we investigate the "deformation" of Kepler's third law and apply our result to the rotation curves of gas and stars in spiral galaxies.
