Title: Braneworld Effective Action at Low Energies
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda
Abstract: The low energy effective theory for the Randall-Sundrum two-brane system is investigated with an emphasis on the role of the non-linear radion in the brane world. It is shown that the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor theory with a specific coupling function.
