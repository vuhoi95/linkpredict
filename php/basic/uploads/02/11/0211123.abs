Title: Anharmonic oscillator radiation process in a large cavity
Authors: G. Flores-Hidalgo and A. P. C. Malbouisson
Abstract: We consider a particle represented by an anharmonic oscillator, coupled to an environment (a field) modeled by an ensemble of anharmonic oscillators, the whole system being confined in a cavity of diameter $L$. Up to the first perturbative order in the quartic interaction (interaction parameter $\lambda$), we use the formalism of {\it dressed} states introduced in previous publications, to obtain for a large cavity explicit $\lambda$-dependent formulas for the particle radiation process. These formulas are obtained in terms of the corresponding exact expressions for the linear case. We conclude for the enhancement of the particle decay induced by the quartic interaction.
