Title: Matrix model approach to the N=2 U(N) gauge theory with matter in the  fundamental representation
Authors: S. Naculich and H. Schnitzer and N. Wyllard
Abstract: We use matrix model technology to study the N=2 U(N) gauge theory with N_f massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. We perform a completely perturbative calculation of the periods a_i and the prepotential F(a) up to the first instanton level, finding agreement with previous results in the literature. We also derive the Seiberg-Witten curve and differential from the large-M solution of the matrix model. We show that the two cases N_f<N and N \le N_f < 2N can be treated simultaneously.
