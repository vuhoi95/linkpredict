Title: On osp(2|2) conformal field theories
Authors: Xiang-Mao Ding and Mark D. Gould and Courtney J. Mewton and Yao-Zhong Zhang
Abstract: We study the conformal field theories corresponding to current superalgebras $osp(2|2)^{(1)}_k$ and $osp(2|2)^{(2)}_k$. We construct the free field realizations, screen currents and primary fields of these current superalgebras at general level $k$. All the results for $osp(2|2)^{(2)}_k$ are new, and the results for the primary fields of $osp(2|2)^{(1)}_k$ also seem to be new. Our results are expected to be useful in the supersymmetric approach to Gaussian disordered systems such as random bond Ising model and Dirac model.
