Title: Pluecker-type relations for orthogonal planes
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and George Papadopoulos
Abstract: We explore a Pluecker-type relation which occurs naturally in the study of maximally supersymmetric solutions of certain supergravity theories. This relation generalises at the same time the classical Pluecker relation and the Jacobi identity for a metric Lie algebra and coincides with the Jacobi identity of a metric n-Lie algebra. In low dimension we present evidence for a geometric characterisation of the relation in terms of middle-dimensional orthogonal planes in euclidean or lorentzian inner product spaces.
