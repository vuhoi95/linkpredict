Title: On a gauge invariant description of soliton dynamics
Authors: Bernard de Wit and Jürg Käppeli
Abstract: We present important elements of a gauge and diffeomorphism invariant formulation of the moduli space approximation to soliton dynamics. We argue that explicit velocity-dependent modifications are determined entirely from gauge and diffeomorphism invariance. We illustrate the formalism for the case of a Yang-Mills theory on a curved spacetime background.
