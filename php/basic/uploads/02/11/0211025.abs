Title: Tall tales from de Sitter space II: Field theory dualities
Authors: Frederic Leblond and Donald Marolf and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We consider the evolution of massive scalar fields in (asymptotically) de Sitter spacetimes of arbitrary dimension. Through the proposed dS/CFT correspondence, our analysis points to the existence of new nonlocal dualities for the Euclidean conformal field theory. A massless conformally coupled scalar field provides an example where the analysis is easily explicitly extended to 'tall' background spacetimes.
