Title: Four-point functions in N=4 SYM
Authors: P. J. Heslop and P. S. Howe
Abstract: A new derivation is given of four-point functions of charge $Q$ chiral primary multiplets in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. A compact formula, valid for arbitrary $Q$, is given which is manifestly superconformal and analytic in the internal bosonic coordinates of analytic superspace. This formula allows one to determine the spacetime four-point function of any four component fields in the multiplets in terms of the four-point function of the leading chiral primary fields. The leading term is expressed in terms of $1/2 Q(Q-1)$ functions of two conformal invariants and a number of single variable functions. Crossing symmetry reduces the number of independent functions, while the OPE implies that the single-variable functions arise from protected operators and should therefore take their free form. This is the partial non-renormalisation property of such four-point functions which can be viewed as a consequence of the OPE and the non-renormalisation of three-point functions of protected operators.
