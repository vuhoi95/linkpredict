Title: Solitons and deformed lattices I
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We study a model describing some aspects of the dynamics of biopolymers. The models involve either one or two finite chains with a number N of sites that represent the "units" of a biophysical system. The mechanical degrees of freedom of these chains are coupled to the internal degrees of freedom through position dependent excitation transfer functions. We reconsider the case of the one chain model discussed by Mingaleev et al. and present new results concerning the soliton sector of this model. We also give new (preliminary) results in the two chain model in which case we have introduced an interaction potential inspired by the Morse potential.
