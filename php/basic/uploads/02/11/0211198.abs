Title: Explicit Formulas for Neumann Coefficients in the Plane-Wave Geometry
Authors: Yang-Hui He and John H. Schwarz and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for the Neumann coefficients and associated quantities that appear in the three-string vertex for type IIB string theory in a plane-wave background, for any value of the mass parameter mu. The derivation involves constructing the inverse of a certain infinite-dimensional matrix, in terms of which the Neumann coefficients previously had been written only implicitly. We derive asymptotic expansions for large mu and find unexpectedly simple results, which are valid to all orders in 1/mu. Using BMN duality, these give predictions for certain gauge theory quantities to all orders in the modified 't Hooft coupling lambda'. A specific example is presented.
