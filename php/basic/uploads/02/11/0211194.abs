Title: Large N Strong Coupling Dynamics in Non-Supersymmetric Orbifold Field  Theories
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Andrew Neitzke and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We give a recipe relating holomorphic quantities in supersymmetric field theory to their descendants in non-supersymmetric Z_2 orbifold field theories. This recipe, consistent with a recent proposal of Strassler, gives exact results for bifermion condensates, domain wall tensions and gauge coupling constants in the planar limit of the orbifold theories.
