Title: Linearized Gravity in the Karch-Randall Braneworld
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis and James T. Liu and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: We present a linearized gravity investigation of the bent braneworld, where an AdS_4 brane is embedded in AdS_5. While we focus on static spherically symmetric mass distributions on the brane, much of the analysis continues to hold for more general configurations. In addition to the identification of the massive Karch-Randall graviton and a tower of Kaluza-Klein gravitons, we find a radion mode that couples to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor on the brane. The Karch-Randall radion arises as a property of the embedding of the brane in the bulk space, even in the context of a single brane model.
