Title: O(3) Sigma model with Hopf term on Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: T. R. Govindarajan and E. Harikumar
Abstract: We formulate the $O(3) \s-$ model on fuzzy sphere and construct the Hopf term. We show that the field can be expanded in terms of the ladder operators of Holstein-Primakoff realisation of SU(2) algebra and the corresponding basis set can be classified into different topological sectors by the magnetic quantum numbers. We obtain topological charge $Q$ and show that $-2j\le Q \le2j$. We also construct BPS solitons. Using the covariantly conserved current, we construct the Hopf term and show that its value is $Q^2$ as in the commutative case. We also point out the interesting relation of physical space to deformed SU(2) algebra.
