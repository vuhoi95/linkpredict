Title: A geometrical derivation of the Dirac equation
Authors: Y. Jack Ng and H. van Dam
Abstract: We give a geometrical derivation of the Dirac equation by considering a spin-1/2 particle travelling with the speed of light in a cubic spacetime lattice. The mass of the particle acts to flip the multi-component wavefunction at the lattice sites. Starting with a difference equation for the case of one spatial and one time dimensions, we generalize the approach to higher dimensions. Interactions with external electromagnetic and gravitational fields are also considered. One logical interpretation is that only at the lattice sites is the spin-1/2 particle aware of its mass and the presence of external fields.
