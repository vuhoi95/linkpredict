Title: Comments on Noncommutative Sigma Models
Authors: Jeff Murugan and Rory Adams
Abstract: We review the derivation of a noncommutative version of the nonlinear sigma model on $\CPn$ and it's soliton solutions for finite $\theta$ emphasizing the similarities it bears to the GMS scalar field theory. It is also shown that unlike the scalar theory, some care needs to be taken in defining the topological charge of BPS solitons of the theory due to nonvanishing surface terms in the energy functional. Finally it is shown that, like its commutative analogue, the noncommutative $\CPn$-model also exhibits a non-BPS sector. Unlike the commutative case however, there are some surprises in the noncommutative case that merit further study.
