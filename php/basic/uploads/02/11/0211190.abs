Title: Noncommutative geometry and the classical orbits of particles in a  central force potential
Authors: B. Mirza and M. Dehghani
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the noncommutative geometry on the classical orbits of particles in a central force potential. The relation is implemented through the modified commutation relations $[x_i, x_j]=i \theta_{ij} $. Comparison with observation places severe constraints on the value of the noncommutativity parameter.
