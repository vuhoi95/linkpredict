Title: Brane gas cosmology in M-theory: late time behavior
Authors: Richard Easther and Brian R. Greene and Mark G. Jackson and Daniel Kabat
Abstract: We investigate the late-time behavior of a universe containing a supergravity gas and wrapped 2-branes in the context of M-theory compactified on T^10. The supergravity gas tends to drive uniform expansion, while the branes impede the expansion of the directions about which they are wrapped. Assuming spatial homogeneity, we study the dynamics both numerically and analytically. At late times the radii obey power laws which are determined by the brane wrapping numbers, leading to interesting hierarchies of scale between the wrapped and unwrapped dimensions. The biggest hierarchy that could evolve from an initial thermal fluctuation produces three large unwrapped dimensions. We also study configurations corresponding to string winding, in which the M2-branes are all wrapped around the (small) 11th dimension, and show that this recovers the scenario discussed by Brandenberger and Vafa.
