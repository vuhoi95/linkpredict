Title: S-brane Actions
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Pei-Ming Ho and John E. Wang
Abstract: We derive effective actions for Spacelike branes (S-branes) and find a solution describing the formation of fundamental strings in the rolling tachyon background. The S-brane action is a Dirac-Born-Infeld action for Euclidean worldvolumes defined in the context of time-dependent tachyon condensation of non-BPS branes. It includes gauge fields and in particular a scalar field associated with translation along the time direction. We show that the BIon spike solutions constructed in this system correspond to the production of a confined electric flux tube (a fundamental string) at late time of the rolling tachyon.
