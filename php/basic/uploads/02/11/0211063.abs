Title: Spacetime Energy Decreases under World-sheet RG Flow
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Matthew Headrick and Shiraz Minwalla and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We study renormalization group flows in unitary two dimensional sigma models with asymptotically flat target spaces. Applying an infrared cutoff to the target space, we use the Zamolodchikov c-theorem to demonstrate that the target space ADM energy of the UV fixed point is greater than that of the IR fixed point: spacetime energy decreases under world-sheet RG flow. This result mirrors the well understood decrease of spacetime Bondi energy in the time evolution process of tachyon condensation.
