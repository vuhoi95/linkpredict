Title: Manifest Supersymmetry for BPS Walls in N=2 Nonlinear Sigma Models
Authors: Masato Arai and Masashi Naganuma and Muneto Nitta and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: BPS equations and wall solutions are studied keeping (part of) supersymmetry (SUSY) manifest. Using N=1 superfields, massive hyper-Kahler quotient is introduced to obtain massive N=2 (8 SUSY) nonlinear sigma models in four dimensions with T*CP(n) target manifold, which yield BPS wall solutions for the n=1 case. We also describe massive hyper-Kahler quotient of T*CP(n) by using the harmonic superspace formalism which preserves all SUSY manifestly, and BPS equations and wall solutions are obtained in the n=1 case.
