Title: Effective matter superpotentials from Wishart random matrices
Authors: Yves Demasure and Romuald A. Janik
Abstract: We show how within the Dijkgraaf-Vafa prescription one can derive superpotentials for matter fields. The ingredients forming the non-perturbative Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotentials arise from constrained matrix integrals, which are equivalent to classical complex Wishart random matrices. The mechanism is similar to the way the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential arises from the matrix model measure.
