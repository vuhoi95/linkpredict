Title: Newton's Second Law in a Noncommutative Space
Authors: Juan M. Romero and J. A. Santiago and J. David Vergara
Abstract: In this work we show that corrections to the Newton's second law appears if we assume that the phase space has a symplectic structure consistent with the rules of commutation of noncommutative quantum mechanis. In the central field case we find that the correction term breaks the rotational symmetry. In particular, for the Kepler problem, this term takes the form of a Coriolis force produced by the weak gravitational field far from a rotating massive object.
