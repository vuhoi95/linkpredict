Title: Coincident Dp-branes in codimension two
Authors: Shesansu Sekhar Pal and Sudhakar Panda
Abstract: We derive the mass shell condition for N coincident D0 branes in codimension two i.e. in space-time dimension three. Using this we present the action for this system in first order formalism. Our analysis is restricted to flat space-time.
