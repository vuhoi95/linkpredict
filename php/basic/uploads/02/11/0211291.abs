Abstract: We apply the proposal of Dijkgraaf and Vafa to analyze N=1 gauge theory with SO(N) and Sp(N) gauge groups with arbitrary tree-level superpotentials using matrix model techniques. We derive the planar and leading non-planar contributions to the large M SO(M) and Sp(M) matrix model free energy by applying the technology of higher-genus loop equations and by straightforward diagrammatics. The loop equations suggest that the RP^2 free energy is given as a derivative of the sphere contribution, a relation which we verify diagrammatically. With a refinement of the proposal of Dijkgraaf and Vafa for the effective superpotential, we find agreement with field theory expectations.
