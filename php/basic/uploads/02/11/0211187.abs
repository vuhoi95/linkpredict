Title: On linearization of superon-graviton model(SGM)
Authors: K. Shima and M. Tsuda and M. Sawaguchi
Abstract: Referring to the supermultiplet of N=1 supergravity (SUGRA) the linearization of N=1 SGM action describing the nonlinear supersymmetric (NL SUSY) gravitational interaction of superon (Nambu-Goldstone fermion) is attempted. The field contents of on-shell SUGRA supermultiplet are realized as the composites, though they have new SUSY transformations which closes on super-Poincar\'e algebra. Particular attentions are paid to the local Lorentz invariance.
