Abstract: We discuss the Penrose limit of the Chamseddine-Volkov BPS selfgravitating monopole in four dimensional N=4 supergravity theory with non-abelian gauge multiplets. We analyze the properties of the resulting supersymmetric pp-wave solutions when various Penrose limits are considered. Apart from the usual rescaling of coordinates and fields we find that a rescaling of the gauge coupling constant to zero is required, rendering the theory abelian. We also study the Killing spinor equations showing an enhancement of the supersymmetries preserved by the solutions and discuss the embedding of the pp-wave solution in $d=10$ dimensions.
