Title: Potential one-forms for hyperk√§hler structures with torsion
Authors: Liviu Ornea and Yat Sun Poon and Andrew Swann
Abstract: It is shown that an HKT-space with closed parallel potential 1-form has $D(2,1;-1)$-symmetry. Every locally conformally hyperk\"ahler manifold generates this type of geometry. The HKT-spaces with closed parallel potential 1-form arising in this way are characterized by their symmetries and an inhomogeneous cubic condition on their torsion.
