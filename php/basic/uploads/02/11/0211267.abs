Title: Towards understanding structure of the monopole clusters
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We consider geometrical characteristics of monopole clusters of the lattice SU(2) gluodynamics. We argue that the polymer approach to the field theory is an adequate means to describe the monopole clusters. Both finite-size and the infinite, or percolating clusters are considered. We find out that the percolation theory allows to reproduce the observed distribution of the finite-size clusters in their length and radius. Geometrical characteristics of the percolating cluster reflect, in turn, the basic properties of the ground state of a system with a gap.
