Title: Brane to bulk supersymmetry breaking and radion force at micron  distances

Abstract: We study mediation of supersymmetry breaking in the bulk, in models with primordial supersymmetry breaking on D-branes at the string scale, in the TeV region. We compute the gravitino and scalar masses up to one-loop level, as well as the radion coupling to matter. We find that the latter mediates a model independent force at submillimeter distances that can be tested in micro-gravity experiments for any dimensionality of the bulk. In the case of two large dimensions, our type I string framework provides an example which allows to stabilize the radion potential and determine the desired hierarchy between the string and Planck scales.
