Title: Multi-Instanton Calculus and Equivariant Cohomology
Authors: Ugo Bruzzo and Francesco Fucito and Jose F. Morales and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: We present a systematic derivation of multi-instanton amplitudes in terms of ADHM equivariant cohomology. The results rely on a supersymmetric formulation of the localization formula for equivariant forms. We examine the cases of N=4 and N=2 gauge theories with adjoint and fundamental matter.
