Title: Theory of phase fluctuating d-wave superconductors and the spin response  in underdoped cuprates
Authors: Igor F. Herbut and Dominic J. Lee
Abstract: The minimal theory of spin of gapless quasiparticles coupled to fluctuating vortex defects in the phase of the d-wave superconducting order parameter at T=0 is studied. With the proliferation of the vortex loops the theory reduces to the previuosly studied QED3, with its concomitant spin-density-wave (chiral) instability. We find a single superconductor-insulator phase transition, which may be fluctuation induced first-order, at which vortices condense and the chiral symmetry for fermions dynamically breaks. We compute the spin-spin correlation function deep in the fluctuating superconducting state, and discuss some prominent trends in the neutron scattering data on underdoped cuprates in light of our results.
