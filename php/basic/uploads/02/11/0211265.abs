Title: The Rogers--Ramanujan recursion and intertwining operators
Authors: Stefano Capparelli and James Lepowsky and Antun Milas
Abstract: We use vertex operator algebras and intertwining operators to study certain substructures of standard $A_1^{(1)}$--modules, allowing us to conceptually obtain the classical Rogers--Ramanujan recursion. As a consequence we recover Feigin-Stoyanovsky's character formulas for the principal subspaces of the level 1 standard $A_1^{(1)}$--modules.
