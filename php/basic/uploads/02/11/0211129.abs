Title: Topics in Nonlinear Sigma Models in D=3
Authors: Ko Furuta and Takeo Inami and Masayoshi Yamamoto
Abstract: Nonlinear sigma models (NLSM) in d=3 have many interesting and non-trivial features, which were explored poorly in contrast with NLSM in d=2 and d=4. We present a few results from our study of the perturbative and non-perturbative properties of three-dimensional (3D) NLSM. i) We have shown that cancellation of ultra-violet (UV) divergences takes place in 3D extended (N=2,4) supersymmetric NLSM in low orders of the 1/n expansion. ii) We consider noncommutative extension of the 3D CP(n) model, and study low-energy dynamics of BPS solitons in this model. We also discuss briefly dynamics of non-BPS solutions.
