Title: Matrix Models of Noncommutative (2d+1) Lattice Gauge Theories
Authors: F. Bazzocchi and M. Cirafici and C. Maccaferri and S. Profumo
Abstract: We investigate the problem of mapping, through the Morita equivalence, odd dimensional noncommutative lattice gauge theories onto suitable matrix models. We specialize our analysis to noncommutative three dimensional QED (NCQED) and scalar QED (NCSQED), for which we explicitly build the corresponding Matrix Model.
