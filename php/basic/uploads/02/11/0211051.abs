Title: Scalar products of symmetric functions and matrix integrals
Authors: J. Harnad and A. Yu. Orlov
Abstract: We present relations between Hirota-type bilinear operators, scalar products on spaces of symmetric functions and integrals defining matrix model partition functions. Using the fermionic Fock space representation, a proof of the expansion of an associated class of KP and 2-Toda tau functions $\tau_{r,n}$ in a series of Schur functions generalizing the hypergeometric series is given and related to the scalar product formulae. It is shown how special cases of such $\tau$-functions may be identified as formal series expansions of partition functions. A closed form exapnsion of $\log \tau_{r,n}$ in terms of Schur functions is derived.
