Title: On the connections between Skyrme and Yang Mills theories
Authors: Joaquin Sanchez-Guillen and L. A. Ferreira
Abstract: Skyrme theories on S^3 and S^2, are analyzed using the generalized zero curvature in any dimensions. In the first case, new symmetries and integrable sectors, including the B =1 skyrmions, are unraveled. In S^2 the relation to QCD suggested by Faddeev is discussed
