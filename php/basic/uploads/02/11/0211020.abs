Title: Divergence terms in the supertrace heat asymptotics for the de Rham  complex on a manifold with boundary
Authors: Peter Gilkey and Klaus Kirsten and Dmitri Vassilevich
Abstract: We use invariance theory to determine the coefficient $a_{m+1,m}^{d+\delta}$ in the supertrace for the twisted de Rham complex with absolute boundary conditions.
