Title: Perturbative Computation of Glueball Superpotentials
Authors: R. Dijkgraaf and M. T. Grisaru and C. S. Lam and C. Vafa and D. Zanon
Abstract: Using N=1 superspace techniques in four dimensions we show how to perturbatively compute the superpotential generated for the glueball superfield upon integrating out massive charged fields. The technique applies to arbitrary gauge groups and representations. Moreover we show that for U(N) gauge theories admitting a large N expansion the computation dramatically simplifies and we prove the validity of the recently proposed recipe for computation of this quantity in terms of planar diagrams of matrix integrals.
