Title: Ward identity in noncommutative QED
Authors: T. Mariz and C. A. de S. Pires and R. F. Ribeiro
Abstract: Although noncommutative QED presents a nonabelian structure, it does not present structure constants. In view of this we investigate how Ward identity is satisfied in pair annihilation process and $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering in noncommutative QED.
