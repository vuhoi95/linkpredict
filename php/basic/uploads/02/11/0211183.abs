Title: Quantum Discontinuity for Massive Spin 3/2 with a Lambda Term
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu and H. Sati
Abstract: We show that the recently demonstrated absence of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity for massive spin 3/2 with a Lambda term is an artifact of the tree level approximation, and that the discontinuity reappears at one loop. As a numerical check on the calculation, we rederive the vanishing of the one- loop beta function for D=11 supergravity on AdS_4 x S^7 level-by-level in the Kaluza-Klein tower.
