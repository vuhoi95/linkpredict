Title: Noncommutative Integrable Field Theories in 2d
Authors: I. Cabrera-Carnero and M. Moriconi
Abstract: We study the noncommutative generalization of (euclidean) integrable models in two-dimensions, specifically the sine- and sinh-Gordon and the U(N) principal chiral models. By looking at tree-level amplitudes for the sinh-Gordon model we show that its na\"\i ve noncommutative generalization is {\em not} integrable. On the other hand, the addition of extra constraints, obtained through the generalization of the zero-curvature method, renders the model integrable. We construct explicit non-local non-trivial conserved charges for the U(N) principal chiral model using the Brezin-Itzykson-Zinn-Justin-Zuber method.
