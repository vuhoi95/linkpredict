Title: Warped brane world supergravity, flipping, and the Scherk-Schwarz  mechanism
Authors: Zygmunt Lalak and Radoslaw Matyszkiewicz
Abstract: We demonstrate the relation between the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and flipped gauged brane-bulk supergravities in five dimensions. We discuss the form of supersymmetry violating Scherk-Schwarz terms in pure supergravity and in supergravity coupled to matter. Although the Lagrangian mass terms that arise as the result of the Scherk-Schwarz redefinition of fields are naturally of the order of the inverse radius of the orbifold, the effective 4d physical mass terms are rather set by the scale \sqrt{|\bar{\Lambda}|}, where \bar{\Lambda} is the 4d cosmlogical constant.
