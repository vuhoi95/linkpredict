Title: Aspects of the Homogeneous Sine-Gordon models
Authors: Patrick Dorey and J. Luis Miramontes
Abstract: The physical mass scales that determine the behaviour of general (simply-laced) Homogeneous Sine-Gordon models are investigated by means of a study of their finite-size effects, using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. These models describe integrable multiparameter perturbations of the theory of level-$k$ $G$-parafermions, where $G$ is a Lie group. The parameters can be related to adjustable mass scales of stable and unstable particles. Our results confirm the presence of unstable particle states at generic values of $k$, as predicted at large $k$ by semiclassical arguments.
