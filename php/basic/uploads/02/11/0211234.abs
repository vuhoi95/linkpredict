Title: Seiberg Duality in Matrix Models II
Authors: Bo Feng and Yang-Hui He
Abstract: In this paper we continue the investigation, within the context of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa Programme, of Seiberg duality in matrix models as initiated in hep-th/0211202, by allowing degenerate mass deformations. In this case, there are some massless fields which remain and the theory has a moduli space. With this illustrative example, we propose a general methodology for performing the relevant matrix model integrations and addressing the corresponding field theories which have non-trivial IR behaviour, and which may or may not have tree-level superpotentials.
