Title: The Onset of Chaos in Spinning Particle Models
Authors: H. T. Cho and J. -K. Kao
Abstract: The onset of chaos in one-dimensional spinning particle models derived from pseudoclassical mechanical hamiltonians with a bosonic Duffing potential is examined. Using the Melnikov method, we indicate the presence of homoclinic entanglements in models with general potentials for the spins, and thus show that chaotic motions occur in these models.
