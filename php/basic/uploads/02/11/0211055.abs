Title: Quantum Radiation from a 5-Dimensional Rotating Black Hole
Authors: Valeri Frolov and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: We study a massless scalar field propagating in the background of a five-dimensional rotating black hole. We showed that in the Myers-Perry metric describing such a black hole the massless field equation allows the separation of variables. The obtained angular equation is a generalization of the equation for spheroidal functions. The radial equation is similar to the radial Teukolsky equation for the 4-dimensional Kerr metric. We use these results to quantize the massless scalar field in the space-time of the 5-dimensional rotating black hole and to derive expressions for energy and angular momentum fluxes from such a black hole.
