Title: Rotating Strings with B-field
Authors: R. C. Rashkov and K. S. Viswanathan
Abstract: Some of the recent important developments in understanding string/ gauge dualities are based on the idea of highly symmetric motion of ``string solitons'' in $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry originally suggested by Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov. In this paper we study symmetric motion of short strings in the presence of antisymetric closed string B field. We compare the values of the energy and the spin in the case of non-vanishing B field with those obtained in the case of B=0. The presence of NS-NS antisymmetric field couples the fluctuation modes that indicates changes in the quantum corrections to the energy spectrum.
