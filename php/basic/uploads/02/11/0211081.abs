Title: Duality of the Dirichlet and Neumann problems in braneworld physics
Authors: D. V. Nesterov and A. O. Barvinsky
Abstract: Braneworld effective action for two-brane model is constructed by two different methods based respectively on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. The equivalence of these methods is shown due to nontrivial duality relations between special boundary operators of these two problems.
