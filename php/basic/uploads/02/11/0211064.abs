Title: Nonperturbative Aspects in N-fold Supersymmetry
Authors: Toshiaki Tanaka and Masatoshi Sato
Abstract: Through a nonperturbative analysis on a sextic triple-well potential, we reveal novel aspects of the dynamical property of the system in connection with N-fold supersymmetry and quasi-solvability.
