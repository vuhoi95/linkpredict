Title: Strong Evidence In Favor OF The Existence Of S-Matrix For Strings In  Plane Waves
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Mohammad M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: Field theories on the plane wave background are considered. We discuss that for such field theories one can only form 1+1 dimensional freely propagating wave packets. We analyze tree level four point functions of scalar field theory as well as scalars coupled to gauge fields in detail and show that these four point functions are well-behaved so that they can be interpreted as S-matrix elements for 2 particle $\to$ 2 particle scattering amplitudes. Therefore, at least classically, field theories on the plane wave background have S-matrix formulation.
