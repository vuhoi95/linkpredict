Title: Nambu Dynamics, Deformation Quantization, and Superintegrability
Authors: Thomas L. Curtright and Cosmas K. Zachos
Abstract: Phase space is a framework ideally suited for quantizing superintegrable systems through the use of deformation methods, as illustrated here by applications to de Sitter and chiral particles. Within this framework, Nambu brackets elegantly incorporate the additional quantum invariants of such models. New results are presented for the non-Abelian quantization of these brackets.
