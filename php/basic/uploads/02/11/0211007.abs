Abstract: The existence of a SL(2,R) symmetry is discussed in SU(N) Yang-Mills in the maximal Abelian Gauge. This symmetry, also present in the Landau and Curci-Ferrari gauge, ensures the absence of tachyons in the maximal Abelian gauge. In all these gauges, SL(2,R) turns out to be dynamically broken by ghost condensates.
