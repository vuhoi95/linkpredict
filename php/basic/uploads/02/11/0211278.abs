Title: AdS Duals of Matrix Strings
Authors: Jose F. Morales and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We review recent work on the holographic duals of type II and heterotic matrix string theories described by warped AdS_3 supergravities. In particular, we compute the spectra of Kaluza-Klein primaries for type I, II supergravities on warped AdS_3xS^7 and match them with the primary operators in the dual two-dimensional gauge theories. The presence of non-trivial warp factors and dilaton profiles requires a modification of the familiar dictionary between masses and ``scaling'' dimensions of fields and operators. We present these modifications for the general case of domain wall/QFT correspondences between supergravities on warped AdS_{d+1}xS^q geometries and super Yang-Mills theories with 16 supercharges.
