Title: Baryonic Corrections to Superpotentials from Perturbation Theory
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Vanicson L. Campos and Gabriele Ferretti and Rainer Heise
Abstract: We study the corrections induced by a baryon vertex to the superpotential of SQCD with gauge group SU(N) and N quark flavors. We first compute the corrections order by order using a standard field theory technique and derive the corresponding glueball superpotential by "integrating in" the glueball field. The structure of the corrections matches with the expectations from the recently introduced perturbative techniques. We then compute the first non-trivial contribution using this new technique and find exact quantitative agreement. This involves cancellations between diagrams that go beyond the planar approximation.
