Title: Critical RSOS and Minimal Models II: Building Representations of the  Virasoro Algebra and Fields
Authors: Giovanni Feverati and Paul A. Pearce
Abstract: We consider sl(2) minimal conformal field theories and the dual parafermion models. Guided by results for the critical A_L Restricted Solid-on-Solid (RSOS) models and its Virasoro modules expressed in terms of paths, we propose a general level-by-level algorithm to build matrix representations of the Virasoro generators and chiral vertex operators (CVOs). We implement our scheme for the critical Ising, tricritical Ising, 3-state Potts and Yang-Lee theories on a cylinder and confirm that it is consistent with the known two-point functions for the CVOs and energy-momentum tensor. Our algorithm employs a distinguished basis which we call the L_1-basis. We relate the states of this canonical basis level-by-level to orthonormalized Virasoro states.
