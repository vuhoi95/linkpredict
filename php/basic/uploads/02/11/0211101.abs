Title: On gravitational couplings in D-brane action
Authors: A. Fotopoulos and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We compute the two closed string graviton - two open string scalar scattering amplitude on the disc to show that there is no second-derivative curvature - scalar coupling term R X^2 in the low-energy effective action of a D-brane in curved space in type II superstring theory.
