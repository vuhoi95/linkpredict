Title: From D-Dbar Pairs to Branes in Motion
Authors: Robert C. Myers and David J. Winters
Abstract: We investigate various supersymmetric brane intersections. Motivated by the recent results on supertubes, we investigate general constraints in which parallel brane-antibrane configurations are supersymmetric. Dual descriptions of these configurations involve systems of branes in relative motion. In particular, we find new supersymmetric configurations which are not related to a static brane intersection by a boost. In these new configurations, the intersection point moves at the speed of light. These systems provide interesting time dependent backgrounds for open strings.
