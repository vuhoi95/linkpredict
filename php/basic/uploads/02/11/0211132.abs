Title: Boundary sine-Gordon model
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs
Abstract: We review our recent results on the on-shell description of sine-Gordon model with integrable boundary conditions. We determined the spectrum of boundary states together with their reflection factors by closing the boundary bootstrap and checked these results against WKB quantization and numerical finite volume spectra obtained from the truncated conformal space approach. The relation between a boundary resonance state and the semiclassical instability of a static classical solution is analyzed in detail.
