Abstract: We first discuss how the longstanding confusion in the literature concerning one-loop quantum corrections to 1+1 dimensional solitons has finally been resolved. Then we use 't Hooft and Veltman's dimensional regularization to compute the kink mass, and find that chiral domain wall fermions, induced by fermionic zero modes, lead to spontaneous parity violation and an anomalous contribution to the central charge such that the BPS bound becomes saturated. On the other hand, Siegel's dimensional reduction shifts this anomaly to the counter terms in the renormalized current multiplet. The superconformal anomaly is located in an evanescent counter term, and imposing supersymmetry, this counter term induces the same anomalous contribution to the central charge. Next we discuss a new regularization scheme: local mode regularization. The local energy density computed in this scheme satisfies the BPS equality (it is equal to the local central charge density). In an appendix we give a very detailed account of the DHN method to compute soliton masses applied to the supersymmetric kink.
