Title: New possibilities for the gauging of chiral bosons
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Alvaro de Souza Dutra and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We study a new mechanism for the electromagnetic gauging of chiral bosons showing that new possibilities emerge for the interacting theory of chiral scalars. We introduce a chirally coupled gauge field necessary to mod out the degree of freedom that obstructs gauge invariance in a system of two opposite chiral bosons soldering them together.
