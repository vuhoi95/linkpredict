Title: Transverse Fivebranes in Matrix Theory
Authors: Juan Maldacena and Mohammad M. Sheikh-Jabbari and Mark Van Raamsdonk
Abstract: M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric plane wave background of eleven-dimensional supergravity admits spherical BPS transverse M5-branes with zero light-cone energy. We give direct evidence that the single M5-brane state corresponds to the trivial (X=0) classical vacuum in the large N limit of the plane wave matrix theory. In particular, we show that the linear fluctuation spectrum of the spherical fivebrane matches exactly with the set of exactly protected excited states about the X=0 vacuum in the matrix model. These states include geometrical fluctuations of the sphere, excitations of the worldvolume two-form field, and fermion excitations. In addition, we propose a description of multiple fivebrane states in terms of matrix model vacua. Finally, we discuss how to obtain the continuum D2/M2 and NS5/M5 theories on spheres from the matrix model. The matrix model can be viewed as a regularization for these theories.
