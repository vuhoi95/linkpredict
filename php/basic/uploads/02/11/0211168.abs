Title: Combinatorics of Hard Particles on Planar Graphs
Authors: J. Bouttier and P. Di Francesco and E. Guitter
Abstract: We revisit the problem of hard particles on planar random tetravalent graphs in view of recent combinatorial techniques relating planar diagrams to decorated trees. We show how to recover the two-matrix model solution to this problem in this purely combinatorial language.
