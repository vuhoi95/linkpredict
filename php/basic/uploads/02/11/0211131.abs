Title: String Amplitudes from Moyal String Field Theory
Authors: I. Bars and I. Kishimoto and Y. Matsuo
Abstract: We illustrate a basic framework for analytic computations of Feynman graphs using the Moyal star formulation of string field theory. We present efficient methods of computation based on (a) the monoid algebra in noncommutative space and (b) the conventional Feynman rules in Fourier space. The methods apply equally well to perturbative string states or nonperturbative string states involving D-branes. The ghost sector is formulated using Moyal products with fermionic (b,c) ghosts. We also provide a short account on how the purely cubic theory and/or VSFT proposals may receive some clarification of their midpoint structures in our regularized framework.
