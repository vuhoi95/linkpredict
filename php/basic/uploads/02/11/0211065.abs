Title: On dynamical supergravity interacting with super-p-brane sources
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Jose A. de Azcarraga and Jose M. Izquierdo and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We review recent progress in a fully dynamical Lagrangian description of the supergravity-superbrane interaction. It suggests that the interacting superfield action, when it exists, is gauge equivalent to the component action of dynamical supergravity interacting with the bosonic limit of the superbrane.
