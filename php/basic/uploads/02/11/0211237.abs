Title: Noncommutativity as a Possible Origin of the Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray  and the TeV-photon Paradoxes
Authors: Shao-Xia Chen and Zhao-Yu Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general modified dispersion relation derived from q-deformed noncommutative theory and apply it to the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray and the TeV-photon paradoxes--threshold anomalies. Our purpose is not only trying to solve these puzzles by noncommutative theory but also to support noncommutative theory through the coincidence of the region in the parameter space for resolving the threshold anomalies with the one from the q-deformed noncommutative theory.
