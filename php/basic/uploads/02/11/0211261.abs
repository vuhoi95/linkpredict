Title: Perturbative Computation of Glueball Superpotentials for SO(N) and  USp(N)
Authors: Harald Ita and Harald Nieder and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We use the superspace method of hep-th/0211017 to prove the matrix model conjecture for N=1 USp(N) and SO(N) gauge theories in four dimensions. We derive the prescription to relate the matrix model to the field theory computations. We perform an explicit calculation of glueball superpotentials. The result is consistent with field theory expectations.
