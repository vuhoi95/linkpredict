Title: Extended BRST quantization in general coordinates
Authors: B. Geyer and P. Lavrov and A. Nersessian
Abstract: We propose an extended BRST invariant Lagrangian quantization scheme of general gauge theories based on explicit realization of "modified triplectic algebra" in general coordinates. All the known Lagrangian quantization schemes based on the extended BRST symmetry are obtained by specifying the (free) parameters of that method.
