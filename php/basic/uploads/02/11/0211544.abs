Title: The Fate of Dark Energy
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: By studying the present cosmological data, particularly on CMB, SNeIA and LSS, we find that the future fate of the universe, for simple linear models of the dark energy equation-of-state, can vary between the extremes of (I) a divergence of the scale factor in as little as 7 Gyr; (II) an infinite lifetime of the universe with dark energy dominant for all future time; (III) a disappearing dark energy where the universe asymptotes as $t \to \infty$ to $a(t) \sim t^{2/3}$ {\it i.e.} matter domination. Our dreadful conclusion is that no amount of data from our past light-cone can select between these future scenarios.
