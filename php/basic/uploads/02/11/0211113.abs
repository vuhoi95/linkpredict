Title: Superspace Formulation of 4D Higher Spin Gauge Theory
Authors: J. Engquist and E. Sezgin and P. Sundell
Abstract: Interacting AdS_4 higher spin gauge theories with N \geq 1 supersymmetry so far have been formulated as constrained systems of differential forms living in a twistor extension of 4D spacetime. Here we formulate the minimal N=1 theory in superspace, leaving the internal twistor space intact. Remarkably, the superspace constraints have the same form as those defining the theory in ordinary spacetime. This construction generalizes straightforwardly to higher spin gauge theories N>1 supersymmetry.
