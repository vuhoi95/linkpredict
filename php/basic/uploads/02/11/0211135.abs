Title: BPS equations in N=2, D=5 supergravity with hypermultiplets
Authors: Sergio L. Cacciatori and Alessio Celi and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: With the general aim to classify BPS solutions in N=2, D=5 supergravities interacting with an arbitrary number of vector, tensor and hypermultiplets, here we begin considering the most general electrostatic, spherical-symmetric BPS solutions in the presence of hypermultiplet couplings. We discuss the properties of the BPS equations and the restrictions imposed by their integrability conditions. We exhibit explicit solutions for the case of static BPS black-holes coupled to one (the so called universal) hypermultiplet.
