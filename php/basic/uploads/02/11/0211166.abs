Title: The Supersymmetric Stueckelberg Mass and Overcoming the Fayet-Iliopoulos  Mechanism for Breaking Symmetry
Authors: S. V. Kuzmin and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: Gauge invariant generation of mass for supersymmetric U(1) vector field through use of a chiral Stueckelberg superfield is considered. When a Fayet-Iliopoulos D term is also present, no breaking of supersymmetry ever occurs so long as the Stueckelberg mass is not zero. A moduli space in which gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken arises in this case.
