Title: The Equivalence Theorem for gauge boson scattering in a five dimensional  Standard Model
Authors: Stefania De Curtis and Daniele Dominici and Jose R. Pelaez
Abstract: We present an Equivalence Theorem for the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons in a compactified five dimensional extension of the Standard Model, whose spontaneous symmetry breaking is driven either by one Higgs in the bulk or by one on a brane or by both togheter. We also show some implications for the unitarity bounds on Higgs masses.
