Title: When Superspace Is Not Enough
Authors: S. James Gates Jr and W. D. Linch and J. Phillips
Abstract: We give an expanded discussion of the proposal that spacetime supersymmetry representations may be viewed as having their origins in 1D theories that involve a special class of real Clifford algebras. These 1D theories reproduce the supersymmetric structures of spacetime supersymmetric theories after the latter are reduced on a 0-brane.
