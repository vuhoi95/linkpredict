Title: Liouville-von Neumann approach and time-dependent Gaussian approximation
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: We show that Liouville-von Neumann approach to quantum mechanical systems, which demands the existence of invariant operators, reproduces the time-dependent variational Gaussian approximation. We find the effective action of the time-dependent systems and show that many aspects of the dynamics are independent of the details of time evolution, e.g., the squeezing of the wave-function is determined by the effective potential of the final stage of time-evolution.
