Title: String interactions and discrete symmetries of the pp-wave background
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Michela Petrini and Rodolfo Russo and Alessandro Tanzini
Abstract: Free string theory on the plane-wave background displays a discrete Z2 symmetry exchanging the two transverse SO(4) rotation groups. This symmetry should be respected also at the interacting level. We show that the zero mode structure proposed in hep-th/0208148 can be completed to a full kinematical vertex, contrary to claims appeared in the previous literature. We also comment on the relation with recent works on the string-bit formalism and on the comparison with the field theory side of the correspondence.
