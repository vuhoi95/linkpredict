Abstract: We further study the validity of the Monte Carlo Hamiltonian method. The advantage of the method, in comparison with the standard Monte Carlo Lagrangian approach, is its capability to study the excited states. We consider two quantum mechanical models: a symmetric one $V(x) = |x|/2$; and an asymmetric one $V(x)=\infty$, for $x < 0$ and $V(x)=x$, for $x \ge 0$. The results for the spectrum, wave functions and thermodynamical observables are in agreement with the analytical or Runge-Kutta calculations.
