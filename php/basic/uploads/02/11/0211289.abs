Title: Solvable model of strings in a time-dependent plane-wave background
Authors: G. Papadopoulos and J. G. Russo and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We investigate a string model defined by a special plane-wave metric ds^2 = 2dudv - l(u) x^2 du^2 + dx^2 with l(u) = k/u^2 and k=const > 0. This metric is a Penrose limit of some cosmological, Dp-brane and fundamental string backgrounds. Remarkably, in Rosen coordinates the metric has a ``null cosmology'' interpretation with flat spatial sections and scale factor which is a power of the light-cone time u. We show that: (i) This spacetime is a Lorentzian homogeneous space. In particular, like Minkowski space, it admits a boost isometry in u,v. (ii) It is an exact solution of string theory when supplemented by a u-dependent dilaton such that its exponent (i.e. effective string coupling) goes to zero at u=infinity and at the singularity u=0, reducing back-reaction effects. (iii) The classical string equations in this background become linear in the light-cone gauge and can be solved explicitly in terms of Bessel's functions; thus the string model can be directly quantized. This allows one to address the issue of singularity at the string-theory level. We examine the propagation of first-quantized point-particle and string modes in this time-dependent background. Using certain analytic continuation prescription we argue that string propagation through the singularity can be smooth.
