Title: Non-perturbative summation over 3D discrete topologies
Authors: Laurent Freidel and David Louapre
Abstract: We construct a group field theory which realizes the sum of gravity amplitudes over all three dimensional topologies trough a perturbative expansion. We prove this theory to be uniquely Borel summable. This shows how to define a non-perturbative summation over triangulations including all topologies in the context of three dimensional discrete gravity.
