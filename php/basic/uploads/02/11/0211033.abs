Title: Interpreting the lattice monopoles in the continuum terms
Authors: F. V. Gubarev and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We review briefly current interpretation of the lattice monopoles, defined within the Maximal Abelian Projection, in terms of the continuum theory. We emphasize, in particular, that the lattice data, at the presently available lattices, indicate that the monopoles are associated with singular fields. This note is prompted by a recent analysis hep-lat/0211005 which is based on an implicit assumption that the fields are regular.
