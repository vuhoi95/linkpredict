Title: Obtaining the CMB anomalies with a bounce from the contracting phase to  inflation
Authors: Zhi-Guo Liu and Zong-Kuan Guo and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: Recent Planck data show the anomalies of CMB fluctuations on large angular scales, which confirms the early observations by WMAP. We continue studying an inflationary model, in which before the slow roll inflation the universe is in a contracting phase, and fit the model with the Planck data. It is showed that this model may generate not only the power deficit at low-l, but also a large hemispherical power asymmetry in CMB. We also discuss the implication of the result to the eternal inflation scenario.
