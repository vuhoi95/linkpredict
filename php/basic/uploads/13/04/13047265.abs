Title: Graviton Corrections to Vacuum Polarization during Inflation
Authors: Katie E. Leonard and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: We use dimensional regularization to compute the one loop quantum gravitational contribution to the vacuum polarization on de Sitter background. Adding the appropriate BPHZ counterterms gives a fully renormalized result which can be used to quantum correct Maxwell's equations. We use the Hartree approximation to argue that the electric field strengths of photons experience a secular suppression during inflation.
