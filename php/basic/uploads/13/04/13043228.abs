Title: Total screening and finite range forces from ultra-massive scalar fields
Authors: H. Arodz and J. Karkowski and Z. Swierczynski
Abstract: Force between static point particles coupled to a classical ultra-massive scalar field is calculated. The field potential is proportional to the modulus of the field. It turns out that the force exactly vanishes when the distance between the particles exceeds certain finite value. Moreover, each isolated particle is surrounded by a compact cloud of the scalar field that completely screens its scalar charge.
