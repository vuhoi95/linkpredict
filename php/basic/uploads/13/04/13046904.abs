Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and J. R. L. Santos
Abstract: In this paper we study the possibility of constructing two-field models from one-field models. The idea is to start with a given one-field model and use the deformation procedure to generate another one-field model, and then couple the two one-field models nontrivially, to get to a two-field model, together with some explicit topological solutions. We show with several distinct examples that the procedure works nicely and can be used generically.
