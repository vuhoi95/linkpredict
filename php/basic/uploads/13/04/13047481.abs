Title: Lifshitz Hydrodynamics
Authors: Carlos Hoyos and Bom Soo Kim and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We construct the hydrodynamics of quantum critical points with Lifshitz scaling. There are new dissipative effects allowed by the lack of boost invariance. The formulation is applicable, in general, to any fluid with an explicit breaking of boost symmetry. We use a Drude model of a strange metal to study the physical effects of the new transport coefficient. It can be measured using electric fields with non-zero gradients, or via the heat production when an external force is turned on. Scaling arguments fix the resistivity to be linear in the temperature.
