Title: An introduction to the Vainshtein mechanism
Authors: Eugeny Babichev and Cedric Deffayet
Abstract: We introduce the Vainshtein mechanism which plays a crucial role in massive gravities, as well as in related theories such as Galileons and their extensions. This mechanism, also known as k-mouflage, allows to hide via non linear effects - typically for source distances smaller than a so-called Vainshtein radius which depends on the source and on the theory considered - some degrees of freedom whose effects are then only left important at large distances, e.g. for cosmology. It is introduced here in non linear Fierz-Pauli theories (massive gravities), including the dRGT theories, in their decoupling limits, as well as in other models such as DGP model or generalized Galileons. This presentation is self-contained and before discussing the Vainshtein mechanism we introduce some useful results and concepts concerning massive gravity, such as the vDVZ discontinuity, the decoupling limits or the Boulware-Deser ghost.
