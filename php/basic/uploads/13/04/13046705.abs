Title: Entropy currents from holography in hydrodynamics with charge
Authors: Grzegorz Plewa and Michal Spalinski
Abstract: The holographic interpretation of the hydrodynamic entropy current is developed for the case of hydrodynamics with a conserved charge. This is carried out within a framework developed in earlier work, which showed how to associate entropy currents with horizons in the dual geometry. The entropy current defined by the event horizon in the dual bulk geometry is calculated. It is also shown that to second order in the gradient expansion the dual geometry possesses a unique Weyl-invariant apparent horizon which also defines an admissable entropy current. At first order both currents coincide with the result obtained on the basis of a purely hydrodynamic analysis.
