Title: Gauged Linear Sigma Model for Exotic Five-brane
Authors: Tetsuji Kimura and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study an N=(4,4) supersymmetric gauged linear sigma model which gives rise to the nonlinear sigma model for multi-centered KK-monopoles. We find a new T-duality transformation of the model even in the presence of F-terms. Performing T-duality, we find the gauged linear sigma model whose IR limit describes the exotic 522-brane with B-field.
