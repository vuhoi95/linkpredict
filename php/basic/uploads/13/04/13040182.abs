Title: CP violation in the models of fermion localization on a domain wall  (brane)
Authors: Alexander A. Andrianov and Vladimir A. Andrianov and Oleg O. Novikov
Abstract: A brief survey of fermion localization mechanism on a domain wall ("thick brane") generated by a topologically nontrivial vacuum configuration of scalar fields is given. The extension of scalar fields interaction with fermions which supplies fermions with an axial mass is proposed. For several flavors and generations of fermions this extension can entail the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix of the Standard Model. As well the model with two scalar doublets which provide a supplementary CP violation mechanism is considered.
