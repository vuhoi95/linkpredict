Title: Light-like Wilson loops in ABJM and maximal transcendentality
Authors: Marco S. Bianchi and Gaston Giribet and Matias Leoni and Silvia Penati
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the two-loop light-like tetragonal Wilson loop for three dimensional pure Chern-Simons and N=6 Chern-Simons-matter theory, within dimensional regularization with dimensional reduction scheme. Our examination shows that, contrary to prior belief, the result respects maximal transcendentality as is the case of the four-point scattering amplitude of the theory. Remarkably, the corrected result matches exactly the scattering amplitude both in the divergent and in the finite parts, constants included.
