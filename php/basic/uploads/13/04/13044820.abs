Abstract: For the CPT-even case of the minimal Standard Model Extension, the spin-projector method is adopted to account for the breaking (tensor) $% K_{\mu \nu \kappa \lambda}$ term. We adopt a particular decomposition of this term in fourvectors, and carry out a detailed analysis of causality and unitarity. From this study, we are able to impose conditions on the decomposition of the $K_{\mu \nu \kappa \lambda}$ and vortex formation is also investigated in different situations.
