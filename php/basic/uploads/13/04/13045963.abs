Title: Hawking radiation of scalars from charged accelerating and rotating  black holes with NUT parameter
Authors: Khush Jan and H. Gohar
Abstract: We study the quantum tunneling of scalars from charged accelerating and rotating black hole with NUT parameter. For this purpose we use the charged Klein-Gordon equation. We apply WKB approximation and the Hamilton-Jacobi method to solve charged the Klein-Gordon equation. We find the tunneling probability of outgoing charged scalars from the event horizon of this black hole, and hence the Hawking temperature for this black hole.
