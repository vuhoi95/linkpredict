Title: New perspectives on neutron star and black hole spectroscopy and dynamic  tides
Authors: Sayan Chakrabarti and TÃ©rence Delsate and Jan Steinhoff
Abstract: We elaborate on a powerful tidal interaction formalism where the multipole dynamics is kept generic and encoded in a linear response function. This response function is the gravitational counterpart of the atomic spectrum and can become of similar importance with the rise of gravitational wave astronomy. We find that the internal dynamics of nonrotating neutron stars admit a harmonic oscillator formulation yielding a simple interpretation of tides. A preliminary investigation of the black holes case is given. Our results fill the gap between Love numbers and dynamic tides.
