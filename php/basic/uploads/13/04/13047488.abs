Title: Emission spectrum of soft massless states from heavy superstring
Authors: Shoichi Kawamoto and Toshihiro Matsuo
Abstract: We calculate emission rates of various bosonic/fermionic soft massless states of open/closed superstring from an ensemble of a highly excited open/closed superstring in the flat background. The resulting spectrum shows thermal distributions at the Hagedorn temperature. We find greybody factors for each process and observe their relation to the ones from blackholes.
