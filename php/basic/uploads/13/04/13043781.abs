Title: Black Hole Scattering from Monodromy
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Joshua M. Lapan and Alexander Maloney and Maria J. Rodriguez
Abstract: We study scattering coefficients in black hole spacetimes using analytic properties of complexified wave equations. For a concrete example, we analyze the singularities of the Teukolsky equation and relate the corresponding monodromies to scattering data. These techniques, valid in full generality, provide insights into complex-analytic properties of greybody factors and quasinormal modes. This leads to new perturbative and numerical methods which are in good agreement with previous results.
