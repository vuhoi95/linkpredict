Title: Non-perturbative black holes in Type-IIA String Theory vs. the No-Hair  conjecture
Authors: Pablo Bueno and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: We obtain the first black hole solution to Type-IIA String Theory compactified on an arbitrary self-mirror Calabi Yau manifold in the presence of non-perturbative quantum corrections. Remarkably enough, the solution involves multivalued functions, which could lead to a violation of the No-Hair conjecture. We discuss how String Theory forbids such secenario. However the possibility still remains open in the context of four-dimensional ungauged Supergravity.
