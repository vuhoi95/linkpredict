Title: Backreacted flavor in non-commutative gauge theories
Authors: Georgios Itsios and Veselin G. Filev and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We construct the gravity dual of N=1 Non-Commutative SYM theory coupled to Nf smeared massless fundamental flavors. Our solution is analytic and non-perturbative. Near the origin the background reduces to the one corresponding to an ordinary SYM theory. At large radial distances, the dilaton diverges signaling the presence of a UV Landau pole. Considering a probe D3-brane we calculate the effective YM coupling and show that it is independent on the parameter of non-commutativity. We calculate the corresponding beta function and show that it remains positive at all energy scales.
