Title: Reflection relations and fermionic basis
Authors: S. Negro and F. Smirnov
Abstract: There are two approaches to computing the one-point functions for sine-Gordon model in infinite volume. One is a bootstrap type procedure based on the reflection relations. Another uses the fermionic basis which was originally found for the lattice six-vertex model. In this paper we show that the two approaches are deeply interrelated.
