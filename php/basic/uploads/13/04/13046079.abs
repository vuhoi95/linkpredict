Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Otari Sakhelashvili and Giorgi Tukhashvili
Abstract: Within the 5D standing wave braneworld model numerical solutions of the equations for matter fields with various spins are found. It is shown that corresponding action integrals are factorizable and convergent over the extra coordinate, i.e. 4D fields are localized on the brane. We find that only left massless fermions are localized on the brane, while the right fermions are localized in the bulk. We demonstrate also quantization of Kaluza-Klein excited modes in our model.
