Title: Detailing N=1 Seiberg's Duality through the Seiberg-Witten Solution of  N=2
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: Starting from the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 SQCD with the U(N) gauge group and N_f quark flavors we construct the so-called \mu-dual N=1 theory in the r vacua in the regime analogous to that existing to the left of the left edge of the Seiberg conformal window (here r is the number of condensed quarks). The strong-weak coupling duality is shown to exist in the so-called zero vacua which can be found at r< N_f-N. We show that the \mu-dual theory matches the Seiberg dual in the zero vacua.
