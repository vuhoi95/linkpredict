Title: Dark matter and dark energy from quark bag model
Authors: Maxim Brilenkov and Maxim Eingorn and Laszlo Jenkovszky and Alexander Zhuk
Abstract: We calculate the present expansion of our Universe endowed with relict colored objects - quarks and gluons - that survived hadronization either as isolated islands of quark-gluon "nuggets", or spread uniformly in the Universe. In the first scenario, the QNs can play the role of dark matter. In the second scenario, we demonstrate that uniform colored objects can play the role of dark energy providing the late-time accelerating expansion of the Universe.
