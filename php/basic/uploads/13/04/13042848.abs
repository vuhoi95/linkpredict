Title: Analysis of Spontaneous Mass Generation by Iterative Method in the  Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model and Gauge Theories
Authors: Ken-Ichi Aoki and Shinnosuke Onai and Daisuke Sato
Abstract: We propose a new iterative method to directly calculate the spontaneous mass generation due to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. We can conclude the physical mass definitely without recourse to any other consideration like the free energy comparison.
