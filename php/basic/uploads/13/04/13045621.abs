Title: Gauge Symmetries in Heterotic Asymmetric Orbifolds
Authors: Florian Beye and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Shogo Kuwakino
Abstract: We study heterotic asymmetric orbifold models. By utilizing the lattice engineering technique, we classify (22,6)-dimensional Narain lattices with right-moving non-Abelian group factors which can be starting points for Z3 asymmetric orbifold construction. We also calculate gauge symmetry breaking patterns.
