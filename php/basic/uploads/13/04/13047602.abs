Abstract: We study quantum integrable models with GL(3) trigonometric $R$-matrix and solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz. Using the presentation of the universal Bethe vectors in terms of projections of products of the currents of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_3)$ onto intersections of different types of Borel subalgebras, we prove that the set of the nested Bethe vectors is closed under the action of the elements of the monodromy matrix.
