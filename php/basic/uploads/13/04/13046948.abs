Title: Recurrence Relations of Higher Spin BPST Vertex Operators for Open  String
Authors: Chih-Hao Fu and Jen-Chi Lee and Chung-I Tan and Yi Yang
Abstract: We calculate higher spin BPST vertex operators for open bosonic string and express these operstors in terms of Kummer function of the second kind. We derive infinite number of recurrence relations among BPST vertex operators of different string states. These recurrence relations among BPST vertex operators lead to the recurrence relations among Regge string scattering amplitudes discovered recently.
