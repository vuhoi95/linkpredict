Title: Matrix Model Fixed Point of Noncommutative Phi-Four
Authors: Badis Ydri and Rachid Ahmim
Abstract: In this article we exhibit explicitly the matrix model ($\theta=\infty$) fixed point of phi-four theory on noncommutative spacetime with only two noncommuting directions using the Wilson renormalization group recursion formula and the 1/N expansion of the zero dimensional reduction and then calculate the mass critical exponent $\nu$ and the anomalous dimension $\eta$ in various dimensions .
