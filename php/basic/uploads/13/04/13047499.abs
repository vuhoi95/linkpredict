Title: On genus expansion of knot polynomials and hidden structure of Hurwitz  tau-functions
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and A. Sleptsov
Abstract: In the genus expansion of the HOMFLY polynomials their representation dependence is naturally captured by symmetric group characters. This immediately implies that the Ooguri-Vafa partition function (OVPF) is a Hurwitz tau-function. In the planar limit involving factorizable special polynomials, it is actually a trivial exponential tau-function. In fact, in the double scaling Kashaev limit (the one associated with the volume conjecture) dominant in the genus expansion are terms associated with the symmetric representations and with the integrability preserving Casimir operators, though we stop one step from converting this fact into a clear statement about the OVPF behavior in the vicinity of q=1. Instead, we explain that the genus expansion provides a hierarchical decomposition of the Hurwitz tau-function, similar to the Takasaki-Takebe expansion of the KP tau-functions. This analogy can be helpful to develop a substitute for the universal Grassmannian description in the Hurwitz tau-functions.
