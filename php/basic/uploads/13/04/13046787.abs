Title: Supersymmetry and the Modular Double
Authors: Ivan Chi-Ho Ip and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: A counterpart of the modular double for quantum superalgebra $\cU_q(\osp(1|2))$ is constructed by means of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We also construct the $R$-matrix operator acting in the corresponding representations, which is expressed via quantum dilogarithm.
