Title: Gravitation at Very Short Distances
Authors: P. H. Frampton and G. Karl
Abstract: In this note, it is discussed why attempts to renormalize conventional quantum gravity may be based on a false presumption, because, according to Verlinde's entropic view of gravity, the gravitational force between two elementary particles vanishes.
