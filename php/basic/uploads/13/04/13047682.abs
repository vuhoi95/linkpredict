Title: Quantum Energy Inequality for the Massive Ising Model
Authors: Henning Bostelmann and Daniela Cadamuro and Christopher J. Fewster
Abstract: A Quantum Energy Inequality (QEI) is derived for the massive Ising model, giving a state-independent lower bound on suitable averages of the energy density; the first QEI to be established for an interacting quantum field theory with nontrivial S-matrix. It is shown that the Ising model has one-particle states with locally negative energy densities, and that the energy density operator is not additive with respect to combination of one-particle states into multi-particle configurations.
