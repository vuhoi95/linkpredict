Title: Sakai-Sugimoto model in D0-D4 background
Authors: Chao Wu and Zhiguang Xiao and Da Zhou
Abstract: We add smeared D0 charges to the D4 background and discuss Sakai-Sugimoto model under this background. The corresponding gauge theory develops a glue condensate $< tr (F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu})> $. The D8 branes go less deep than in the original S-S model and massless Goldstones are still found in the spectrum. The effects of the condensate on the meson spectra, pion decay constant, and couplings of the vector mesons and Goldstones are then investigated.
