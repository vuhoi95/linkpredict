Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric formulation of linearized New Massive Gravity without introducing higher derivatives. Instead, we introduce supersymmetrically a set of bosonic and fermionic auxiliary fields which, upon elimination by their equations of motion, introduce fourth-order derivative terms for the metric and third-order derivative terms for the gravitino. Our construction requires an off-shell formulation of the three-dimensional supersymmetric massive Fierz-Pauli theory. We discuss the non-linear extension of our results.
