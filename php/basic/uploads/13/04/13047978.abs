Title: Algebraic Bethe ansatz for singular solutions
Authors: Rafael I. Nepomechie and Chunguang Wang
Abstract: The Bethe equations for the isotropic periodic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with N sites have solutions containing i/2, -i/2 that are singular: both the corresponding energy and the algebraic Bethe ansatz vector are divergent. Such solutions must be carefully regularized. We consider a regularization involving a parameter that can be determined using a generalization of the Bethe equations. These generalized Bethe equations provide a practical way of determining which singular solutions correspond to eigenvectors of the model.
