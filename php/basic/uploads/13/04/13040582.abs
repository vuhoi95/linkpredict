Title: Awaking the vacuum with spheroidal shells

Abstract: It has been shown that well-behaved spacetimes may induce the vacuum fluctuations of some nonminimally coupled free scalar fields to go through a phase of exponential growth. Here, we discuss this mechanism in the context of spheroidal thin shells emphasizing the consequences of deviations from spherical symmetry.
