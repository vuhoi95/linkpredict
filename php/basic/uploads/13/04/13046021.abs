Title: Torus knots as Hopfions
Authors: Michikazu Kobayashi and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We present a direct connection between torus knots and Hopfions by finding stable and static solutions of the extended Faddeev-Skyrme model with a ferromagnetic potential term. (P,Q)--torus knots consisting of |Q| sine-Gordon kink strings twisted P/Q times into the poloidal cycle along the toroidal cycle on a toroidal domain wall carry the Hopf charge PQ, which demonstrates that Hopfions can be further classified according to torus knot type.
