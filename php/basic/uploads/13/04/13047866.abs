Title: Parity doubling structure of nucleon at non-zero density in the  holographic mean field theory
Authors: Bing-Ran He and Masayasu Harada
Abstract: We develope the holographic mean field theory approach in a bottom-up holographic QCD model including baryons and scalar mesons in addition to vector mesons and pions. We study the effect of parity doubling structure of baryons at non-zero density to the equation of state between the chemical potential and the baryon number density. We first show that we can adjust the amount of nucleon mass coming from the chiral symmetry breaking by changing the boundary value of the five-dimensional baryon fields. Then, introducing the mean field for the baryon fields, we calculate the equation of state between the baryon number density and its corresponding chemical potential. Then, comparing the predicted equation of state with the one obtained in a Walecka type model, we extract the density dependence of the effective nucleon mass. The result shows that the effective mass decreases with increasing density, and that the rate of decreasing is more rapid for the larger percentage of the mass coming from the chiral symmetry breaking.
