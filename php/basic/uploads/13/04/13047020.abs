Title: Charged black holes on Kaluza-Klein bubbles
Authors: Jutta Kunz and Petya G. Nedkova and Cristian Stelea
Abstract: We construct exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton field equations in five dimensions, which describe general configurations of charged and static black holes sitting on a Kaluza-Klein bubble. More specifically we discuss the configurations describing two black holes sitting on a Kaluza-Klein bubble and also the general charged static black Saturn balanced by a Kaluza-Klein bubble. A straightforward extension of the solution generating technique leads to a new solution describing the charged static black Saturn on the Taub-bolt instanton. We compute the conserved charges and investigate some of the thermodynamic properties of these systems.
