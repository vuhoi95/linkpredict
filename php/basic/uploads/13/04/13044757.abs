Title: Finite temperature behaviour of glueballs in Lattice Gauge Theories
Authors: Michele Caselle and Roberto Pellegrini
Abstract: We propose a new method to compute glueball masses in finite temperature Lattice Gauge Theories which at low temperature is fully compatible with the known zero temperature results and as the temperature increases leads to a glueball spectrum which vanishes at the deconfinement transition. We show that this definition is consistent with the Isgur-Paton model and with the expected contribution of the glueball spectrum to various thermodynamic quantities at finite temperature. We test our proposal with a set of high precision numerical simulations in the 3d gauge Ising model and find a good agreement with our predictions.
