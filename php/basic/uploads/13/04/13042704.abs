Title: Vacuum Varieties, Holomorphic Bundles and Complex Structure  Stabilization in Heterotic Theories
Authors: Lara B. Anderson and James Gray and Andre Lukas and Burt Ovrut
Abstract: We discuss the use of gauge fields to stabilize complex structure moduli in Calabi-Yau three-fold compactifications of heterotic string and M-theory. The requirement that the gauge fields in such models preserve supersymmetry leads to a complicated landscape of vacua in complex structure moduli space. We develop methods to systematically map out this multi-branched vacuum space, in a computable and explicit manner. In analyzing the resulting vacua, it is found that the associated Calabi-Yau three-folds are sometimes stabilized at a value of complex structure resulting in a singular compactification manifold. We describe how it is possible to resolve these singularities, in some cases, while maintaining computational control over the moduli stabilization mechanism. The discussion is illustrated throughout the paper with explicit worked examples.
