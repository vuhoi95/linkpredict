Title: Symmetry breaking in de Sitter: a stochastic effective theory approach
Authors: Gianrocco Lazzari and Tomislav Prokopec
Abstract: We consider phase transitions on (eternal) de Sitter in an O(N) symmetric scalar field theory. Making use of Starobinsky's stochastic inflation we prove that deep infrared scalar modes cannot form a condensate -- and hence they see an effective potential that allows no phase transition. We show that by proving convexity of the effective potential that governs deep infrared field fluctuations both at the origin as well as at arbitrary values of the field. Next, we present numerical plots of the scalar field probability distribution function (PDF) and the corresponding effective potential for several values of the coupling constant at the asymptotic future timelike infinity of de Sitter. For small field values the effective potential has an approximately quadratic form, corresponding to a positive mass term, such that the corresponding PDF is approximately Gaussian. However, the curvature of the effective potential shows qualitatively different (typically much softer) behavior on the coupling constant than that implied by the Starobinsky-Yokoyama procedure. For large field values, the effective potential as expected reduces to the tree level potential plus a positive correction that only weakly (logarithmically) depends on the background field. Finally, we calculate the backreaction of fluctuations on the background geometry and show that it is positive.
