Title: Lifshitz as a deformation of Anti-de Sitter
Authors: Yegor Korovin and Kostas Skenderis and Marika Taylor
Abstract: We consider holography for Lifshitz spacetimes with dynamical exponent z=1+epsilon^2, where epsilon is small. We show that the holographically dual field theory is a specific deformation of the relativistic CFT, corresponding to the z=1 theory. Treating epsilon as a small expansion parameter we set up the holographic dictionary for Einstein-Proca models up to order epsilon^2 in three and four bulk dimensions. We explain how renormalization turns the relativistic conformal invariance into non-relativistic Lifshitz invariance with dynamical exponent z=1+epsilon^2. We compute the two-point function of the conserved spin two current for the dual two-dimensional field theory and verify that it is Lifshitz invariant. Using only QFT arguments, we show that a particular class of deformations of CFTs generically leads to Lifshitz scaling invariance and we construct examples of such deformations.
