Abstract: We compute the greybody factors for non-minimally coupled scalar fields in four-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. In particular, we demonstrate that the zero-angular-momentum greybody factor generically tends to zero in the zero-frequency limit like frequency squared if there is non-vanishing coupling to the scalar curvature. This is in contrast with the minimally coupled case, where the greybody factor is known to tend to a finite constant. We also study the Hawking radiation for non-minimally coupled massless scalar fields in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, formulate a sensible notion of a generalized absorption cross section and investigate its properties.
