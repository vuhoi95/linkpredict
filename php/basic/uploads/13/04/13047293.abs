Title: Symmetries of the Free Schr√∂dinger Equation in the Non-Commutative  Plane
Authors: Carles Batlle and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura
Abstract: We study all the symmetries of the free Schr\"odinger equation in the non-commutative plane. These symmetry transformations form an infinite-dimensional Weyl algebra that appears naturally from a two-dimensional Heisenberg algebra generated by Galilean boosts and momenta. These infinite high symmetries could be useful for constructing non-relativistic interacting higher spin theories. A finite-dimensional subalgebra is given by the Schr\"odinger algebra which, besides the Galilei generators, contains also the dilatation and the expansion. We consider the quantization of the symmetry generators in both the reduced and extended phase spaces, and discuss the relation between both approaches.
