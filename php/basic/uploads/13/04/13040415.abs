Title: Grand Symmetry, Spectral Action, and the Higgs mass
Authors: Agostino Devastato and Fedele Lizzi and Pierre Martinetti
Abstract: In the context of the spectral action and the noncommutative geometry approach to the standard model, we build a model based on a larger symmetry. With this "grand symmetry" it is natural to have the scalar field necessary to obtain the Higgs mass in the vicinity of 126 GeV. This larger symmetry mixes gauge and spin degrees of freedom without introducing extra fermions. Requiring the noncommutative space to be an almost commutative geometry (i.e. the product of manifold by a finite dimensional internal space) gives conditions for the breaking of this grand symmetry to the standard model.
