Title: Magnetized Branes and the Six-Torus
Authors: L. De Angelis and R. Marotta and F. Pezzella and R. Troise
Abstract: In the framework of Type IIB String Theory compactified on a general six-torus T6 with arbitrary complex structure, Yukawa couplings are determined for the chiral matter described by open strings ending on D9-branes having different oblique magnetization.
