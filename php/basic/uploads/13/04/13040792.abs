Title: More stable dS vacua from S-dual non-geometric fluxes
Authors: Cesar Damian and Oscar Loaiza-Brito
Abstract: Stable vacua obtained from isotropic tori compactification might not be fully stable provided the existence of runaway directions in the Kaehler directions of anisotropy. By implementing a genetic algorithm we report the existence of explicit flux configurations leading to stable de Sitter and Anti- de Sitter vacua, consisting on Type IIB compactifications on a 6-dimensional anisotropic torus threaded with standard and S-dual invariant non-geometric fluxes in the presence of orientifold 3-planes. In all dS vacua the masses of the complex structure moduli are heavier than the Hubble scale suggesting that the axio-dilaton and Kaeahler moduli are natural candidates for small-field inflation. In the way, we also report new solutions on isotropic and semi-isotropic tori compactifications. Finally, we observe that, since all our solutions are obtained in the absence of solitonic objects, they are good candidates to be lifted to stable solutions in extended supersymmetric theories.
