Title: CFTs in rotating black hole backgrounds
Authors: Pau Figueras and Saran Tunyasuvunakool
Abstract: We use AdS/CFT to construct the gravitational dual of a 5D CFT in the background of a non-extremal rotating black hole. Our boundary conditions are such that the vacuum state of the dual CFT corresponds to the Unruh state. We extract the expectation value of the stress tensor of the dual CFT using holographic renormalisation and show that it is stationary and regular on both the future and the past event horizons. The energy density of the CFT is found to be negative everywhere in our domain and we argue that this can be understood as a vacuum polarisation effect. We construct the solutions by numerically solving the elliptic Einstein--DeTurck equation for stationary Lorentzian spacetimes with Killing horizons.
