Title: Exact Solutions in Massive Gravity
Authors: Gianmassimo Tasinato and Kazuya Koyama and Gustavo Niz
Abstract: Massive gravity is a good theoretical laboratory to study modifications of General Relativity. The theory offers a concrete set-up to study models of dark energy, since it admits cosmological self-accelerating solutions in the vacuum, in which the size of the acceleration depends on the graviton mass. Moreover, non-linear gravitational self-interactions, in the proximity of a matter source, manage to mimic the predictions of linearised General Relativity, hence agreeing with solar-system precision measurements. In this article, we review our work in the subject, classifying, on one hand, static solutions, and on the other hand, self-accelerating backgrounds. For what respects static solutions we exhibit black hole configurations, together with other solutions that recover General Relativity near a source via the Vainshtein mechanism. For the self-accelerating solutions we describe a wide class of cosmological backgrounds, including an analysis of their stability.
