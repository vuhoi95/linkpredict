Title: Holographic d-wave superconductors
Authors: Keun-Young Kim and Marika Taylor
Abstract: We construct top down models for holographic d-wave superfluids in which the order parameter is a charged spin two field in the bulk. Close to the transition temperature the condensed phase can be captured by a charged spin two field in an R-charged black hole background (downstairs picture) or equivalently by specific graviton perturbations of a spinning black brane (upstairs picture). We analyse the necessary conditions on the mass and the charge of the spin two field for a condensed phase to exist and we discuss the competition of the d-wave phase with other phases such as s-wave superfluids.
