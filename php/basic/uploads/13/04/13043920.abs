Title: Possible existence of viable models of bi-gravity with detectable  graviton oscillations by gravitational wave detectors
Authors: Antonio De Felice and Takashi Nakamura and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We discuss graviton oscillations based on the ghost free bi-gravity theory. We point out that this theory possesses a natural cosmological background solution which is very close to the case of general relativity. Furthermore, interesting parameter range of the graviton mass, which can be explored by the observations of gravitational waves, is not at all excluded by the constraint from the solar system tests. Therefore the graviton oscillation with possible inverse chirp signal would be an interesting scientific target of KAGRA, adv LIGO, adv Virgo and GEO.
