Title: On the Torus Degeneration of the Genus Two Partition Function
Authors: Donny Hurley and Michael P. Tuite
Abstract: We consider the partition function of a general vertex operator algebra $V$ on a genus two Riemann surface formed by sewing together two tori. We consider the non-trivial degeneration limit where one torus is pinched down to a Riemann sphere and show that the genus one partition function on the degenerate torus is recovered up to an explicit universal $V$-independent multiplicative factor raised to the power of the central charge.
