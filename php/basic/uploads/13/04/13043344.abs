Title: Four-loop results for the anomalous dimension for a general N=2  supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions
Authors: I. Jack and C. Luckhurst
Abstract: We present results for the planar contribution to the four-loop anomalous dimension for a general N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions. These results should facilitate higher-order superconformality checks for theories relevant for the AdS/CFT correspondence.
