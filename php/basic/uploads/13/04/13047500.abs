Title: Generalized Chern-Simons action and maximally supersymmetric gauge  theories
Authors: M. V. Movshev and A. Schwarz
Abstract: We study observables and deformations of generalized Chern-Simons action and show how to apply these results to maximally supersymmetric gauge theories. We describe a construction of large class of deformations based on some results on the cohomology of super Lie algebras proved in the Appendix.
