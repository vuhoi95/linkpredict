Abstract: The interactions between gluons are important in theories such as quantum chromodynamics. Therefore, to rediscover new features of well known methods in order to investigate the SU(3) gauge group can be a new way to deal with Yang-Mills theories. In this work we analyzed YM theories through the well known Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for constrained systems. Besides, we showed precisely that having U(1) Maxwell electromagnetic theory as a starting point we can construct SU(3)-like and SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1) non-Abelian theories.
