Title: Integrability of zero-dimensional replica field theories at beta=1
Authors: Pedro Vidal and Eugene Kanzieper
Abstract: Building on insights from the theory of integrable lattices, the integrability is claimed for nonlinear replica sigma models derived in the context of real symmetric random matrices. Specifically, the fermionic and the bosonic replica partition functions are proven to form a single (supersymmetric) Pfaff-KP hierarchy whose replica limit is shown to reproduce the celebrated nonperturbative formula for the density-density eigenvalue correlation function in the infinite-dimensional Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. Implications of the formalism outlined are briefly discussed.
