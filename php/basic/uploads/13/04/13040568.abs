Title: Smooth U(1) Gauge Potentials on the de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Bin Zhou and Shibei Kong and Peng Zhao and Ruixiao Zhang
Abstract: Using the methods of Lie groups and Lie algebras, we solved U(1) gauge potentials on the de Sitter background. Resulted gauge potentials are smooth on the whole spacetime, satisfying the Lorentz gauge condition. It is shown that electromagnetic fields on the de Sitter background could not be source free.
