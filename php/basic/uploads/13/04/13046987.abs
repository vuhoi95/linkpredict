Title: Interaction between viscous varying modified cosmic Chaplygin gas and  Tachyonic fluid
Authors: Jafar Sadeghi and Hoda Farahani
Abstract: In this paper we study the interaction between the general form of viscous varying modified cosmic Chaplygin gas and the Tachyon fluid in the framework of Einstein gravity. We want to reconstruct the Tachyon potential and total equation of state parameter graphically by using numerical methods. In the presence of deceleration parameter, the interaction between components becomes sign changeable to explain different evolutionary eras in the universe. We review the potential and total equation of state parameter in Emergent, Intermediate and Logamediate scenarios of scale factor numerically. Analysis of total equation of state parameter show that, $\omega_{tot}<-1$ and $\omega_{tot}>-1$ imply the phantom-like and quintessence-like behaviors respectively. we have checked the effects of cosmic and viscosity elements on the interaction process. Stability is checked in all the models by the squared velocity of sound.
