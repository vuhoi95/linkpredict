Title: Quadruply-graded colored homology of knots
Authors: Eugene Gorsky and Sergei Gukov and Marko Stosic
Abstract: We conjecture the existence of four independent gradings in the colored HOMFLY homology. We describe these gradings explicitly for the rectangular colored homology of torus knots and make qualitative predictions of various interesting structures and symmetries in the colored homology of general knots. We also give a simple representation-theoretic model for the HOMFLY homology of the unknot colored by any representation. While some of these structures have a natural interpretation in the physical realization of knot homologies based on counting supersymmetric configurations (BPS states, instantons, and vortices), others are completely new. They suggest new geometric and physical realizations of colored HOMFLY homology as the Hochschild homology of the category of branes in a Landau-Ginzburg B-model or, equivalently, in the mirror A-model. Supergroups and supermanifolds are surprisingly ubiquitous in all aspects of this work.
