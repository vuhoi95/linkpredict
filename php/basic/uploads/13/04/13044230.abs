Title: Proton Stability, Gauge Coupling Unification and a Light $Z^\prime$ in  Heterotic-string Models
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Viraf M. Mehta
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological viability of a light Z' in heterotic-string models, whose existence has been motivated by proton stability arguments. A class of quasi-realistic string models that produce such a viable Z' are the Left-Right Symmetric (LRS) heterotic-string models in the free fermionic formulation. A key feature of these models is that the matter charges under U(1)_Z' do not admit an E6 embedding. The light Z' in the LRS heterotic-string models forbids baryon number violating operators, while allowing lepton number violating operators, hence suppressing proton decay yet allowing for sufficiently small neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism. We show that the constraints imposed by the gauge coupling data and heterotic-string coupling unification nullify the viability of a light Z' in these models. We further argue that agreement with the gauge coupling data necessitates that the U(1)_Z' charges admit an E6 embedding. We discuss how viable string models with this property may be constructed.
