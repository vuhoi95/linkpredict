Title: Jordanian deformation of the open sl(2) Gaudin model
Authors: N. Cirilo António and N. Manojlović and Z. Nagy
Abstract: We derive the deformed sl(2) Gaudin model with integrable boundaries. Starting from the Jordanian deformation of the SL(2)-invariant Yang R-matrix and generic solutions of the associated reflection equation and the dual reflection equation, the corresponding inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXX chain is obtained. The quasi-classical expansion of the transfer matrix yields the deformed sl(2) Gaudin Hamiltonians with boundary terms.
