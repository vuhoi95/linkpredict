Abstract: Light pseudoscalars, or axion like particles (ALPs), are much studied due to their potential relevance to the fields of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The most relevant coupling of ALPs from the viewpoint of current experimental searches is to the photon: in this work, we study the generation of this coupling as an effect of quantum corrections, originated from an underlying Lorentz violating background. Most interestingly, we show that the interaction so generated turns out to be Lorentz invariant, thus mimicking the standard ALPs coupling to the photon that is considered in the experiments. This consideration implies that violations of spacetime symmetries, much studied as possible consequences of physics in very high energy scales, might infiltrate in other realms of physics in unsuspected ways. Additionally, we conjecture that a similar mechanism can also generate Lorentz invariant couplings involving scalar particles and photons, playing a possible role in the phenomenology of Higgs bosons.
