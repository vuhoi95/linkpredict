Title: On Lagrangian Formulation for Spin (2,1,1) Massive Tensor Field on  Minkowski Backgrounds
Authors: A. A. Reshetnyak and P. Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We derive the Lagrangian for a new model of a massive rank-4 tensor field with generalized spin (2,1,1) in Minkowski spacetime of any dimension d>5, by using dimensional reduction applied to a reducible gauge model of a massless rank-4 tensor field with generalized spin (2,1,1) in Minkowski spacetime of dimension d+1.
