Authors: R. Casana and M. M. Ferreira Jr. and E. da Hora and C. dos Santos
Abstract: We have found analytical self-dual solutions within the generalized Yang-Mills-Higgs model introduced in Phys. Rev. D 86, 085034 (2012). Such solutions are magnetic monopoles satisfying Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) equations and usual finite energy boundary conditions. Moreover, the new solutions are classified in two different types according to their capability of recovering (or not) the usual 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. Finally, we compare the profiles of the solutions we found with the standard ones, from which we comment about the main features exhibited by the new configurations.
