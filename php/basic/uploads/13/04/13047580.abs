Title: Supersymmetry Breaking in Anti-de Sitter spacetime
Authors: Bin Zhu and Kun Meng and Ran Ding
Abstract: We study the questions of how supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in Anti de-Sitter spacetime. We verify that the would-be R-symmetry in $AdS_4$ plays a central role for the existence of meta-stable supersymmetry breaking. To illustrate, some well-known models such as Poloyni models and O'Raifeartaigh models are investigated in detail. Our calculations are reliable in flat spacetime limit and confirm us that meta-stable vacua are generic even though quantum corrections are taken into account.
