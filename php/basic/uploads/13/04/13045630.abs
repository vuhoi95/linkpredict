Title: The $AdS_{5}xS^(5)$ fermionic model
Authors: Elcio Abdalla and Antonio Lima-Santos
Abstract: We consider the $AdS_{5}xS^(5)$ integrable model. As it turns out, relying on well known arguments, we claim that the conformally invariant fermionic model is solvable, the resulting solution given in terms of two current algebras realizations.
