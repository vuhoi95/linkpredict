Title: An sl(2, R) current algebra from AdS_3 gravity
Authors: Steven G. Avery and Rohan R. Poojary and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: We provide a set of chiral boundary conditions for three-dimensional gravity that allow for asymptotic symmetries identical to those of two-dimensional induced gravity in light-cone gauge considered by Polyakov. These are the most general boundary conditions consistent with the boundary terms introduced by Compere, Song and Strominger recently. We show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra of our boundary conditions is an sl(2,R) current algebra with level given by c/6. The fully non-linear solution in Fefferman--Graham coordinates is also provided along with its charges.
