Title: Time dependent black holes and scalar hair
Authors: Sarah Chadburn and Ruth Gregory
Abstract: We show how to correctly account for scalar accretion onto black holes in scalar field models of dark energy by a consistent expansion in terms of a slow roll parameter. We find an exact solution for the scalar field within our Hubble volume which is regular on both black hole and cosmological event horizons, and compute the back reaction of the scalar on the black hole, calculating the resulting expansion of the black hole. Our results are independent of the relative size of black hole and cosmological event horizons. We comment on the implications for more general black hole accretion, and the no hair theorems.
