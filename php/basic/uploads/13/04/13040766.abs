Title: Quantum hypermultiplet moduli spaces in N=2 string vacua: a review
Authors: Sergei Alexandrov and Jan Manschot and Daniel Persson and Boris Pioline
Abstract: The hypermultiplet moduli space M_H in type II string theories compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold X is largely constrained by supersymmetry (which demands quaternion-K\"ahlerity), S-duality (which requires an isometric action of SL(2, Z)) and regularity. Mathematically, M_H ought to encode all generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants on X consistently with wall-crossing, modularity and homological mirror symmetry. We review recent progress towards computing the exact metric on M_H, or rather the exact complex contact structure on its twistor space.
