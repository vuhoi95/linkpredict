Title: Dynamical noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: S. A. Alavi and S. Abbaspour
Abstract: We study some basic and interesting quantum mechanical systems in dynamical noncommutative spaces in which the space- space commutation relations are position dependent. It is observed that the fundamental objects in the dynamical noncommutative space introduced here are stringlike. We show that the Stark effect can be employed to determine whether the noncommutativity of space is dynamical or non-dynamical. It appears that unlike non-dynamical case there is a fundamental energy $\dfrac{\tau\hbar^{2}}{m}$ in this dynamical space.}
