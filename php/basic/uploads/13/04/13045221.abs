Title: Cyclic Cosmology from the Little Rip
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Kevin J. Ludwick
Abstract: We revisit a cyclic cosmology scenario proposed in 2007 to examine whether its hypotheses can be sustained if the underlying big rip evolution, which was assumed there, is replaced by the recently proposed little rip. We show that the separation into causal patches at turnaround is generally valid for a little rip, and therefore conclude that the little rip is equally as suitable a basis for cyclicity as is the big rip.
