Title: Pure connection gravity at one loop: Instanton background
Authors: Kai Groh and Kirill Krasnov and Christian F. Steinwachs
Abstract: In the "pure connection" formulation General Relativity becomes a particular diffeomorphism invariant SL(2) gauge theory. Using this formalism, we compute the divergent contributions to the gravitational one-loop effective action. Calculations of the on-shell effective action simplify greatly if one specialises to an instanton background where only the anti-self-dual part of the Weyl curvature is non-vanishing. One of the most striking features of the connection formulation is that the (linearised) Euclidean action has a definite sign, unlike in the metric case. As in the metric GR, we find the logarithmically divergent contribution to consist of the volume and Euler character terms, but the arising numerical constants are different. However, the difference between the two results turns out to be always an integer. We explain this by noting that at one loop the connection and metric based quantum theories are closely related, the only difference being in a finite number of scalar modes.
