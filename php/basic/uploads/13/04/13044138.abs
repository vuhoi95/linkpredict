Title: Equivalence between Born-Infeld tachyon and effective real scalar field  theories for brane structures in warped geometry
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and O. Bertolami
Abstract: An equivalence between Born-Infeld and effective real scalar field theories for brane structures is built in some specific warped space-time scenarios. Once the equations of motion for tachyon fields related to the Born-Infeld action are written as first-order equations, a simple analytical connection with a particular class of real scalar field superpotentials can be found. This equivalence leads to the conclusion that, for a certain class of superpotentials, both systems can support identical thick brane solutions as well as brane structures described through localized energy densities, $T_{00}(y)$, in the $5^{th}$ dimension, $y$. Our results indicate that thick brane solutions realized by the Born-Infeld cosmology can be connected to real scalar field brane scenarios which can be used to effectively map the tachyon condensation mechanism.
