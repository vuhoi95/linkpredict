Title: Non-abelian Self-Dual String and M2-M5 Branes Intersection in  Supergravity
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pichet Vanichchapongjaroen
Abstract: We consider the non-abelian theory (http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1203.4224) for an arbitrary number $N_5$ of five-branes and construct self-dual string solution with an arbitrary $N_2$ unit of self-dual charges. This generalizes the previous solution of non-abelian self-dual string (http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1207.1095) of $N_5=2, N_2=1$. The radius-transverse distance relation describing the M2-branes spike, particularly its dependence on $N_2$ and $N_5$, is obtained and is found to agree precisely with the supergravity description of an intersecting M2-M5 branes system.
