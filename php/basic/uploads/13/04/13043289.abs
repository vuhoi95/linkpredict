Title: Uniqueness and Significance of Weak Solution of Non-perturbative  Renormalization Group Equation to Analyze Dynamical Chiral Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Ken-Ichi Aoki and Shin-Ichiro Kumamoto and Daisuke Sato
Abstract: We propose quite a new method of analyzing the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories. Starting with the non-perturbative renormalization group equation for the Wilsonian fermion potential, we define the weak solution of it in order to mathematically authorize solutions with singularity. The weak solution is obtained uniquely and it successfully predicts the physically correct vacuum, chiral condensates, dynamical mass, through its auto-convexizing power for the effective potential. Thus it works perfectly even for the first order phase transition in the finite density QCD.
