Title: Exploring Double Field Theory
Authors: David Geissbuhler and Diego Marques and Carmen Nunez and Victor Penas
Abstract: We present a flux formulation of Double Field Theory, in which geometric and non-geometric fluxes are dynamical and field-dependent. Gauge consistency imposes a set of quadratic constraints on the dynamical fluxes, which can be solved by truly double configurations. The constraints are related to generalized Bianchi Identities for (non-)geometric fluxes in the double space, sourced by (exotic) branes. Following previous constructions, we then obtain generalized connections, torsion and curvatures compatible with the consistency conditions. The strong constraint-violating terms needed to make contact with gauged supergravities containing duality orbits of non-geometric fluxes, systematically arise in this formulation.
