Title: Relativistic Landau-He-McKellar-Wilkens quantization and relativistic  bound states solutions for a Coulomb-like potential induced by the Lorentz  symmetry breaking effects
Authors: K. Bakke and H. Belich
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the relativistic Landau-He-McKellar-Wilkens quantization and relativistic bound states solutions for a Dirac neutral particle under the influence of a Coulomb-like potential induced by the Lorentz symmetry breaking effects. We present new possible scenarios of studying Lorentz symmetry breaking effects by fixing the space-like vector field background in special configurations. It is worth mentioning that we use the criterion for studying the violation of Lorentz symmetry is that the gauge symmetry should be preserved.
