Title: The calculation of the thermodynamic quantities of the Bardeen black  hole
Authors: Jingyun Man and Hongbo Cheng
Abstract: In this work we research on the thermodynamical properties of the Bardeen black holes. We compute the series of new thermodynamic quantities such as local temperature, heat capacity, off-shell free energy of this kind of black hole in detail. We further analyze the thermodynamical characteristics of the Bardeen black hole by varying its charge $q$ to check the existence and stability of the black hole.
