Title: The role of exterior Weyl fluids on compact stellar structures in  Randall-Sundrum gravity
Authors: J Ovalle and F Linares and A Pasqua and A Sotomayor
Abstract: In the context of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld, the minimal geometric deformation approach (MGD) is used to generate a new physically acceptable interior solution to Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric compact distribution. This new solution is used to elucidate the role of exterior Weyl stresses from bulk gravitons on compact stellar distributions. We found strong evidences showing that the exterior dark radiation ${\cal U}^+$ always increases both the pressure and the compactness of stellar structures, and that the exterior "dark pressure" ${\cal P}^+$ always reduces them.
