Title: Energy Density Bounds in Cubic Quasi-Topological Cosmology
Authors: U. Camara dS and A. A. Lima and G. M. Sotkov
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamical and causal consistency of cosmological models of the cubic Quasi-Topological Gravity (QTG) in four dimensions, as well as their phenomenological consequences. Specific restrictions on the maximal values of the matter densities are derived by requiring the apparent horizon's entropy to be a non-negative, non-decreasing function of time. The QTG counterpart of the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) gravity model of linear equation of state is studied in detail. An important feature of this particular QTG cosmological model is the new early-time acceleration period of the evolution of the Universe, together with the standard late-time acceleration present in the original EH model. The QTG correction to the causal diamond's volume is also calculated.
