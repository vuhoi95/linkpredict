Title: Quantum Holonomies based on the Lorentz-violating tensor background
Authors: K. Bakke and H. Belich
Abstract: We study geometric quantum phases corresponding to analogues of the Anandan quantum phase [J. Anandan, Phys. Lett. A {\bf138}, 347 (1989)] based on a possible scenario of the Lorentz symmetry violation background in a tensor background. We also show that quantum holonomies associated with the analogue of the Anandan quantum phase can be determined, and discuss a way of performing one-qubit quantum gates by analogy with the holonomic quantum computation [P. Zanardi and M. Rasetti, Phys. Lett. A {\bf264}, 94 (1999)].
