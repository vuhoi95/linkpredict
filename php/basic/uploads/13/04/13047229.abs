Title: Properties of Causal Holographic Information
Authors: Ben Freivogel and Benjamin Mosk
Abstract: Causal holographic information [1] is a variant of the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal for the entanglement entropy of a spatial region in the context of AdS/CFT, but with the bulk surface defined by causality rather than extremality. We investigate the properties of causal holographic information, focusing in particular on the universal coefficient of the logarithmically divergent term. We find that this coefficient contains a novel conformal invariant that cannot be written as an integral of local quantities. By considering higher curvature corrections in the bulk, we identify the coefficient of the a and c central charges in 4 dimensions. Finally, we speculate about which CFT quantity could correspond to the causal holographic information.
