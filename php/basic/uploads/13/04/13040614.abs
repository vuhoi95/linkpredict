Title: The BPS spectrum of the 4d N=2 SCFT's H_1, H_2, D_4, E_6, E_7, E_8
Authors: Sergio Cecotti and Michele Del Zotto
Abstract: Extending results of arXiv:1112.3984, we show that all rank 1 N=2 SCFT's in the sequence H_1, H_2, D_4 E_6, E_7, E_8 have canonical finite BPS chambers containing precisely 2 h(F)=12(Delta-1) hypermultiplets. The BPS spectrum of the canonical BPS chambers saturates the conformal central charge c, and satisfies some intriguing numerology.
