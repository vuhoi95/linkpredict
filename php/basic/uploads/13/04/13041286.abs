Title: String theories on warped AdS backgrounds and integrable deformations of  spin chains
Authors: Takashi Kameyama and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study integrable deformations of AdS/CFT by focusing upon three kinds of warped AdS_3 geometries, 1) space-like warped AdS_3, 2) time-like warped AdS_3 and 3) null warped AdS_3. These geometries are embedded into type IIB supergravity solutions and are regarded as consistent string backgrounds. By restricting the classical motion of strings on the warped AdS_3xS^1 subspace, the Landau-Lifshitz sigma models are derived by taking the fast-moving limit. The first two warped AdS_3 spaces correspond to anisotropic deformations of the sl(2) spin chain and the last one to Jordanian deformations. After taking the continuum limit of the deformed spin chains with coherent states, the resulting theories agree with the Landau-Lifshitz sigma models obtained from the string-theory side.
