Authors: Masahiro Nozaki and Tokiro Numasawa and Andrea Prudenziati and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement entropy for weakly excited states in conformal field theories by using the AdS/CFT. This is aimed at a first step to find a counterpart of Einstein equation in the CFT language. In particular, we point out that the entanglement entropy satisfies differential equations which directly correspond to the Einstein equation in several setups of AdS/CFT. We also define a quantity called entanglement density in higher dimensional field theories and study its dynamical property for weakly excited states in conformal field theories.
