Title: Holographic Gravitational Anomaly in First and Second Order  Hydrodynamics
Authors: Eugenio Megias and Francisco Pena-Benitez
Abstract: We compute, in the framework of the fluid/gravity correspondence, the transport coefficients of a relativistic fluid affected by chiral and gauge-gravitational anomalies, including external electromagnetic fields. The computation is performed at first and second order in the hydrodynamical expansion. We use a 5-dim holographic model with pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms in the action. We reproduce at first order previous results on the anomaly induced current of a magnetic field and a vortex in a relativistic fluid, and compute at second order the anomalous and non anomalous transport coefficients by using a Weyl covariant formalism. We find a dissipative and anomalous correction to the chiral magnetic conductivity due to the time dependence of the magnetic field. We also find a new contribution from the mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly to the shear waves dispersion relation. The role played by the chiral and gravitational anomalies in other transport coefficients is discussed.
