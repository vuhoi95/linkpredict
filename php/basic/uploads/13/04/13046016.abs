Abstract: We investigate new aspects related to the abelian gauge-Higgs model with the addition of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. We focus on one-loop quantum corrections to the photon and Higgs sectors due to spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry and show that new finite and definite Lorentz-breaking terms are induced. Specifically in the gauge sector, a CPT-even aether term is induced. Besides, aspects of the one-loop renormalization of the background vector dependent terms are discussed.
