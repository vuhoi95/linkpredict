Title: Neutrino Anisotropies after Planck
Authors: Martina Gerbino and Eleonora Di Valentino and Najla Said
Abstract: We present new constraints on the rest-frame sound speed, c_{eff}^2, and the viscosity parameter, c_{vis}^2, of the Cosmic Neutrino Background from the recent measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies provided by the Planck satellite. While broadly consistent with the expectations of c_{eff}^2=c_{vis}^2=1/3 in the standard scenario, the Planck dataset hints at a higher value of the viscosity parameter, with c_{vis}^2=0.60+/-0.18 at 68% c.l., and a lower value of the sound speed, with c_{eff}^2=0.304+/-0.013 at 68% c.l.. We find a correlation between the neutrino parameters and the lensing amplitude of the temperature power spectrum A_L. When the latter parameter is allowed to vary, we find a better consistency with the standard model with c_{vis}^2=0.51+/-0.22, c_{eff}^2=0.311+/-0.019 and A_L=1.08+/-0.18 at 68% c.l.. This result indicates that the anomalous large value of A_L measured by Planck could be connected to non-standard neutrino properties. Including additional datasets from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys and the Hubble Space Telescope constraint on the Hubble constant, we obtain c_{vis}^2=0.40+/-0.19, c_{eff}^2=0.319+/-0.019, and A_{L}=1.15+/-0.17 at 68% c.l.; including the lensing power spectrum, we obtain c_{vis}^2=0.50+/-0.19, c_{eff}^2=0.314+/-0.015, and A_L=1.025+/-0.076 at 68% c.l.. Finally, we investigate further degeneracies between the clustering parameters and other cosmological parameters.
