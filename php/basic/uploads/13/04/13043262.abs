Title: Superimposed Oscillations in Brane Inflation
Authors: Santiago Avila and Jerome Martin and Daniele Steer
Abstract: In canonical scalar field inflation, the Starobinsky model (with a linear potential but discontinuous slope) is remarkable in that though slow-roll is violated, both the power-spectrum and bi-spectrum can be calculated exactly analytically. The two-point function is characterised by different power on large and small scales, and a burst of small amplitude superimposed oscillations in between. Motivated by string-theory models with stuck branes, we extend this analysis to Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) inflation, for which generalised slow-roll is violated at the discontinuity and a rapid variation in the speed of sound c_s occurs. In an attempt to characterise the effect of non-linear kinetic terms on the oscillatory features of the primordial power-spectrum, we show that the resulting power spectrum has a shape and features which differ significantly from those of the standard Starobinsky model. In particular, the power-spectrum now takes very similar scale invariant values on large and small scales, while on intermediate scales it is characterised by much larger amplitude and higher frequency superimposed oscillations. We also show that calculating non-Gaussianities in this model is a complicated but interesting task since all terms in the cubic action now contribute. Investigating whether the superimposed oscillations could fit to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (for instance by explaining the large scale Planck anomalies) with, at the same time, small non-Gaussianities remains an intriguing and open possibility.
