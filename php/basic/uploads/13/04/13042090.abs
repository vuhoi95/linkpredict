Title: Matter-gravity scattering in the presence of spontaneous Lorentz  violation
Authors: R. V. Maluf and Victor Santos and W. T. Cruz and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: Considering quantum gravity within the framework of effective field theory, we investigated the consequences of spontaneous Lorentz violation for the gravitational potential. In particular, we focus our attention on the bumblebee models, in which the graviton couples to a vector $B_{\mu}$ that assumes a nonzero vacuum expectation value. The leading order corrections for the nonrelativistic potential are obtained from calculation of the scattering matrix of two scalar particles interacting gravitationally. These corrections imply anisotropic properties associated with the bumblebee background and also add a Darwin-like term for Newton's potential.
