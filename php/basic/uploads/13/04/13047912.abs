Abstract: In the last years quantum correlations received large attention as key ingredient in advanced quantum metrology protocols, in this letter we show that they provide even larger advantages when considering multiple-interferometer setups. In particular we demonstrate that the use of quantum correlated light beams in coupled interferometers leads to substantial advantages with respect to classical light, up to a noise-free scenario for the ideal lossless case. On the one hand, our results prompt the possibility of testing quantum gravity in experimental configurations affordable in current quantum optics laboratories and strongly improve the precision in "larger size experiments" such as the Fermilab holometer; on the other hand, they pave the way for future applications to high precision measurements and quantum metrology.
