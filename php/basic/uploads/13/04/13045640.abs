Title: A comprehensive view of cosmological Dark Side
Authors: S. Capozziello and G. Lambiase
Abstract: Recent cosmological and astrophysical observations point out that the Universe is in accelerating expansion and filled up with non-luminous matter. In order to explain the observed large scale structures and this accelerating behavior one needs a huge amounts of Dark Energy and Dark Matter. Although many attempts have been done, both at theoretical and experimental level, up to now there are several models proposed to explain such mysterious components. However, no final conclusion on the nature of dark components has been reached up to now so the question is completely open. In this paper, we review, with no claim of completeness, the recent results and ideas underlying Dark Energy and Dark Matter issues.
