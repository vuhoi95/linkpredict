Title: Modular forms in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Francis Brown and Oliver Schnetz
Abstract: The amplitude of a Feynman graph in Quantum Field Theory is related to the point-count over finite fields of the corresponding graph hypersurface. This article reports on an experimental study of point counts over F_q modulo q^3, for graphs up to loop order 10. It is found that many of them are given by Fourier coefficients of modular forms of weights <=8 and levels <=17.
