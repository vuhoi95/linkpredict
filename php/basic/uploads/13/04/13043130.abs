Title: Striped Order in AdS/CFT
Authors: Moshe Rozali and Darren Smyth and Evgeny Sorkin and Jared B. Stang
Abstract: We study the formation of inhomogeneous order in the Einstein-Maxwell-axion system, dual to a 2+1 dimensional field theory that exhibits a spontaneously generated current density, momentum density and modulated scalar operator. Below the critical temperature, the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole becomes unstable and stripes form in the bulk and on the boundary. The bulk geometry possesses striking geometrical features, including a modulated horizon that tends to pinch off as T -> 0. On a domain of fixed length, we find a second order phase transition to the striped solution in each of the grand canonical, canonical and microcanonical ensembles, with modulated charges that grow and saturate as we lower the temperature and descend into the inhomogeneous phase. For the black hole on an infinite domain, a similar second order transition occurs, and the width of the dominant stripe increases in the zero temperature limit.
