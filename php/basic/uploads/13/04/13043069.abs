Title: Graviweak Unification, Invisible Universe and Dark Energy

Abstract: We consider a Graviweak Unification model with the assumption of the existence of the hidden (invisible) sector of our Universe parallel to the visible world. This Hidden World (HW) is assumed to be a Mirror World (MW) with broken mirror parity. We start with a diffeomorphism invariant theory of a gauge field valued in a Lie algebra g, which is broken spontaneously to the direct sum of the spacetime Lorentz algebra and the Yang-Mills algebra: $\tilde {\mathfrak g} = {\mathfrak su}(2)^{(grav)}_L \oplus {\mathfrak su}(2)_L$ -- in the ordinary world, and $\tilde {\mathfrak g}' = {{\mathfrak su}(2)'}^{(grav)}_R \oplus {\mathfrak su}(2)'_R$ -- in the hidden world. Using an extension of the Plebanski action for general relativity, we recover the actions for gravity, SU(2) Yang-Mills and Higgs fields in both (visible and invisible) sectors of the Universe, and also the total action. After symmetry breaking, all physical constants, including the Newton's constants, cosmological constants, Yang-Mills couplings, and other parameters, are determined by a single parameter $g$ presented in the initial action, and by the Higgs VEVs. The Dark Energy problem of this model predicts a too large supersymmetric breaking scale ($\sim 10^{10}-10^{12}$ GeV), which is not within the reach of the LHC experiments.
