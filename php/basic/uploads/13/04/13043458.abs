Title: Decoupling of High Dimension Operators from the Low Energy Sector in  Holographic Models
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Jared Kaplan and Emanuel Katz and Lisa Randall
Abstract: We study the decoupling of high dimension operators from the the description of the low-energy spectrum in theories where conformal symmetry is broken by a single scale, which we refer to as `broken CFTs'. Holographic duality suggests that this decoupling occurs in generic backgrounds. We show how the decoupling of high mass states in the (d+1)-dimensional bulk relates to the decoupling of high energy states in the d-dimensional broken CFT. In other words, we explain why both high dimension operators and high mass states in the CFT decouple from the low-energy physics of the mesons and glueballs. In many cases, the decoupling can occur exponentially fast in the dimension of the operator. Holography motivates a new kind of form factor proportional to the two point function between broken CFT operators with very different scaling dimensions. This new notion of decoupling can provide a systematic justification for holographic descriptions of QCD and condensed matter systems with only light degrees of freedom in the bulk.
