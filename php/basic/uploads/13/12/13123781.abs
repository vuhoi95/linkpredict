Title: Remnants, fermions' tunnelling and effects of quantum gravity
Authors: Deyou Chen and Qingquan Jiang and Peng Wang and Haitang Yang
Abstract: The remnants are investigated by fermions' tunnelling from a 4-dimensional charged dilatonic black hole and a 5-dimensional black string. Based on the generalized uncertainty principle, effects of quantum gravity are taken into account. The quantum numbers of the emitted fermions affects the Hawking temperatures. For the black hole, the quantum gravity correction slows down the increase of the temperature, which leads to the remnant left in the evaporation. For the black string, the existence of the remnant is determined by the quantum gravity correction and effects of the extra compact dimension.
