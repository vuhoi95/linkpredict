Title: Generalized Randall-Sundrum model with a single thick brane
Authors: Aqeel Ahmed and Lukasz Dulny and Bohdan Grzadkowski
Abstract: A generalized version of the Randall-Sundrum model-2 with different cosmological constants on each side of a brane has been discussed. A possibility of replacing the singular brane by a configuration of a scalar field has been also considered, the Einstein equations for this setup were solved and stability of the solution discussed. It has been shown that under mild assumptions the relation between cosmological constants and the brane tension obtained in the brane limit does not depend on the particular choice of the regularizing profile of the scalar field.
