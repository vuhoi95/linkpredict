Abstract: Both cosmological expansion and black holes are ubiquitous features of our observable Universe, yet exact solutions connecting the two have remained elusive. To this end, we study self-gravitating classical fields within dynamical spherically symmetric solutions that can describe black holes in an expanding universe. After attempting a perturbative approach of a known black-hole solution with scalar hair, we show by exact methods that the unique scalar field action with first-order derivatives that can source shear-free expansion around a black hole requires noncanonical kinetic terms. The resulting action is an incompressible limit of k-essence, otherwise known as the cuscuton theory, and the spacetime it describes is the McVittie metric. We further show that this solution is an exact solution to the vacuum Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with anisotropic Weyl symmetry.
