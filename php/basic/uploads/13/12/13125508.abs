Title: Thermodynamics of Soft Wall Model in Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet  Gravity
Authors: Shobhit Sachan and Sanjay Siwach
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and confinement/deconfinement transition in soft wall model of QCD with Gauss-Bonnet corrections. The two geometries, charged AdS black hole and thermally charged AdS are studied with Gauss-Bonnet corrections. The difference in grand potentials in the two geometries is calculated up to first order in Gauss-Bonnet coupling. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling modifies the transition temperature of the system but qualitative features remain unchanged. We plot the chemical potential versus transition temperature for different values of Gauss-Bonnet couplings. We find that there exist a point in $\mu-T$ plane where lines with different value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling cross each other. This point may be the onset of the transition from first order to cross over behaviour. We compare our results with the hard wall model.
