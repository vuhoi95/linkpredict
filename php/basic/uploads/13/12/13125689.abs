Title: An approach to the quantization of black-hole quasi-normal modes
Authors: Soham Pal and Karthik Rajeev and S. Shankaranarayanan
Abstract: In this work we derive the asymptotic quasi-normal modes of a BTZ black hole using a quantum field theoretic Lagrangian. The BTZ black hole is a very popular system in the context of $2+1$-dimensional quantum gravity. However to our knowledge the quasi-normal modes of the BTZ black hole have been studied only in the classical domain. Here we show a way to quantize the quasi-normal modes of the BTZ black hole by mapping it to the Bateman-Feschbach-Tikochinsky oscillator and the Caldirola-Kanai oscillator. We have also discussed a couple of other black hole potentials to which this method can be applied
