Title: Holographic RÃ©nyi entropy for CFT with $W$ symmetry
Authors: Bin Chen and Jiang Long and Jia-ju Zhang
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the holographic R\'enyi entropy of two disjoint intervals on complex plane with small cross ratio $x$ for conformal field theory with $W$ symmetry in the ground state, which could be dual to a higher spin AdS$_3$ gravity. We focus on the cases of $W_3$ and $W_4$ symmetries. In order to see the nontrivial contributions from the $W$ fields, we calculate the R\'enyi entropy in the expansion of $x$ to order $x^8$ in both the gravity and the CFT sides. In the gravity side the classical contributions to the entanglement entropy is still given by the Ryu-Takayanagi area formula under the reasonable assumption, while the 1-loop quantum corrections have to take into account of the contributions not only from massless gravitons, but also from massless higher spin fields. In the CFT side we still use the operator product expansion of twist operators in the small interval limit, but now we need to consider the quasiprimary fields constructed from $W$ fields, besides the ones from Virasoro Verma module. In the large central charge limit, we obtain the classical, 1-loop, 2-loop, and 3-loop parts of the R\'enyi entropy. The classical and 1-loop results in the gravity and the CFT sides are in exact match. This confirms the higher spin gravity/CFT correspondence, and also supports the holographic computation of R\'enyi entanglement entropy, including the quantum correction, in both the AdS$_3$ gravity and the higher spin AdS$_3$ gravity.
