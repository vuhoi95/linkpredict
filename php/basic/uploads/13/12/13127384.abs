Title: High Scale Mixing Unification for Dirac Neutrinos
Authors: Gauhar Abbas and Saurabh Gupta and G. Rajasekaran and Rahul Srivastava
Abstract: Starting with high scale mixing unification hypothesis, we investigate the renormalization group evolution of mixing parameters and masses for Dirac type neutrinos. Following this hypothesis, the PMNS mixing angles and phase are taken to be identical to the CKM ones at a unifying high scale. Then, they are evolved to a low scale using renormalization-group equations. The notable feature of this hypothesis is that renormalization group evolution with quasi-degenerate mass pattern can explain largeness of leptonic mixing angles even for Dirac neutrinos. The renormalization group evolution "naturally" results in a non-zero and small value of leptonic mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. One of the important predictions of this work is that the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is non-maximal and lies only in the second octant. We also derive constraints on the allowed parameter range for the SUSY breaking and unification scales for which this hypothesis works. The results are novel and can be tested by present and future experiments.
