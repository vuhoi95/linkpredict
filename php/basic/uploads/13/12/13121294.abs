Title: 5D partition functions, q-Virasoro systems and integrable spin-chains
Authors: Fabrizio Nieri and Sara Pasquetti and Filippo Passerini and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We analyze N = 1 theories on S5 and S4 x S1, showing how their partition functions can be written in terms of a set of fundamental 5d holomorphic blocks. We demonstrate that, when the 5d mass parameters are analytically continued to suitable values, the S5 and S4 x S1 partition functions degenerate to those for S3 and S2 x S1. We explain this mechanism via the recently proposed correspondence between 5d partition functions and correlators with underlying q-Virasoro symmetry. From the q-Virasoro 3-point functions, we axiomatically derive a set of associated reflection coefficients, and show they can be geometrically interpreted in terms of Harish-Chandra c-functions for quantum symmetric spaces. We then link these particular c-functions to the types appearing in the Jost functions encoding the asymptotics of the scattering in integrable spin chains, obtained taking different limits of the XYZ model to XXZ-type.
