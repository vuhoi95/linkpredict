Abstract: We investigate the presence of twinlike models in theories described by several real scalar fields. We focus on the first-order formalism, and we show how to build distinct scalar field theories that support the same extended solution, with the same energy density and the very same linear stability. The results are valid for two distinct classes of generalized models, that include the standard model and cover a diversity of generalized models of current interest in high energy physics.
