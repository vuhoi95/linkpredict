Title: AdS/CFT and Landau Fermi liquids
Authors: Richard A. Davison and Mikhail Goykhman and Andrei Parnachev
Abstract: We study the field theory dual to a charged gravitational background in which the low temperature entropy scales linearly with the temperature. We exhibit the existence of a sound mode which is described by hydrodynamics, even at energies much larger than the temperature, and explain how this, and other properties of the field theory, are consistent with those of a (3+1)-dimensional Landau Fermi liquid, finely tuned to the Pomeranchuk critical point. We also discuss how one could engineer a higher-derivative gravitational Lagrangian which reproduces the correct low temperature behavior of shear viscosity in a generic Landau Fermi liquid.
