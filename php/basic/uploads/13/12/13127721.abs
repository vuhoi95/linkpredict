Title: Variations of $Î±$ and $G$ from nonlinear multidimensional gravity
Authors: K. A. Bronnikov and M. V. Skvortsova
Abstract: To explain the recently reported large-scale spatial variations of the fine structure constant $\alpha$, we apply some models of curvature-nonlinear multidimensional gravity. Under the reasonable assumption of slow changes of all quantities as compared with the Planck scale, the original theory reduces to a multi-scalar field theory in four dimensions. On this basis, we consider different variants of isotropic cosmological models in both Einstein and Jordan conformal frames. One of the models turns out to be equally viable in both frames, but in the Jordan frame the model predicts simultaneous variations of $\alpha$ and the gravitational constant $G$, equal in magnitude. Large-scale small inhomogeneous perturbations of these models allow for explaining the observed spatial distribution of $\alpha$ values.
