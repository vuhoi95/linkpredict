Title: Quantum Computation and Non-Abelian Statistics in Chern-Simons-Higgs  Theory
Authors: J. C. Brozeguini and E. C. Marino
Abstract: We naturally obtain the NOT and CNOT logic gates, which are key pieces of quantum computing algorithms, in the framework of the non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory in two spatial dimensions. For that, we consider the anyonic quantum vortex topological excitations occurring in this system and show that self-adjoint (Majorana-like) combinations of these vortices and anti-vortices have in general non-Abelian statistics. The associated unitary monodromy braiding matrices become the required logic gates in the special case when the vortex spin is $s=1/4$. We explicitly construct the vortex field operators, show that they carry both magnetic flux and charge and obtain their euclidean correlation functions by using the method of quantization of topological excitations, which is based on the order-disorder duality. These correlators are in general multivalued, the number of sheets being determined by the vortex spin. This, by its turn, is proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field and therefore can be tuned both by the free parameters of the Higgs potential and the temperature.
