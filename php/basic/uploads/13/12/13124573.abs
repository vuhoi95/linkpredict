Title: Dark Strings and their Couplings to the Standard Model
Authors: Jeffrey M. Hyde and Andrew J. Long and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We consider the Standard Model extended by a hidden sector U(1)_X symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the TeV scale by the vacuum expectation value of an additional scalar field. We study "dark string" solutions in this model and their properties due to the Higgs portal and gauge kinetic mixing operators. We find that dark strings effectively interact with Higgs and Z bosons by linear couplings, and with leptons and baryons via Aharonov-Bohm couplings, thus possibly leading to new cosmological constraints on dark matter models with spontaneously broken extra U(1) symmetry factors.
