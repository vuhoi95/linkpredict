Title: Cosmology with non-minimal coupled gravity: inflation and perturbation  analysis
Authors: F. Darabi and A. Parsiya
Abstract: We study a scalar-tensor cosmological model where the Einstein tensor is non-minimally coupled to the free scalar field dynamics. Using FRW metric, we investigate the behavior of scale factor for vacuum, matter and dark energy dominated eras. Especially, we focus on the inflationary behavior at early universe. Moreover, we study the perturbation analysis of this model in order to confront the inflation under consideration with the observational results.
