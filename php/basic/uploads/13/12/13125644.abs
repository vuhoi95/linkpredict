Title: Self-dual String and Higher Instanton Solutions
Authors: Sam Palmer and Christian Saemann
Abstract: We present and discuss explicit solutions to the non-abelian self-dual string equation as well as to the non-abelian self-duality equation in six dimensions. These solutions are generalizations of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole and the BPST instanton to higher gauge theory. We expect that these solutions are relevant to the effective description of M2- and M5-branes.
