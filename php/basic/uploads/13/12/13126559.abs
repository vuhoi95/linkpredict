Title: Cosmology with non-minimally coupled Yang--Mills field
Authors: Evgeny A. Davydov and Dmitry V. Gal'tsov
Abstract: We discuss cosmological model with homogeneous and isotropic Yang-Mills field non-minimally coupled to gravity through an effective mass term. In this model conformal symmetry is violated which leads to possibility of inflationary expansion. Parameters of non-minimal coupling have relatively ``natural'' values in the regime of sufficiently long acceleration stage.
