Title: Thermodynamics of Lovelock black holes with a nonminimal scalar field
Authors: Francisco Correa and Mokhtar Hassaine
Abstract: We source the Lovelock gravity theories indexed by an integer k and fixed by requiring a unique anti-de Sitter vacuum with a self-interacting nonminimal scalar field in arbitrary dimension d. For each inequivalent Lovelock gravity theory indexed by the integer k, we establish the existence of a two-parametric self-interacting potential that permits to derive a class of black hole solutions with planar horizon for any arbitrary value of the nonminimal coupling parameter. In the thermodynamical analysis of the solution, we show that, once regularized the Euclidean action, the mass contribution coming form the gravity side exactly cancels, order by order, the one arising from the matter part yielding to a vanishing mass. This result is in accordance with the fact that the entropy of the solution, being proportional to the lapse function evaluated at the horizon, also vanishes. Consequently, the integration constant appearing in the solution is interpreted as a sort of hair which turns out to vanish at high temperature.
