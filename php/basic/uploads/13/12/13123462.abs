Title: Matters on a moving brane
Authors: Tomi Sebastian Koivisto and Danielle Elizabeth Wills
Abstract: A novel generalisation of the Dirac-Born-Infeld string scenario is described. It is shown that matter residing on the moving brane is dark and has the so-called disformal coupling to gravity. This gives rise to cosmologies where dark matter stems from the oscillations of the open strings along the brane and the transverse oscillations result in dark energy. Furthermore, due to a new screening mechanism that conceals the fifth force from local experiments, one may even entertain the possibility that the visible sector is also moving along the extra dimensions.
