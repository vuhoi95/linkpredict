Title: Kinetic theory of chiral relativistic plasmas and energy density of  their gauge collective excitations
Authors: Cristina Manuel and Juan M. Torres-Rincon
Abstract: We use the recently developed kinetic theory with Berry curvature to describe the fermions and antifermions of a chiral relativistic plasma. We check that this transport approach allows to reproduce the chiral anomaly equation of relativistic quantum field theory at finite temperature. We also check that it allows to describe the anomalous gauge polarization tensor that appears in the Hard Thermal (and/or Dense) effective field theory. We also construct an energy density associated to the gauge collective modes of the chiral relativistic plasma, valid in the case of small couplings or weak fields, which can be the basis for the study of their dynamical evolution.
