Title: Living with the Wrong Sign
Authors: Patrick Cooper and Sergei Dubovsky and Ali Mohsen
Abstract: We describe a UV complete asymptotically fragile Lorentz-invariant theory exhibiting superluminal signal propagation. Its low energy effective action contains "wrong" sign higher dimensional operators. Nevertheless, the theory gives rise to an S-matrix, which is defined at all energies. As expected for a non-local theory, the corresponding scattering amplitudes are not exponentially bounded on the physical sheet, but otherwise are healthy. We study some of the physical consequences of this S-matrix.
