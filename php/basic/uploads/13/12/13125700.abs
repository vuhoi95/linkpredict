Title: Three-dimensional fractional-spin gravity
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Per Sundell and Mauricio Valenzuela
Abstract: Using Wigner-deformed Heisenberg oscillators, we construct 3D Chern--Simons models consisting of fractional-spin fields coupled to higher-spin gravity and internal non-abelian gauge fields. The gauge algebras consist of Lorentz-tensorial Blencowe-Vasiliev higher-spin algebras and compact internal algebras intertwined by infinite-dimensional generators in lowest-weight representations of the Lorentz algebra with fractional spin. In integer or half-integer non-unitary cases, there exist truncations to gl(N,N +/- 1) or gl(N|N +/- 1) models. In all non-unitary cases, the internal gauge fields can be set to zero. At the semi-classical level, the fractional-spin fields are either Grassmann even or odd. The action requires the enveloping-algebra representation of the deformed oscillators, while their Fock-space representation suffices on-shell.
