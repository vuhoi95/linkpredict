Title: Quantization of the electromagnetic field outside high-dimensional  static black holes and its application outside the Gauss-Bonnet black hole
Authors: Ming Zhang and Zhan-Ying Yang and Rui-Hong Yue
Abstract: In present paper, we investigated the quantization of an electromagnetic field in the background of static spherically symmetric d-dimensional spacetime in the Boulware vacuum. We have also calculated the response rate of a static charge outside both d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole and the GB black hole in the low-frequency regime, which can be expressed as the summation of hypergeometric functions.
