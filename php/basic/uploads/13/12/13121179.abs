Title: Universality and the QCD Anderson Transition
Authors: Matteo Giordano and Tamas G. Kovacs and Ferenc Pittler
Abstract: We study the Anderson-type transition previously found in the spectrum of the QCD quark Dirac operator in the high temperature, quark-gluon plasma phase. Using finite size scaling for the unfolded level spacing distribution, we show that in the thermodynamic limit there is a genuine mobility edge, where the spectral statistics changes from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson statistics in a non-analytic way. We determine the correlation length critical exponent, $\nu$, and find that it is compatible with that of the unitary Anderson model.
