Title: Warm-viscous inflation model on the brane in the light of BICEP2
Authors: M. R. Setare and V. Kamali
Abstract: In the present work warm inflationary universe model with viscous pressure on the brane in high-dissipation regime is studied. We derive a condition which is required for this model to be realizable in slow-roll approximation. We also present analytic expressions for density perturbation and amplitude of tensor perturbation in longitudinal gauge. General expressions of tensor-to-scalar ratio, scalar spectral index and its running are obtained. We develop our model by using chaotic potential, the characteristics of this model are calculated for two specific cases: 1- Dissipative parameter $\Gamma$ and bulk viscous parameter $\zeta$ are constant parameters. 2- Dissipative parameter as a function of scalar field $\phi$ and bulk viscous parameter as a function of radiation-matter mixture energy density $\rho$. The parameters of the model are restricted by WMAP9, Planck and BICEP2 observational data.
