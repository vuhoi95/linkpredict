Title: On the Classification of 6D SCFTs and Generalized ADE Orbifolds
Authors: Jonathan J. Heckman and David R. Morrison and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We study (1,0) and (2,0) 6D superconformal field theories (SCFTs) that can be constructed in F-theory. Quite surprisingly, all of them involve an orbifold singularity C^2 / G with G a discrete subgroup of U(2). When G is a subgroup of SU(2), all discrete subgroups are allowed, and this leads to the familiar ADE classification of (2,0) SCFTs. For more general U(2) subgroups, the allowed possibilities for G are not arbitrary and are given by certain generalizations of the A- and D-series. These theories should be viewed as the minimal 6D SCFTs. We obtain all other SCFTs by bringing in a number of E-string theories and/or decorating curves in the base by non-minimal gauge algebras. In this way we obtain a vast number of new 6D SCFTs, and we conjecture that our construction provides a full list.
