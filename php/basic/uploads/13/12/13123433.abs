Title: Analogues of Lusztig's higher order relations for the q-Onsager algebra
Authors: P. Baseilhac and T. T. Vu
Abstract: Let $A,A^*$ be the generators of the $q-$Onsager algebra. Analogues of Lusztig's $r-th$ higher order relations are proposed. In a first part, based on the properties of tridiagonal pairs of $q-$Racah type which satisfy the defining relations of the $q-$Onsager algebra, higher order relations are derived for $r$ generic. The coefficients entering in the relations are determined from a two-variable polynomial generating function. In a second part, it is conjectured that $A,A^*$ satisfy the higher order relations previously obtained. The conjecture is proven for $r=2,3$. For $r$ generic, using an inductive argument recursive formulae for the coefficients are derived. The conjecture is checked for several values of $r\geq 4$. Consequences for coideal subalgebras and integrable systems with boundaries at $q$ a root of unity are pointed out.
