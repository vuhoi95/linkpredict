Title: Electrodynamics Modified by Some Dimension-five Lorentz Violating  Interactions: Radiative Corrections
Authors: Shan-quan Lan and Feng Wu
Abstract: We study radiative corrections to massless quantum electrodynamics modified by two dimension-five LV interactions $\bar{\Psi} \gamma^{\mu} b'^{\nu} F_{\mu\nu}\Psi$ and $\bar{\Psi}\gamma^{\mu}b^{\nu} \tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} \Psi$ in the framework of effective field theories. All divergent one-particle-irreducible Feynman diagrams are calculated at one-loop order and several related issues are discussed. It is found that massless quantum electrodynamics modified by the interaction $\bar{\Psi} \gamma^{\mu} b'^{\nu} F_{\mu\nu}\Psi$ alone is one-loop renormalizable and the result can be understood on the grounds of symmetry. In this context the one-loop Lorentz-violating beta function is derived and the corresponding running coefficients are obtained.
