Title: D-instanton probe and the enhan√ßon mechanism from a quiver gauge  theory
Authors: Eduardo Conde and Micha Moskovic
Abstract: We study the $\mathcal N=2$ field theory realized by D3-branes on the ${\mathbb C}^2/{\mathbb Z}_2$ orbifold. The dual supergravity solution exhibits a repulson singularity cured by the enhancon mechanism. By comparing the open and closed string descriptions of a probe D-instanton, we can compute the exact non-perturbative profile of the supergravity twisted field, which determines the supergravity background. We then show how the non-trivial IR physics of the field theory translates into the stringy effects that give rise to the enhancon mechanism and the associated excision procedure.
