Title: Persistent Superconductor Currents in Holographic Lattices
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Akihiro Ishibashi and Kengo Maeda
Abstract: We consider a persistent superconductor current along the direction with no translational symmetry in a holographic gravity model. Incorporating a lattice structure into the model, we numerically construct novel solutions of hairy charged stationary black brane with momentum/rotation along the latticed direction. The lattice structure prevents the horizon from rotating, and the total momentum is only carried by matter fields outside the black brane horizon. This is consistent with the black hole rigidity theorem, and suggests that in dual field theory with lattices, superconductor currents are made up by "composite" fields, rather than "fractionalized" degrees of freedom. We also show that our solutions are consistent with the superfluid hydrodynamics.
