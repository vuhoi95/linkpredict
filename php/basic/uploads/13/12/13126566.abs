Title: The description of phase transition of Bardeen black hole in the  Ehrenfest scheme
Authors: Jingyun Man and Hongbo Cheng
Abstract: The phase transition of a Bardeen black hole is studied by considering Ehrenfest's equations. The thermodynamic variables such as entropy, potential and heat capacity are calculated from the first law of thermodynamics for black holes. That no discontinuity in entropy and potential of the black holes means that the first order phase transition will not generate for the Bardeen black holes. However, the divergence of heat capacity at constant potential and satisfaction of the Ehrenfest's equations indicates that the second order phase transition of Bardeen black hole will appear.
