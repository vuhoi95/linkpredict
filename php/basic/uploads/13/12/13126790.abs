Title: Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem and its stability in f(R) gravity
Authors: Anne Marie Nzioki and Rituparno Goswami and Peter K. S. Dunsby
Abstract: We prove a Jebsen-Birkhoff like theorem for f(R) theories of gravity in order to to find the necessary conditions required for the existence of the Schwarzschild solution in these theories and demonstrate that the rigidity of such solutions of f(R) gravity is valid even in the perturbed scenario.
