Abstract: In brane world models, combining the extra dimensional field modes with the standard four dimensional ones yields interesting physical consequences that have been proved from high energy physics to cosmology. Even some low energy phenomena have been considered along these lines to set bounds on the brane model parameters. In this work we extend to the gravitational realm a previous result which gave finite electromagnetic and scalar potentials and self energies for a source looking pointlike to an observer sitting in a 4D Minkowski subspace of the single brane of a Randall-Sundrum spacetime including compact dimensions. We calculate here the gravitational field for the same type of source by solving the linearized Einstein equations. Remarkably, it turns out to be also non singular. Moreover, we use gravitational experimental results of the Cavendish type and the Parameterized Post Newtonian (PPN) coefficients, to look for admissible values of the brane model parameters. The anti de Sitter radius hereby obtained is concordant with previous results based on Lamb shift in hydrogen. However, the resulting PPN parameters lie outside the acceptable value domain.
