Title: The Schwinger pair production rate in confining theories via holography
Authors: Daisuke Kawai and Yoshiki Sato and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study the Schwinger pair production in confining theories. The production rate in an external electric field E is numerically evaluated by using the holographic description. There exist two kinds of critical values of the electric field, i) E=E_c, above which there is no potential barrier and particles are freely generated, ii) E=E_s, below which the confining string tension dominates the electric field and the pair production does not occur. We argue the universal exponents associated with the critical behaviors.
