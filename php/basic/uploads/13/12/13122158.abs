Title: Geometric Representation of Interacting Non-Relativistic Open Strings  using Extended Objects
Authors: P. J. Arias and N. Bolivar and E. Fuenmayor and L. Leal
Abstract: Non-relativistic charged open strings coupled with Abelian gauge fields are quantized in a geometric representation that generalizes the Loop Representation. The model consists of open-strings interacting through a Kalb-Ramond field in four dimensions. The geometric representation proposed uses lines and surfaces that can be interpreted as an extension of the picture of Faraday's lines of classical electromagnetism. This representation results to be consistent, provided the coupling constant (the "charge" of the string) is quantized. The Schr\"odinger equation in this representation is also presented.
