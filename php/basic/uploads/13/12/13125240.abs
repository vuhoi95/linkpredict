Title: On the coset duals of extended higher spin theories
Authors: Constantin Candu and Carl Vollenweider
Abstract: We study the holographic duality between the M x M matrix extension of Vasiliev higher spin theories on AdS3 and the large N limit of SU(N+M)/SU(N) x U(1) type cosets. We present a simplified proof for the agreement of the spectra and clarify the relation between this duality and the version in which the cosets are replaced by Kazama-Suzuki models of Grassmannian type.
