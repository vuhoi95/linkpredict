Title: Quantum Systems based upon Galois Fields: from Sub-quantum to  Super-quantum Correlations
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Zachary Lewis and Djordje Minic and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: In this talk we describe our recent work on discrete quantum theory based on Galois fields. In particular, we discuss how discrete quantum theory sheds new light on the foundations of quantum theory and we review an explicit model of super-quantum correlations we have constructed in this context. We also discuss the larger questions of the origins and foundations of quantum theory, as well as the relevance of super-quantum theory for the quantum theory of gravity.
