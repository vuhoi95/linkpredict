Title: An alternative to anti-branes and O-planes?
Authors: Ulf Danielsson and Giuseppe Dibitetto
Abstract: In this paper we consider type IIA compactifications in the isotropic Z2 x Z2 orbifold with a flux-induced perturbative superpotential combined with non-perturbative effects. Without requiring the presence of O-planes, and simply having D6-branes as local sources, we demonstrate the existence of de Sitter (dS) critical points, where the non-perturbative contributions to the cosmological constant have negligible size. We note, however, that these solutions generically have tachyons. By means of a more systematic search, we are able to find two examples of stable dS vacua with no need for anti-branes or O-planes, which, however, exhibit important non-perturbative corrections. The examples that we present turn out to remain stable even after opening up the fourteen non-isotropic moduli.
