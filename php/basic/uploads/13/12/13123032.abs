Title: Noncommutative information is revealed from Hawking radiation as  tunneling
Authors: Baocheng Zhang and Qing-yu Cai and Ming-sheng Zhan and Li You
Abstract: We revisit the tunneling process from a Schwarzschild black hole in the noncommutative spacetime and obtain the non-thermal tunneling probability. In such non-thermal spectrum, the correlations are discovered, which can carry the information about the noncommutativity. Thus this enlightens a way to find the noncommutative information in the Hawking radiation. The entropy is also shown to be conserved in the whole radiation process, which implies that the unitarity is held even for the Hawking radiation from noncommutative black holes.
