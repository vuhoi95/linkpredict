Title: BTZ Black Hole Entropy and the Turaev-Viro model
Authors: Marc Geiller and Karim Noui
Abstract: We show the explicit agreement between the derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Euclidean BTZ black hole from the point of view of spin foam models and canonical quantization. This is done by considering a graph observable (corresponding to the black hole horizon) in the Turaev-Viro state sum model, and then analytically continuing the resulting partition function to negative values of the cosmological constant.
