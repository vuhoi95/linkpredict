Title: Non-Linear Resonance in Relativistic Preheating
Authors: Bret Underwood and Yunxiao Zhai
Abstract: Inflation in the early Universe can be followed by a brief period of preheating, resulting in rapid and non-equilibrium particle production through the dynamics of parametric resonance. However, the parametric resonance effect is very sensitive to the linearity of the reheating sector. Additional self-interactions in the reheating sector, such as non-canonical kinetic terms like the DBI Lagrangian, may enhance or frustrate the parametric resonance effect of preheating. In the case of a DBI reheating sector, preheating is described by parametric resonance of a damped relativistic harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we illustrate how the non-linear terms in the relativistic oscillator shut down the parametric resonance effect. This limits the effectiveness of preheating when there are non-linear self-interactions.
