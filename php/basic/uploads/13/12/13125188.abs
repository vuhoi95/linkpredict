Title: Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Actions in Three-dimensional Projective  Superspaces
Authors: Masato Arai and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We construct an action for the superconformal Chern-Simons theory with non-Abelian gauge groups in three-dimensional N=3 projective superspace. We propose a Lagrangian given by the product of the function of the tropical multiplet, that represents the N=3 vector multiplet, and the O(-1,1) multiplet. We show how the tropical multiplet is embedded into the O(-1,1) multiplet by comparing our Lagrangian with the Chern- Simons Lagrangian in the N=2 superspace. We also discuss N=4 generalization of the action.
