Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan and F. Pourasadollah
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a heavy quark under the plasmas correspond to three dimensional hairy black holes. We utilize the AdS/CFT correspondence to study the holographic Brownian motion of this particle in different kinds of hairy black holes. For uncharged black hole at low frequency limit we derive analytic expressions for correlation functions and response functions and verify that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds in the presence of a scalar field in the metric background. In the case of charged black hole, we think that the results are similar to what derived for uncharged black hole.
