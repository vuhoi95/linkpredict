Title: Structural aspects of loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology  from an algebraic perspective
Authors: Alexander Stottmeister and Thomas Thiemann
Abstract: We comment on structural properties of the algebras $\mathfrak{A}_{LQG/LQC}$ underlying loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology, especially the representation theory, relating the appearance of the (dynamically induced) superselection structure ($\theta$-sectors) in loop quantum cosmology to recently proposed representations with non-degenerate background geometries in loop quantum gravity with Abelian structure group. To this end, we review and employ the concept of extending a given (observable) algebra with possibly non-trivial centre to a (charged) field algebra with (global) gauge group.We also interpret the results in terms of the geometry of the structure group G. Furthermore, we analyze the Koslowski-Sahlmann representations with non-degenerate background in the case of a non-Abelian structure group. We find that these representations can be interpreted from two different, though related, points view: Either, the standard algebras of loop quantum gravity need to be extended by a (possibly) central term, or the elementary flux vector fields need to acquire a shift related to the (classical) background to make these representations well-defined. Both perspectives are linked by the fact that the background shift is not an automorphism of the algebras, but rather an affine transformation. Finally, we show how similar algebraic mechanisms, which are used to explain the breaking of chiral symmetry and the occurrence of $\theta$-vacua in quantum field theory, extend to loop quantum gravity. Thus, opening a path for the discussion of these questions in loop quantum gravity.
