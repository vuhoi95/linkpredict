Title: Higher order relations for ADE-type generalized q-Onsager algebras
Authors: P. Baseilhac and T. T. Vu
Abstract: Let $\{A_j|j=0,1,...,rank(g)\}$ be the fundamental generators of the generalized $q-$Onsager algebra $\cal O_{q}(\widehat{g})$ introduced in \cite{BB1}, where $\widehat{g}$ is a simply-laced affine Lie algebra. New relations between certain monomials of the fundamental generators - indexed by the integer $r\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ - are conjectured. These relations can be seen as deformed analogues of Lusztig's $r-$th higher order $q-$Serre relations associated with ${\cal U}_q({\widehat g})$, which are recovered as special cases. The relations are proven for $r\leq 5$. For $r$ generic, several supporting evidences are presented.
