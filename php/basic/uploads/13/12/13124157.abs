Title: 126 GeV Higgs Boson Associated with D-term Triggered Dynamical  Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: H. Itoyama and Nobuhito Maru
Abstract: Continuing with our previous work on D-term triggered dynamical supersymmetry breaking, we consider a system in which our generic N=1 action is minimally extended to include the pair of Higgs doublet superfields charged under the overall U(1) as well as mu and B mu terms. The gauge group is taken to be SU(3)_C times SU(2)_L times U(1)_Y times U(1). We point out, among other things, that the Higgs mass less than the Z-boson mass at tree level can be pushed up to be around 126 GeV by D-term contributions of the overall U(1). This is readily realized by taking a U(1) gauge coupling of O(1).
