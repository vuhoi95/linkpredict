Title: Infinite Statistics Condensate as a Model of Dark Matter
Authors: Zahra Ebadi and Behrouz Mirza and Hosein Mohammadzadeh
Abstract: In some models, dark matter is considered as a condensate bosonic system. In this paper, we prove that condensation is also possible for particles that obey infinite statistics and derive the critical condensation temperature. We argue that a condensed state of a gas of very weakly interacting particles obeying infinite statistics could be considered as a consistent model of dark matter.
