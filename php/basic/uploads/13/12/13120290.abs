Abstract: Quantum weak measurements with states both pre- and postselected offer a window into a hitherto neglected sector of quantum mechanics. A class of such systems involves time dependent evolution with transitions possible. In this paper we explore two very simple systems in this class. The first is a toy model representing the decay of an excited atom. The second is the tunneling of a particle through a barrier. The postselection criteria are chosen as follows: at the final time, the "atom" remains in its initial excited state for the first example and the particle remains behind the barrier for the second. We then ask what weak values are predicted in the physical environment of the "atom" (to which no net energy has been transferred) and in the region beyond the barrier (to which the particle has not tunneled). Previous work suggests that very large weak values might arise in these regions for long durations between pre- and postselection times. Our calculations reveal some distinct differences between the two model systems.
