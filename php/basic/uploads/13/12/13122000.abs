Title: Reduction Redux of Adinkras
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Stephen Randall and Kory Stiffler
Abstract: We show performing general "0-brane reduction" along an arbitrary fixed direction in spacetime and applied to the starting point of minimal, off-shell 4D, $\cal N$ $=$ 1 irreducible supermultiplets, yields adinkras whose adjacency matrices are among some of the special cases proposed by Kuznetsova, Rojas, and Toppan. However, these more general reductions also can lead to `Garden Algebra' structures beyond those described in their work. It is also shown that for light-like directions, reduction to the 0-brane breaks the equality in the number of fermions and bosons for dynamical theories. This implies that light-like reductions should be done instead to the space of 1-branes or equivalently to the worldsheet.
