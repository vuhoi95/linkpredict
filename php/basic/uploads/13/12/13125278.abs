Title: Aspects of fine-tuning of the Higgs mass within finite field theories
Authors: Pierre Grange' and Jean-Francois Mathiot and Bruno Mutet and Ernst Werner
Abstract: We reanalyze the perturbative radiative corrections to the Higgs mass within the Standard Model in the light of the Taylor-Lagrange renormalization scheme. This scheme naturally leads to completely finite corrections, depending on an arbitrary scale. The formulation avoids very large individual corrections to the Higgs mass. This illustrates the fact that the so-called fine-tuning problem in the Standard Model is just an artifact of the regularization scheme. It should therefore not lead to any physical interpretation in terms of the energy scale at which new physics should show up, nor in terms of a new symmetry. We analyze the intrinsic physical scales relevant for the description of these radiative corrections.
