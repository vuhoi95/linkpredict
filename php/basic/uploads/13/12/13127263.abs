Title: Accretion of radiation and rotating Primordial black holes
Authors: Swapna Mahapatra and Bibekananda Nayak
Abstract: We consider rotating Primordial black holes (PBHs) and study the effect of accretion of radiation in the radiation dominated era. The central part of our analysis deals with the role of the angular momentum parameter on the evolution of PBHs. We find that both the accretion rate and evaporation rate decrease with increase in angular momentum parameter, but the rate of evaporation decreases more rapidly than the rate of accretion. This shows that the evaporation time of PBHs get prolonged with increase in angular momentum parameter. We also note that the lifetime of rotating PBHs increase with increase in accretion efficiency of the radiation as in the case of nonrotating PBHs.
