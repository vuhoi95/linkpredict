Title: Flavours in global Klebanov-Witten background
Authors: Dimo Arnaudov and Veselin Filev and Radoslav Rashkov
Abstract: We probe flavour branes in the Klebanov-Witten background in global coordinates. We show that supersymmetric probes correspond to massless flavours and analyse their spectrum of fluctuations. Our studies suggest that the mesons are dissociated by the Casimir energy. The spectrum is equidistant, with a ground state given by the conformal dimension of the operator dual to the fluctuations. We show that the equidistant structure of the spectrum arises from the addition of the angular momenta of the fundamental fields composing the meson operators.
