Abstract: It is known that by introducing the Yukawa coupling between the fermion and the background scalar field, a bulk spin-half fermion can be localized on general Randall-Sundrum braneworlds generated by a kinklike background scalar. However, this localization mechanism does not work anymore for Randall-Sundrum braneworlds generated by a scalar whose configuration is an even function of the extra dimension. In this paper, we present a new localization mechanism for spin-half fermions for such a class of braneworld models, in which extra dimension has the topology $S^1/Z_2$. By two examples, it is shown that the new localization mechanism produces interesting results. In the first model with the brane generated by two scalars, the zero mode of the left-handed fermion is localized on the brane and there is a mass gap between the fermion zero mode and excited KK modes. In the second model with the brane generated by a dilaton scalar, the zero mode of the left- or right-chiral fermion can be localized on the brane and there is no mass gap.
