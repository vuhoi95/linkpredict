Title: Dressing a black hole with a time-dependent Galileon
Authors: Eugeny Babichev and Christos Charmousis
Abstract: We present a class of exact scalar-tensor black holes for a shift-symmetric part of the Horndeski action. The action includes a higher order scalar tensor interaction term. We find that for a static and spherically symmetric space-time, the scalar field, if time dependent, can be non-trivial and regular thus circumventing in an interesting way no-hair arguments for gallileons. Furthermore, within this class we find a stealth Schwarzschild and a partially self-tuned de-Sitter Schwarzschild black hole, both exhibiting a non trivial and regular space and time dependent scalar. In the latter solution the bulk vacuum energy is screened from a necessarily smaller geometric effective de Sitter vacuum via an integration constant associated to the time dependent scalar field.
