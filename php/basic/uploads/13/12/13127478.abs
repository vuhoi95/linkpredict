Abstract: We investigate, in the case of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the definitions of gravitational energy and gravitational pressure that naturally arise in the framework of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. In particular, we calculate the gravitational energy enclosed by the event horizon of the black hole, E, and the radial pressure over it, p. With these quantities we then analyse the thermodynamic relation dE + pdV (as p turns out to be a density, dV is actually given by dV = dr d\theta d\phi, in spherically-type coordinates). We compare the latter with the standard first law of black hole dynamics. Also, by identifying TdS = dE + pdV, we comment on a possible modification of the standard, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation due to gravitational energy and gravitational pressure of the black hole. The infinitesimal variations in question refer to the Penrose process for a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole.
