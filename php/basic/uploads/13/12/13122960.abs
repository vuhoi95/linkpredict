Title: BPS Skyrme model and nuclear binding energies
Authors: C. Adam and C. Naya and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: We use the classical BPS soliton solutions of the BPS Skyrme model together with corrections from the collective coordinate quantization of spin and isospin, the electrostatic Coulomb energies, and a small explicit breaking of the isospin symmetry - accounting for the proton-neutron mass difference - to calculate nuclear binding energies. We find that the resulting binding energies are already in excellent agreement with their physical values for heavier nuclei, demonstrating thereby that the BPS Skyrme model is a distinguished starting point for a detailed quantitative investigation of nuclear and low-energy strong interaction physics.
