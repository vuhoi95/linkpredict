Title: Conformal Pomeron and Odderon in Strong Coupling
Authors: Richard C. Brower and Miguel Costa and Marko Djuric and Timothy Raben and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: We discuss how exact conformal invariance in the strong coupling leads naturally through AdS/CFT correspondence to a systematic expansion for the Pomeron and Odderon intercepts in power of $\lambda^{-1/2}$, with $\lambda=g^2N_c$ the 't Hooft coupling. We also point out the importance of confinement for a realistic treatment of DIS in the HERA energy range.
