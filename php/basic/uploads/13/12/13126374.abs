Title: Note on Mutual Information between Two Intervals of Extremal BTZ
Authors: Nan Bai and Yi-Hong Gao and Xiao-bao Xu
Abstract: In this note we compute mutual information between two intervals in CFTs dual to extremal BTZ (UV CFT) and near horizon limit of extremal BTZ (IR CFT) using the replica technique in some limiting regimes, which can be compared with holographic description.
