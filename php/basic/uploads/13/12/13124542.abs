Title: Exceptional Field Theory II: E$_{7(7)}$
Authors: Olaf Hohm and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: We introduce exceptional field theory for the group E_{7(7)}, based on a (4+56)-dimensional spacetime subject to a covariant section condition. The `internal' generalized diffeomorphisms of the coordinates in the fundamental representation of E_{7(7)} are governed by a covariant `E-bracket', which is gauged by 56 vector fields. We construct the complete and unique set of field equations that is gauge invariant under generalized diffeomorphisms in the internal and external coordinates. Among them feature the non-abelian twisted self-duality equations for the 56 gauge vectors. We discuss the explicit solutions of the section condition describing the embedding of the full, untruncated 11-dimensional and type IIB supergravity, respectively. As a new feature compared to the previously constructed E_{6(6)} formulation, some components among the 56 gauge vectors descend from the 11-dimensional dual graviton but nevertheless allow for a consistent coupling by virtue of a covariantly constrained compensating 2-form gauge field.
