Abstract: We calculate the Fisher zeros for $SU(3)$ gauge theory with different $N_f$ flavors of staggered fermions for various values of the fermion mass. We discuss the finite-size scaling near the end point of the line of discontinuity of $\bar{\psi} \psi$ in the beta-mass plane and in the larger beta-lower mass region. We discuss possible interpretations of these results in terms of Wilsonian RG flows and their possible relevance to construct composite Higgs models.
