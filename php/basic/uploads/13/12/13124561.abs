Title: A novel cross-check of localization and non conformal holography
Authors: Francesco Bigazzi and Aldo L. Cotrone and Luca Griguolo and Domenico Seminara
Abstract: We precisely reproduce the perimeter law obeyed by Wilson loops on large spatial contours in planar N=2 SYM at strong coupling, as recently deduced using localization, by means of a dual holographic model. The relevant supergravity background is sourced by D5-branes wrapped on a two-sphere in a Calabi-Yau two-manifold. Thus, localization and holography are cross-checked, for the first time, in a non conformal context where the gravity background is not asymptotically Anti de Sitter and the dual gauge theory has a logarithmically running coupling. We also notice that the same cross-check can be performed considering an alternative holographic description of N=2 SYM based on a background sourced by fractional D3-branes.
