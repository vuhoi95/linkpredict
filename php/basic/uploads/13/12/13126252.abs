Title: Towards experimentally studying some puzzles of Hawking radiation
Authors: Zehua Tian and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We investigate the features of the non-corrected thermal (non-thermal) spectrum and the quantum corrected thermal (non-thermal) spectrum. We find that: (i) using the quantum corrected non-thermal spectra, the black hole radiation as tunneling is an entropy conservation process, and thus black hole evaporation process is unitary; (ii) there are no obvious differences between all spectra except for near the Planck mass scale by comparing their average emission energies, average numbers of emissions and average emission energy fluctuations; (iii) the energy covariances of Hawking radiations for all the thermal spectra are exactly zero, while they are nontrivial for all the non-thermal spectra. Especially, there are distinctly different maximums of energy covariances for the temperature-corrected and energy-corrected non-thermal spectra. Consequently, these differences provide a possible way towards experimentally analyzing whether the radiation spectrum of black hole is thermal or non-thermal with or without high order quantum corrections.
