Title: Finite Field-Energy and Interparticle Potential in Logarithmic  Electrodynamics
Authors: Patricio Gaete and José Helayël-Neto
Abstract: We pursue an investigation of Logarithmic Electrodynamics, for which the field-energy of a point-like charge is finite, as it happens in the case of the usual Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We also show that, contrary to the latter, Logarithmic Electrodynamics exhibits the feature of birefringence. Next, we analyze the lowest-order modifications for both Logarithmic Electrodynamics and for its non-commutative version, within the framework of the gauge-invariant path-dependent variables formalism. The calculation shows a long-range correction ($1/r^5$- type) to the Coulomb potential for Logarithmic Electrodynamics. Interestingly enough, for its non-commutative version, the interaction energy is ultraviolet finite. We highlight the role played by the new quantum of length in our analysis.
