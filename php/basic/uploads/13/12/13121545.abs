Title: Radial quantization of the 3d CFT and the higher spin/vector model  duality
Authors: Shan Hu and Tianjun Li
Abstract: We study the radial quantization of the 3d O(N) vector model. We calculate the higher spin charges whose commutation relations give the higher spin algebra. The Fock states of higher spin gravity in AdS_{4} are realized as the states in the 3d CFT. The inner products between these states encode dynamical information. The construction of bulk operators from CFT is discussed as well. This serves as the simplest explicit demonstration of the CFT definition for the quantum gravity.
