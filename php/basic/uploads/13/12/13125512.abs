Title: An introduction to spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity black  holes
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin
Abstract: We review recent developments in the treatment of spherically symmetric black holes in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we discuss an exact solution to the quantum constraints that represents a black hole and is free of singularities. We show that new observables that are not present in the classical theory arise in the quantum theory. We also discuss Hawking radiation by considering the quantization of a scalar field on the quantum spacetime.
