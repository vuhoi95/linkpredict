Title: On the Oscillation of Species
Authors: Iosif Bena and Simon F. Ross and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We describe a new class of BPS objects called magnetubes: their supersymmetry is determined by their magnetic charges, while their electric charges can oscillate freely between different species. We show how to incorporate these objects into microstate geometries and create BPS solutions in which the charge densities rotate through different U(1) species as one moves around a circle within the microstate geometry. Our solutions have the same "time-like" supersymmetry as five-dimensional, three-charge black holes but, in various parts of the solution, the supersymmetry takes the "null" form that is normally associated with magnetic charges. It is this property that enables the species oscillation of magnetubes to be compatible with supersymmetry. We give an example in which the species oscillate non-trivially around a circle within a microstate geometry, and yet the energy-momentum tensor and metric are completely independent of this circle: only the amplitude of the oscillation influences the metric.
