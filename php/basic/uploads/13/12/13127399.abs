Title: Atomic collapse in graphene and cyclic RG flow
Authors: Alexander Gorsky and Fedor Popov
Abstract: In this Letter we consider the problem of screening of external charge in graphene from the cyclic RG flow viewpoint. The analogy with conformal Calogero model is used to suggest the interpretation of the tower of resonant states as tower of Efimov states.
