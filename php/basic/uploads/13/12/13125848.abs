Title: Oscillatory matrix model in Chern-Simons theory and Jacobi-theta  determinantal point process
Authors: Yuta Takahashi and Makoto Katori
Abstract: The partition function of the Chern-Simons theory on the three-sphere with the unitary group $U(N)$ provides a one-matrix model. The corresponding $N$-particle system can be mapped to the determinantal point process whose correlation kernel is expressed by using the Stieltjes-Wigert orthogonal polynomials. The matrix model and the point process are regarded as $q$-extensions of the random matrix model in the Gaussian unitary ensemble and its eigenvalue point process, respectively. We prove the convergence of the $N$-particle system to an infinite-dimensional determinantal point process in $N \to \infty$, in which the correlation kernel is expressed by Jacobi's theta functions. We show that the matrix model obtained by this limit realizes the oscillatory matrix model in Chern-Simons theory discussed by de Haro and Tierz.
