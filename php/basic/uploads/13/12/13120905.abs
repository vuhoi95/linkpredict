Title: Quantum group spin nets: refinement limit and relation to spin foams
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Mercedes Martin-Benito and Sebastian Steinhaus
Abstract: So far spin foam models are hardly understood beyond a few of their basic building blocks. To make progress on this question, we define analogue spin foam models, so called spin nets, for quantum groups $\text{SU}(2)_k$ and examine their effective continuum dynamics via tensor network renormalization. In the refinement limit of this coarse graining procedure, we find a vast non-trivial fixed point structure beyond the degenerate and the $BF$ phase. In comparison to previous work, we use fixed point intertwiners, inspired by Reisenberger's construction principle [1] and the recent work [2], as the initial parametrization. In this new parametrization fine tuning is not required in order to flow to these new fixed points. Encouragingly, each fixed point has an associated extended phase, which allows for the study of phase transitions in the future. Finally we also present an interpretation of spin nets in terms of melonic spin foams. The coarse graining flow of spin nets can thus be interpreted as describing the effective coupling between two spin foam vertices or space time atoms.
