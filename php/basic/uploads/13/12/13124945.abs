Title: Dualising the Baryonic Branch: Dynamic SU(2) and confining backgrounds  in IIA
Authors: Jerome Gaillard and Niall T. Macpherson and Carlos Nunez and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: In this paper we construct and examine new supersymmetric solutions of massive IIA supergravity that are obtained using non-Abelian T-duality applied to the Baryonic Branch of the Klebanov-Strassler background. The geometries display SU(2) structure which we show flows from static in the UV to dynamical in the IR. Confinement and symmetry breaking are given a geometrical interpretation by this change of structure. Various field theory observables are studied, suggesting possible ways to break conformality and flow in $N=1$ $T_N$ and related field theories.
