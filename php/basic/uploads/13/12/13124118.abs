Title: Interpretation of the Cosmological Constant Problem within the Framework  of Generalized Uncertainty Principle
Authors: Yan-Gang Miao and Ying-Jie Zhao
Abstract: We propose an improved exponential Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) by introducing a positive integer $n$ called the suppressing index. Due to the UV/IR mixing brought by the GUP, the states with momenta smaller than the critical momentum ($P < P_{\rm Crit}$) are canceled by the states with momenta larger than the critical momentum ($P > P_{\rm Crit}$) and thus have no contributions to the energy density of the vacuum. By considering the contributions just from the states with momenta larger than the critical momentum ($P > P_{\rm Crit}$) and choosing a suitable suppressing index, $n \sim 10^{123}$, we calculate the cosmological constant consistent with the experimentally observed value.
