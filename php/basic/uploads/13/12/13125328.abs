Title: De Sitter Vacua from Non-perturbative Flux Compactifications
Authors: Johan Blåbäck and Diederik Roest and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: We present stable de Sitter solutions of $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supergravity in a geometric type IIB duality frame with the addition of non-perturbative contributions. Contrary to the standard approach, we retain the moduli dependence of both the tree level superpotential and its non-perturbative contribution. This provides the possibility for a single-step stabilisation of all moduli simultaneously in a de Sitter vacuum. Using a genetic algorithm we find explicit solutions with different features.
