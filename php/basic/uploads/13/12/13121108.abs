Title: Holographic superconductivity in the large D expansion
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: We study holographic superconductivity by expanding the equations in the inverse of the number of spacetime dimensions D. We obtain an analytic expression for the critical temperature as a function of the conformal dimension of the condensate operator. Its accuracy for 3+1-dimensional superconductors is better than 15%. The analysis reveals a simple, and quantitative, explanation for the onset of the superconducting instability, as well as universal features of holographic superconductivity in the large D limit. In particular, this allows to easily compute the effects of backreaction on the critical temperature.
