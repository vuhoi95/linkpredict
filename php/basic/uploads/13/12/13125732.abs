Title: Generalized Jack polynomials and the AGT relations for the $SU(3)$ group
Authors: S. Mironov and An. Morozov and Y. Zenkevich
Abstract: We find generalized Jack polynomials for the group $SU(3)$ and verify that their Selberg averages for several first levels are given by Nekrasov functions. To compute the averages we derive recurrence relations for the $sl_3$ Selberg integrals.
