Title: dS/CFT at uniform energy density and a de Sitter "bluewall"
Authors: Diptarka Das and Sumit R. Das and K. Narayan
Abstract: We describe a class of spacetimes that are asymptotically de Sitter in the Poincare slicing. Assuming that a dS/CFT correspondence exists, we argue that these are gravity duals to a CFT on a circle leading to uniform energy-momentum density, and are equivalent to an analytic continuation of the Euclidean AdS black brane. These are solutions with a complex parameter which then gives a real energy-momentum density. We also discuss a related solution with the parameter continued to a real number, which we refer to as a de Sitter "bluewall". This spacetime has two asymptotic de Sitter universes and Cauchy horizons cloaking timelike singularities. We argue that the Cauchy horizons give rise to a blue-shift instability.
