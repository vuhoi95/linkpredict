Title: Fermionic UV completions of Composite Higgs models
Authors: Gabriele Ferretti and Denis Karateev
Abstract: We classify the four-dimensional purely fermionic gauge theories that give a UV completion of composite Higgs models. Our analysis is at the group theoretical level, addressing the necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for the viability of these models, such as the existence of top partners and custodial symmetry. The minimal cosets arising are those of type SU(5)/SO(5) and SU(4)/Sp(4). We list all the possible "hyper-color" groups allowed and point out the simplest and most promising ones.
