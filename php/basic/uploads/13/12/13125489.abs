Title: Rotating and Moving D-Branes in the Presence of Various Background  Fields
Authors: Farzin Safarzadeh-Maleki and Davoud Kamani
Abstract: We calculate the bosonic boundary state associated with a rotating and moving D$p$-brane in the presence of the antisymmetric tensor field, a $U(1)$ gauge field and a tachyon field. Rotation and motion are in the brane volume. We reconstruct this boundary state via the group $PSL(2,R)$ to be applicable when the tachyon field is presented. This modified boundary state enables us to calculate the interaction amplitude between two parallel D$p$-branes with rotation and motion. The long-range force of this interaction will be obtained. The boundary state also enables us to investigate the tachyon condensation on a rotating and moving D$p$-brane.
