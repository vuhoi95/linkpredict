Title: Massless and massive representations in the spinor technique
Authors: T. Troha and D. Lukman and N. S. Mankoc Borstnik
Abstract: The technique for representing spinors and the definition of the discrete symmetries is used to illustrate on a toy model properties of massless and massive spinors states, in the first and the second quantized picture. Since in this toy model the number of the starting massless representations is well defined as well as the origin of masses and charges in $d=(3+1)$ space, this contribution might help to clarify the problem about Dirac, Weyl and Majorana kinds of representations in physically more interesting cases.
