Title: Dynamical sectors of a relativistic two particle model
Authors: Daniele Dominici and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Giorgio Longhi
Abstract: We reconsider a model of two relativistic particles interacting via a multiplicative potential, as an example of a simple dynamical system with sectors, or branches, with different dynamics and degrees of freedom.The presence or absence of sectors depends on the values of rest masses. Some aspects of the canonical quantization are described. The model could be interpreted as a bigravity model in one dimension.
