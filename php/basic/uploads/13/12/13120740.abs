Title: Cosmology of the Spinor Emergent Universe and Scale-invariant  Perturbations
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Youping Wan and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: A nonsingular emergent universe cosmology can be realized by a nonconventional spinor field as first developed in \cite{Cai:2012yf}. We study the mechanisms of generating scale-invariant primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbation in the frame of spinor emergent universe cosmology. Particularly, we introduce a light scalar field of which the kinetic term couples to the bilinear of the spinor field. This kinetic coupling can give rise to an effective "Hubble radius" for primordial fluctuations from the scalar field to squeeze at large length scales as well as to form a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum. We study the stability of the backreaction and constrain the forms of the coupling terms. These almost scale-independent fluctuations are able to be transferred into curvature perturbation after the epoch of emergent universe through a generalized curvaton mechanism and thus can explain cosmological observations.
