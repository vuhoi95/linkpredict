Title: A Note on Asymmetric Thick Branes
Authors: D. Bazeia and R. Menezes and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: In this work we study asymmetric thick braneworld scenarios, generated after adding a constant to the superpotential associated to the scalar field. We study in particular models with odd and even polynomial superpotentials, and we show that asymmetric brane can be generated irrespective of the potential being symmetric or asymmetric. We study in addition the nonpolynomial sine-Gordon-like model, also constructed with the inclusion of a constant in the standard superpotential, and we investigate gravitational stability of the asymmetric brane. The results suggest robustness of the new braneworld scenarios and add further possibilities for the construction of asymmetric branes.
