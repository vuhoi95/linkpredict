Title: Effective $Î¸$ term by CP-odd electromagnetic background fields
Authors: Claudio Bonati and Guido Cossu and Massimo D'Elia and Marco Mariti and Francesco Negro
Abstract: We discuss our study of QCD in the presence of CP-odd electromagnetic (e.m.) background fields. We investigate the propagation of the CP-odd term from the e.m. sector to the strong sector, inducing an effective $\theta$ term. We discuss the method we have used in our lattice QCD simulations, and the results of our analysis, which are relevant to the determination of the effective pseudoscalar QED-QCD interactions. We also explore how these CP-odd e.m. background fields influence the number of the Dirac zero modes in our configurations.
