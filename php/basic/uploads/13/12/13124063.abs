Title: Q-operator and fusion relations for $C^{(2)}_q(2)$
Authors: Ivan Chi-Ho Ip and Anton M. Zeitlin
Abstract: The construction of the Q-operator for twisted affine superalgebra $C^{(2)}_q(2)$ is given. It is shown that the corresponding prefundamental representations give rise to evaluation modules some of which do not have a classical limit, which nevertheless appear to be a necessary part of fusion relations.
