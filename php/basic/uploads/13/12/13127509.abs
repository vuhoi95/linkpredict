Title: The homogeneity theorem for supergravity backgrounds II: the  six-dimensional theories
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Noel Hustler
Abstract: We prove that supersymmetry backgrounds of (1,0) and (2,0) six-dimensional supergravity theories preserving more than one half of the supersymmetry are locally homogeneous. As a byproduct we also establish that the Killing spinors of such a background generate a Lie superalgebra.
