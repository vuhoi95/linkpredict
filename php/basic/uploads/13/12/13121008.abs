Title: tt* Geometry in 3 and 4 Dimensions
Authors: Sergio Cecotti and Davide Gaiotto and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We consider the vacuum geometry of supersymmetric theories with 4 supercharges, on a flat toroidal geometry. The 2 dimensional vacuum geometry is known to be captured by the $tt^*$ geometry. In the case of 3 dimensions, the parameter space is $(T^{2}\times {\mathbb R})^N$ and the vacuum geometry turns out to be a solution to a generalization of monopole equations in $3N$ dimensions where the relevant topological ring is that of line operators. We compute the generalization of the 2d cigar amplitudes, which lead to $S^2\times S^1$ or $S^3$ partition functions which are distinct from the supersymmetric partition functions on these spaces, but reduce to them in a certain limit. We show the sense in which these amplitudes generalize the structure of 3d Chern-Simons theories and 2d RCFT's. In the case of 4 dimensions the parameter space is of the form $(T^3\times {\mathbb R})^M\times T^{3N}$, and the vacuum geometry is a solution to a mixture of generalized monopole equations and generalized instanton equations (known as hyper-holomorphic connections). In this case the topological rings are associated to surface operators. We discuss the physical meaning of the generalized Nahm transforms which act on all of these geometries.
