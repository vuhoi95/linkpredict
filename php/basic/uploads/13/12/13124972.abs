Title: Infra-red divergences in Light Front Field Theory and Coherent State  Formalism
Authors: Jai D. More and Anuradha Misra
Abstract: We discuss fermion self energy correction in light front QED using a coherent state basis. We show that if one uses coherent state basis instead of fock basis to calculate the transition matrix elements the true infrared divergences in $\delta m^2$ get canceled up to $O(e^4)$ . We show this in Light-front as well as in Feynman gauge.
