Title: The Standard Model with New Order Parameters at Finite Temperature
Authors: M. Sakamoto and K. Takenaga
Abstract: We consider the finite temperature effective potential of the standard model at the one-loop level in four dimensions by taking account of two kinds of order parameters, the Higgs vacuum expectation value and the zero modes of gauge fields for the Euclidean time direction. We study the vacuum structure of the model, focusing on the existence of new phase, where the zero modes, that is, the new order parameters develop nontrivial vacuum expectation values except for the center of the gauge group. We find that under certain conditions there appears no new phase at finite temperature.
