Title: Twisting and kappa-Poincare
Authors: Andrzej Borowiec and Jerzy Lukierski and Anna Pachol
Abstract: We demonstrate that the coproduct of D=2 and D=4 quantum kappa-Poincare algebra in classical algebra basis can not be obtained by the cochain twist depending only on Poincare algebra generators. We also argue that nonexistence of such a twist does not imply the nonexistence of universal R-matrix.
