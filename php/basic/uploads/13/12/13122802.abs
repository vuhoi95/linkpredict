Title: Supersymmetric invariant theories
Authors: S. R. Esipova and P. M. Lavrov and O. V. Radchenko
Abstract: We study field models for which a quantum action (i.e. the action appearing in the generating functional of Green functions) is invariant under supersymmetric transformations. We derive the Ward identity which is direct consequence of this invariance. We consider a change of variables in functional integral connected with supersymmetric transformations when its parameter is replaced by a nilpotent functional of fields. Exact form of the corresponding Jacobian is found. We find restrictions on generators of supersymmetric transformations when a consistent quantum description of given field theories exists.
