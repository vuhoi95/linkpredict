Title: First-Quantized Theory of Expanding Universe from Field Quantization in  Mini-Superspace
Authors: Daisuke Ida and Miyuki Saito
Abstract: We propose an improved variant of the third-quantization scheme, for the spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models in Einstein gravity coupled with a neutral massless scalar field. Our strategy is to specify a semi-Riemannian structure on the mini-superspace and to consider the quantum Klein-Gordon field on the mini-superspace. Then, the Hilbert space of this quantum system becomes inseparable, which causes the creation of infinite number of universes. To overcome this issue, we introduce a vector bundle structure on the Hilbert space and the connection of the vector bundle. Then, we can define a consistent unitary time evolution of the quantum universe in terms of the connection field on the vector bundle. By doing this, we are able to treat the quantum dynamics of a single-universe state. We also find an appropriate observable set constituting the CCR-algebra, and obtain the Schr\"odinger equation for the wave function of the single-universe state. We show that the present quantum theory correctly reproduces the classical solution to the Einstein equation.
