Title: Three-point functions in the SU(2) sector at strong coupling
Authors: Yoichi Kazama and Shota Komatsu
Abstract: Extending the methods developed in our previous works (arXiv:1110.3949, arXiv:1205.6060), we compute the three-point functions at strong coupling of the non-BPS states with large quantum numbers corresponding to the composite operators belonging to the so-called SU(2) sector in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. This is achieved by the semi-classical evaluation of the three-point functions in the dual string theory in the $AdS_3 \times S^3$ spacetime, using the general one-cut finite gap solutions as the external states. In spite of the complexity of the contributions from various parts in the intermediate stages, the final answer for the three-point function takes a remarkably simple form, exhibiting the structure reminiscent of the one obtained at weak coupling. In particular, in the Frolov-Tseytlin limit the result is expressed in terms of markedly similar integrals, however with different contours of integration. We discuss a natural mechanism for introducing additional singularities on the worldsheet without affecting the infinite number of conserved charges, which can modify the contours of integration.
