Title: Non-Fermi liquid behavior of large N_B quantum critical metals
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Shamit Kachru and Jared Kaplan and S. Raghu
Abstract: The problem of continuous quantum phase transitions in metals involves critical bosons coupled to a Fermi surface. We solve the theory in the limit of a large number, N_B, of bosonic flavors, where the bosons transform in the adjoint representation, while the fermions are in the fundamental representation of a global SU(N_B) flavor symmetry group. The leading large N_B solution corresponds to a non-Fermi liquid coupled to Wilson-Fisher bosons. In a certain energy range, the fermion velocity vanishes - resulting in the destruction of the Fermi surface. Subleading 1/N_B corrections correspond to a qualitatively different form of Landau damping of the bosonic critical fluctuations. We discuss the model in d=3-epsilon but because of the additional control afforded by large N_B, our results are valid down to d=2. In the limit epsilon << 1, the large N_B solution is consistent with the RG analysis of Ref. 1.
