Title: Neutrinos in the Early Universe, Kalb-Ramond Torsion and  Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry
Authors: Nick E. Mavromatos and Sarben Sarkar
Abstract: The generation of a matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe may be induced by the propagation of fermions in non-trivial, spherically asymmetric (and hence Lorentz violating) gravitational backgrounds. Such backgrounds may characterise the epoch of the early universe. The key point in these models is that the background induces different dispersion relations, hence populations, between fermions and antifermions, and thus CPT Violation (CPTV) appears in thermal equilibrium. Species populations may freeze out leading to leptogenesis and baryogenesis. We consider here a string-inspired scenario, in which the CPTV is associated with a cosmological background with torsion provided by the Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymemtric tensor field of the string gravitational multiplet. In a four-dimensional space time this field is dual to a pseudoscalar ``axion-like'' field. The mixing of the KR field with an ordinary axion field can lead to the generation of a Majorana neutrino mass.
