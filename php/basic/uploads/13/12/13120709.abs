Authors: Ying-li Zhang and Ryo Saito and Dong-han Yeom and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We study the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) instanton characterizing the tunneling from a false vacuum to the true vacuum in a semi-classical way in dRGT (deRham-Gabadadze-Tolley) massive gravity theory, and evaluate the dependence of the tunneling rate on the model parameters. It is found that provided with the same physical Hubble parameters for the true vacuum $H_{\rm T}$ and the false vacuum $H_{\rm F}$ as in General Relativity (GR), the thin-wall approximation method implies the same tunneling rate as GR. However, deviations of tunneling rate from GR arise when one goes beyond the thin-wall approximation and they change monotonically until the Hawking-Moss (HM) case. Moreover, under the thin-wall approximation, the HM process may dominate over the CDL one if the value for the graviton mass is larger than the inverse of the radius of the bubble.
