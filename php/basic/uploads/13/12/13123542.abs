Title: S-matrix for strings on $Î·$-deformed AdS5 x S5
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Riccardo Borsato and Sergey Frolov
Abstract: We determine the bosonic part of the superstring sigma model Lagrangian on $\eta$-deformed AdS5 x S5, and use it to compute the perturbative world-sheet scattering matrix of bosonic particles of the model. We then compare it with the large string tension limit of the q-deformed S-matrix and find exact agreement.
