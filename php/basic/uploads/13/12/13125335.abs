Title: Novel Higgs Potentials from Gauge Mediation of Exact Scale Breaking
Authors: Steven Abel and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We present a gauge mediation principle for BSM theories where exact UV scale invariance is broken in a hidden sector. The relevant configurations are those in which the Standard Model and a hidden sector emanate from a scale invariant pair of UV theories that communicate only via gauge interactions. We compute the radiatively induced Higgs potential which contains logarithmic mass-squared terms that lead to unusual Higgs self-couplings. Its other couplings are unchanged.
