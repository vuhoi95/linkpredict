Title: Analysis of higher spin black holes with spin-4 chemical potential
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We consider the $AdS_{3}/CFT_{2}$ duality between certain coset WZW theories at large central charge and Vasiliev 3D higher spin gravity with a single complex field. On the gravity side, we discuss a higher spin black hole solution with chemical potential coupled to the spin-4 charge. We compute the perturbative expansion of the higher spin charges and of the partition function at high order in the chemical potential. The result is obtained with its exact dependence on the parameter $\lambda$ characterising the symmetry algebra $\mbox{hs}[\lambda]$. The cases of $\lambda=0,1$ are successfully compared with a CFT calculation. The special point $\lambda=\infty$, the Bergshoeff-Blencowe-Stelle limit, is also solved in terms of the exact generating function for the partition function. The thermodynamics of both the spin-4 and the usual spin-3 black holes is studied in order to discuss the $\lambda$ dependence of the BTZ critical temperature $T_{\rm BTZ}(\lambda)$. In the spin-3 case, it is shown that $T_{\rm BTZ}(\lambda)$ converges for large $\lambda$ to the critical point of the $\lambda=\infty$ known partition function previously found by the authors. In the spin-4 black hole, the picture is qualitatively similar and $T_{\rm BTZ}(\infty)$ is accurately determined by various numerical methods.
