Title: Self-dual road to noncommutative gravity with twist: a new analysis
Authors: Elisabetta Di Grezia and Giampiero Esposito and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: The field equations of noncommutative gravity can be obtained by replacing all exterior products by twist-deformed exterior products in the action functional of general relativity, and are here studied by requiring that the torsion 2-form should vanish, and that the Lorentz-Lie-algebra- valued part of the full connection 1-form should be self-dual. Other two conditions, expressing self-duality of a pair 2-forms occurring in the full curvature 2-form, are also imposed. This leads to a systematic solution strategy, here displayed for the first time, where all parts of the connection 1-form are first evaluated, hence the full curvature 2-form, and eventually all parts of the tetrad 1-form, when expanded on the basis of {\gamma}-matrices. By assuming asymptotic expansions which hold up to first order in the noncommutativity matrix in the neighbourhood of the vanishing value for noncommutativity, we find a family of self-dual solutions of the field equations. This is generated by solving first a inhomogeneous wave equation on 1-forms in a classical curved spacetime (which is itself self-dual and solves the vacuum Einstein equations), subject to the Lorenz gauge condition. In particular, when the classical undeformed geometry is Kasner spacetime, the above scheme is fully computable out of solutions of the scalar wave equation in such a Kasner model.
