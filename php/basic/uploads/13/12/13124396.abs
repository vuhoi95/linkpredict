Title: Static Domain Wall in the Braneworld gravity
Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and P. F. Carlesso and J. M. hoff da Silva
Abstract: In this paper we consider a static domain wall inside a 3-brane. Differently of the standard achievement obtained in General Relativity, the analysis performed here gives a consistency condition for the existence of static domain walls in a braneworld gravitational scenario. It is also shown the behavior of the domain wall gravitational field in the newtonian limit.
