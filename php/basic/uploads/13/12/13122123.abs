Abstract: We report on a detailed numerical study of the evolution of semilocal string networks, based on the largest and most accurate field theory simulations of these objects to date. We focus on the large-scale network properties, confirming earlier indications (coming from smaller simulations) that linear scaling is the attractor solution for the entire parameter space of initial conditions that we are able to probe. We also provide a brief comparison of our numerical results with the predictions of a previously developed one-scale model for the overall evolution of these networks. Two subsequent papers will discuss in more detail the analytic modeling of the semilocal segment populations as well as optimized numerical diagnostics.
