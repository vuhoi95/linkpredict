Abstract: The nested off-diagonal Bethe ansatz method is proposed to diagonalize multi-component integrable models with generic integrable boundaries. As an example, the exact solutions of the su(n)-invariant spin chain model with both periodic and non-diagonal boundaries are derived by constructing the nested T-Q relations based on the operator product identities among the fused transfer matrices and the asymptotic behavior of the transfer matrices.
