Title: New Cosmological Signatures from Double Field Theory
Authors: Houwen Wu and Haitang Yang
Abstract: In cosmology, it has been a long-standing problem to establish a \emph{parameter insensitive} evolution from an anisotropic phase to an isotropic phase. On the other hand, it is of great importance to construct a theory having extra dimensions as its intrinsic ingredients. We show that these two problems are closely related and can naturally be solved simultaneously in double field theory cosmology. Our derivations are based on general arguments without any fine-tuning parameters. In addition, We find that when we begin with FRW metric, the full spacetime metric of DFT totally agrees with \emph{Kaluza-Klein theory}. There is a visible and invisible dimension exchange between the pre- and post-big bangs. Our results indicate that double field theory has profound physical consequences and the continuous $O\left(D,D\right)$ is a very fundamental symmetry. This observation reinforces the viewpoint that symmetries dictate physics.
