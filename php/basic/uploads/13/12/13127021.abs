Title: Dynamic Lattice Supersymmetry in gl(n|m) Spin Chains
Authors: David Meidinger and Vladimir Mitev
Abstract: Supersymmetry operators that change a spin chain's length have appeared in numerous contexts, ranging from the AdS/CFT correspondence to statistical mechanics models. In this article, we present, via an analysis of the Bethe equations, all homogeneous, rational and trigonometric, integrable gl(n|m) spin chains for which length-changing supersymmetry can be present. Furthermore, we write down the supercharges explicitly for the simplest new models, namely the sl(n|1) spin chains with the (n-1)-fold antisymmetric tensor product of the fundamental representation at each site and check their compatibility with integrability.
