Title: Quantum gauge theories on noncommutative 3-d space
Authors: Antoine Géré and Patrizia Vitale and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: We consider a class of gauge invariant models on the noncommutative space $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$, a deformation of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Focusing on massless models with no linear $A_i$ dependence, we obtain noncommutative gauge models for which the computation of the propagator can be done in a convenient gauge. We find that the infrared singularity of the massless propagator disappears in the computation of the correlation functions. We show that massless gauge invariant models on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$ have quantum instabilities of the vacuum, signaled by the occurrence of non vanishing 1-point functions for some but not all of the components of the gauge potential. The tadpole contribution to the effective action cannot be interpreted as a standard $\sigma$-term. Its global symmetry does not fit with the one of the classical action, reminiscent to an explicit global symmetry breaking term.
