Abstract: We study $N=5$ gauged supergravity in three dimensions with compact, non-compact and non-semisimple gauge groups. The theory under consideration is of Chern-Simons type with $USp(4,k)/USp(4)\times USp(k)$ scalar manifold. We classify possible semisimple gauge groups of the $k=2,4$ cases and identify some of their critical points. A number of supersymmetric $AdS_3$ critical points are found, and holographic RG flows interpolating between these critical points are also investigated. As one of our main results, we consider a non-semisimple gauge group $SO(5)\ltimes \mathbf{T}^{10}$ for the theory with $USp(4,4)/USp(4)\times USp(4)$ scalar manifold. The resulting theory describes $N=5$ gauged supergravity in four dimensions reduced on $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and admits a maximally supersymmetric $AdS_3$ critical point with $Osp(5|2,\mathbb{R})\times Sp(2,\mathbb{R})$ superconformal symmetry. We end the paper with the construction of $SO(6)\ltimes \mathbf{T}^{15}$ gauged supergravity with $N=6$ supersymmetry. The theory admits a half-supersymmetric domain wall as a vacuum solution and may be obtained from an $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ reduction of $N=6$ gauged supergravity in four dimensions.
