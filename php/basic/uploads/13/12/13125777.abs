Abstract: HYPERDIRE is a project devoted to the creation of a set of Mathematica based programs for the differential reduction of hypergeometric functions. The current version includes two parts: the first one, FdFunction, for manipulations with Appell hypergeometric functions $F_D$ of $r$ variables; and the second one, FsFunction, for manipulations with Lauricella-Saran hypergeometric functions $F_S$ of three variables. Both functions are related with one-loop Feynman diagrams. The published version includes also Chapter 5 with two theorems about structure of coefficients of epsilon-expansion of the Horn-type hypergeometric functions. As illustration, the first three coefficients of epsilon-expansion for the Appell hypergeometric function FD of r-variables are explicitly evaluated.
