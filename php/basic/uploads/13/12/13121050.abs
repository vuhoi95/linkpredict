Title: Thermodynamic limit of the Nekrasov-type formula for E-string theory
Authors: Takenori Ishii and Kazuhiro Sakai
Abstract: We give a proof of the Nekrasov-type formula proposed by one of the authors for the Seiberg-Witten prepotential for the E-string theory on R^4 x T^2. We take the thermodynamic limit of the Nekrasov-type formula following the example of Nekrasov-Okounkov and reproduce the Seiberg-Witten description of the prepotential. The Seiberg-Witten curve obtained directly from the Nekrasov-type formula is of genus greater than one. We find that this curve is transformed into the known elliptic curve by a simple map. We consider the cases in which the low energy theory has E_8, E_7+A_1 or E_6+A_2 as a global symmetry.
