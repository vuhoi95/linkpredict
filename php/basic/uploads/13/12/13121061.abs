Title: The embedding tensor of Scherk-Schwarz flux compactifications from  eleven dimensions
Authors: Hadi Godazgar and Mahdi Godazgar and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We study the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of D=11 supergravity with background fluxes in the context of a recently developed framework pertaining to D=11 supergravity. We derive the embedding tensor of the associated four-dimensional maximal gauged theories directly from eleven dimensions by exploiting the generalised vielbein postulates, and by analysing the couplings of the full set of 56 electric and magnetic gauge fields to the generalised vielbeine. The treatment presented here will apply more generally to other reductions of $D=11$ supergravity to maximal gauged theories in four dimensions.
