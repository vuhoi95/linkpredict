Abstract: In this paper, we investigate localization of a free massless $q-$form bulk field on thin and thick $AdS_{p+1}$ branes with codimension one. It is found that the zero mode of the $q-$form field with $q>(p+2)/2$ can be localized on the thin negative tension brane, which is different from the flat brane case given in [JHEP 10 (2012) 060]. For the thick $AdS_{p+1}$ branes, the $q-$form field with $q>(p+2)/2$ also has a localized zero mode under some conditions. Furthermore, we find that there are massive bound KK modes of the $q-$form field, which are localized on this type $p-$branes.
