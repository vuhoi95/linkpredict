Title: Equivariant functions and vector-valued modular forms
Authors: Hicham Saber and Abdellah Sebbar
Abstract: For any discrete group $\Gamma$ and any 2-dimensional complex representation $\rho$ of $\Gamma$, we introduce the notion of $\rho-$equivariant functions, and we show that they are parameterized by vector-valued modular forms. We also provide examples arising from the monodromy of differential equations.
