Title: Resolving Witten's Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Theodore Erler and Sebastian Konopka and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We regulate Witten's open superstring field theory by replacing the picture-changing insertion at the midpoint with a contour integral of picture changing insertions over the half-string overlaps of the cubic vertex. The resulting product between string fields is non-associative, but we provide a solution to the $A_\infty$ relations defining all higher vertices. The result is an explicit covariant superstring field theory which by construction satisfies the classical BV master equation.
