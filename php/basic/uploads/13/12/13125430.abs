Title: AdS Black Holes from Duality in Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Nick Halmagyi and Thomas Vanel
Abstract: We study and utilize duality transformations in a particular STU-model of four dimensional gauged supergravity. This model is a truncation of the de Wit-Nicolai N=8 theory and as such has a lift to eleven-dimensional supergravity on the seven-sphere. Our duality group is $U(1)^3$ and while it can be applied to any solution of this theory, we consider the known asymptotically AdS$_4$, supersymmetric black holes and focus on duality transformations which preserve supersymmetry. For static black holes we generalize the supersymmetric solutions of Cacciatori and Klemm from three magnetic charges to include two additional electric charges and argue that this is co-dimension one in the full space of supersymmetric static black holes in the STU-model. These new static black holes have nontrivial profiles for axions. For rotating black holes, we generalize the known two-parameter supersymmetric solution to include an additional parameter which represents scalar hair. When lifted to M-theory, these black holes correspond to the near horizon geometry of a stack of BPS rotating M2-branes, spinning on an $S^7$ which is fibered non-trivially over a Riemann surface.
