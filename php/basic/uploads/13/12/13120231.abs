Title: Supermembrane in D=5: component action
Authors: S. Bellucci and N. Kozyrev and S. Krivonos and A. Yeranyan
Abstract: Based on the connection between partial breaking of global supersymmetry, coset approach, which realized the given pattern of supersymmetry breaking, and the Nambu-Goto actions for the extended objects, we have constructed on-shell component action for N=1, D=5 supermembrane and its dual cousins. We demonstrate that the proper choice of the components and the use of the covariant (with respect to broken supersymmetry) derivatives drastically simplify the action: it can be represented as a sum of four terms each having an explicit geometric meaning.
