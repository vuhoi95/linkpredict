Title: $E_7 \subset Sp(56,R)$ irrep decompositions of interest for physical  models
Authors: Lorenzo Fortunato and Willem A. de Graaf
Abstract: In this note we show how to obtain the projection matrix for the $E_7 \subset C_{28}$ chain and we tabulate some decompositions of the symplectic algebra $C_{28}$ representations into irreps of the $E_7$ subalgebra that are important for various physical models.
