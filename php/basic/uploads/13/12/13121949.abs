Title: Critical behaviour in the QCD Anderson transition
Authors: Matteo Giordano and Tamas G. Kovacs and Ferenc Pittler
Abstract: We study the Anderson-type localisation-delocalisation transition found previously in the QCD Dirac spectrum at high temperature. Using high statistics QCD simulations with $N_f=2+1$ flavours of staggered quarks, we discuss how the change in the spectral statistics depends on the volume, the temperature and the lattice spacing, and we speculate on the possible universality of the transition from Poisson to Wigner-Dyson in the spectral statistics. Moreover, we show that the transition is a genuine phase transition: at the mobility edge, separating localised and delocalised modes, quantities characterising the spectral statistics become non-analytic in the thermodynamic limit. Using finite size scaling we also determine the critical exponent of the correlation length, and we speculate on possible extensions of the universality of Anderson transitions.
