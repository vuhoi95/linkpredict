Title: Matrix Flavor Brane and Dual Wilson Line
Authors: Andreas Karch and Sichun Sun
Abstract: We study a novel non-Abelian matrix configuration of probe D-branes in AdS5. This configuration gives rise to a new D-brane phenomenon related to the known "Myers effect" in the context of holography. It is dual to a deformation of the field theory by a Wilson line threaded fermion bilinear. We study the two point function of these short Wilson lines from both the non-Abelian DBI action and a classical string world sheet calculation and identify the region where they agree. We also study a related configuration where the non-Abelian nature of the embedding functions is enhanced by a background flux as in the Myers effect.
