Abstract: The two-point gauge correlation function in Yang--Mills--Chern--Simons theory in three dimensional Euclidean space is analysed by taking into account the non-perturbative effects of the Gribov horizon. In this way, we are able to describe the confinement and de-confinement regimes, which naturally depend on the topological mass and on the gauge coupling constant of the theory.
