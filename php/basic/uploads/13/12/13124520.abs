Title: Super-Liouville - Double Liouville correspondence
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski
Abstract: The AGT motivated relation between the tensor product of the N = 1 super-Liouville field theory with the imaginary free fermion (SL) and a certain projected tensor product of the real and the imaginary Liouville field theories (LL) is analyzed. Using conformal field theory techniques we give a complete proof of the equivalence in the NS sector. It is shown that the SL-LL correspondence is based on the equivalence of chiral objects including suitably chosen chiral structure constants of all the three Liouville theories involved.
