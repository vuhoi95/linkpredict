Title: BPS $M2$-branes in $AdS_4\times Q^{1, 1, 1}$ Dual to Loop Operators
Authors: Jun-Bao Wu and Meng-Qi Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we first compute the Killing spinors of $AdS_4\times Q^{1, 1, 1}$ and its certain orbifolds. Based on this, two classes of $M2$-brane solutions are found. The first class of solutions includes $M2$-branes dual to Wilson loops in the fundamental representation as special cases. The second class includes the candidates of the holographic description of vortex loops in the dual field theories.
