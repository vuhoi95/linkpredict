Title: Asymptotically locally AdS and flat black holes in Horndeski theory
Authors: Andres Anabalon and Adolfo Cisterna and Julio Oliva
Abstract: In this paper we construct asymptotically locally AdS and flat black holes in the presence of a scalar field whose kinetic term is constructed out from a linear combination of the metric and the Einstein tensor. The field equations as well as the energy-momentum tensor are second order in the metric and the field, therefore the theory belongs to the ones defined by Horndeski. We show that in the presence of a cosmological term in the action, it is possible to have a real scalar field in the region outside the event horizon. The solutions are characterized by a single integration constant, the scalar field vanishes at the horizon and it contributes to the effective cosmological constant at infinity. We extend these results to the topological case. The solution is disconnected from the maximally symmetric AdS background, however, within this family there exits a gravitational soliton which is everywhere regular. This soliton is therefore used as a background to define a finite Euclidean action and to obtain the thermodynamics of the black holes. For a certain region in the space of parameters, the thermodynamic analysis reveals a critical temperature at which a Hawking-Page phase transition between the black hole and the soliton occurs. We extend the solution to arbitrary dimensions grater than four and show that the presence of a cosmological term in the action allows to consider the case in which the standard kinetic term for the scalar it's not present. In such scenario, the solution reduces to an asymptotically flat black hole.
