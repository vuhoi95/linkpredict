Title: Meromorphic Functions and the Topology of Giant Gravitons
Authors: Michael C. Abbott and Jeff Murugan and Andrea Prinsloo and Nitin Rughoonauth
Abstract: Using Mikhailov's map from holomorphic functions to supersymmetric D3-brane solutions, we show how to construct giant gravitons in AdS5 x S5 with toroidal topologies. In the 1/4-BPS sector we show that these are always of the form #^K (S2 x S1), and in the limit in which this becomes a set of m+n perpendicular spherical giants re-connected near to their intersections, we find K in terms of m,n. In the 1/8-BPS sector we find a similar class of solutions.
