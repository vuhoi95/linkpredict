Title: Superluminal Propagation and Acausality of Nonlinear Massive Gravity
Authors: S. Deser and K. Izumi and Y. C. Ong and A. Waldron
Abstract: Massive gravity is an old idea: trading geometry for mass. Much effort has been expended on establishing a healthy model, culminating in the current ghost-free version. We summarize here our recent findings -- that it is still untenable -- because it is locally acausal: CTC solutions can be constructed in a small neighborhood of any event.
