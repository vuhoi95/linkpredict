Title: Exact results for the entanglement entropy and the energy radiated by a  quark
Authors: Aitor Lewkowycz and Juan Maldacena
Abstract: We consider a spherical region with a heavy quark in the middle. We compute the extra entanglement entropy due to the presence of a heavy quark both in ${\cal N}=4 $ Super Yang Mills and in the ${\cal N}=6$ Chern-Simons matter theory (ABJM). This is done by relating the computation to the expectation value of a circular Wilson loop and a stress tensor insertion. We also give an exact expression for the Bremsstrahlung function that determines the energy radiated by a quark in the ABJM theory.
