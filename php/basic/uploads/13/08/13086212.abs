Title: Entanglement, Superselection Rules and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: E. Cattaruzza and E. Gozzi and C. Pagani
Abstract: In this paper we show that the energy eigenstates of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) with non definite "fermion" number are entangled states. They are "physical states" of the model provided that observables with odd number of spin variables are allowed in the theory like it happens in the Jaynes-Cummings model. Those states generalize the so called "spin spring" states of the Jaynes-Cummings model which have played an important role in the study of entanglement.
