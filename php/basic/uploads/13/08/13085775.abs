Title: Some Aspects of Supersymmetric Field Theories with Minimal Length and  Maximal Momentum
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and M. Moafi and F. Rezaee Balef
Abstract: We consider a real scalar field and a Majorana fermion field to construct a supersymmetric quantum theory of free fermion fields based on the deformed Heisenberg algebra $[x,p]=i\hbar\big(1-\beta p+2\beta^{2}p^{2}\big)$, where $\beta $ is a deformation parameter. We present a deformed supersymmetric algebra in the presence of minimal length and maximal momentum.
