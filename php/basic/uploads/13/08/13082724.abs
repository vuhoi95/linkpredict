Abstract: In this work we study the presence of kinks in models described by two real scalar fields in bi-dimensional space-time. We generate new two-field models, constructed from distinct but important one-field models, and we solve them with techniques that we introduce in the current work. We illustrate the results with several examples of current interest to high energy physics.
