Title: Signature transition in Einstein-Cartan cosmology
Authors: Babak Vakili and Shahram Jalalzadeh
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity, we consider a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model with Weyssenhoff perfect fluid. We focus attention on those classical solutions that admit a degenerate metric in which the scale factor has smooth behavior in the transition from a Euclidean to a Lorentzian domain. It is shown that the spin-spin contact interaction enables one to obtain such a signature changing solutions due to the Riemann-Cartan ($U_4$) structure of space-time.
