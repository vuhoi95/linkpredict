Title: Snyder Momentum Space in Relative Locality
Authors: Andrzej Banburski and Laurent Freidel
Abstract: The standard approaches of phenomenology of Quantum Gravity have usually explicitly violated Lorentz invariance, either in the dispersion relation or in the addition rule for momenta. We investigate whether it is possible in 3+1 dimensions to have a non local deformation that preserves fully Lorentz invariance, as it is the case in 2+1D Quantum Gravity. We answer positively to this question and show for the first time how to construct a homogeneously curved momentum space preserving the full action of the Lorentz group in dimension 4 and higher, despite relaxing locality. We study the property of this relative locality deformation and show that this space leads to a noncommutativity related to Snyder spacetime.
