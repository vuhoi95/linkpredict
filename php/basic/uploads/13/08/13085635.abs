Abstract: The dynamics of the magnetic field in a superconducting phase is described by an effective massive bosonic field theory. If the superconductor is confined in a domain M with boundary \partial M, the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic fields are predetermined by physics. They are time-reversal and also parity invariant for adapted geometry. They lead to edge excitations while in comparison, the bulk energies have a large gap. A similar phenomenon occurs for topological insulators where appropriate boundary conditions for the Dirac Hamiltonian also lead to similar edge states and an 'incompressible bulk'. They give spin-momentum locking as well. In addition time-reversal and parity invariance emerge for adapted geometry. Similar edge states appear in QCD bag models with chiral boundary conditions.
