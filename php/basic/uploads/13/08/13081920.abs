Abstract: We study the effects of disorder on a holographic superconductor by introducing a random chemical potential on the boundary. We consider various realizations of disorder and find that the critical temperature for superconductivity is enhanced. We also present evidence for a precise form of renormalization in this system. Namely, when the random chemical potential is characterized by a Fourier spectrum of the form $k^{-2\alpha}$ we find that the spectra of the condensate and the charge density are again power-laws, whose exponents are accurately and universally governed by linear functions of $\alpha$.
