Title: Second Order Standard Model
Authors: Johnny Espin and Kirill Krasnov
Abstract: We rewrite the Lagrangian of the fermionic sector of the Standard Model in a novel compact form. The new Lagrangian is second order in derivatives, and is obtained from the usual first order Lagrangian by integrating out all primed (or dotted) 2-component spinors. The Higgs field enters the new Lagrangian non-polynomially, very much like the metric enters the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian of General Relativity. We also discuss unification in the second order formalism, and describe a natural in this framework SU(2)xSU(4) unified theory.
