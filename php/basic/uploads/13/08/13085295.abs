Title: Exact Analytical Solution of the N-dimensional Radial Schrodinger  Equation with Pseudoharmonic Potential via Laplace Transform Approach
Authors: Tapas Das and Altug Arda
Abstract: The second order $N$-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with pseudoharmonic potential is reduced to a first order differential equation by using the Laplace transform approach and exact bound state solutions are obtained using convolution theorem. Some special cases are verified and variation of energy eigenvalues $E_n$ as a function of dimension $N$ are furnished. To give an extra depth of this letter, present approach is also briefly investigated for generalized Morse potential as an example.
