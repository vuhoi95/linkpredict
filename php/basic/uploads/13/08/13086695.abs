Title: Bosonization, Singularity Analysis, Nonlocal Symmetry Reductions and  Exact Solutions of Supersymmetric KdV Equation
Authors: Xiao Nan Gao and S. Y. Lou and Xiao Yan Tang
Abstract: Assuming that there exist at least two fermionic parameters, the classical N= 1 supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries (SKdV) system can be transformed to some coupled bosonic systems. The boson fields in the bosonized SKdV (BSKdV) systems are defined on even Grassmann algebra. Due to the intrusion of other Grassmann parameters, the BSKdV systems are different from the usual non-supersymmetric integrable systems, and many more abundant solution structures can be unearthed. With the help of the singularity analysis, the Painlev\'e property of the BSKdV system is proved and a B\"acklund transformation (BT) is found. The BT related nonlocal symmetry, we call it as residual symmetry, is used to find symmetry reduction solutions of the BSKdV system. Hinted from the symmetry reduction solutions, a more generalized but much simpler method is established to find exact solutions of the BSKdV and then the SKdV systems, which actually can be applied to any fermionic systems.
