Title: Partition function of beta-gamma system on orbifolds
Authors: Chandrasekhar Bhamidipati and Koushik Ray
Abstract: Partition function of beta-gamma systems on the orbifolds C^2/Z_N and C^3/Z_M x Z_N are obtained as the invariant part of that on the respective affine spaces, by lifting the geometric action of the orbifold group to the fields. Interpreting the sum over roots of unity as an elementary contour integration, the partition function evaluates to an infinite series counting invariant monomials composed of basic operators of the theory at each mass level.
