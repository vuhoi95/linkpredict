Title: Quasi-local characteristics of dynamical extreme black holes
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Sumio Yamada and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: Introducing the concept of the extreme trapping horizon, we discuss geometric features of dynamical extreme black holes in four dimensions and then derive the integral identities which hold for the dynamical extreme black holes. We address the causal/geometrical features too.
