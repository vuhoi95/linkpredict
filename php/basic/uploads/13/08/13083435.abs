Title: A note on discrete R symmetries in Z6-II orbifolds with Wilson lines
Authors: Hans Peter Nilles and Saul Ramos-Sanchez and Michael Ratz and Patrick K. S. Vaudrevange
Abstract: We re-derive the R symmetries for the Z6-II orbifold with non-trivial Wilson lines and find expressions for the R charges which differ from those in the literature.
