Title: Some properties of the de Sitter black holes in three dimensional  spacetime
Authors: Yongjoon Kwon and Soonkeon Nam and Jong-Dae Park
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of the de Sitter spacetime and new type-de Sitter black holes in new massive gravity, a higher derivative gravity theory in three dimensions. We calculate thermodynamic quantities and check that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied. In particular, we obtain the energies of the de Sitter spacetime and new type-de Sitter black holes from the renormalized Brown-York boundary stress tensor on the Euclidean surfaces at late temporal infinity. We also obtain the quasinormal modes and by using them we find that the entropy spectra are equally spaced via semi-classical quantization.
