Title: Sources for Generalized Gauge Fields
Authors: Claudio Bunster and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: Generalized gauge fields are tensor fields with mixed symmetries. For gravity and higher spins in dimensions greater than four, the fundamental field in the "magnetic representation" is a generalized gauge field. It is shown that the analog of a point source for a generalized gauge field is a special type of brane whose worldsheet has another brane interwoven into it: a current within a current. In the case of gravity in higher dimensions, this combined extended object is the generalization of a magnetic pole. The Dirac quantization condition for the "electric" and "magnetic" strengths holds.
