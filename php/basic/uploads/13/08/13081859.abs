Abstract: Newtonian fluid dynamics allows the construction of acoustic metrics from which black hole configurations can be studied. However, relativistic pressure effects are neglected within Newtonian theory. We study acoustic black holes in the framework of neo-Newtonian hydrodynamics, which is designed to take into account relativistic inertial effects of the pressure $p$. Within this new hydrodynamical context we show how $p$ can influence the formation of the acoustic horizons.
