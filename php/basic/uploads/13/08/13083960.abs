Title: N=6 conformal supergravity in three dimensions
Authors: M. Nishimura and Y. Tanii
Abstract: N=6 conformal supergravity in three dimensions is studied in an off-shell component field formulation. We obtain local symmetry transformation laws and a Lagrangian of the conformal supergravity multiplet. We then couple it to the ABJM theory and obtain local transformation laws and a Lagrangian of the coupled theory.
