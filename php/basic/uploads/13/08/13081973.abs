Title: Exact Results in Supersymmetric Field Theories on Manifolds with  Boundaries
Authors: Sotaro Sugishita and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric gauge theories on some curved manifolds with boundaries. Our examples include a part of three-sphere and a part of two-sphere. We concentrate on Dirichlet boundary conditions. For these theories on the manifolds with the boundaries, we compute the partition functions and the Wilson loops exactly using the localization technique.
