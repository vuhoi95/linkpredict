Title: Exact cosmological solutions from Hojman conservation quantities
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Mahmood Roshan
Abstract: We present a new approach to find exact solutions for cosmological models. By requiring the existence of a symmetry transformation vector for the equations of motion of the given cosmological model (without using either Lagrangian or Hamiltonian), one can find corresponding Hojman conserved quantities. With the help of these conserved quantities, the analysis of the cosmological model can be simplified. In the case of quintessence scalar-tensor models, we show that the Hojman conserved quantities exist for a wide range of V(\phi)-potentials and allow to find exact solutions for the cosmic scale factor and the scalar field. Finally, we investigate the general cosmological behavior of solutions by adopting a phase-space view.
