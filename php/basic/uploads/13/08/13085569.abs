Abstract: Unlike three-dimensional Einstein gravity, three-dimensional massive gravity admits asymptotically de Sitter space (dS) black hole solutions. These black holes present interesting features and provide us with toy models to study the dS/CFT correspondence. A remarkable property of these black holes is that they are always in thermal equilibrium with the cosmological horizon of the space that hosts them. This invites us to study the thermodynamics of these solutions within the context of dS/CFT. We study the asymptotic symmetry group of the theory and find that it indeed coincides with the local two-dimensional conformal algebra. The charge algebra associated to the asymptotic Killing vectors consists of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with non-vanishing central extension. We compute the mass and angular momentum of the dS black holes and verify that a naive application of Cardy's formula exactly reproduces the entropy of both the black hole and the cosmological horizon. By adapting the holographic renormalization techniques to the case of dS space, we define the boundary stress tensor of the dual Euclidean conformal field theory.
