Title: The closed-string 3-loop amplitude and S-duality
Authors: Humberto Gomez and Carlos R. Mafra
Abstract: The low-energy limit of the four-point 3-loop amplitude (including its overall coefficient) is computed in both type IIA and IIB superstring theories using the pure spinor formalism. The result is shown to agree with the prediction of the coefficient for the type IIB $D^6 R^4$ interaction made by Green and Vanhove based on S-duality considerations.
