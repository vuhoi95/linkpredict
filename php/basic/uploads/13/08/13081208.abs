Title: Noether symmetries in extended gravity quantum cosmology
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Mariafelicia De Laurentis
Abstract: We summarize the use of Noether symmetries in Minisuperspace Quantum Cosmology. In particular, we consider minisuperspace models, showing that the existence of conserved quantities gives selection rules that allow to recover classical behaviors in cosmic evolution according to the so called Hartle criterion. Such a criterion selects correlated regions in the configuration space of dynamical variables whose meaning is related to the emergence of classical observable universes. Some minisuperspace models are worked out starting from Extended Gravity, in particular coming from scalar tensor, f(R) and f(T) theories. Exact cosmological solutions are derived.
