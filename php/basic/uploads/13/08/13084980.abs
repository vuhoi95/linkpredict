Title: Solving 2D QCD with an adjoint fermion analytically
Authors: Emanuel Katz and Gustavo Marques Tavares and Yiming Xu
Abstract: We present an analytic approach to solving 1+1 dimensional QCD with an adjoint Majorana fermion. In the UV this theory is described by a trivial CFT containing free fermions. The quasi-primary operators of this CFT lead to a discrete basis of states which is useful for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of the full strongly interacting theory. Working at large-$N$, we find that the decoupling of high scaling-dimension quasi-primary operators from the low-energy spectrum occurs exponentially fast in their scaling-dimension. This suggests a scheme, whereby, truncating the basis to operators of dimension below $\Delta_{max}$, one can calculate the low-energy spectrum, parametrically to an accuracy of $e^{-\Delta_{max}}$ (although the precise accuracy depends on the state). Choosing $\Delta_{max} =9.5$ we find very good agreement with the known spectrum obtained earlier by numerical DLCQ methods. Specifically, below the first three-particle threshold, we are able to identify all six single-particle bound-states, as well as several two-particle thresholds.
