Title: Gravity duals of N = 2 superconformal field theories with no  electrostatic description
Authors: P. Marios Petropoulos and Konstadinos Sfetsos and Konstadinos Siampos
Abstract: We construct the first eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, which are regular, have no smearing and possess only SO(2,4) x SO(3) x U(1)_R isometry. They are dual to four-dimensional field theories with N = 2 superconformal symmetry. We utilise the Toda frame of self-dual four-dimensional Euclidean metrics with SU(2) rotational symmetry. They are obtained by transforming the Atiyah--Hitchin instanton under SL(2,R) and are expressed in terms of theta functions. The absence of any extra U(1) symmetry, even asymptotically, renders inapplicable the electrostatic description of our solution.
