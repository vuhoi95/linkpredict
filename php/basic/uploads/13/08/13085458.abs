Title: Relativistic conformal symmetry of neural field propagation in the brain
Authors: Juan M. Romero and Carlos Trenado and Berenice Aguilar and Miriam Tirradentro
Abstract: In this paper, we address a neural field equation that characterizes spatio-temporal propagation of a neural population pulse. Due that the human brain is a complex system whose constituents interaction give rise to fundamental states of consciousness and behavior, it is crucial to gain insight into its functioning even at relativistic scales. To this end, we study the action of the relativistic conformal group on the accounted neural field propagation equation. In particular, we obtain an exact solution for the field propagation equation when the space-time is 3 or 4 dimensional. Furthermore, in the 4 dimensional case and the large distance limit, it is shown that the neural population pulse becomes a Yukawa potential.
