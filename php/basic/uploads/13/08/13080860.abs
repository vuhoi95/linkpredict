Title: Nonbaryonic dark matter and scalar field coupled with a transversal  interaction plus decoupled radiation
Authors: Luis P. Chimento and Mart√≠n G. Richarte
Abstract: We analyze a universe filled with interacting dark matter, a scalar field accommodated as dark radiation along with dark energy plus a decoupled radiation term within the framework of spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime. We work in a three-dimensional internal space spanned by the interaction vector and use a transversal interaction $\mathbf{Q_t}$ for solving the source equation in order to find all the interacting component energy densities. We asymptotically reconstruct the scalar field and potential from an early radiation era to the late dominate dark energy one, passing through an intermediate epoch dominated by dark matter. We apply the $\chi^{2}$ method to the updated observational Hubble data for constraining the cosmic parameters, contrast with the Union 2 sample of supernovae, and analyze the amount of dark energy in the radiation era. It turns out that our model fulfills the severe bound of $\Omega_{\rm \phi}(z\simeq 1100)<0.018$ at $2\sigma$ level, is consistent with the recent analysis that includes cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope along with the future constraints achievable by Planck and CMBPol experiments, and satisfies the stringent bound $\Omega_{\rm \phi}(z\simeq 10^{10})<0.04$ at $2\sigma$ level in the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch.
