Title: Bertotti-Robinson solutions of D=5 Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Lambda  theory
Authors: Adel Bouchareb and Chiang-Mei Chen and Gérard Clément and Dmitri V. Gal'tsov
Abstract: We present a series of new solutions in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an arbitrary Chern-Simons coupling $\gamma$ and a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. For general $\gamma$ and $\Lambda$ we give various generalizations of the Bertotti-Robinson solutions supported by electric and magnetic fluxes, some of which presumably describe the near-horizon regions of black strings or black rings. Among them there is a solution which could apply to the horizon of a topological AdS black ring in gauged minimal supergravity. Others are horizonless and geodesically complete. We also construct extremal asymptotically flat multi-string solutions for $\Lambda=0$ and arbitrary $\gamma$.
