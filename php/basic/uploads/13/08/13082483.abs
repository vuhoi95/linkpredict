Title: Holograghic Brownian motion in three dimensional GÃ¶del black hole
Authors: J. Sadeghi and F. Pourasadollah and H. Vaez
Abstract: By using the AdS/CFT correspondence and G\"{o}del black hole background, we study the dynamics of heavy quark under a rotating plasma. In that case we follow Atmaja (JHEP 1304, 021, (2013)) about Brownian motion in BTZ black hole. In this paper we receive some new results for the case of $\alpha^{2}l^{2}\neq1$. This case, we must redefine the angular velocity of string fluctuation. We obtain the time evolution of displacement square that angular velocity and show that it behaves as a Brownian particle in non-relativistic limit. In this plasma, it seems that relating the Brownian motion with physical observables is rather a difficult work. But our results match with Atmaja work in the limit $\alpha^{2}l^{2}\rightarrow1$.
