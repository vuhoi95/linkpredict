Title: Applications of homological mirror symmetry to hypergeometric systems:  duality conjectures
Authors: Lev A. Borisov and R. Paul Horja
Abstract: Homological mirror symmetry for crepant resolutions of Gorenstein toric singularities leads to a pair of conjectures on certain hypergeometric systems of PDEs. We explain these conjectures and verify them in some cases.
