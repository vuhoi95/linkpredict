Title: Size of the Gribov region in curved spacetime
Authors: Marco de Cesare and Giampiero Esposito and Hossein Ghorbani
Abstract: Recent work in the literature has argued that the joint effect of spacetime curvature and the Gribov ambiguity may introduce further modifications to the Green functions in the infrared. This paper focuses on a simple criterion for studying the effect of spacetime curvature on the size of the Gribov region, improving the accuracy of the previous analysis. It is shown that, depending on the sign of the scalar and Riemann curvature, the Gribov horizon moves inward or, instead, outward with respect to the case of flat spacetime. This is made clear by two novel inequalities here derived for the first time.
