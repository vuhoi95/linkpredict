Title: Exact Results In Two-Dimensional (2,2) Supersymmetric Gauge Theories  With Boundary
Authors: Kentaro Hori and Mauricio Romo
Abstract: We compute the partition function on the hemisphere of a class of two-dimensional (2,2) supersymmetric field theories including gauged linear sigma models. The result provides a general exact formula for the central charge of the D-brane placed at the boundary. It takes the form of Mellin-Barnes integral and the question of its convergence leads to the grade restriction rule concerning branes near the phase boundaries. We find expressions in various phases including the large volume formula in which a characteristic class called the Gamma class shows up. The two sphere partition function factorizes into two hemispheres glued by inverse to the annulus. The result can also be written in a form familiar in mirror symmetry, and suggests a way to find explicit mirror correspondence between branes.
