Title: Remarks on positive energy vacua via effective potentials in string  theory
Authors: Sujan P. Dabholkar and Marcelo M. Disconzi and Vamsi P. Pingali
Abstract: We study warped compactifications of string/M theory with the help of effective potentials, continuing previous work of the last two authors and Michael R. Douglas presented in arXiv:1206.1885. The dynamics of the conformal factor of the internal metric, which is responsible for instabilities in these constructions, is explored, and such instabilities are investigated in the context of de Sitter vacua. We prove existence results for the equations of motion in the case of a slowly varying warp factor, and the stability of such solutions is also addressed. These solutions are a family of meta-stable de Sitter vacua from type IIB string theory in a general non-supersymmetric setup.
