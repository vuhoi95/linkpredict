Title: Casimir energy in the Gribov-Zwanziger approach to QCD
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Luigi Rosa
Abstract: In this paper we study the Casimir energy of QCD within the Gribov-Zwanziger approach. In this model non-perturbative effects of gauge copies are properly taken into account. We show that the computation of the Casimir energy for the MIT bag model within the (refined) Gribov-Zwanziger approach not only gives the correct sign but it also gives an estimate for the radius of the bag.
