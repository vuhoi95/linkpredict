Title: Spherically symmetric vacuum solutions arising from trace dynamics  modifications to gravitation
Authors: Stephen L. Adler and Fethi M. Ramazanoglu
Abstract: We derive the equations governing static, spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein equations, as modified by the frame-dependent effective action arising from trace dynamics. We give analytic and numerical results for the solutions of these equations, first in polar coordinates, and then in isotropic coordinates. General features of the static case are that (i) there is no horizon, since $g_{00}$ is non-vanishing for finite values of the polar radius, and only vanishes (in isotropic coordinates) at the internal singularity, (ii) the Ricci scalar $R$ vanishes identically, and (iii) there is a physical singularity at cosmological distances. The large distance singularity may be an artifact of the static restriction, since we find that the behavior at large distances is altered in a time-dependent solution using the Mc Vittie Ansatz.
