Title: An O(D,D) Invariant Hamiltonian Action for the Superstring
Authors: Chris D. A. Blair and Emanuel Malek and Alasdair J. Routh
Abstract: We construct O(D,D) invariant actions for the bosonic string and RNS superstring, using Hamiltonian methods and ideas from double field theory. In this framework the doubled coordinates of double field theory appear as coordinates on phase space and T-duality becomes a canonical transformation. Requiring the algebra of constraints to close leads to the section condition, which splits the phase space coordinates into spacetime coordinates and momenta.
