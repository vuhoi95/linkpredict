Title: Collective coordinate approximation to the scattering of solitons in the  (1+1) dimensional NLS model
Authors: H. E. Baron and G. Luchini and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We present a collective coordinate approximation to model the dynamics of two interacting nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) solitons. We discuss the accuracy of this approximation by comparing our results to those of the full numerical simulations and find that it is remarkably accurate not only when the solitons are some distance apart but also during their interaction.
