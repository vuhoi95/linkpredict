Title: Spectra of Coset Sigma Models
Authors: Constantin Candu and Vladimir Mitev and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We compute the complete 1-loop spectrum of anomalous dimensions for the bulk fields of non-linear sigma models on symmetric coset (super)spaces G/H, both with and without world-sheet supersymmetry. In addition, we provide two new methods for the construction of partition functions in the infinite radius limit and demonstrate their efficiency in the case of (super)sphere sigma models. Our results apply to a large number of target spaces including superspheres and superprojective spaces such as the N=2 sigma model on CP(3|4).
