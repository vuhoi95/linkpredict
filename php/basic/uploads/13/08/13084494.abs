Title: Twisted-Mass Potential on the Non-Abelian String World Sheet Induced by  Bulk Masses
Authors: Pavel A. Bolokhov and Mikhail Shifman and Alexei Yung
Abstract: We derive the twisted-mass potential in N=(2,2) CP(N-1) theory on the world sheet of the non-Abelian string from the bulk N=2 theory with massive (s)quarks by determining the profile functions of the adjoint fields. Although this potential was indirectly found some time ago, this is the first direct derivation from the bulk. As an application of the adjoint field profiles, we compute and confirm the $ | \mu \sigma | $ potential (where $ \sigma $ is a scalar field in the gauge supermultiplet) which arises in the effective two-dimensional theory on the string due to the supersymmetry breaking bulk mass term $ \mu A^2 $ for the adjoint matter.
