Title: Exploring Spiral Inflation in String Theory
Authors: Pontus Ahlqvist and Brian Greene and David Kagan
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that spiral inflation can be realized using the near-conifold flux potentials for the complex structure moduli in type IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. Using the explicit form of the flux potential for complex structure moduli, we provide analytical and numerical arguments showing that spiral inflation is difficult to support. We also show that for this sector of low energy string theories, a viable spiral inflationary scenario would owe its success to a de Sitter-like vacuum energy, with minimal reliance on the non-gradient flow field trajectories which characterize spiral inflation. We thus conclude that even though the near conifold region has the requisite multi-sheeted potential called for by spiral inflation, generically it appears that spiral inflation is not realized using the complex structure flux potential alone.
