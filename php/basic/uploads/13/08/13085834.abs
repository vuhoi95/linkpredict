Title: On the effective superpotential in the generic higher-derivative  three-dimensional scalar superfield theory
Authors: F. S. Gama and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We formulate a generic three-dimensional higher-derivative superfield theory for self-interacting scalar superfield action. We consider the cases of real and complex scalar superfields. For these theories, we explicitly calculate the one-loop effective potential.
