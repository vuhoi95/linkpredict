Title: Who Ordered the Anti-de Sitter Tangent Group?
Authors: Ali H. Chamseddine and Viatcheslav Mukhanov
Abstract: General relativity can be unambiguously formulated with Lorentz, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter tangent groups, which determine the fermionic representations. We show that besides of the Lorentz group only anti-de Sitter tangent group is consistent with all physical requirements.
