Title: Collider constraints on Gauss-Bonnet coupling in warped geometry model
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Soumya Sadhukhan and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: In this paper the requirement of a warp solution in an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet 5D warped geometry is shown to fix the signature of Gauss-Bonnet coupling ($\alpha_{5}$). Further, imposing the phenomenological constraints, obtained from the recently observed Higgs like scalar mass as well as $\mu$ parameter of the decay channels ${H}_{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma,\tau{\bar \tau}$ explored in ATLAS and CMS detectors, we obtain a stringent bound on $\alpha_{5}$ within $(4.8 - 5.1)\times 10^{-7}$.
