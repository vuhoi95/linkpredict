Abstract: We study the locally rotational symmetry Bianchi type-I dark energy model in the framework of $f(T)$ theory of gravity, where $T$ denotes the torsion scalar. A viable cosmological model is undertaken and the isotropization of this latter is checked, yielding a result that reflects the real evolution of our universe. Moreover, still in the anisotropic optic, a more complicated $f(T)$ model is obtained from the cosmological reconstruction scheme and the analysis shows that the universe is more anisotropic at the beginning if the terms of higher order in $T$ are not considered. This means that the non-linear model should be favoured by observational data.
