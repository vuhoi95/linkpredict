Title: High Energy Scattering in Perturbative Quantum Gravity at Next to  Leading Power
Authors: Ratindranath Akhoury and Ryo Saotome and George Sterman
Abstract: We consider the relativistic scattering of unequal-mass scalar particles through graviton exchange in the small-angle high-energy regime and calculate the scattering amplitude up to the next-to-leading eikonal correction, including gravitational effects of the same order. We find that only one set of these power corrections (the seagull and graviton loop contributions) are consistent with the exponentiation of a corrected phase in impact parameter space, once all possible graviton exchanges are summed. The other set (arising from propagator expansions) starts at the second loop order. Both of these leading power corrections are suppressed by a single power of the ratio of momentum transfer to the energy of the light particle in the rest frame of the heavy particle, independent of the heavy particle mass. For large enough heavy-particle mass, the saddle point for the impact parameter is modified compared to the leading order by a multiple of the Schwarzschild radius determined by the mass of the heavy particle, independent of the energy of the light particle.
