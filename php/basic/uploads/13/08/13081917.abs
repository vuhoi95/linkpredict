Title: Entropy of a Rindler Observer
Authors: O. Brauer and E. Kirchuk and L. Raviola and M. Socolovsky
Abstract: We compute the entropy of a Rindler particle-detector (observer) in the presence of a quantum field in the Minkowski vacuum state; due to the Unruh effect, the observer is immersed in a thermal bath at a temperature proportional to its proper acceleration.
