Abstract: In this paper we consider several phenomenological models of variable $\Lambda$. Model of a flat Universe with variable $\Lambda$ and $G$ is accepted. It is well known, that varying $G$ and $\Lambda$ gives rise to modified field equations and modified conservation laws, which gives rise to many different manipulations and assumptions in literature. We will consider two component fluid, which parameters will enter to $\Lambda$. Interaction between fluids with energy densities $\rho_{1}$ and $\rho_{2}$ assumed as $Q=3Hb(\rho_{1}+\rho_{2})$. We have numerical analyze of important cosmological parameters like EoS parameter of the composed fluid and deceleration parameter $q$ of the model.
