Title: Cosmic censorship in Lovelock theory
Authors: Xian O. Camanho and Jose D. Edelstein
Abstract: In analyzing maximally symmetric Lovelock black holes with non-planar horizon topologies, many novel features have been observed. The existence of finite radius singularities, a mass gap in the black hole spectrum and solutions displaying multiple horizons are noteworthy examples. Naively, in all these cases, the appearance of naked singularities seems unavoidable, leading to the question of whether these theories are consistent gravity theories. We address this question and show that whenever the cosmic censorship conjecture is threaten, an instability generically shows up driving the system to a new configuration with presumably no naked singularities. Also, the same kind of instability shows up in the process of spherical black holes evaporation in these theories, suggesting a new phase for their decay. We find circumstantial evidence indicating that, contrary to many claims in the literature, the cosmic censorship hypothesis holds in Lovelock theory.
