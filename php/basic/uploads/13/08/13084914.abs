Title: No one-loop gauge anomalies for a Lorentz-violating quantum  electrodynamics: Evaluation of the three-photon vertex
Authors: Daniel H. T. Franco and Andr√© H. Gomes
Abstract: Identification of the diagrams that can lead to gauge anomalies in the (minimal) Lorentz- and $CPT$-violating extension of quantum electrodynamics reveals these are the electron self-energy and vertex correction (related to the Ward-Takahashi identity), the photon self-energy (related to the vacuum polarization tensor transversality), and the three-photon vertex diagrams. All but the latter were explicitly verified to be free of anomalies to first order in loop expansion. Here we provide this remaining evaluation and verify the absence of anomalies in this process.
