Title: Casimir Torque for a Perfectly Conducting Wedge: A Canonical Quantum  Field Theoretical Approach
Authors: H. Razmi and S. M. Modarresi
Abstract: The torque density per unit height exerted on a perfectly conducting wedge due to the quantum vacuum fluctuations (the Casimir torque) is obtained. A canonical quantum field theoretical approach with the method of calculating vacuum-to-vacuum propagator (Green function) [1] is used.
