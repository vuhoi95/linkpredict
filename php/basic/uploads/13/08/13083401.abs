Title: On the consistency of non-minimally coupled f(R) gravity
Authors: Nicola Tamanini and Tomi S. Koivisto
Abstract: Theories with a non-minimal coupling between the space-time curvature and matter fields introduce an extra force due to the non-conservation of the matter energy momentum. In the present work the theoretical consistency of such couplings is studied using a scalar field Lagrangian to model the matter content. The conditions that the coupling does not introduce ghosts, classical instabilities or superluminal propagation of perturbations are derived. These consistency conditions are then employed to rule out or severely restrict the forms of the non-minimal coupling functions considered in the previous literature. For example, a power-law coupling is viable only for sublinear positive power of the curvature scalar.
