Authors: Naresh Dadhich and Sushant G. Ghosh and Sanjay Jhingan
Abstract: We study collapse of inhomogeneous dust and null dust (Vaidya radiation) in pure Lovelock gravity in higher dimensions. Since pure Lovelock gravity is kinematic in odd d=2N+1 dimension, hence pertinent dimension for the study is even d=2N+2, where N is degree of Lovelock polynomial. It turns out that pure Lovelock collapse favors naked singularity as against black hole for the Einstein case in the same dimension while strength of singularity as measured by divergence of Kretshmann scalar is interestingly the same in the two cases; i.e. the corresponding scalars have the same fall off behavior.
