Title: Equations of motion in gravity theories with nonminimal coupling: a  loophole to detect torsion macroscopically?
Authors: Dirk Puetzfeld and Yuri N. Obukhov
Abstract: We derive multipolar equations of motion for gravitational theories with general nonminimal coupling in spacetimes admitting torsion. Our very general findings allow for the systematic testing of whole classes of theories by means of extended test bodies. One peculiar feature of certain subclasses of nonminimal theories turns out to be their sensitivity to post-Riemannian spacetime structures even in experiments without microstructured test matter.
