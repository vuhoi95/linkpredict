Title: On the gauge independence of the fermion pole mass
Authors: Ashok K. Das and R. R. Francisco and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study the question of complete gauge independence of the fermion pole mass by choosing a general class of gauge fixing which interpolates between the covariant, the axial and the Coulomb gauges for different values of the gauge fixing parameters. We derive the Nielsen identity describing the gauge parameter variation of the fermion two point function in this general class of gauges. Furthermore, we relate the denominator of the fermion propagator to the two point function. This then allows us to study directly the gauge parameter dependence of the denominator of the propa- gator using the Nielsen identity for the two point function. This leads to a simple proof that, when infrared divergences and mass shell singularities are not present at the pole, the fermion pole mass is gauge independent, in the complete sense, to all orders in perturbation theory. Namely, the pole is not only independent of the gauge fixing parameters, but has also the same value in both covariant and non-covariant gauges.
