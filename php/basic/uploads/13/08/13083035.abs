Title: Separability and Dynamical Symmetry of Quantum Dots
Authors: P. -M. Zhang and L. -P. Zou and P. A. Horvathy and G. W. Gibbons
Abstract: The separability and Runge-Lenz-type dynamical symmetry of the internal dynamics of certain two-electron Quantum Dots, found by Simonovi\'c et al. [1], is traced back to that of the perturbed Kepler problem. A large class of axially symmetric perturbing potentials which allow for separation in parabolic coordinates can easily be found. Apart of the 2:1 anisotropic harmonic trapping potential considered in [1], they include a constant electric field parallel to the magnetic field (Stark effect), the ring-shaped Hartmann potential, etc. The harmonic case is studied in detail.
