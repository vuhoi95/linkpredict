Title: Monopoles without magnetic charges: Finite energy monopole-antimonopole  configurations in CP1 model and restricted QCD
Authors: L. P. Zou and P. M. Zhang and D. G. Pak
Abstract: We propose a new type of regular monopole-like field configuration in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and CP^1 model. The monopole configuration can be treated as a monopole-antimonopole pair without localized magnetic charges. An exact numeric solution for a simple monopole-antimonopole solution has been obtained in CP^1 model with an appropriate potential term. We suppose that similar monopole solutions may exist in effective theories of QCD and in the electroweak standard model.
