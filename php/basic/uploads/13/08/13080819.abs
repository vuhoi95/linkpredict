Title: Entanglement Temperature in Non-conformal Cases
Authors: Song He and Danning Li and Jun-Bao Wu
Abstract: Potential reconstruction can be used to find various analytical asymptotical AdS solutions in Einstein dilation system generally. We have generated two simple solutions without physical singularity called zero temperature solutions. We also proposed a numerical way to obtain black hole solution in Einstein dilaton system with special dilaton potential. By using this method, we obtain the corresponding black hole solutions numerically and investigate the thermal stability of the black hole by comparing the free energy of thermal gas and the corresponding black hole. In two groups of non-conformal gravity solutions obtained in this paper, we find that the two thermal gas solutions are more unstable than black hole solutions respectively. Finally, we consider black hole solutions as a thermal state of zero temperature solutions to check that the first thermal dynamical law exists in entanglement system from holographic point of view.
