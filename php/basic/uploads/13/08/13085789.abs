Title: Conformal symmetry and accelerating cosmology in teleparallel gravity
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Sergei D. Odintsov and Diego Sáez-Gómez
Abstract: We discuss conformal issues of pure and extended teleparallel gravity. In particular, we present formulations of conformal transformation in teleparallel gravity. Furthermore, we propose conformal scalar and gauge field theories in teleparallel gravity and study conformal torsion gravity. We explicitly demonstrate that a power-law acceleration (including the $\Lambda$CDM universe) as well as the de Sitter expansion of the universe can be realized in extended teleparallel gravity with a conformal scalar field, and that pure teleparallel gravity with a conformal scalar field can lead to the $\Lambda$CDM model. It is also shown that there can exist the de Sitter solution in conformal torsion gravity.
