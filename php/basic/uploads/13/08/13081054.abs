Title: Thermodynamics of a charged hairy black hole in (2+1) dimensions
Authors: J. Sadeghi and H. Farahani
Abstract: In this paper we study thermodynamics, statistics and spectroscopic aspects of a charged black hole with a scalar hair coupled to the gravity in (2+1) dimensions. We obtained effects of the black hole charge and scalar field on the thermodynamical and statistical quantities. We find that scalar charge may increase entropy, temperature and probability, while may decrease black hole mass, free and internal energy. Also electric charge increases probability and decreases temperature and internal energy. Also we investigate stability of the system and find that the thermodynamical stability exists.
