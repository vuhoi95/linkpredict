Title: Constructing analytical solutions of linear perturbations of inflation  with modified dispersion relations
Authors: Tao Zhu and Anzhong Wang and Gerald Cleaver and Klaus Kirsten and Qin Sheng
Abstract: We develop a technique to construct analytical solutions of the linear perturbations of inflation with a nonlinear dispersion relation, due to quantum effects of the early universe. Error bounds are given and studied in detail. The analytical solutions describe the exact evolution of the perturbations extremely well even when only the first-order approximations is used.
