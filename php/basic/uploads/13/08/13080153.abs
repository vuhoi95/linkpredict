Title: New solvable sigma models in plane--parallel wave background
Authors: Ladislav Hlavaty and Ivo Petr
Abstract: We explicitly solve the classical equations of motion for strings in backgrounds obtained as non-abelian T-duals of a homogeneous isotropic plane-parallel wave. To construct the dual backgrounds, semi-abelian Drinfeld doubles are used which contain the isometry group of the homogeneous plane wave metric. The dual solutions are then found by the Poisson-Lie transformation of the explicit solution of the original homogeneous plane wave background. Investigating their Killing vectors, we have found that the dual backgrounds can be transformed to the form of more general plane-parallel waves.
