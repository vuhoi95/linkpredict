Title: Standard and exotic singularities regularized by varying constants
Authors: Mariusz P. Dabrowski and Konrad Marosek and Adam Balcerzak
Abstract: We review the variety of new singularities in homogeneous and isotropic FRW cosmology which differ from standard Big-Bang and Big-Crunch singularities and suggest how the nature of these singularities can be influenced by the varying fundamental constants.
