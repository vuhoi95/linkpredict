Title: Heterotic G_2-manifold compactifications with fluxes and fermionic  condensates
Authors: Karl-Philip Gemmer and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We consider flux compactifications of heterotic string theory in the presence of fermionic condensates on M_{1,2} times X_7 with both factors carrying a Killing spinor. In other words, M_{1,2} is either de Sitter, anti-de Sitter or Minkowski, and X_7 possesses a nearly parallel G_2-structure or has G_2-holonomy. We solve the complete set of field equations and the Bianchi identity to order alpha'. The latter is satisfied via a non-standard embedding by choosing the gauge field to be a G_2-instanton. It is shown that none of the solutions to the field equations is supersymmetric.
