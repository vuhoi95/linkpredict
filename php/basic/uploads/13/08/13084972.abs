Title: The tensor hierarchy simplified
Authors: Jesper Greitz and Paul Howe and Jakob Palmkvist
Abstract: A compact formulation of the field-strengths, Bianchi identities and gauge transformations for tensor hierarchies in gauged maximal supergravity theories is given. A key role in the construction is played by the recently-introduced tensor hierarchy algebra.
