Title: Lecture Notes on Turbulent Instability of Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
Authors: Maciej Maliborski and Andrzej Rostworowski
Abstract: In these lecture notes we discuss recently conjectured instability of anti-de Sitter space, resulting in gravitational collapse of a large class of arbitrarily small initial perturbations. We uncover the technical details used in the numerical study of spherically symmetric Einstein-massless scalar field system with negative cosmological constant that led to the conjectured instability.
