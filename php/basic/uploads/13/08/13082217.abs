Title: Exact results for boundaries and domain walls in 2d supersymmetric  theories
Authors: Daigo Honda and Takuya Okuda
Abstract: We apply supersymmetric localization to N=(2,2) gauged linear sigma models on a hemisphere, with boundary conditions, i.e., D-branes, preserving B-type supersymmetries. We explain how to compute the hemisphere partition function for each object in the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves, and argue that it depends only on its K theory class. The hemisphere partition function computes exactly the central charge of the D-brane, completing the well-known formula obtained by an anomaly inflow argument. We also formulate supersymmetric domain walls as D-branes in the product of two theories. In particular 4d line operators bound to a surface operator, corresponding via the AGT relation to certain defects in Toda CFT's, are constructed as domain walls. Moreover we exhibit domain walls that realize the sl(2) affine Hecke algebra.
