Title: Hierarchy of Fermion Masses in the 5D Standing Wave Braneworld
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Giorgi Tukhashvili
Abstract: The localization problem for massive fermions in the 5D standing wave braneworld is considered. The fermion generations on the brane are explained by the existence of three nodes of standing waves in the bulk, where the left and right modes of the 5D fermion are localized and Dirac-type couplings mixes them. We show that in this model the structure of peaks of the left and right fermion wavefunctions in extra dimension leads to the observed mass spectrum of the up and down quark families.
