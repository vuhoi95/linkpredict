Title: Hawking temperature and the emergent cosmic space
Authors: M. Hashemi and S. Jalalzadeh and S. Vasheghani Farahani
Abstract: The aim of this work is to model the evolution of the cosmic space based on thermodynamical parameters. The universe is considered to have an apparent horizon radius with a Kodama-Hayward temperature assigned to it. The method is founded on the fact proposed by Padmanabhan [1,2] that the subtraction of the surface and bulk degrees of freedom provides information on the cosmic space emergence. The fact of the matter is that in this approach the Raychaudhuri equation could even be obtained by the consideration of only thermodynamical parameters. As such, the standard general relativity is taken as the starting point where by implementing the standard cosmological equations we obtain a generalized evolutionary equation supporting emergence of the cosmic space. The method proposed in this work would provide basis for other cosmological models to have an emergent perspective.
