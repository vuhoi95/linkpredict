Title: Inflation induced by Gravitino Condensation in Supergravity
Authors: John Ellis and Nick E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We discuss the emergence of an inflationary phase in supergravity with the super-Higgs effect due to dynamical spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry, in which the role of the inflaton is played by the gravitino condensate. Realistic models compatible with the Planck satellite CMB data are found in conformal supergravity scenarios with dynamical gravitino masses that are small compared to the Planck mass, as could be induced by a non-trivial vacuum expectation value of the dilaton superfield of appropriate magnitude.
