Title: Two-loop finiteness of self-energies in higher-derivative SQED3
Authors: E. A. Gallegos and R. Baptista
Abstract: In the superfield formalism, two higher-derivative kinetic operators (Lee-Wick operators) are implemented into the standard three dimensional supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics for improving its ultraviolet behavior. It is shown in particular that the ghosts associated with these Lee-Wick operators allow to remove all ultraviolet divergences in the scalar and gauge self-energies at two-loop level.
