Title: Friedmann equations in braneworld scenarios from emergence of cosmic  space
Authors: A. Sheykhi and M. H. Dehghani and S. E. Hosseini
Abstract: Recently, it was argued that the spacetime dynamics can be understood by calculating the difference between the degrees of freedom on the boundary and in the bulk in a region of space. In this Letter, we apply this new idea to braneworld scenarios and extract the corresponding Friedmann equations of $(n-1)$-dimensional brane embedded in the $(n+1)$-dimensional bulk with any spacial curvature. We will also extend our study to the more general Gauss-Bonnet braneworld with curvature correction terms on the brane and in the bulk, and derive the dynamical equation in a nonflat Universe.
