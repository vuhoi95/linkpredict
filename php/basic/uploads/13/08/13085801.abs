Title: Transparent Dirac potentials in one dimension: the time-dependent case
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Michael Thies
Abstract: We generalize the original derivation of transparent, static Schroedinger potentials by Kay and Moses, to obtain a large class of time-dependent transparent Dirac potentials in one spatial dimension. They contain all known transparent potentials as special cases and play a key role in the semi-classical solution of 1+1 dimensional, fermionic quantum field theories of Gross-Neveu and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type.
