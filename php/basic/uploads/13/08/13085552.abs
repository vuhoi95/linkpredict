Title: N=6 superconformal gravity in three dimensions from superspace
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Joseph Novak and Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli
Abstract: A unique feature of N=6 conformal supergravity in three dimensions is that the super Cotton tensor W^{IJKL} can equivalently be viewed, via the Hodge duality, as the field strength of an Abelian vector multiplet, W^{IJ}. Using this observation and the conformal superspace techniques developed in arXiv:1305.3132 and arXiv:1306.1205, we construct the off-shell action for N=6 conformal supergravity. The complete component action is also worked out.
