Title: Bohm Trajectories as Approximations to Properly Fluctuating Quantum  Trajectories
Authors: Pisin Chen and Hagen Kleinert
Abstract: We explain the approximate nature of particle trajectories in Bohm's quantum mechanics. They are streamlines of a superfluid in Madelung's reformulation of the Schr\"{o}dinger wave function, around which the proper particle trajectories perform their quantum mechanical fluctuations to ensure Heisenberg's uncertainty relation between position and momentum.
