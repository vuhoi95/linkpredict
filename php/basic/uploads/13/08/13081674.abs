Title: Renormalization group equations and matching in a general quantum field  theory with kinetic mixing
Authors: Renato M. Fonseca and Michal Malinsky and Florian Staub
Abstract: We work out a set of simple rules for adopting the two-loop renormalization group equations of a generic gauge field theory given in the seminal works of Machacek and Vaughn to the most general case with an arbitrary number of Abelian gauge factors and comment on the extra subtleties possibly encountered upon matching a set of effective gauge theories in such a framework.
