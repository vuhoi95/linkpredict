Abstract: In this paper the results of numerical simulation of monolayer graphene in external magnetic field are presented. The numerical simulation is performed in the effective lattice field theory with noncompact $3 + 1$-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge fields and $2 + 1$-dimensional staggered lattice fermions. The dependences of fermion condensate and graphene conductivity on the dielectric permittivity of substrate for different values of external magnetic field are calculated. It is found that magnetic field shifts insulator-semimetal phase transition to larger values of the dielectric permittivity of substrate. The phase diagram of graphene in external magnetic field is drawn.
