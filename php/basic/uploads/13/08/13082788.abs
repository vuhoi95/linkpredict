Title: Quantum dynamics of the harmonic oscillator on a cylinder
Authors: K. Kowalski and J. Rembieli≈Ñski
Abstract: Evolution of coherent states is considered for a particle confined to a cylinder moving in a harmonic oscillator potential. Because of the discontinuous changes as time goes by of the phase representing the position of a particle on a parallel (circle) the trajectory pattern of quantum averages specifying coordinates on a cylinder is very complex and in some aspects resembles chaotic one.
