Title: Classical chiral kinetic theory and anomalies in even space-time  dimensions
Authors: Vatsal Dwivedi and Michael Stone
Abstract: We propose a classical action for the motion of massless Weyl fermions in a background gauge field in (2N+1)+1 spacetime dimensions. We use this action to derive the collisionless Boltzmann equation for a gas of such particles, and show how classical versions of the gauge and Abelian chiral anomalies arise from the Chern character of the non-Abelian Berry connection that parallel transports the spin degree of freedom in momentum space.
