Title: Toroidal Lie superalgebras and free field representations
Authors: Naihuan Jing and Chongbin Xu
Abstract: A loop-algebraic presentation is given for toroidal Lie superalgebras of classical types. Based on the loop superalgebra presentation free field realizations of toroidal Lie superalgebras are constructed for types $A(m,n)$, $B(m,n)$, C(n) and $D(m,n)$.
