Title: Time-reparametrization invariance and Hamilton-Jacobi approach to the  cosmological sigma-model
Authors: Jan-Willem van Holten and Richard Kerner
Abstract: The construction of physical models with local time-reparametrization invariance is reviewed. Negative-energy contributions to the hamiltonian are shown to be crucial for the realization of this reparametrization symmetry. The covariant formulation of the dynamics is used to develop a time and gauge invariant Hamilton-Jacobi theory. This formalism is applied to solve for the cosmology of a homogeneous universe of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker type. After a discussion of empty universes, the FLRW theory is extended with homogeneous scalar fields generically described by a $\sg$-model on some scalar manifold. An explicit gauge-invariant solution is constructed for the non-linear O(N)-models.
