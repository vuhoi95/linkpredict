Title: Some Electronic Properties of Metals through q-Deformed Algebras
Authors: Damien Tristant and Francisco A. Brito
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of metals by applying q-deformed algebras. We shall mainly focus our attention on q-deformed Sommerfeld parameter as a function of q-deformed electronic specific heat. The results revealed that q-deformation acts as a factor of disorder or impurity, modifying the characteristics of a crystalline structure and thereby controlling the number of electrons per unit volume.
