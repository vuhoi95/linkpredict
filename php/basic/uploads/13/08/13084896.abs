Authors: Francesco Benini and Richard Eager and Kentaro Hori and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We compute the elliptic genera of general two-dimensional N=(2,2) and N=(0,2) gauge theories. We find that the elliptic genus is given by the sum of Jeffrey-Kirwan residues of a meromorphic form, representing the one-loop determinant of fields, on the moduli space of flat connections on T^2. We give several examples illustrating our formula, with both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge groups, and discuss some dualities for U(k) and SU(k) theories. This paper is a sequel to the authors' previous paper arXiv:1305.0533.
