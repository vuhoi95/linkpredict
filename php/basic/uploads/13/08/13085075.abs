Title: Higgs Mass Bounds from Renormalization Flow for a simple Yukawa model
Authors: Holger Gies and Clemens Gneiting and Ren√© Sondenheimer
Abstract: We study the functional renormalization group flow of a Higgs-Yukawa toy model mimicking the top-Higgs sector of the standard model. This approach allows for treating arbitrary bare couplings. For the class of standard bare potentials of \phi^4-type at a given ultraviolet cut-off, we show that a finite infrared Higgs mass range emerges naturally from the renormalization group flow itself. Higgs masses outside the resulting bounds cannot be connected to any conceivable set of bare parameters in this standard-model \phi^4 class. By contrast, more general bare potentials allow to diminish the lower bound considerably. We identify a simple renormalization group mechanism for this depletion of the lower bound. If active also in the full standard model, Higgs masses smaller than the conventional infrared window do not necessarily require new physics at low scales or give rise to instability problems.
