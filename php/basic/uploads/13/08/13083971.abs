Title: Thermal Width of Quarkonium from Holography
Authors: Kazem Bitaghsir Fadafan and Seyed Kamal Tabatabaei
Abstract: From the AdS/CFT correspondence, the effects of charge and finite 't Hooft coupling correction on the thermal width of a heavy quarkonium are investigated. To study the charge effect, we consider Maxwell charge which is interpreted as quark medium. In the case of finite 't Hooft coupling corrections, $\mathcal{R}^4$ terms and Gauss-Bonnet gravity have been considered, respectively. It is shown that these corrections affect the thermal width. It is also argued that by decreasing the 't Hooft coupling, the thermal width becomes effectively smaller. Interestingly, this is similar to analogous calculations in weakly coupled plasma.
