Title: Non-commutative Dp-Brane in General Background Fields
Authors: Maryam Zoghi and Davoud Kamani
Abstract: We investigate non-commutativity of open strings, attached to a D$p$-brane, in the presence of the linear dilaton, tachyon, U(1) gauge field as well as constant anti-symmetric $B$-field backgrounds. Non-commutativity parameter, open string metric and some special cases will be studied. Mode-dependent non-commutativity, inspired by the tachyon field, will be discussed in detail.
