Title: Integrable Deformations of the XXZ Spin Chain
Authors: Niklas Beisert and Lucas Fievet and Marius de Leeuw and Florian Loebbert
Abstract: We consider integrable deformations of the XXZ spin chain for periodic and open boundary conditions. In particular, we classify all long-range deformations and study their impact on the spectrum. As compared to the XXX case, we have the z-spin at our disposal, which induces two additional deformations: the short-range magnetic twist and a new long-range momentum-dependent twist.
