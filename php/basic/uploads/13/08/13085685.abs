Title: A new class of N=1 no-scale supergravity models
Authors: Gianguido Dall'Agata and Fabio Zwirner
Abstract: We introduce a new N=1 no-scale supergravity model with F- and D-term breaking. It contains a single chiral supermultiplet T and a single U(1) vector multiplet U, gauging an axionic shift symmetry. Both supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry are spontaneously broken, with the spin-3/2, spin-1 and spin-1/2 masses sliding along a classical flat direction, with a single real massless scalar in the spectrum. The other degrees of freedom are absorbed by the massive gravitino and vector. We extend our model, under very mild conditions, to general gauge groups and matter content.
