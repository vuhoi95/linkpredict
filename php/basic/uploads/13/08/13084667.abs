Title: Conformal Symmetry, Rindler Space and The AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Prasant Samantray and T. Padmanabhan
Abstract: Field theories in black hole spacetimes undergo dimensional reduction near horizon (in the Rindler limit) to two dimensional conformal field theories. We investigate this enhancement of symmetries in the context of gauge/gravity duality by considering Rindler space as boundary of Anti-de Sitter space in three spacetime dimensions. We show that the loxodromy conjugacy class of the SO(2,2) isometry group is responsible for generating the special conformal transformations on the boundary under RG flow. We use this approach to present an alternative derivation of the two-point function in Rindler space using AdS/CFT correspondence.
