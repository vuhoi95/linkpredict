Title: Numerical and analytical tests of quasi-integrability in modified  Sine-Gordon models
Authors: L. A. Ferreira and Wojtek J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: Following our attempts to define quasi-integrability in which we related this concept to a particular symmetry of the two-soliton function we check this condition in three classes of modified Sine-Gordon models in (1+1) dimensions. We find that the numerical results seen in various scatterings of two solitons and in the time evolution of breather-like structures support our ideas about the symmetry of the field configurations and its effects on the anomalies of the conservation laws of the charges.
