Title: Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking with T_N Theory
Authors: Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Yuji Tachikawa and Wenbin Yan and Kazuya Yonekura
Abstract: We demonstrate that the supersymmetry is dynamically broken in the four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theory coupled to a strongly-coupled superconformal theory T_N. This is a direct generalization of the model of supersymmetry breaking on deformed moduli space in supersymmetric QCD with an SU(2) gauge group.
