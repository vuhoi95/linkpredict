Title: On the Mutual Information in Hawking Radiation
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Daniel Kabat
Abstract: We compute the mutual information of two Hawking particles emitted consecutively by an evaporating black hole. Following Page, we find that the mutual information is of order exp(-S) where S is the entropy of the black hole. We speculate on implications for black hole unitarity, in particular on a possible failure of locality at large distances.
