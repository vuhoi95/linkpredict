Title: Noncommutative Gauge Theories: Model for Hodge theory
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: The nilpotent BRST, anti-BRST, dual-BRST and anti-dual-BRST symmetry transformations are constructed in the context of noncommutative (NC) 1-form as well as 2-form gauge theories. The corresponding Noether's charges for these symmetries on the Moyal plane are shown to satisfy the same algebra as by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. The Hodge decomposition theorem on compact manifold is also studied. We show that noncommutative gauge theories are field theoretic models for Hodge theory.
