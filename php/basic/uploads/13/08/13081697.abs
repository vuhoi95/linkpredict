Title: Scattering Amplitudes
Authors: Henriette Elvang and Yu-tin Huang
Abstract: The purpose of this review is to bridge the gap between a standard course in quantum field theory and recent fascinating developments in the studies of on-shell scattering amplitudes. We build up the subject from basic quantum field theory, starting with Feynman rules for simple processes in Yukawa theory and QED. The material covered includes spinor helicity formalism, on-shell recursion relations, superamplitudes and their symmetries, twistors and momentum twistors, loops and integrands, Grassmannians, polytopes, and amplitudes in perturbative supergravity as well as 3d Chern-Simons-matter theories. Multiple examples and exercises are included.
