Title: Low energy singularities in the ground state of fermionic superfluids
Authors: Benjamin Obert and Christoph Husemann and Walter Metzner
Abstract: We analyze the effects of order parameter fluctuations on the ground state of fully gapped charge-neutral fermionic superfluids. The Goldstone mode associated with the spontaneously broken symmetry leads to a problem of coupled singularities in $d \leq 3$ dimensions. We derive a minimal set of one-loop renormalization group equations which fully captures the interplay of the singularities. The flow equations are based on a symmetry conserving truncation of a scale dependent effective action. We compute the low energy behavior of longitudinal, transverse and mixed order parameter correlations, and their impact on the fermionic gap. We demonstrate analytically that cancellations protecting the Goldstone mode are respected by the flow, and we present a numerical solution of the flow equations for the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model.
