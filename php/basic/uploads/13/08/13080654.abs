Title: Golden Ratio Controlled Chaos in Supersymmetric Dynamics
Authors: Tristan Hubsch and Gregory A. Katona
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric Lagrangians for the recently constructed off-shell worldline N=3 supermultiplet $Y_I/(i D_I X)$ for I=1,2,3, where $Y_I$ and $X$ are standard, Salam-Strathdee superfields: $Y_I$ fermionic and $X$ bosonic. Already the Lagrangian bilinear in component fields exhibits a total of thirteen free parameters, seven of which specify Zeeman-like coupling to external (magnetic) fluxes. All but special subsets of this parameter space describe aperiodic oscillatory response, some of which are controlled by the "golden ratio," $\varphi\approx1.61803$. We also show that all of these Lagrangians admit an $N=3\to 4$ supersymmetry extension, while a subset admits two inequivalent such extensions.
