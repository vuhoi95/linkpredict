Title: Interacting Ricci-like holographic dark energy
Authors: F. Arevalo and P. Cifuentes and S. Lepe and F. Pe√±a
Abstract: In a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background, a scheme of dark matter-dark energy interaction is studied considering a holographic Ricci-like model for the dark energy. Without giving a priori some specific model for the interaction function, we show that this function can experience a change of sign during the cosmic evolution. The parameters involved in the holographic model are adjusted with Supernova data and we obtained results compatible with the observable universe.
