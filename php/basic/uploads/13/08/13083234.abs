Title: Entanglement entropy of compressible holographic matter: loop  corrections from bulk fermions
Authors: Brian Swingle and Liza Huijse and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a useful probe of compressible quantum matter because it can detect the existence of Fermi surfaces, both of microscopic fermionic degrees of freedom and of "hidden" gauge charged fermions. Much recent attention has focused on holographic efforts to model strongly interacting compressible matter of interest for condensed matter physics. We complete the entanglement analysis initiated in Huijse {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B 85, 035121 (2012) (arXiv:1112.0573) and Ogawa {\em et al.}, JHEP 1, 125 (2012) (arXiv:1111.1023) using the recent proposal of Faulkner {\em et al.} (arXiv:1307.2892) to analyze the entanglement entropy of the visible fermions which arises from bulk loop corrections. We find perfect agreement between holographic and field theoretic calculations.
