Title: Multi-field G-inflation
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Norihiro Tanahashi and Masahide Yamaguchi
Abstract: We propose a multi-field extension of (generalized) G-inflation, based on covariant multi-galileons and their generalization preserving second-order field equations. We compute the quadratic action for cosmological perturbations. By comparing the formulas for cosmological perturbations, it is highlighted that multi-field DBI galileon inflation is not included in the multi-field version of generalized G-inflation. Our result indicates that the generalized covariant multi-galileon theory is not the most general multi-scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations.
