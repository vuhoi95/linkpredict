Title: Black holes with surrounding matter in scalar-tensor theories
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Isabella P. Carucci and Paolo Pani and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: We uncover two mechanisms that can render Kerr black holes unstable in scalar-tensor gravity, both associated to the presence of matter in the vicinity of the black hole and the fact that this introduces an effective mass for the scalar. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the structure of spacetime in realistic, astrophysical black holes in scalar-tensor theories.
