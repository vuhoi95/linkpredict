Title: Current Algebras from DG Symplectic Pairs in Supergeometry
Authors: Noriaki Ikeda and Xiaomeng Xu
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in the category of supergeometry. We take a QP pair as the fundamental framework, which is a tower of two dg symplectic manifolds introduced in the author's previous paper. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms are naturally constructed from this structure. Moreover, a new class of current algebras are obtained systematically. The Poisson brackets of currents are described by the derived bracket on the big QP manifold. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP pair, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived.
