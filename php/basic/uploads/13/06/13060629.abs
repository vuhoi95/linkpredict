Title: Quantum field theory with varying couplings
Authors: Gianluca Calcagni and Giuseppe Nardelli
Abstract: A quantum scalar field theory with spacetime-dependent coupling is studied. Surprisingly, while translation invariance is explicitly broken in the classical theory, momentum conservation is recovered at the quantum level for some specific choice of the coupling's profile for any finite-order perturbative expansion. For one of these cases, some tree and one-loop diagrams are calculated. This is an example of a theory where violation of Lorentz symmetry is not enhanced at the quantum level. We draw some consequences for the renormalization properties of certain classes of fractional field theories.
