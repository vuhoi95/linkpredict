Title: Examples of N=2 to N=1 supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Tobias Hansen and Jan Louis
Abstract: In this paper we consider gauged N=2 supergravities which arise in the low-energy limit of type II string theories and study examples which exhibit spontaneous partial supersymmetry breaking. For the quantum STU model we derive the scalar field space and the scalar potential of the N=1 supersymmetric low-energy effective action. We also study the properties of the Minkowskian N=1 supersymmetricground states for a broader class of supergravities including the quantum STU model.
