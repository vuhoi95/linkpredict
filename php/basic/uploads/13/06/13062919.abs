Title: Phase diagram of Yang-Mills theories in the presence of a theta term
Authors: Massimo D'Elia and Francesco Negro
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of non-Abelian pure gauge theories in the presence of a topological theta term. The dependence of the deconfinement temperature on theta is determined on the lattice both by analytic continuation and by reweighting, obtaining consistent results. The general structure of the diagram is discussed on the basis of large-N considerations and of the possible analogies and dualities existing with the phase diagram of QCD in presence of an imaginary baryon chemical potential.
