Title: Holographic Fluctuations from Unitary de Sitter Invariant Field Theory
Authors: Tom Banks and Willy Fischler and T. J. Torres and Carroll L. Wainwright
Abstract: We continue the study of inflationary fluctuations in Holographic Space Time models of inflation. We argue that the holographic theory of inflation provides a physical context for what is often called dS/CFT. The holographic theory is a quantum theory which, in the limit of a large number of e-foldings, gives rise to a field theory on $S^3$, which is the representation space for a unitary representation of SO(1,4). This is not a conventional CFT, and we do not know the detailed non-perturbative axioms for correlation functions. However, the two- and three-point functions are completely determined by symmetry, and coincide up to a few constants (really functions of the background FRW geometry) with those calculated in a single field slow-roll inflation model. The only significant deviation from slow roll is in the tensor fluctuations. We predict zero tensor tilt and roughly equal weight for all three conformally invariant tensor 3-point functions (unless parity is imposed as a symmetry). We discuss the relation between our results and those of Maldacena, McFadden, Skenderis, and others. Current data can be explained in terms of symmetries and a few general principles, and is consistent with a large class of models, including HST.
