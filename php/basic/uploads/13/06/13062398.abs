Title: Curvature Couplings in $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ Nonlinear Sigma Models on  $S^2$
Authors: Bei Jia and Eric Sharpe
Abstract: Following recent work on GLSM localization, we work out curvature couplings for rigidly supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models with superpotential for general target spaces, describing both ordinary and twisted chiral superfields on round two-sphere worldsheets. We briefly discuss why, unlike four-dimensional theories, there are no constraints on Kahler forms in these theories. We also briefly discuss general issues in topological twists of such theories.
