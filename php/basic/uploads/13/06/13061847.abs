Authors: D. Bazeia and R. Menezes and A. Yu. Petrov and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We consider the Randall-Sundrum braneworld theory with a single extra dimension of infinite extent to investigate generalized $f(R)$ braneworld models in the presence of several real scalar fields. In particular, we solve the modified Einstein equations for the case of flat brane, with zero cosmological constant, and for the case of bent brane, with a nonvanishing cosmological constant. In both cases we found explicit solutions for the scalar fields with analytical expressions for the respective warp factors.
