Title: Holographic Schwinger effect in confining phase
Authors: Yoshiki Sato and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We consider the Schwinger effect in confining phase by using a holographic setup. The potential analysis is performed for the confining D3-brane and D4-brane backgrounds. We find the critical electric field above which there is no potential barrier and the system becomes unstable catastrophically. An intriguing point is that no Schwinger effect occurs when the electric field is smaller than the confining string tension.
