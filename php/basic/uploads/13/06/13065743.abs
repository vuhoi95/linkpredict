Title: Cosmological perturbations of massive gravity coupled to DBI Galileons
Authors: Melinda Andrews and Kurt Hinterbichler and James Stokes and Mark Trodden
Abstract: Certain scalar fields with higher derivative interactions and novel classical and quantum mechanical properties - the Galileons - can be naturally covariantized by coupling to nonlinear massive gravity in such a way that their symmetries and number of degrees of freedom are unchanged. We study the propagating degrees of freedom in these models around cosmologically interesting backgrounds. We identify the conditions necessary for such a theory to remain ghost free, and consider when tachyonic instabilities can be avoided. We show that on the self-accelerating branch of solutions, the kinetic terms for the vector and scalar modes of the massive graviton vanish, as in the case of pure massive gravity.
