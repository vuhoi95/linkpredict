Title: Modular-type functions attached to Calabi-Yau varieties: integrality  properties
Authors: Hossein Movasati and Khosro Monsef Shokri
Abstract: We study the integrality properties of the coefficients of the mirror map attached to the generalized hypergeometric function $_{n}F_{n-1}$ with rational parameters and with a maximal unipotent monodromy. We present a conjecture on the $p$-integrality of the mirror map which can be verified experimentally. We prove its consequence on the $N$-integrality of the mirror map for the particular cases $1\leq n\leq 4$. For $n=2$ we obtain the Takeuchi's classification of arithmetic triangle groups with a cusp, and for $n=4$ we prove that $14$ examples of hypergeometric Calabi-Yau equations are the full classification of hypergeometric mirror maps with integral coefficients. As a by-product we get the integrality of the corresponding algebra of modular-type functions. These are natural generalizations of the algebra of classical modular and quasi-modular forms in the case $n=2$.
