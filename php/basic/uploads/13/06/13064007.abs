Title: Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Solution of Gross-Neveu models: Twisted Kink  Constituents of Baryons and Breathers
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Michael Thies
Abstract: We find the general solution to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock problem for the Gross-Neveu models, with both discrete (GN2) and continuous (NJL2) chiral symmetry. We find new multi-baryon, multi-breather and twisted breather solutions, and show that all GN2 baryons and breathers are composed of constituent twisted kinks of the NJL2 model.
