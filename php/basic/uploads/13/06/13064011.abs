Title: Gravitating Q-tubes and cylindrical spacetime
Authors: Y. Brihaye and T. Delsate
Abstract: We consider a model involving a self-interacting complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and emphasize the cylindrically symmetric classical solutions. A general ansatz is performed which transforms the field equations into a system of differential equations. In the generic case, the scalar field depends on the four space-time coordinates. The underlying Einstein vacuum equations are worth studying by themselve and lead to numerous analytic results extending the Kasner solutions. The solutions of the coupled system are -static as well as stationnary- gravitating Q-tubes of scalar matter which deform space-time.
