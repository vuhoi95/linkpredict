Title: The 1+1+2 formalism for Scalar-Tensor gravity
Authors: Sante Carloni and Peter K S Dunsby
Abstract: We use the 1+1+2 covariant approach to clarify a number of aspects of spherically symmetric solutions of non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theories. Particular attention is focused on the extension of Birkhoff's theorem and the nature of quasi-local horizons in this context.
