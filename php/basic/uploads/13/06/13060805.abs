Title: Radion cosmology and stabilization
Authors: Sumanta Chakraborty and Soumitra Sengupta
Abstract: We solve the Einstein's equation in five-dimensional spacetime for Randall Sundrum Brane world model with time dependent radion field to study variation of brane scale factor with time. We have shown that as radion field decreases with time compactifying the extra dimension, the scale factor increases exponentially with time leading to inflationary scenario. We have also proposed a time dependent generalization of Goldberger-Wise moduli stabilization mechanism to explain the time evolution of the radion field to reach a stable value after which the scale factor on the brane exits from inflationary expansion.
