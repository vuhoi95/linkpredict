Abstract: Thermal correlation functions and the associated effective statistical potential are computed in two- and three-dimensional non-commutative space using an operator formulation that makes no reference to a star product. The corresponding results for the Moyal and Voros star products are then easily obtained by taking the corresponding overlap with Moyal and Voros bases. The forms of the correlation function and the effective potential are found to be the same, except that in the Voros case the thermal length undergoes a non-commutative deformation, ensuring that it has a lower bound of the order of $\sqrt{\theta}$. It is shown that in a suitable basis (called here quasi-commutative) in the multi-particle sector the thermal correlation function coincides with the commutative result both in the Moyal and Voros cases, with an appropriate non-commutative correction to the thermal length in the Voros case, and that the Pauli principle is restored.
