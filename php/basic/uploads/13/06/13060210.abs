Abstract: We study the holographic entanglement entropy in a homogeneous falling shell background, which is dual to the strongly coupled field theory following a global quench. For d=2 conformal field theories, it is known that the entropy has a linear growth regime if the scale of the entangling region is large. In addition, the growth rate approaches a constant when the scale increases. We demonstrate analytically that this behavior is directly related to the part of minimal area surface probing the interior of apparent horizons in the bulk, as well as the mutual information between two disjoint rectangular subsystems in the boundary. Furthermore, we show numerically that all the results are universal for the d=3 conformal field theory, the non-relativistic scale-invariant theory and the dual theory of Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
