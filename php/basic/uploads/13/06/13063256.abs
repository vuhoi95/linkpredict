Title: Black Hole Formation in Fuzzy Sphere Collapse
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka and Daniel Kabat and Shubho Roy and Debajyoti Sarkar
Abstract: We study the collapse of a fuzzy sphere, that is a spherical membrane built out of D0-branes, in the BFSS model. At weak coupling, as the sphere shrinks, open strings are produced. If the initial radius is large then open string production is not important and the sphere behaves classically. At intermediate initial radius the back-reaction from open string production is important but the fuzzy sphere retains its identity. At small initial radius the sphere collapses to form a black hole. The crossover between the later two regimes is smooth and occurs at the correspondence point of Horowitz and Polchinski.
