Abstract: Interaction of Double sine-Gordon solitons with a space dependent potential wall and also a potential well has been investigated by employing an analytical model based on the collective coordinate approach. The potential has been added to the model through a suitable nontrivial metric for the background space-time. The model is able to predict most of the features of the soliton-potential interaction. It is shown that a soliton can pass through a potential barrier if its velocity is greater than a critical velocity which is a function of soliton initial conditions and also characters of the potential. It is interesting that the solitons of the double sine-Gordon model can be trapped by a potential barrier and oscillate there. This situation is very important in applied physics. Soliton-well system has been investigated using the presented model too. Analytical results also have been compared with the results of the direct numerical solutions.
