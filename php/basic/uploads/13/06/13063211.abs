Title: Superconformal Generalization of the Chaotic Inflation Model λ  φ^4/4 - ξ/ 2 φ^2 R
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde
Abstract: A model of chaotic inflation based on the theory of a scalar field with potential \lambda\phi^4 perfectly matches the observational data if one adds to it a tiny non-minimal coupling to gravity -\xi/2 \phi^2 R with \xi > 0.002. We describe embedding of this model into the superconformal theory with spontaneous breaking of superconformal symmetry, and into supergravity. A model with small \xi is technically natural: setting the small parameter \xi to zero leads to a point of enhanced symmetry in the underlying superconformal theory.
