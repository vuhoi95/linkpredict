Title: The finite and large-$N$ behaviors of independent-value matrix models
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and John R. Klauder
Abstract: We investigate the finite and large $N$ behaviors of independent-value O(N)-invariant matrix models. These are models defined with matrix-type fields and with no gradient term in their action. They are generically nonrenormalizable but can be handled by nonperturbative techniques. We find that the functional of any O(N) matrix trace invariant may be expressed in terms of an O(N)-invariant measure. Based on this result, we prove that, in the limit that all interaction coupling constants go to zero, any interacting theory is continuously connected to a pseudo-free theory. This theory differs radically from the familiar free theory consisting in putting the coupling constants to zero in the initial action. The proof is given for generic finite-size matrix models, whereas, in the limiting case $N\rightarrow\infty$, we succeed in showing this behavior for restricted types of actions using a particular scaling of the parameters.
