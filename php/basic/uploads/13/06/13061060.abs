Title: Quasinormal frequencies of a massless scalar in the hidden Kerr/CFT  proposal
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: The hidden Kerr/CFT proposal implies that the massless scalar wave equation in the near-region and low-frequency limit respects a hidden SL(2,R)$\times$SL(2,R) invariance in the Kerr black hole spacetime. We may use this symmetry to determine quasinormal frequencies (QNFs) of the massless scalar wave propagating around the Kerr black hole algebraically. It is shown that QNFs obtained using the hidden conformal symmetry near the horizon correspond approximately to not only those of scalar perturbation around the near-horizon region of a nearly extremal Kerr (NEK) black hole, but also those of non-equatorial scalar modes around the NEK black hole. This indicates that the hidden Kerr/CFT proposal could determine quasinormal modes and frequencies of the massless scalar wave around the NEK (rapidly rotating) black hole approximately.
