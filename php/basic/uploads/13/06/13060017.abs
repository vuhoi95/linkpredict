Title: Supersymmetric AdS Black Rings
Authors: J. Grover and J. B. Gutowski and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: It has been proven in arXiv:1303.0853 that all regular supersymmetric near-horizon geometries in minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity admit automatic supersymmetry enhancement. Using this result, the integrability conditions associated with the existence of the additional supersymmetry are analysed, and the near-horizon geometries are determined explicitly. We show that they all correspond to previously constructed examples. Hence, there are no supersymmetric black ring solutions in minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity.
