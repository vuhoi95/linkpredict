Title: Ricci dark energy in Chern-Simons modified gravity
Authors: J. G. Silva and A. F. Santos
Abstract: In this work, we have considered the Ricci dark energy model, where the energy density of the universe is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature, in the dynamic Chern-Simons modified gravity. We show that in this context the evolution of the scale factor is similar to that displayed by the modified Chaplygin gas.
