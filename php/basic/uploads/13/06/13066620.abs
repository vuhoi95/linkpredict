Title: Generalised cusp anomalous dimension in beta-deformed super Yang Mills  theory
Authors: George Georgiou and Dimitrios Giataganas
Abstract: In this work we study the cusp anomalous dimension of the marginally deformed N=4 sYM theory. We find the expression of the cusp anomalous dimension both at the weak and strong coupling limits. On the gravity side we partially map the system of equations to that of undeformed N=4 sYM, by defining in the internal space an effective angle \Delta \theta_{eff} which depends on the deformation parameter. The cusp anomalous dimension then can be read from that of the N=4 sYM theory, by using this effective angle instead of the usual angle of the undeformed 5-sphere. In the weak coupling regime we find no beta dependence up to two loops. Based on these results we conjecture that for any value of lambda, the cusp anomalous dimension is given by the N=4 sYM result using the coupling dependent effective angle. As a consequence of this, we derive a BPS-like condition between the angle of the AdS space and the \Delta \theta_{eff} of the deformed sphere which when satisfied, nullifies the cusp anomalous dimension.
