Title: Modularity, Quaternion-Kahler spaces and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Sergei Alexandrov and Sibasish Banerjee
Abstract: We provide an explicit twistorial construction of quaternion-Kahler manifolds obtained by deformation of c-map spaces and carrying an isometric action of the modular group SL(2,Z). The deformation is not assumed to preserve any continuous isometry and therefore this construction presents a general framework for describing NS5-brane instanton effects in string compactifications with N=2 supersymmetry. In this context the modular invariant parametrization of twistor lines found in this work yields the complete non-perturbative mirror map between type IIA and type IIB physical fields.
