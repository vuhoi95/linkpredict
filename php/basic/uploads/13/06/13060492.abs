Title: Thermodynamics of Charged Kalb Ramond AdS black hole in presence of  Gauss-Bonnet coupling
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We study the role of the Gauss-Bonnet corrections to the gravity action on the charged AdS black hole in presence of rank 3 antisymmetric Kalb Ramond tensor field strength. Analyzing the branch singularity and the killing horizon, we explicitly derive various thermodynamic parameters and study their behaviour in presence of five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet coupling in AdS space-time. The possibility of a second order phase transition is explored in the light of AdS/CMT correspondence and various critical exponents associated with the discontinuities of the various thermodynamic parameters are determined. We further comment on the universality of the well known Rushbrooke Josephson scaling law and derive a relation between the degree of homogeneity appearing in various free energies and the critical exponents by homogeneous hypothesis test. By making use of the constraints appearing from Hawking temperature and Gauss-Bonnet extended gravity version of Kubo formula we introduce a bound on the five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the viscosity entropy ratio in the four dimensional holographic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) dual. This yields a fractional deviation in viscosity entropy ratio from the result obtained from Einstein gravity.
