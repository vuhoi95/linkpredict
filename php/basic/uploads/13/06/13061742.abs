Title: Off-diagonal Bethe ansatz solution of the XXX spin-chain with arbitrary  boundary conditions
Authors: Junpeng Cao and Wenli Yang and Kangjie Shi and Yupeng Wang
Abstract: With the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz method proposed recently by the present authors, we exactly diagonalize the $XXX$ spin chain with arbitrary boundary fields. By constructing a functional relation between the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and the quantum determinant, the associated $T-Q$ relation and the Bethe ansatz equations are derived.
