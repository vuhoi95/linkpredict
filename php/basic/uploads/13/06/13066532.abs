Title: Numerical Solutions of Open String Field Theory in Marginally Deformed  Backgrounds
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate numerical solutions of bosonic open string field theory in some marginally deformed backgrounds, which are obtained by expanding the action around an identity-based marginal solution with one parameter. We construct numerical solutions in the Siegel gauge and the Landau gauge corresponding to the tachyon vacuum. Their vacuum energy approximately cancels the D-brane tension for larger intervals of the parameter with increasing truncation level. The result is consistent with the previous expectation that the identity-based marginal solution has vanishing energy regardless of the values of the parameter. We also study the marginal branch (M-branch) and the vacuum branch (V-branch) and evaluate not only the vacuum energy but also the gauge invariant overlaps with the graviton and the closed tachyon. We observe that there is a finite bound for the value of the massless field of numerical solutions even in the marginally deformed background.
