Title: The Petrov-like boundary condition at finite cutoff surface in  Gravity/Fluid duality
Authors: Yi Ling and Chao Niu and Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu and Wei Zhang
Abstract: Previously it has been shown that imposing a Petrov-like boundary condition on a hypersurface may reduce the Einstein equation to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, but all these correspondences are established in the near horizon limit. In this note, we remark that this strategy can be extended to an arbitrary finite cutoff surface which is spatially flat, and the Navier-Stokes equation is obtained by employing a non-relativistic long-wavelength limit.
