Title: Pulsating Strings With Angular Momenta
Authors: Pabitra M. Pradhan and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We derive the energy of pulsating string, as function of oscillation number and angular momenta, which oscillates in AdS3 with an extra angular momentum along S1. We find similar solutions for the strings oscillating in S3 in addition to extra angular momentum. Further we generalize the result of the oscillating strings in Anti de-Sitter space in the presence of both spin and angular momentum in AdS5 x S1.
