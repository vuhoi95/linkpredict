Title: Carbon nanotubes in almost homogeneous transverse magnetic field:  exactly solvable model
Authors: Vit Jakubsky and Sengul Kuru and Javier Negro
Abstract: A class of exactly solvable models describing carbon nanotubes in the presence of an external inhomogeneous magnetic field is considered. The framework of the continuum approximation is employed, where the motion of the charge carriers is governed by the Dirac- Weyl equation. The explicit solution of a particular example is provided. It is shown that these models possess nontrivial integrals of motion that establish N = 2 nonlinear supersymmetry in case of metallic and maximally semiconducting nanotubes. Remarkable stability of energy levels with respect to small fluctuations of longitudinal momentum is demonstrated
