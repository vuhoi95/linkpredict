Title: Correlation Functions of the SU(infinity) Principal Chiral Model
Authors: Axel Cortes Cubero and Peter Orland
Abstract: We obtain exact matrix elements of physical operators of the (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear sigma model of an SU(N)-valued bare field, in the 't Hooft limit N goes to infinity. Specifically, all the form factors of the Noether current and the stress-energy-momentum tensor are found with an integrable bootstrap method. These form factors are used to find vacuum expectation values of products of these operators.
