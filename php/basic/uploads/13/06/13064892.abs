Title: Scalar fields and defect structures: perturbative procedure for  generalized models
Authors: C. A. G. Almeida and D. Bazeia and L. Losano and R. Menezes
Abstract: We develop a general procedure to deal with defect structures in generalized models, described by a single real scalar field, in (1,1) spacetime dimensions. The models that we consider have the standard kinetic and potential contributions modified to include corrections that depend on a single small parameters, used to control modification on the kinematics and the potential. We start with standard model that engenders stable defect structures, and we show how to obtain new structures for the generalized models. We examine distinct aspects of the new deformed solutions, including linear stability. We work with several distinct modifications, and we show how to make the new defect structures stable, controlled by the parameter that modify the standard theory. We illustrate the procedure with examples of current interest to high energy physics.
