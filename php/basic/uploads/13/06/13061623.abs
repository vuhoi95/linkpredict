Title: Generalized second law at linear order for actions that are functions of  Lovelock densities
Authors: Sudipta Sarkar and Aron C. Wall
Abstract: In this article we consider the second law of black holes (and other causal horizons) in theories where the gravitational action is an arbitrary function of the Lovelock densities. We show that there exists an entropy which increases locally, for linearized perturbations to regular Killing horizons. In addition to a classical increase theorem, we also prove a generalized second law for semiclassical, minimally-coupled matter fields.
