Title: Black Hole Firewalls Require Huge Energy of Measurement
Authors: Masahiro Hotta and Jiro Matsumoto and Ken Funo
Abstract: The unitary moving mirror model is one of the best quantum systems for checking the reasoning of the original firewall paradox of AMPS in quantum black holes. Though the late-time part of radiations emitted from the mirror is fully entangled with the early-part, no firewall exists with a deadly, huge average energy flux in this model. This is because high-energy entanglement structure of the discretized systems in almost maximally entangled states is modified so as to yield the correct description of low-energy effective field theory. Furthermore, the strong subadditivity paradox of firewalls is resolved using non-locality of general one-particle states and zero-point fluctuation entanglement. Due to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem in quantum field theory, another firewall paradox is inevitably raised with quantum remote measurements in the model. We resolve this paradox from the viewpoint of the energy cost of measurements. No firewall appears, as long as the energy for the measurement is much smaller than the ultraviolet cutoff scale.
