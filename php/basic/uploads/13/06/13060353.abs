Title: Wheeler-De Witt equation and AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Francesco Cianfrani and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman
Abstract: The radial Wheeler--De Witt equation on the asymptotically AdS spacetime proposed in [9] has as its semiclassical solution the wave function that asymptotically satisfies the conformal Ward identity, exemplifying the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this paper we show that this results holds also in the case of a complete quantum solution of the radial Wheeler--De Witt equation. It turns out that if the wavefunction is expanded in the parameter $\rho$ with $\rho\rightarrow0$ defines the asymptotic boundary of the spacetime, the quantum loop corrections to the semiclassical wave are of subleading order.
