Title: Time-reversal symmetry and fluctuation relations in non-equilibrium  quantum steady states
Authors: Denis Bernard and Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: In this note, we present a simple derivation, from time-reversal symmetry, of fluctuation relations for steady-state large deviation functions in non-equilibrium quantum systems. We further show that a condition of pure transmission implies extended fluctuation relations, connecting large deviation functions to mean currents at shifted temperatures and chemical potentials. We illustrate these concepts in various examples, including the interacting resonant level model and conformal or integrable models.
