Title: The Mirage of the Fermi Scale
Authors: Oleg Antipin and Francesco Sannino and Kimmo Tuominen
Abstract: The discovery of a light Higgs boson at LHC may be suggesting that we need to revise our model building paradigms to understand the origin of the weak scale. We explore the possibility that the Fermi scale is not fundamental but rather a derived one, i.e. a low energy mirage. We show that this scenario emerges in a very natural way in models previously used to break the electroweak symmetry dynamically and suggest a simple dynamical framework for this idea. In our model the electroweak scale results from the interplay between two very high energy scales, one typically of the order of $\Luv\sim 10^{10}$ GeV and the other around $M_{\rm U} \sim 10^{16}$ GeV, although other values are also possible.
