Title: Solvable limits of a 4D noncommutative QFT
Authors: Harald Grosse and Raimar Wulkenhaar
Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the (\theta->\infty)-limit of \phi^4_4-quantum field theory on noncommutative Moyal space is an exactly solvable matrix model. In this paper we translate these results to position space. We show that the Schwinger functions are symmetric and invariant under the full Euclidean group. The Schwinger functions only depend on matrix correlation functions at coinciding indices per topological sector, and clustering is violated. We prove that Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity of the Schwinger two-point function is equivalent to the question whether the diagonal matrix two-point function is a Stieltjes function. Numerical investigations suggest that this can at best be expected for the wrong sign of the coupling constant. The corresponding Wightman functions would describe particles which interact without momentum transfer. The theory differs from a free theory by the presence of non-trivial topological sectors.
