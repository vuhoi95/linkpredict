Title: Passing through the Firewall
Authors: Erik Verlinde and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We propose that black hole information is encoded in non-local correlations between microscopic interior and exterior degrees of freedom. We give a simple qubit representation of this proposal, and show herein that for every black hole state, the apparent firewall can be removed via a universal, state independent unitary transformation. A central element in our discussion is the distinction between virtual qubits, which are in a specified vacuum state, and real qubits, that carry the free quantum information of the black hole. We outline how our proposal may be realized in AdS/CFT
