Authors: D. Bazeia and A. S. Lobao Jr. and L. Losano and R. Menezes
Abstract: This work deals with braneworld scenarios obtained from N real scalar fields, whose dynamics is generalized to include higher order power in the derivative of the fields. For the scalar fields being driven by nonstandard dynamics, we show how a first-order formalism can be obtained for flat brane in the presence of several fields. We then illustrate our findings investigating distinct potentials with one and two fields, obtaining stable standard and compact solutions in the braneworld theory. In particular, we have found different models describing the very same warp factor.
