Title: Generating Non-perturbative Physics from Perturbation Theory
Authors: Gerald V. Dunne and Mithat Unsal
Abstract: In a large variety of quantum mechanical systems, we show that the full non-perturbative expression for energy eigenvalues, containing all orders of perturbative, non-perturbative and quasi-zero-mode terms, may be generated directly from the perturbative expansion about the perturbative vacuum, combined with a single global boundary condition. This provides a dramatic realization of the principle of "resurgence", that the fluctuations about different semiclassical saddle points are related to one another in a precise quantitative manner. The analysis of quantum mechanics also generalizes to certain calculable regimes of quantum field theory.
