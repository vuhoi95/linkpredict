Title: Numerical Simulation of Cosmic String Motion in Peres Background
Authors: Sergey Roshchupkin and Alexey Zhovtan
Abstract: The dynamics of closed cosmic strings in Peres background, using finite-difference method, has been considered. It is shown that motion of the strings is very complicated and its perform complex oscillations and deformed to form loops and cusps.
