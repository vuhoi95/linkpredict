Title: Holographic Superconductors in f(R) Gravity
Authors: Zhao Xue and Sheng-liang Cui
Abstract: We study the holographic superconductors in f(R) gravity, and show how the critical temperature and the condensate of the dual operator depend on the modifications to Einstein gravity. We first review the black holes with constant curvature, which are clear in f(R) gravity. The dependencies are represented with the modified Newtonian constant and the effective cosmological constant trivially. Then we consider a planar black hole solution for a specific f(R) without imposing the constant curvature, which is asymptotic to AdS spacetime. The corrections to the thermal dynamics of the black holes, the critical temperature and the condensates are all obtained in a perturbative approach. Some comments are given on the affections of the f(R) gravity to the holographic superconductors.
