Title: Note on Gauge Invariance and Causal Propagation
Authors: Marc Henneaux and Rakibur Rahman
Abstract: Interactions of gauge-invariant systems are severely constrained by several consistency requirements. One is the preservation of the number of gauge symmetries, another is causal propagation. For lower-spin fields, the emphasis is usually put on gauge invariance that happens to be very selective by itself. We demonstrate with an explicit example, however, that gauge invariance, albeit indispensable for constructing interactions, may not suffice as a consistency condition. The chosen example that exhibits this feature is the theory of a massless spin-3/2 field coupled to electromagnetism. We show that this system admits an electromagnetic background in which the spin-3/2 gauge field may move faster than light. Requiring causal propagation rules out otherwise allowed gauge-invariant couplings. This emphasizes the importance of causality analysis as an independent test for a system of interacting gauge fields. We comment on the implications of allowing new degrees of freedom and non-locality in a theory, on higher-derivative gravity and Vasiliev's higher-spin theories.
