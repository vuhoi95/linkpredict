Abstract: We study the role of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ and the choice of connection in the construction of (a symmetry-reduced version of) loop quantum gravity. We start with the four-dimensional Lorentzian Holst action that we reduce to three dimensions in a way that preserves the presence of $\gamma$. In the time gauge, the phase space of the resulting three-dimensional theory mimics exactly that of the four-dimensional one. Its quantization can be performed, and on the kinematical Hilbert space spanned by SU(2) spin network states the spectra of geometric operators are discrete and $\gamma$-dependent. However, because of the three-dimensional nature of the theory, its SU(2) Ashtekar-Barbero Hamiltonian constraint can be traded for the flatness constraint of an sl(2,C) connection, and we show that this latter has to satisfy a linear simplicity-like condition analogous to the one used in the construction of spin foam models. The physically relevant solution to this constraint singles out the non-compact subgroup SU(1,1), which in turn leads to the disappearance of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and to a continuous length spectrum, in agreement with what is expected from Lorentzian three-dimensional gravity.
