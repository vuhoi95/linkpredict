Abstract: We consider the problem of resumming the perturbative expansions for anomalous dimensions of low twist, non-BPS operators in four dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. The requirement of S-duality invariance imposes considerable restrictions on any such resummation. We introduce several prescriptions that produce interpolating functions on the upper half plane that are compatible with a subgroup of the full duality group. These lead to predictions for the anomalous dimensions at all points in the fundamental domain of the complex gauge coupling, and in particular at the duality-invariant values \tau=i and \tau=exp(i\pi/3). For low-rank gauge groups, the predictions are compatible with the bounds derived by conformal bootstrap methods for these anomalous dimensions; within numerical errors, they are in good agreement with the conjecture that said bounds are saturated at a duality-invariant point. We also find that the anomalous dimensions of the lowest twist operators lie within an extremely narrow window around a straight line as we vary the moduli of the theory over the two dimensional fundamental domain.
