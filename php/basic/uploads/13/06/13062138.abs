Title: Quasi-Local Conserved Charges in Covariant Theory of Gravity
Authors: Wontae Kim and Shailesh Kulkarni and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: In any generally covariant theory of gravity, we show the relationship between the linearized asymptotically conserved current and its non-linear completion through the identically conserved current. Our formulation for conserved charges is based on the Lagrangian description, and so completely covariant. By using this result, we give a prescription to define quasi-local conserved charges in any higher derivative gravity. As applications of our approach, we demonstrate the angular momentum invariance along the radial direction of black holes and reproduce more efficiently the linearized potential on the asymptotic AdS space.
