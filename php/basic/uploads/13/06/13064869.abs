Title: Stringy Corrections to the Classical Tests of General Relativity
Authors: Christopher Frye and Costas J. Efthimiou
Abstract: String theory imposes modifications to Einstein's equations of classical general relativity. Consequently, we calculate the additional corrections to the classical tests: the perihelion precession of Mercury, the deflection of light rays by the sun, and the gravitational redshift which should be present if these modified equations hold. In each case, we determine --- quite consistently with expectations --- that the stringy effects are much too small to be measured.
