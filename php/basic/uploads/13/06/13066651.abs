Title: The Structure of Non-Abelian Kinks
Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and J. Luis Miramontes and David M. Schmidtt
Abstract: We consider a class of integrable quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions whose classical equations have kink solutions with internal collective coordinates that transform under a non-abelian symmetry group. These generalised sine-Gordon theories have been shown to be related to the world sheet theory of the string in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We provide a careful analysis of the boundary conditions at spatial infinity complicated by the fact that they are defined by actions with a WZ term. We go on to describe the local and non-local charges carried by the kinks and end by showing that their structure is perfectly consistent with the exact factorizable S-matrices that have been proposed to describe these theories.
