Authors: M. H. Dehghani and Ch. Shakuri and M. H. Vahidinia
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics of Lifshitz black branes in the presence of a nonlinear massless electromagnetic field. We begin by introducing the appropriate action in grand-canonical and canonical ensembles for nonlinear electromagnetic field. The condition on the parameters of the metric for having black brane solutions will be presented. Since the field equations cannot be solved for an arbitrary value of the critical exponent $z$, we obtain a conserved quantity along the $r$ coordinate that enables us to relate the parameters of the metric at the horizon and at infinity. Then, we calculate the energy density of the Lifshitz black brane through the use of the counterterm method generalized for the asymptotic Lifshitz spacetimes. Finally, we present a relation between the energy density and the thermodynamical quantities, electric potential, charge density, temperature and entropy density. This relation is the generalization of Smarr formula for anti-de Sitter black branes.
