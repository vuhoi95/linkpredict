Title: Large-distance properties of holographic baryons
Authors: Pietro Colangelo and Juan Jose Sanz-Cillero and Fen Zuo
Abstract: Employing the asymptotic instanton solution in an arbitrary background of a set of holographic QCD models, we show that baryon form factors have a precise large-distance behaviour regardless of the background. The dependence coincides with that obtained from general chiral soliton models and large-$N_C$ chiral perturbation theory. The nonlinear terms in the equations of motion are necessary to recover the correct results. We also show that the holographic currents have the right structure at low energy if the solutions of the full equation of motion, instead of the linearized ones, are used. The indication is that in this holographic approach, the linearized approximation used in the meson sector is not appropriate for the solitonic description of the baryons.
