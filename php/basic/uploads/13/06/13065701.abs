Title: Factorization of Dirac Equation in Two Space Dimensions
Authors: Hocine Bahlouli and Ahmed Jellal and Youness Zahidi
Abstract: We present a systematic approach for the separation of variables for the two-dimensional Dirac equation in polar coordinates. The three vector potential, which couple to the Dirac spinor via minimal coupling, along with the scalar potential are chosen to have angular dependence which emanate the Dirac equation to complete separation of variables. Exact solutions are obtained for a class of solvable potentials along with their relativistic spinor wavefunctions. Particular attention is paid to the situation where the potentials are confined to a quantum dot region and are of scalar, vector and pseudo-scalar type. The study of a single charged impurity embedded in a 2D Dirac equation in the presence of a uniform magnetic field was treated as a particular case of our general study.
