Title: Mixed Inflaton and Spectator Field Models after Planck
Authors: Kari Enqvist and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the primordial perturbation has two sources: the inflaton and a spectator field, which is not dynamically important during inflation but which after inflation can contribute to the curvature perturbation. The recent Planck results on the power spectrum and non-Gaussianity allow us to put constraints on such mixed models. In the generic case, where no specific model for the inflaton or the spectator is assumed, one finds that in the mixed scenario it is possible to have a large trispectrum with tau_NL >> (f_NL)^2. The constraints on inflation models in the plane of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are modified by the presence of a spectator and depend also on the ratio of the spectator-to-inflaton power R. If one chooses the spectator to be the curvaton with a quadratic potential, non-Gaussianities can be computed and imply restrictions on possible values of R. We also consider a mixed curvaton and chaotic inflation model and show that even quartic chaotic inflation is still feasible in the context of mixed models.
