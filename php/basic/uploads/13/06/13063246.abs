Title: Spectra of geometric operators in three-dimensional LQG: From discrete  to continuous
Authors: Jibril Ben Achour and Marc Geiller and Karim Noui and Chao Yu
Abstract: We study and compare the spectra of geometric operators (length and area) in the quantum kinematics of two formulations of three-dimensional Lorentzian loop quantum gravity. In the SU(2) Ashtekar-Barbero framework, the spectra are discrete and depend on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ exactly like in the four-dimensional case. However, we show that when working with the self-dual variables and imposing the reality conditions the spectra become continuous and $\gamma$-independent.
