Title: Quantum gravity from the point of view of locally covariant quantum  field theory
Authors: Romeo Brunetti and Klaus Fredenhagen and Katarzyna Rejzner
Abstract: We construct perturbative quantum gravity in a generally covariant way. In particular our construction is background independent. It is based on the locally covariant approach to quantum field theory and the renormalized Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. We do not touch the problem of nonrenormalizability and interpret the theory as an effective theory at large length scales.
