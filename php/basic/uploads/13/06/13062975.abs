Title: Construction of an effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian with manifest BCJ  duality
Authors: Mathias Tolotti and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: The BCJ decomposition is a highly non-trivial property of gauge theories. In this paper we systematically construct an effective Lagrangian, whose Feynman rules automatically produce the BCJ numerators. The effective Lagrangian contains non-local terms. The difference between the standard Yang-Mills Lagrangian and the effective Lagrangian simplifies to zero.
