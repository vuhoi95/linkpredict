Title: Supergravity Solutions of Two M2 Branes
Authors: A. M. Ghezelbash and R. Oraji
Abstract: We present an exact analytic class of solutions for a system of two membranes in eleven-dimensional supergravity. One brane in the system is completely localized along the overall and relative transverse coordinates while the other brane in the system is localized only along the overall transverse coordinates. The membrane configuration preserves four supersymmetries. Moreover we find some approximate solutions for the system of two membranes with a Bianchi space as the overall transverse space to both membranes. All supergravity solutions preserve 1/8 of the supersymmetry. Upon dimensional reduction, the solutions provide intersecting configurations of three D-branes in type IIA supergravity.
