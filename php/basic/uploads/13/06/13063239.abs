Title: A Higgs--Saw Mechanism as a Source for Dark Energy
Authors: Lawrence M. Krauss and James B. Dent
Abstract: Motivated by the see-saw mechanism for neutrinos which naturally generates small neutrino masses, we explore how a small GUT-scale mixing between the Standard Model Higgs and an otherwise massless hidden sector scalar can naturally generate a small mass and VEV for the new scalar which produces a false vacuum energy density contribution comparable to that of the observed dark energy dominating the current expansion of the Universe. The new scalar produces no discernible signatures in existing terrestrial experiments so that one may have to rely on other cosmological tests of this idea.
