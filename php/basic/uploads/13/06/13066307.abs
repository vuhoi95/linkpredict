Title: The pole of the fermion propagator in a general class of gauges
Authors: Ashok K. Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study the behavior of the pole of the fermion propagator, in QED in $n$-dimensions, in a general class of gauges which interpolate between the covariant, the axial and the Coulomb gauges. We use Nielsen identities, following from the BRST invariance of the theory, to determine the gauge variation of the fermion two point function in this general class of gauges. This allows us to show directly and in a simple manner, to all orders in perturbation theory, that in the absence of infrared divergences and mass shell singularities, the fermion pole mass is gauge independent.
