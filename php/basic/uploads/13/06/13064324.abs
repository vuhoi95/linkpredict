Title: Global properties of causal wedges in asymptotically AdS spacetimes
Authors: Veronika E. Hubeny and Mukund Rangamani and Erik Tonni
Abstract: We examine general features of causal wedges in asymptotically AdS spacetimes and show that in a wide variety of cases they have non-trivial topology. We also prove some general results regarding minimal area surfaces on the causal wedge boundary and thereby derive constraints on the causal holographic information. We go on to demonstrate that certain properties of the causal wedge impact significantly on features of extremal surfaces which are relevant for computation of holographic entanglement entropy.
