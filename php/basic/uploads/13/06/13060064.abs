Authors: Weiping Yao and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We analytically study the holographic superconductors for Born-Infeld electrodynamics in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with backreactions. We note that the analytic method is still powerful for this complex system and the results obtained by the analytical and numerical computations are consistent. We find that the critical temperature decreases with the increase of the backreactions, Gauss-Bonnet, and Born-Infeld parameters, which means that increase of the strength of these effects will make the scalar hair harder to form. Furthermore, the Gauss-Bonnet factor modifies the critical temperature more significantly than the backreaction factor. The effect of the Born-Infeld factor on the critical temperature is weaker than the backreaction factor. We also show that the critical exponent is not affected by the backreactions, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Born-Infeld electrodynamics.
