Title: Emergence of space and cosmic evolution based on entropic force
Authors: Fei-Quan Tu and Yi-Xin Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model in which an additional pressure due to the effects of the entropic force is added to the ideal fluid. Furthermore, we obtain the dynamic equation in the FRW universe which contains the quantum gravitational effects based on the description of entropic force and emergence of space. Our model can well explain the age of the universe and the effect of the current accelerating expansion. We give the relation between the luminosity distance and the redshift factor, and compare this relation with that of lambda cold dark matter model($\Lambda CDM$ model).
