Title: No consistent bimetric gravity?
Authors: S. Deser and M. Sandora and A. Waldron
Abstract: We discuss the prospects for a consistent, nonlinear, partially massless (PM), gauge symmetry of bimetric gravity (BMG). Just as for single metric massive gravity, we show that consistency of BMG relies on it having a PM extension; we then argue that it cannot.
