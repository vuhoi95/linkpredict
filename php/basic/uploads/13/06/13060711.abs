Title: Yangian symmetric correlators
Authors: D. Chicherin and R. Kirschner
Abstract: Similarity transformations and eigenvalue relations of monodromy operators composed of Jordan-Schwinger type L matrices are considered and used to define Yangian symmetric correlators of n-dimensional theories. Explicit expressions are obtained and relations are formulated. In this way basic notions of the Quantum inverse scattering method provide a convenient formulation for high symmetry and integrability not only in lower dimensions.
