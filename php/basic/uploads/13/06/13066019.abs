Abstract: We examine the high energy (Regge) limit of gravitational scattering using a Wilson line approach previously used in the context of non-Abelian gauge theories. Our aim is to clarify the nature of the Reggeization of the graviton and the interplay between this Reggeization and the so-called eikonal phase which determines the spectrum of gravitational bound states. Furthermore, we discuss finite corrections to this picture. Our results are of relevance to various supergravity theories, and also help to clarify the relationship between gauge and gravity theories.
