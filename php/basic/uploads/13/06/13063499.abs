Title: Coherent States, Superpositions of Coherent States and Uncertainty  Relations on a Möbius Strip
Authors: Thiago Prudêncio and Diego Julio Cirilo-Lombardo
Abstract: Since symmetry properties of coherent states (CS) on M\"obius strip (MS) and fermions are closely related, CS on MS are naturally associated to the topological properties of fermionic fields. Here we consider CS and superpositions of coherent states (SCS) on MS. We extend a recent propose of CS on MS (Cirilo-Lombardo, 2012 [25]), including the analysis of periodic behaviors of CS and SCS on MS and the uncertainty relations associated to angular momentum and the phase angle. The advantage of CS and SCS on MS with respect to the standard ones and potential applications in continuous variable quantum computation are also addressed.
