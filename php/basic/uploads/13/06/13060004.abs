Title: Bimetric gravity doubly coupled to matter: theory and cosmological  implications
Authors: Yashar Akrami and Tomi S. Koivisto and David F. Mota and Marit Sandstad
Abstract: A ghost-free theory of gravity with two dynamical metrics both coupled to matter is shown to be consistent and viable. Its cosmological implications are studied, and the models, in particular in the context of partially massless gravity, are found to explain the cosmic acceleration without resorting to dark energy.
