Title: Quantum Instability of the Emergent Universe
Authors: Anthony Aguirre and John Kehayias
Abstract: We perform a semi-classical analysis of the Emergent Universe scenario for inflation. Fixing the background, and taking the inflaton to be homogenous, we cast the inflaton's evolution as a one-dimensional quantum mechanics problem. We find that the tuning required over a long time scale for this inflationary scenario is unstable quantum mechanically. Considering the inflaton field value as a wavepacket, the spreading of the wavepacket destroys any chance of both starting and ending with a well-formed state. Thus, one cannot have an Einstein static universe to begin with that evolves into a well-defined beginning to inflation a long time later.
