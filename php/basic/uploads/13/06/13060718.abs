Title: Constrained WZWN Models on G/{S x U(1)^n} and Exchange Algebra of  G-Primaries
Authors: Shogo Aoyama and Katsuyuki Ishii
Abstract: Consistently constrained WZWN models on G/{S x U(1)^n} is given by constraining currents of the WZWN models with G. Poisson brackets are set up on the light-like plane. Using them we show the Virasoro algebra for the energy-momentum tensor of constrained WZWN models. We find a G-primary which satisfies a classical exchange algebra in an arbitrary representation of G. The G-primary and the constrained currents are also shown to obey the conformal transformation with respect to the energy-momentum tensor. It is checked that conformal weight of the constrained currents is 0. This is necessary for the consistency for our formulation of constrained WZWN models.
