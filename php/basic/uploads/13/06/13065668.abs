Title: Dynamical Gauge Symmetry Breaking in Strongly Coupled Lattice Theories
Authors: Simon Catterall and Aarti Veernala
Abstract: We show how a strongly coupled lattice theory consisting of just fermions and gauge fields can exhibit a dynamical Higgs mechanism through the formation of a gauge invariant four fermion condensate. Furthermore, we argue that this lattice Higgs phase may survive into the continuum limit.
