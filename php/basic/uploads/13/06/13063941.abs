Title: Phenomenological characterisation of semi-holographic non-Fermi liquids
Authors: Ayan Mukhopadhyay and Giuseppe Policastro
Abstract: We analyse some phenomenological implications of the most general semi-holographic models for non-Fermi liquids that have emerged with inputs from the holographic correspondence. We find generalizations of Landau-Silin equations with few parameters governing thermodynamics, low energy response and collective excitations. We show that even when there is a Fermi surface with well-defined quasi-particle excitations, the collective excitations can behave very differently from Landau's theory.
