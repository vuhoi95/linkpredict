Title: Numerically Investigating the Emergent Cyclic Inflation Scenario
Authors: William Duhe and Tirthabir Biswas
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive numerical study of the Emergent Cyclic Inflation scenario. This is a scenario where instead of traditional monotonic slow roll inflation, the universe expands over numerous short asymmetric cycles due to the production of entropy via interactions among different species. This is one of the very few scenarios of inflation which provides a nonsingular geodesically complete space-time and does not require any "reheating" mechanism.
