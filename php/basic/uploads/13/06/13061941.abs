Title: Very Special Relativity and Lorentz Violating Theories
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: Very special relativity (VSR) keeps the main features of special relativity but breaks rotational invariance. It can not be regarded as a fundamental symmetry of nature because many observed phenomena depend on the existence of Lorentz boosts. However, within the scope of Lorentz violating theories it can have a role since it is breaking Lorentz symmetry in a very mild way. In this context, when VSR terms are incorporated in a Lorentz invariant theory several possibilities are allowed. In order to generate such terms systematically we start with a formulation for a spinning particle in VSR. It is then coupled minimally to the electromagnetic field and a gyromagnetic factor is added to give rise to a magnetic moment. In order to analyze the effects of VSR in Thomas precession a spin vector is then proposed in terms of the spinning particle variables. It is then found the VSR contributions to the equation which determines the spin precession angular velocity.
