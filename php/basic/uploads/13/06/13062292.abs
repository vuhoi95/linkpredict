Title: On the scattering over the GKP vacuum
Authors: Davide Fioravanti and Simone Piscaglia and Marco Rossi
Abstract: By converting the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM into non-linear integral equations, we find 2D scattering amplitudes of excitations on top of the GKP vacuum. We prove that this is a suitable and powerful set-up for the understanding and computation of the whole S-matrix. We show that all the amplitudes depend on the fundamental scalar-scalar one.
