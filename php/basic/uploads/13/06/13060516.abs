Title: Black Hole Information as Topological Qubits
Authors: Erik Verlinde and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: The principle of balanced holography, introduced in [1], posits that black hole information is stored in non-local correlations between the interior and exterior. Based on this concept, we propose that black hole information decomposes into elementary units in the form of topological qubits, and is protected from local sources of decoherence. The topological protection mechanism ensures that the horizon of an evaporating black hole stays young and smooth.
