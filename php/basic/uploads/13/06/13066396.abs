Title: Charge transport by holographic Fermi surfaces
Authors: Thomas Faulkner and Nabil Iqbal and Hong Liu and John McGreevy and David Vegh
Abstract: We compute the contribution to the conductivity from holographic Fermi surfaces obtained from probe fermions in an AdS charged black hole. This requires calculating a certain part of the one-loop correction to a vector propagator on the charged black hole geometry. We find that the current dissipation is as efficient as possible and the transport lifetime coincides with the single-particle lifetime. In particular, in the case where the spectral density is that of a marginal Fermi liquid, the resistivity is linear in temperature.
