Title: Superconformal generalizations of the Starobinsky model
Authors: Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde
Abstract: We find a way to represent the Starobinsky model in terms of a simple conformally invariant theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also present a superconformal theory, which, upon spontaneous breaking of the superconformal symmetry, provides a consistent supergravity generalization of the Starobinsky model.
