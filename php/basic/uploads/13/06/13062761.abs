Title: Dimensional Oxidation of Non-geometric Fluxes in Type II Orientifolds
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Xin Gao and Daniela Herschmann and Pramod Shukla
Abstract: Some aspects of string compactifications with non-geometric fluxes are revisited in the light of recent progress in double field theory. After rederiving the general form of these fluxes, we consider the proposed flux induced four-dimensional effective superpotential and oxidize its induced scalar potential to terms in a ten-dimensional action. This analysis is performed independently for an explicit toroidal type IIA and its T-dual type IIB orientifold. We show in detail that the result of this bottom-up approach is compatible with the gauged supergravity motivated flux formulation of the double field theory action in both the NS-NS and the R-R sector.
