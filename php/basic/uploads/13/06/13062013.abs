Title: Critical magnetic field in holographic superconductor in Gauss-Bonnet  gravity with Born-Infeld electrodynamics
Authors: Sheng-liang Cui and Zhao Xue
Abstract: In the paper using matching method in the probe limit, we investigate some properties of holographic superconductor in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Born-Infeld electrodynamics . We discuss the effects of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\a$ and Born-Infeld parameter $b$ on the critical temperature and condensate. We find that both of $\a$ and $b$ make the critical temperature decrease, which implies the condensate harder to form. Moreover we study the magnetic effect on holographic superconductor and obtain that the ratio between the critical magnetic field and the square of the critical temperature increases from zero as the temperature is lowered below the critical value $T_c$, which agrees well with the former results. We also find the critical magnetic field is indeed affected by Gauss-Bonnet coupling, but not by Born-Infeld parameter.
