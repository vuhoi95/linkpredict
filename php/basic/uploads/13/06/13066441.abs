Title: Pure Gravitational Back-Reaction Observables
Authors: N. C. Tsamis and R. P. Woodard
Abstract: After discussing the various issues regarding and requirements on pure quantum gravitational observables in homogeneous-isotropic conditions, we construct a composite operator observable satisfying most of them. We also expand it to first order in the loop counting parameter and suggest it as a physical quantifier of gravitational back-reaction in an initially inflating cosmology.
