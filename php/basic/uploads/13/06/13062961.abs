Title: On Ghost-free Supersymmetric Galileons
Authors: Fotis Farakos and Cristiano Germani and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: We present consistent supersymmetric theories invariant under the generalization of the Galilean shift symmetry to ${\cal{N}}=1$ superspace. These theories are constructed via the decoupling limit of certain non-minimally derivative coupled supergravities, thus they correspond to the supersymmetrization of the so-called covariant Galileon. Specifically, these theories are constructed in the linearized ${\cal{N}}=1$ new-minimal supergravity set-up where the chiral supermultiplet is minimally coupled to gravity via the standard R-current contact term, and, at the same time, non-minimally derivatively coupled to the Einstein superfield.
