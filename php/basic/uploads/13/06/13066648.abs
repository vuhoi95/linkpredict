Title: Finite momentum at string endpoints
Authors: Andrej Ficnar and Steven S. Gubser
Abstract: We argue that classical strings, both bosonic and supersymmetric, can have finite energy and momentum at their endpoints. We show that in a general curved background, string endpoints must propagate along null geodesics as long as their energy remains finite. Finite endpoint momentum allows strings with a fixed energy to travel a greater distance in an AdS5-Schwarzschild background than has been possible for classical solutions considered previously. We review the relevance to heavy ion phenomenology of the dependence of this distance on energy, and we propose a scheme for determining the instantaneous rate of energy loss.
