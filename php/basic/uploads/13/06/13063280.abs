Title: Eisenstein series on rank 2 hyperbolic Kac--Moody groups
Authors: Lisa Carbone and Kyu-Hwan Lee and Dongwen Liu
Abstract: We define Eisenstein series on rank 2 hyperbolic Kac--Moody groups over R, induced from quasi--characters. We prove convergence of the constant term and hence the almost everywhere convergence of the Eisenstein series. We define and calculate the degenerate Fourier coefficients. We also consider Eisenstein series induced from cusp forms and show that these are entire functions.
