Title: Holographic $s$-wave condensation and Meissner-like effect in  Gauss-Bonnet gravity with various non-linear corrections
Authors: Shirsendu Dey and Arindam Lala
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the onset of holographic $s$-wave condensate in the $(4+1)$ dimensional planar Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black hole background with several non-linear corrections to the gauge field. In the probe limit, performing explicit analytic computations, with and without magnetic field, we found that these higher order corrections indeed affect various quantities characterising the holographic superconductors. Also, performing a comparative study of the two non-linear electrodynamics it has been shown that the exponential electrodynamics has stronger effects on the formation of the scalar hair. We observe that our results agree well with those obtained numerically [Z. Zhao et. al., Nucl. Phys. B 871 [FS] (2013) 98].
