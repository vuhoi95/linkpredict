Title: Two-loop static potential in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Mario Prausa and Matthias Steinhauser
Abstract: We compute the soft contribution to the static energy of two heavy colour sources interacting via a N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Both singlet and octet colour configurations are considered. Our calculations complete recent considerations of the ultrasoft contributions.
