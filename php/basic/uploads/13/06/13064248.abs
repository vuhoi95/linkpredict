Title: Conformal Trace Relations from the Dilaton Wess-Zumino Action
Authors: Claudio Coriano and Luigi Delle Rose and Carlo Marzo and Mirko Serino
Abstract: We use the method of Weyl-gauging in the determination of the Wess-Zumino conformal anomaly action, to show that in any even ($d = 2 k$) dimensions all the hierarchy of correlation functions involving traces of the energy-momentum tensor is determined in terms of those of lower orders, up to $2 k$. We work out explicitly the case $d=4$, and show that in this case in any conformal field theory only the first 4 traced correlators are independent. All the remaining correlators are recursively generated by the first 4. The result is a consequence of the cocycle condition which defines the Wess-Zumino action and of the finite order of its dilaton interactions.
