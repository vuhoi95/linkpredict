Title: Renormalization of Higher Derivative Quantum Gravity Coupled to a Scalar  with Shift Symmetry
Authors: Kenji Muneyuki and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: It has been suggested that higher-derivative gravity theories coupled to a scalar field with shift symmetry may be an important candidate for a quantum gravity. We show that this class of gravity theories are renormalizable in D = 3 and 4 dimensions.
