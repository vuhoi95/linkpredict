Title: Warming up D3 brane motion in the background of D5 brane and Inflation
Authors: Anindita Bhattacharjee and Atri Deshamukhya
Abstract: The position of a mobile D-3 brane moving towards a stack of localized D-5 branes has been studied as a candidate driving inflation in the warm inflationary scenario. We compare the results obtained by considering the dissipation parameter $\Gamma$ as an arbitrary function of only the inflaton field and a particular form derived by Bastro-Gil et al \cite{Berera8}. We find that the observables remain well within the recent observational constraint for a wide range of model parameters for the first case whereas the spectral index in the later case is always predicted blue, other cosmological observables remaining well within bound for a wider range of parameters though. We also discuss the non-gaussianity generated during inflation in this model.
