Title: Extraordinary Gauge Mediation at Finite Temperature
Authors: Aaron Hanken and Ben Kain and Collin Manning
Abstract: We investigate minimally completed models of extraordinary gauge mediation, which are examples of direct gauge mediation, at finite temperature both analytically and numerically. These models may have both supersymmetry breaking and supersymmetric vacua. Our interest is in determining the preferred vacuum. We do so by computing the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potential and studying its thermal evolution.
