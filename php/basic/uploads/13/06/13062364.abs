Title: Revisiting the Faddeev-Skyrme Model and Hopf Solitons
Authors: A. Gorsky and M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We observe that the Faddeev-Skyrme model emerges as a low-energy limit of scalar QED with two charged scalar fields and a selfinteraction potential of a special form (inspired by supersymmetric QCD). Then we discuss possible Hopf solitons of the "twisted-toroidal" type.
