Title: Nucleon GPDs in a light-front quark model derived from soft-wall AdS/QCD
Authors: Alfredo Vega and Ivan Schmidt and Thomas Gutsche and Valery E. Lyubovitskij
Abstract: We study the helicity-independent generalized parton distributions of nucleons in the zero skewness case, based on a particular light-front quark model derived in a soft-wall AdS/QCD approach.
