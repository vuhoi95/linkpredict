Title: Fractionalized Non-Self-Dual Solutions in the CP(N-1) Model
Authors: Robert Dabrowski and Gerald V. Dunne
Abstract: We study non-self-dual classical solutions in the CP(N-1) model with Z_N twisted boundary conditions on the spatially compactified cylinder. These solutions have finite, and fractional, classical action and topological charge, and are `unstable' in the sense that the corresponding fluctuation operator has negative modes. We propose a physical interpretation of these solutions as saddle point configurations whose contributions to a resurgent semi-classical analysis of the quantum path integral are imaginary non-perturbative terms which must be cancelled by infrared renormalon terms generated in the perturbative sector.
