Title: Extended higher spin holography and Grassmannian models
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Yasuaki Hikida and Peter B. Ronne
Abstract: We propose holographic dualities between higher spin gravity theories extended with Chan-Paton factor on AdS_3 and a large N limit of two dimensional Grassmannian models with and without supersymmetry. These proposals are natural extensions of the duality without Chan-Paton factor, and the extensions are motivated by a higher dimensional version of the duality, which implies a possible relation to superstring theory via ABJ theory. As evidence for the proposals, we show that the free limit of the Grassmannian models have the higher spin symmetry expected from the dual gravity theory. Furthermore, we construct currents in the 't Hooft limit of the supersymmetric Grassmannian model and compare them with the currents from the bulk theory. One-loop partition function of the supergravity theory is reproduced by the 't Hooft limit of the Grassmannian model after decoupling a gauge sector.
