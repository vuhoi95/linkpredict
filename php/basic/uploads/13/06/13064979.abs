Abstract: We obtain constraints on parameters of the Yukawa-type corrections to Newton's gravitational law from measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force between surfaces coated with ferromagnetic metal Ni and from measurements of the Casimir force between Au-coated sinusoidally corrugated surfaces at various angles between corrugations. It is shown that constraints following from the experiment with magnetic surfaces are slightly weaker than currently available strongest constraints, but benefit from increased reliability and independence of systematic effects.The constraints derived from the experiment with corrugated surfaces within the interaction region from 11.6 to 29.2\,nm are stronger up to a factor of 4 than the strongest constraints derived from other experiments. The possibility of further strengthening of constraints on non-Newtonian gravity by using the configurations with corrugated boundaries is proposed.
