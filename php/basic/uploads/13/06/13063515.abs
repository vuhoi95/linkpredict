Title: Model Sensitivity in Holographic Superconductors and their Deconstructed  Cousins
Authors: Joshua Erlich and Zhen Wang
Abstract: Holographic models of superconductors successfully reproduce certain experimental features of high-temperature superconductors, such as a large gap-to-T_c ratio compared to that of conventional superconductors. By deconstructing the extra dimension of these holographic models, similar phenomenology is described by a class of models defined in the natural dimension of the superconducting system. We analyze the sensitivity of certain observables in holographic and deconstructed holographic superconductors to details of the extra-dimensional spacetime. Our results support the notion that certain quantitative successes of simple models of this type are accidental. However, we also find a certain universal relationship between superconducting observables.
