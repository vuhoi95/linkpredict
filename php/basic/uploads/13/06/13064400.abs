Title: No-go theorem for static scalar field dark matter halos with no Noether  charges
Authors: Alberto Diez-Tejedor and Alma X. Gonzalez-Morales
Abstract: Classical scalar fields have been considered as a possible effective description of dark matter. We show that, for any metric theory of gravity, no static, spherically symmetric, regular, spatially localized, attractive, stable spacetime configuration can be sourced by the coherent excitation of a scalar field with positive definite energy density and no Noether charges. In the weak-field regime the result also applies for configurations with a repulsive gravitational potential. This extends Derrick's theorem to the case of a general (non-canonical) scalar field, including the self-gravitational effects. Some possible ways out are briefly discussed.
