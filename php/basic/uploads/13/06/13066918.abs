Title: The low energy limit of the AdS(3) x S(3) x M(4) spinning string
Authors: Per Sundin and Linus Wulff
Abstract: We derive the low-energy effective action for the spinning (GKP) string in AdS(3) x S(3) x M(4) where M(4) = S(3) x S(1) or T(4). In the first case the action consists of two O(4) non-linear sigma models which are coupled through their interaction with four massless Majorana fermions (plus one free decoupled scalar). While in the second case it consists of one O(4) sigma model coupled to four Majorana fermions together with four free scalars from the T(4). We show that these models are classically integrable by constructing their Lax connections.
