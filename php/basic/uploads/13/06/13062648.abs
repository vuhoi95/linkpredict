Abstract: We consider the topologically nontrivial phase states and the corresponding topological defects in the SU(3) d-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The homotopy groups for topological classes of such defects are calculated explicitly. We have shown that the three nontrivial groups are pi_3 SU(3)=Z, pi_5 SU(3)=Z, and pi_6 SU(3)=Z_6 if 3 < d < 6. The latter result means that we are dealing exactly with six topologically different phase states. The topological invariants for d=3,5,6 are described in detail.
