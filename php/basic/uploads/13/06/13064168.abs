Title: Cosmological Tests of the Disformal Coupling to Radiation
Authors: Philippe Brax and Clare Burrage and Anne-Christine Davis and Giulia Gubitosi
Abstract: Light scalar fields can naturally couple disformally to Standard Model fields without giving rise to the unacceptably large fifth forces usually associated with light scalars. We show that these scalar fields can still be studied and constrained through their interaction with photons, and focus particularly on changes to the Cosmic Microwave Background spectral distortions and violations of the distance duality relation. We then specialise our constraints to scalars which could play the role of axionic quintessence.
