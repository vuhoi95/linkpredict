Abstract: We evaluate ABJM observables at two loops, for any value of the rank N of the gauge group. We compute the color subleading contributions to the four-point scattering amplitude in ABJM at two loops. Contrary to the four dimensional case, IR divergent N-subleading contributions are proportional to leading poles in the regularization parameter. We then exploit the non-planar calculation for the amplitude to derive an expression for the two-loop Sudakov form factor at any N. In the planar limit the result coincides with the one recently obtained in literature by using Feynman diagrams and unitarity. Finally, we analyze the subleading contributions to the light-like four-cusps Wilson loop and interpret the result in terms of the non-abelian exponentiation theorem. All these perturbative results satisfy the uniform transcendentality principle, hinting at its validity in ABJM beyond the planar limit.
