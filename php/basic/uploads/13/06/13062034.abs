Title: Statistical Mechanics of Phase-Space Curves
Authors: M. Rocca and A. Plastino and G. L. Ferri
Abstract: We study the classical statistical mechanics of a phase-space curve. This unveils a mechanism that, via the associated entropic force, provides us with a simple realization of effects such as confinement, hard core, and asymptotic freedom. Additionally, we obtain negative specific heats, a distinctive feature of self-gravitating systems and negative pressures, typical of dark energy.
