Title: Strong lensing constraints on bimetric massive gravity
Authors: Jonas Enander and Edvard Mortsell
Abstract: We derive dynamical and gravitational lensing properties of local sources in the Hassan-Rosen bimetric gravity theory. Observations of elliptical galaxies rule out values of the effective length-scale of the theory, in units of the Hubble radius, in the interval 10^-6 < lambda_g/r_H < 10^-3, unless the proportionality constant between the metrics at the background level is far from unity, in which case general relativity is effectively restored for local sources. In order to have background solutions resembling the concordance cosmological model, without fine-tuning of the parameters of the model, we are restricted to the upper interval, or lambda_g/r_H ~ 1. Except for a limited range of parameter values, the Hassan-Rosen theory is thus consistent with the observed lensing and dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies.
