Title: Phase Structure in a Dynamical Soft-Wall Holographic QCD Model
Authors: Song He and Shang-Yu Wu and Yi Yang and Pei-Hung Yuan
Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system with an arbitrary kinetic gauge function and a dilaton potential. A family of analytic solutions is obtained by the potential reconstruction method. We then study its holographic dual QCD model. The kinetic gauge function can be fixed by requesting the linear Regge spectrum of mesons. We calculate the free energy to obtain the phase diagram of the holographic QCD model and interpret our result as the heavy quarks system by comparing the recent lattice QCD simulation. We finally obtain the equations of state in our model.
