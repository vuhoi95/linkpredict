Abstract: Several dark energy models on the brane are investigated. They are compared with corresponding theories in the frame of 4d Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. To constrain the parameters of the models considered, recent observational data, including SNIa apparent magnitude measurements, baryon acoustic oscillation results, Hubble parameter evolution data and matter density perturbations are used. Explicit formulas of the so-called {\it state-finder} parameters in teleparallel theories are obtained that could be useful to test these models and to establish a link between Loop Quantum Cosmology and Brane Cosmology. It is concluded that a joint analysis as the one developed here allows to estimate, in a very convenient way, possible deviation of the real universe cosmology from the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker one.
