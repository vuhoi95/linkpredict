Title: Exact higher-spin symmetry in CFT: free fermion correlators from  Vasiliev Theory
Authors: V. E. Didenko and Jianwei Mei and E. D. Skvortsov
Abstract: N-point correlation functions of conserved currents and weight-two scalar operators of the three-dimensional free fermion vector model are found as invariants of the higher-spin symmetry in four-dimensional AdS. These are the correlators of the unbroken Vasiliev higher-spin theory. The results extend the recent work arXiv:1210.7963 and are complementary to arXiv:1301.3123 where the correlators were computed entirely on the boundary.
