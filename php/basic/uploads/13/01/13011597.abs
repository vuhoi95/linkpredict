Title: Rigorous Test of Non-conformal Holography: Wilson Loops in N=2* Theory
Authors: Alex Buchel and Jorge G. Russo and Konstantin Zarembo
Abstract: N=2* gauge theory in four space-time dimensions arises as a deformation of the parent N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mill theory under which its hypermultiplet acquires a mass. This theory, on the one hand, has a known supergravity dual and on the other hand is amenable to localization. We explain, using localization, a dynamical selection of the supergravity Coulomb branch vacuum at large N. We also demonstrate that large Wilson loops obey perimeter law, again finding exact match between direct field-theory calculations and string theory. Additionally, we compute free energy at large 't Hooft coupling.
