Title: PM = EM: Partially Massless Duality Invariance
Authors: S. Deser and A. Waldron
Abstract: In d=4 de Sitter space, novel conformally invariant photon-like theories consistently couple to charged matter. We show that these higher spin, maximal depth, partially massless systems enjoy a Maxwellian, "electric-magnetic" duality.
