Title: On non-equilibrium physics and string theory
Authors: Nickolas Gray and Djordje Minic and Michel Pleimling
Abstract: In this article we review the relation between string theory and non-equilibrium physics based on our previously published work. First we explain why a theory of quantum gravity and non-equilibrium statistical physics should be related in the first place. Then we present the necessary background from the recent research in non-equilibrium physics. The review discusses the relationship of string theory and aging phenomena, as well as the connection between AdS/CFT correspondence and the Jarzynski identity. We also discuss the emergent symmetries in fully developed turbulence and the corresponding non-equilibrium stationary states. Finally we outline a larger picture regarding the relationship between non-perturbative quantum gravity and non-equilibrium statistical physics. This relationship can be understood as a natural generalization of the well-known Wilsonian relation between local quantum field theory and equilibrium statistical physics of critical phenomena. According to this picture the AdS/CFT duality is just an example of a more general connection between non-perturbative quantum gravity and non-equilibrium physics. In the appendix of this review we discuss a new kind of complementarity between thermodynamics and statistical physics which should be important in the context of black hole complementarity.
