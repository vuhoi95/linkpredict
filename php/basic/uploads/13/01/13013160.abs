Abstract: We investigate 4D dS solutions with co-dimension two branes and finite 4D Planck mass in six dimensions. We present the conditions under which six-dimensional compactifications with holomorphic axion-dilaton field or models with pure gravity with local sources can yield 4D dS solutions. Different classes of solutions are specified by a holomorphic function describing different embeddings of multiple conical branes. Depending on the local singularities of this holomorphic function and the topology of the compact dimension one has to introduce D3-branes creating a deficit angle equal to \pi and/or D4-branes with positive tensions.
