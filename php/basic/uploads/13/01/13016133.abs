Title: Effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on Compact Stars
Authors: Ahmed Farag Ali and A. Tawfik
Abstract: Based on the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), proposed by some approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory and doubly special relativity theories, we investigate the effect of GUP on the thermodynamic properties of compact stars with two different components. We note that the existence of quantum gravity correction tends to resist the collapse of stars if the GUP parameter $\alpha$ is taking values between Planck scale and electroweak scale. Comparing with approaches, it is found that the radii of compact stars are found smaller. Increasing energy almost exponentially decreases the radii of compact stars.
