Title: Lee-Wick radiation induced bouncing universe models
Authors: Kaushik Bhattacharya and Yi-Fu Cai and Suratna Das
Abstract: The present article discusses about the effect of a Lee-Wick partner infested radiation phase of the early universe. As Lee-Wick partners can contribute negative energy density so it is always possible that at some early phase of the universe when the Lee-Wick partners were thermalized the total energy density of the universe became very small making the effective Hubble radius very big. This possibility gives rise to the probability of a bouncing universe. As will be shown in the article that a simple Lee-Wick radiation is not enough to produce a bounce. There can be two possibilities which can produce a bounce in the Lee-Wick radiation phase. One requires a cold dark matter candidate to trigger the bounce and the other possibility requires the bouncing temperature to be fine tuned such as all the Lee-Wick partners of the standard fields are not thermalized at the bounce temperature. Both the possibilities give rise to blue-tilted power spectrum of metric perturbations. Moreover the bouncing universe model can predict the lower limit of the masses of the Lee-Wick partners of chiral fermions and massless gauge bosons. The mass limit intrinsically depends upon the bounce temperature.
