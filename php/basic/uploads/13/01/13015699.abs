Title: A Single Field Inflation Model with Large Local Non-Gaussianity
Authors: Xingang Chen and Hassan Firouzjahi and Mohammad Hossein Namjoo and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: A detection of large local form non-Gaussianity is considered to be able to rule out all single field inflation models. This statement is based on a single field consistency condition. Despite the awareness of some implicit assumptions in the derivation of this condition and the demonstration of corresponding examples that illustrate these caveats, to date there is still no explicit and self-consistent model which can serve as a counterexample to this statement. We present such a model in this Letter.
