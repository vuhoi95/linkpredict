Abstract: The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric with spherical topology is calculated as an effective metric at the brane in a multiple branes in $D-$dimensional spacetime scenario. In this model the radius of the brane is the cosmological scale factor, and its evolution is calculated from the viewpoint of the observers on their respective branes. The cosmology of the brane-universe is analyzed in cases where the anisotropic pressure has a cosmological constant like state equation. The pressure values needed to distinguish the oscillating, expanding or collapsing solutions are found, and the minimum value of a brane-universe mass to prevent a collapse into a black hole is also calculated. Finally the equation of motion is solved numerically in order to illustrate the different cosmological scenarios and to validate the analytical results.
