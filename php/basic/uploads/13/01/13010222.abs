Title: The noncovariant gauges in 3-form theories
Authors: Sudhaker Upadhyay and Manoj Kumar Dwivedi and Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We study the 3-form gauge theory in the context of generalized BRST formulation. We construct the finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST) symmetry for such a theory. The generating functional for 3-form gauge theory in noncovariant gauge is obtained from that of in covariant gauge. We further extend the results by considering 3-form gauge theory in the context of Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation.
