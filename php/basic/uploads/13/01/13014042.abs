Title: GUP-based and Snyder Non-Commutative Algebras, Relativistic Particle  models and Deformed Symmetries: A Unified Approach
Authors: Souvik Pramanik and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: We have developed a unified scheme for studying Non-Commutative algebras based on Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and Snyder form in a relativistically covariant point particle Lagrangian (or symplectic) framework. Even though the GUP based algebra and Snyder algebra are very distinct, the more involved latter algebra emerges from an approximation of the Lagrangian model of the former algebra. Deformed Poincare generators for the systems that keep space-time symmetries of the relativistic particle models have been studied thoroughly. From a purely constrained dynamical analysis perspective the models studied here are very rich and provide insights on how to consistently construct approximate models from the exact ones when non-linear constraints are present in the system. We also study dynamics of the GUP particle in presence of external electromagnetic field.
