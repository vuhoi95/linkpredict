Abstract: In this talk, we examine the physical unitarity in a massive Yang-Mills theory without the Higgs field in which the color gauge symmetry is not spontaneously broken and kept intact. For this purpose, we use a new framework proposed one of the authors based on a nonperturbative construction of a non-Abelian field describing a massive spin-one vector boson field, which enables us to perform the perturbative and nonperturbative studies on the physical unitarity. Moreover, we present a new perturbative treatment for the physical unitarity after giving the general properties of the massive Yang-Mills theory. Then we reproduce the violation of physical unitarity in a transparent way. This work is a preliminary work to the subsequent works in which we present a nonperturbative framework to propose a possible scenario of restoring the physical unitarity in the Curci-Ferrari model. We discuss the implications for the low-energy QCD in relation to color confinement, glueball mass and BRST-invariant dimension-two condensate.
