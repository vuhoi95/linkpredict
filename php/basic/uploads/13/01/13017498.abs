Title: Including four-gluon interactions into Landau and maximally-Abelian  gauge Dyson-Schwinger studies
Authors: Valentin Mader and Reinhard Alkofer
Abstract: In Dyson-Schwinger studies of the Yang-Mills propagators the four-gluon interaction has been usually neglected due to the related technical difficulties with the associated two-loop terms and especially their renormalization. A possible scenario to renormalize these fully-dressed two-loop terms is presented. Preliminary results for the Landau gauge gluon propagator are shown. Implications for the gluon propagators in maximally Abelian gauge are discussed.
