Title: Non-minimal $RF^2$-type corrections to holographic superconductor
Authors: Ã–zcan Sert and Muzaffer Adak
Abstract: We study $(2+1)$-dimensional holographic superconductors in the presence of non-minimally coupled electromagnetic field to gravity by considering an arbitrary linear combination of $RF^2$-type invariants with three parameters. Our analytical analysis shows that the non-minimal couplings affect the condensate and the critical temperature.
