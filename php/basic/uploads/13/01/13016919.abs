Title: The many surprises of maximal supergravity
Authors: Andrea Borghese and Adolfo Guarino and Diederik Roest
Abstract: We describe recent developments regarding gauged N=8 supergravity in D=4. Using the embedding tensor formulation we show how to classify all the extrema of this theory with a G2 residual gauge symmetry. Our classification contains all the vacua of the recently discovered family of SO(8) gauged maximal supergravities.
