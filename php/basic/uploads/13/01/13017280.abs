Title: Four Kahler Moduli Stabilisation in type IIB Orientifolds with K3-fibred  Calabi-Yau threefold compactification
Authors: Dieter Lust and Xu Zhang
Abstract: We present a concrete and consistent procedure to generate one kind of non-perturbative superpotential, including the gaugino condensation corrections and poly-instanton corrections, in type IIB orientifold compactification with four Kahler Moduli. Then we use this kind of superpotential as well as the alphaprime-corrections to Kahler potential to fix all of the four Kahler moduli on a general Calabi-Yau manifold with typical K3-fibred volume form. In our construction, the considered Calabi-Yau threefolds are K3-fibred and admit at least one del Pezzo surface and one W-surface. Searching through all existing four dimensional reflexive lattice polytopes, we find 23 of them fulfilling all the requirements.
