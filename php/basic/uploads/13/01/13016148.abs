Title: Dirac Equation with vector and scalar potentials via Supersymmetry in  Quantum Mechanics
Authors: E. S. Rodrigues and A. F. de Lima and R. de Lima Rodrigues
Abstract: In this work, a spin $\frac 12$ relativistic particle described by a generalized potential containing both the Coulomb potential and a Lorentz scalar potential in Dirac equation is investigated in terms of the generalized ladder operators from supersymmetry in quantum mechanics. This formalism is applied for the generalized Dirac-Coulomb problem, which is an exactly solvable potential in relativistic quantum mechanics. We obtain the energy eigenvalues and calculate explicitly the energy eigenfunctions for the ground state and the first excited state.
