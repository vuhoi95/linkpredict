Title: Emergent D4-Brane Background from D-Particles
Authors: Frank Ferrari and Micha Moskovic
Abstract: We show that the solution of a pre-geometric strongly coupled quantum mechanical model describing K D-particles in the presence of N D4-branes in type IIA string theory, at fixed K and large N, yields an effective action describing the motion of the K D-particles in a classical ten-dimensional curved space-time. By comparing the effective action with the non-abelian D-brane action in an arbitrary supergravity background, we identify the metric, dilaton and Ramond-Ramond fields and find a precise match with the near-horizon D4-brane geometry.
