Title: Space-Times with Integrable Singularity
Authors: Vladimir N. Lukash and Vladimir N. Strokov
Abstract: We use the phenomenological approach to study properties of space-time in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black-hole singularity. Requiring finiteness of the Schwarzschild-like metrics we come to the notion of integrable singularity that is, in a sense, weaker than the conventional singularity and allows the (effective) matter to pass to the white-hole region. This leads to a possibility of generating a new universe there. Thanks to the gravitational field of the singularity, this universe is already born highly inflated ('singularity-induced inflation') before the ordinary inflation starts.
