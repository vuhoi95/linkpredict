Title: The Yang-Mills vacuum wave functional in three dimensions at weak  coupling
Authors: Sebastian Krug and Antonio Pineda
Abstract: We compute the Yang-Mills vacuum wave functional in three dimensions at weak coupling with O(e^2) precision. We use two different methods to solve the Schroedinger functional equation. One of them generalizes to O(e^2) the method followed by Hatfield at O(e). The other uses the weak coupling version of the gauge invariant formulation of the Schroedinger equation and the ground state wave functional followed by Karabali, Nair, and Yelnikov. We compare both results and discuss the differences between them.
