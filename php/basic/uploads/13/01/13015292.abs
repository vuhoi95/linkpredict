Title: The non-perturbative BRST quartet mechanism in Landau gauge QCD:  Ghost-gluon and ghost-quark bound states
Authors: Natalia Alkofer and Reinhard Alkofer
Abstract: The non-perturbative BRST quartet mechanism in infrared Landau gauge QCD is presented. It is demonstrated that positivity violation for transverse gluons allows to identify the gluon's non-perturbative BRST quartet. To describe the respective BRST-daughter state a truncated Bethe-Salpeter equation for the gluon-ghost bound state is investigated. An analogous construction for quarks yields a truncated Bethe-Salpeter equation for the quark-ghost bound state. The gluon-ghost bound state equation in two space-time dimensions has been numerically solved.
