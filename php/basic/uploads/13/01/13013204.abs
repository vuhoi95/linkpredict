Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the localization of the Kalb-Ramond field on symmetric and asymmetric thick branes, which are generated by a background scalar field. In order to localize the Kalb-Ramond field, we introduce a coupling with the background scalar field, and find that there exist some Kaluza-Klein resonant modes. For the case of symmetric brane, we seek the resonances by using the relative probability method and transfer matrix method, and obtain the same result for the two methods. For the asymmetric case, we use the transfer matrix method. We find that the number of resonances will decrease with the increase of the asymmetry.
