Title: BRST cohomology of the sum of two pure spinors
Authors: Andrei Mikhailov and Renjun Xu
Abstract: We study the zero mode cohomology of the sum of two pure spinors. The knowledge of this cohomology allows us to better understand the structure of the massless vertex operator of the Type IIB pure spinor superstring.
