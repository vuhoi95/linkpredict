Title: No Conformal Anomaly in Unimodular Gravity
Authors: Enrique √Ålvarez and Mario Herrero-Valea
Abstract: The conformal invariance of unimodular gravity survives quantum corrections, even in the presence of conformal matter. Unimodular gravity can actually be understood as a certain truncation of the full Einstein-Hilbert theory, where in the Einstein frame the metric tensor enjoys unit determinant. Our result is compatible with the idea that the corresponding restriction in the functional integral is consistent as well.
