Title: $(2+1)$-$d$ Glueball Spectrum within a Constituent Picture
Authors: F. Buisseret and V. Mathieu and C. Semay
Abstract: The quantum numbers and mass hierarchy of the glueballs observed in $(2+1)$-dimensional lattice QCD with gauge group SU($N_c$) are shown to be in agreement with a constituent picture. The agreement is maintained when going from glueballs to gluelumps, and when the gauge group SO($2N_c$) is taken instead of SU($N_c$).
