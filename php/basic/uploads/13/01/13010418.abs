Title: Rigorous theoretical constraint on constant negative EoS parameter  $Ï‰$ and its effect for the late Universe
Authors: Alvina Burgazli and Maxim Eingorn and Alexander Zhuk
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Universe at the late stage of its evolution and deep inside the cell of uniformity. At these scales, the Universe is filled with inhomogeneously distributed discrete structures (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies). Supposing that the Universe contains also the cosmological constant and a perfect fluid with a negative constant equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega$ (e.g., quintessence, phantom or frustrated network of topological defects), we investigate scalar perturbations of the FRW metrics due to inhomogeneities. Our analysis shows that, to be compatible with the theory of scalar perturbations, this perfect fluid, first, should be clustered and, second, should have the equation of state parameter $\omega=-1/3$. In particular, this value corresponds to the frustrated network of cosmic strings. Therefore, the frustrated network of domain walls with $\omega =-2/3$ is ruled out. A perfect fluid with $\omega =-1/3$ neither accelerates nor decelerates the Universe. We also obtain the equation for the nonrelativistic gravitational potential created by a system of inhomogeneities. Due to the perfect fluid with $\omega = -1/3$, the physically reasonable solutions take place for flat, open and closed Universes. This perfect fluid is concentrated around the inhomogeneities and results in screening of the gravitational potential.
