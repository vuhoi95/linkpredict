Title: High-temperature expansion of the one-loop free energy of a scalar field  on a curved background
Authors: I. S. Kalinichenko and P. O. Kazinski
Abstract: The complete form of the high-temperature expansion of the one-loop contribution to the free energy of a scalar field on a stationary gravitational background is derived. The explicit expressions for the divergent and finite parts of the high-temperature expansion in a three-dimensional space without boundaries are obtained. These formulas generalize the known one for the stationary spacetime. In particular, we confirm that for a massless conformal scalar field the leading correction to the Planck law proportional to the temperature squared turns out to be nonzero due to non-static nature of the metric. The explicit expression for the so-called energy-time anomaly is found. The interrelation between this anomaly and the conformal (trace) anomaly is established. The natural simplest Lagrangian for the "Killing vector field" is given.
