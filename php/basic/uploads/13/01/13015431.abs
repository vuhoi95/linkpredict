Title: The effect of inertia on the Dirac electron, the spin Hall current and  the momentum space Berry curvature
Authors: Debashree Chowdhury and B. Basu
Abstract: We have studied the spin dependent force and the associated momentum space Berry curvature in an accelerating system. The results are derived by taking into consideration the non relativistic limit of a generally covariant Dirac equation under the presence of electromagnetic field where the methodology of Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is applied to achieve the non relativistic limit. Spin currents appear due to the combined action of the external electric field, crystal field and the induced inertial electric field via the total effective spin-orbit interaction. In an accelerating frame, the crucial role of momentum space Berry curvature in the spin dynamics has also been addressed from the perspective of spin Hall conductivity. For time dependent acceleration, the expression for the spin polarization has been derived.
