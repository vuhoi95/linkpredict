Title: Nonrelativistic conformal transformations in Lagrangian formalism
Authors: K. Andrzejewski and J. Gonera and A. Kijanka-Dec
Abstract: The conformal transformations corresponding to $N$-Galilean conformal symmetries, previously defined as canonical symmetry transformations on phase space, are constructed as point transformations in coordinate space.
