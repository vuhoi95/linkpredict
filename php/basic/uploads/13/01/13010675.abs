Title: Many avatars of the Wilson fermion: A perturbative analysis
Authors: Abhishek Chowdhury and A. Harindranath and Jyotirmoy Maiti and Santanu Mondal
Abstract: We explore different branches of the fermion doublers with Wilson fermion in perturbation theory, in the context of additive mass renormalization and chiral anomaly, and show that by appropriately averaging over suitably chosen branches one can reduce cut-off artifacts. Comparing the central branch with all other branches, we find that the central branch, among all the avatars of the Wilson fermion, is the most suitable candidate for exploring near conformal lattice field theories.
