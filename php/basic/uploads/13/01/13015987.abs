Title: Nonlocality and Entanglement via the Unruh effect
Authors: Zehua Tian and Jieci Wang and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: Modeling the qubit by a two-level semiclassical detector coupled to a massless scalar field, we investigate how the Unruh effect affects the nonlocality and entanglement of two-qubit and three-qubit states when one of the entangled qubits is accelerated. Two distinct differences with the results of free field model in non-inertial frames are (i) for the two-qubit state, the CHSH inequality can not be violated for sufficiently large but finite acceleration, furthermore, the concurrence will experience "sudden death"; and (ii) for the three-qubit state, not only the entanglement vanishes in the infinite acceleration limit, but also the Svetlichny inequality can not be violated in the case of large acceleration.
