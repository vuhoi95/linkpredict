Title: Chameleons on the Racetrack
Authors: Horatiu Nastase and Amanda Weltman
Abstract: We modify the ansatz for embedding chameleon scalars in string theory proposed in [1] by considering a racetrack superpotential with two KKLT-type exponentials $e^{ia\varrho}$ instead of one. This satisfies all experimental constraints, while also allowing for the chameleon to be light enough on cosmological scales to be phenomenologically interesting.
