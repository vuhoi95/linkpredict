Title: Measurement-Induced-Nonlocality via the Unruh effect
Authors: Zehua Tian and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: Treated beyond the single-mode approximation, Measurement-Induced-Nonlocality (MIN) is investigated for both Dirac and Bosonic fields in non-inertial frames. Two distinctly differences between the Dirac and Bosonic fields are: (i) the MIN for Dirac fields persists for any acceleration, while the quantity for Bosonic fields does decay to zero in the infinite acceleration limit; (ii) the dynamic behaviors of the MIN for Dirac fields is quite different from the Bosonic fields case. Besides, we also study the nonlocality for Dirac fields and find that the MIN is more general than the quantum nonlocality related to violation of Bell's inequalities. Meanwhile some discussions of geometric discord are presented too.
