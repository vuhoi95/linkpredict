Title: Self-sustained traversable wormholes in modified gravity theories
Authors: Remo Garattini and Francisco S. N. Lobo
Abstract: We consider the possibility that wormhole geometries are sustained by their own quantum fluctuations, in the context of noncommutative geometry and Gravity's Rainbow models. More specifically, the energy density of the graviton one-loop contribution to a classical energy in a wormhole background is considered as a self-consistent source for wormholes. In this semi-classical context, we consider the effects of a smeared particle-like source in noncommutative geometry and of the Rainbow's functions in sustaining wormhole geometries.
