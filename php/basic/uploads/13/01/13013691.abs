Title: Electric and magnetic Weyl tensors in higher dimensions
Authors: Sigbj√∏rn Hervik and Marcello Ortaggio and Lode Wylleman
Abstract: Recent results on purely electric (PE) or magnetic (PM) spacetimes in n dimensions are summarized. These include: Weyl types; diagonalizability; conditions under which direct (or warped) products are PE/PM.
