Title: Constraints on relativity violations from gamma-ray bursts
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Matthew Mewes
Abstract: Tiny violations of the Lorentz symmetry of relativity and the associated discrete CPT symmetry could emerge in a consistent theory of quantum gravity such as string theory. Recent evidence for linear polarization in gamma-ray bursts improves existing sensitivities to Lorentz and CPT violation involving photons by factors ranging from ten to a million.
