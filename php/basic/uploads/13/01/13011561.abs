Title: Phantom collapse of electrically charged scalar field in dilaton gravity
Authors: Anna Nakonieczna and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: Our research focus on gravitational collapse of electrically charged scalar field in dilaton gravity and in the presence of phantom coupling. We examine dynamical behaviour of the scalar field coupled to Maxwell field when gravitational interactions have form consistent with the low-energy limit of the string theory. Moreover, we allow the evolving fields to have negative sign in front of the respective kinetic term of the Lagrangian. The main aim of our studies is to investigate in what manner does the phantom nature of either Maxwell or dilaton fields (or both of them) affect the outcomes of the collapse. It turns out that the influence is crucial to the obtained spacetime structures. Negative kinetic energy of one (or both) of the fields delays, changes the course or even prevents the collapse.
