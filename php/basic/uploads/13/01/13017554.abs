Title: Composite representations of new SUSY algebra under nonlinear SUSY  transformations in curved spacetime
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We discuss composite representations of new supersymmetry (SUSY) algebra under nonlinear (NL) SUSY transformations in curved space-time from the viewpoint of nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity (NLSUSY GR)/ SGM scenario. We show in the linearization of NLSUSY how various basic fields in linear SUSY theories/supergravity are expressed as functionals in terms of a vierbein and Nambu-Goldstone fermion fundamental fields in NLSUSY GR.
