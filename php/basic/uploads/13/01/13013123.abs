Title: Operator algebra of free conformal currents via twistors
Authors: O. A. Gelfond and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Operator algebra of (not necessarily free) higher-spin conformal conserved currents in generalized matrix spaces, that include 3d Minkowski space-time as a particular case, is shown to be determined by an associative algebra $M$ of functions on the twistor space. For free conserved currents, $M$ is the universal enveloping algebra of the higher-spin algebra. Proposed construction greatly simplifies computation and analysis of correlators of conserved currents. Generating function for $n$-point functions of 3d (super)currents of all spins, built from $N$ free constituent massless scalars and spinors, is obtained in a concise form of certain determinant. Our results agree with and extend earlier bulk computations in the HS $AdS_4/CFT_3$ framework. Generating function for $n$-point functions of 4d conformal currents is also presented.
