Title: The Leading Order Dressing Phase in ABJM Theory
Authors: Andrea Mauri and Alberto Santambrogio and Stefano Scoleri
Abstract: We study the planar asymptotic dilatation operator of ABJM theory in the SU(2) x SU(2) sector up to eight loops. Combining Bethe Ansatz techniques and N = 2 superspace methods, we are able to fix all the coefficients appearing in the maximal-reshuffling terms. In particular, we can directly compute from Feynman diagrams the leading order coefficient of the dressing phase and find an agreement with the relation conjectured by Gromov and Vieira between the ABJM and N = 4 SYM phase factor.
