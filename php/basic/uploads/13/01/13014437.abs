Title: The Physical Mirror Equivalence for the Local P^2
Authors: Sergio Luigi Cacciatori and Marco Compagnoni and Stefano Guerra
Abstract: In this paper we consider the total space of the canonical bundle of P^2 and we use a proposal by Hosono, together with results in Seidel and Auroux-Katzarkov-Orlov, to deduce the right physical mirror equivalence between D^b(K_{P^2}) and the derived Fukaya category of its mirror. By construction, our equivalence is compatible with the mirror map between moduli spaces and with the computation of Gromov--Witten invariants.
