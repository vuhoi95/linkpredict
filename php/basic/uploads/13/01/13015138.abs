Title: Black hole complementarity and firewall in two dimensions
Authors: Wontae Kim and Bum-Hoon Lee and Dong-han Yeom
Abstract: In connection with black hole complementarity, we study the possibility of the duplication of information in the RST model which is an exactly soluble quantized model in two dimensions. We find that the duplication of information can be observed without resort to assuming an excessively large number of scalar fields. If we introduce a firewall, then we can circumvent this problem; however, the firewall should be outside the event horizon.
