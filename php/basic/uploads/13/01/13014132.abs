Title: An exact solution of the Dirac equation with CP violation
Authors: Tomislav Prokopec and Michael G. Schmidt and Jan Weenink
Abstract: We consider Yukawa theory in which the fermion mass is induced by a Higgs like scalar. In our model the fermion mass exhibits a temporal dependence, which naturally occurs in the early Universe setting. Assuming that the complex fermion mass changes as a tanh-kink, we construct an exact, helicity conserving, CP-violating solution for the positive and negative frequency fermionic mode functions, which is valid both in the case of weak and strong CP violation. Using this solution we then study the fermionic currents both in the initial vacuum and finite density/temperature setting. Our result shows that, due to a potentially large state squeezing, fermionic currents can exhibit a large oscillatory magnification. Having in mind applications to electroweak baryogenesis, we then compare our exact results with those obtained in a gradient approximation. Even though the gradient approximation does not capture the oscillatory effects of squeezing, it describes quite well the averaged current, obtained by performing a mode sum. Our main conclusion is: while the agreement with the semiclassical force is quite good in the thick wall regime, the difference is sufficiently significant to motivate a more detailed quantitative study of baryogenesis sources in the thin wall regime in more realistic settings.
