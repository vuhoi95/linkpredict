Title: Comment on star-star relations in statistical mechanics and elliptic  gamma-function identities
Authors: Vladimir V. Bazhanov and Andrew P. Kels and Sergey M. Sergeev
Abstract: We prove a recently conjectured star-star relation, which plays the role of an integrability condition for a class of 2D Ising-type models with multicomponent continuous spin variables. Namely, we reduce this relation to an identity for elliptic gamma functions, previously obtained by Rains.
