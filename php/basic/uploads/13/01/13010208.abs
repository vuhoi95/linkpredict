Title: The OPEs of Spin-4 Casimir Currents in the Holographic SO(N) Coset  Minimal Models
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Jinsub Paeng
Abstract: We compute the operator product expansion (OPE) between the spin-4 current and itself in the WD_4 coset minimal model with SO(8) current algebra. The right hand side of this OPE contains the spin-6 Casimir current which is also a generator of WD_4 coset minimal model. Based on this N=8 result, we generalize the above OPE for the general N(in the WD_{N/2} coset minimal model) by using two N-generalized coupling constants initiated by Hornfeck sometime ago: the simplest OPE for the lowest higher spin currents. We also analyze the similar OPE in the WB_3(and WB_{(N-1)/2}) coset minimal model with SO(7) current algebra. The large N 't Hooft limits are discussed. Our results in two dimensional conformal field theory provide the asymptotic symmetry, at the quantum level, of the higher spin AdS_3 gravity found by Chen et al.
