Title: Nonlinear Partially Massless from Massive Gravity?
Authors: S. Deser and M. Sandora and A. Waldron
Abstract: We show that consistent nonlinear Partially Massless models cannot be obtained starting from "f-g" massive gravity, with "f" the embedding de Sitter space. The obstruction, which is also the source of f-g acausality, is the very same fifth constraint that removes the notorious sixth ghost excitation. Here, however, it blocks extension of the mass to cosmological background tuned gauge invariance that took away the helicity zero mode at linear level. Separately, our methods allow us to almost complete the class of acausal f-g models.
