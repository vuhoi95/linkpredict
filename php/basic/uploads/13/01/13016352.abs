Title: On $k$-jet field approximations to geodesic deviation equations
Authors: Ricardo Gallego Torrom√© and Jonathan Gratus
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\mathcal{S}$ a spray defined on a convex cone $\mathcal{C}$ of the tangent bundle $TM$. It is proven that the only non-trivial $k$-jet approximation to the exact geodesic deviation equation of $\mathcal{S}$, linear on the deviation functions and invariant under arbitrary local coordinate transformations is the Jacobi equation. However, if linearity in the deviation functions is not required, there are differential equations whose solutions admit $k$-jet approximations and are invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations. As an example of higher order geodesic deviation equations we study the first and second order geodesic deviation equations for a Finsler spray. Some general implications for theories of gravity based on Finsler space-times are described. In particular, it is shown that Einstein's equivalence principle does not hold and that Schiff's conjecture is false for a generic Finslerian gravity geometry. We show that a necessary condition for the Einstein equivalence principle to hold good for a Finsler space-time is that it must be of Berwald type.
