Title: Pomeron in the N=4 supersymmetric gauge model at strong couplings
Authors: A. V. Kotikov and L. N. Lipatov
Abstract: We find the BFKL Pomeron intercept at N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory in the form of the inverse coupling expansion j0=2-2/lambda**(1/2)-1/lambda + 1/4 1/lambda**(3/2) + 2(1+3zeta3)/lambda**(2) + O(1/lambda**(5/2)) with the use of the AdS/CFT correspondence in terms of string energies calculated recently. The corresponding slope gamma'(2) of the anomalous dimension calculated directly up to the fifth order of perturbation theory turns out to be in an agreement with the closed expression obtained from the recent Basso results.
