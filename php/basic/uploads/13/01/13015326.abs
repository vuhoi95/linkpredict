Title: Nonlinear field theory with topological solitons: Skyrme models
Authors: C. Adam and C. Naya and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: In this talk, we give new insight into one of the best-known nonlinear field theories, the Skyrme model. We present some exact relevant solutions coming from different new versions (gauged BPS baby as well as vector BPS Skyrme models) giving rise to topological solitons, and highlighting the BPS character of the theory.
