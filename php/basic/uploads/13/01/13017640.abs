Abstract: We investigate the dependence of four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories on the topological theta term at finite temperature and, in particular, across the deconfinement transition. For this purpose, we exploit the lattice formulation of the theory and present numerical results for the expansion of the free energy up to O(theta^6), for N=3 and N=6. Our numerical analysis shows that the theta dependence of 4D SU(N) gauge theory experiences a drastic change across the deconfinement transition: the low-temperature phase is characterized by a large-N scaling with theta/N as relevant variable, while in the high-temperature phase the scaling variable is just theta and the free energy is essentially determined by the instanton-gas approximation. The crossover between the two different behaviours gets sharper with increasing N, suggesting that the instanton-gas regime sets in just above Tc at large N.
