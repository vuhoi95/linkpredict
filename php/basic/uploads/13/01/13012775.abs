Title: Anti-Evaporation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Black Holes in $F(R)$  gravity
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We studied the anti-evaporation of degenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole (so-called Nariai space-time) in modified $F(R)$ gravity. The analysis of perturbations of the Nariai black hole is done with the conclusion that anti-evaporation may occur in such a theory already on classical level. For several power-law $F(R)$ gravities which may describe the inflation and/or dark energy eras we presented the theory parameters bounds for occurrence of anti-evaporation and conjectured creation of infinite number of horizons.
