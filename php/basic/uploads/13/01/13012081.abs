Authors: Paul R. Anderson and Roberto Balbinot and Alessandro Fabbri and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: The density density correlation function is computed for the Bogoliubov pseudoparticles created in a Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing a black hole flow. On the basis of the gravitational analogy, the method used relies only on quantum field theory in curved spacetime techniques. A comparison with the results obtained by ab initio full condensed matter calculations is given, confirming the validity of the approximation used provided the profile of the flow varies smoothly on scales compared to the condensate healing length.
