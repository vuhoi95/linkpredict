Title: On the rest and flat limits of the scalar modes on the de Sitter  spacetime
Authors: Ion I. Cotaescu and Gabriel Pascu and Flavius Alin Dregoesc
Abstract: The scalar mode functions on the spatially flat FLRW chart of the de Sitter spacetime are redefined in order to obtain a natural frequencies separation in the special local charts where the momentum vanishes, called here (natural) rest frames. This can be done since in such frames the mode functions are eigenfunctions of the energy operator. Moreover, the most general criteria for choosing the suitable phase factors of the mode functions able to simultaneously determine the correct rest and flat limits are established. These results are compared to the different original choices from the literature. Pacs: 04.62.+v
