Title: Thermodynamics of Extended Gravity Black Holes
Authors: Guido Cognola and Lorenzo Sebastiani and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: Thermodynamics of extended gravity static spherically symmetric black hole solutions is investigated. The energy issue is discussed making use of the derivation of Clausius relation from equations of motion, evaluating the black hole entropy by the Wald method and computing the related Hawking temperature.
