Title: Galilean Islands in Eternally Inflating Background
Authors: Zhi-Guo Liu and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: We show that the observational universe may emerge classically from a de Sitter background with low energy scale. We find, after calculating the curvature perturbation, that the resulting scenario is actually a style of the eternal inflation scenario, in which some regions will go through the slowly expanding Galilean genesis phase with the rapidly increasing energy density and become island universes, while other regions are still eternally inflating, which will make the room for more island universes to emerge.
