Title: The fate of flat directions in higher derivative gravity
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta and Ivano Lodato
Abstract: We discuss the fate of flat directions in higher derivative gravity by studying two explicit examples, namely higher derivative gauged supergravity in five dimensions and higher derivative type IIB string theory in ten dimensions. In the first case, the supersymmetric spinning black hole solution in asymptotically AdS spacetime, found by Gutowski and Reall, is analyzed. In this case we find that the flat direction at the two derivative level is not lifted after addition of higher derivative terms, and as it turns out, this result holds even for non-supersymmetric deformations of the higher derivative action. For the rotating D3-brane solutions in type IIB theory, the dilaton parametrizes a flat direction at leading order, but its fate changes upon including order (\alpha^\prime)^3 supersymmetric higher derivative corrections to the type IIB action, i.e. its leading value gets fixed.
