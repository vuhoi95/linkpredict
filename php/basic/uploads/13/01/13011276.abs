Title: Orthogonality of Macdonald polynomials with unitary parameters
Authors: J. F. van Diejen and E. Emsiz
Abstract: For any admissible pair of irreducible reduced crystallographic root systems, we present discrete orthogonality relations for a finite-dimensional system of Macdonald polynomials with parameters on the unit circle subject to a truncation relation.
