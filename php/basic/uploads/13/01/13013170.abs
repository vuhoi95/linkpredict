Title: Conformal Anomalies in Hydrodynamics
Authors: Christopher Eling and Yaron Oz and Stefan Theisen and Shimon Yankielowicz
Abstract: We study the effect of conformal anomalies on the hydrodynamic description of conformal field theories in even spacetime dimensions. We consider equilibrium curved backgrounds characterized by a time-like Killing vector and construct a local low energy effective action that captures the conformal anomalies. Using as a special background the Rindler spacetime we derive a formula for the anomaly effect on the hydrodynamic pressure. We find that this anomalous effect is only due to the Euler central charge.
