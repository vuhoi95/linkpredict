Title: Classification of Standard Model Particles in $E_6$ Orbifold Grand  Unified Theories
Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura and Takashi Miura
Abstract: We classify the standard model fermions, which originate from bulk fields of the $\bf{27}$ or $\bar{\bf{27}}$ representation after orbifold breaking, in $E_6$ grand unified theories on 5 or 6-dimensional space-time, under the condition that $q$, $e^c$ and $u^c$ survive as zero modes.
