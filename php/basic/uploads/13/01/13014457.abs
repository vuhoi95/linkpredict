Title: Odd spin glueball masses and the odderon Regge trajectories from the  holographic hardwall model
Authors: Eduardo Folco Capossoli and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: We use the holographic hardwall model to calculate the masses of light glueball states with odd spin and P= C= -1 associated with odderons. Considering Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions we obtain expressions for the odderon Regge trajectories consistent with those calculated using other approaches.
