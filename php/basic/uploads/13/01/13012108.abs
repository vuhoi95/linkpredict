Title: Hard thermal loops in long wave-length and static external gravitational  fields
Authors: R. R. Francisco and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study, in the long wave-length and static limits, the structure of the n-point graviton functions at high temperature. Using the gauge and Weyl invariance of the theory, we derive a simple expression for the hard thermal amplitudes in these two limits.
