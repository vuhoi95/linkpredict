Title: Fully stable dS vacua from generalised fluxes
Authors: Johan Blåbäck and Ulf Danielsson and Giuseppe Dibitetto
Abstract: We investigate the possible existence of (meta-)stable de Sitter vacua within N=1 compactifications with generalised fluxes. With the aid of an algorithm inspired by the method of differential evolution, we were able to find three novel examples of completely tachyon-free de Sitter extrema in a non-isotropic type IIB model with non-geometric fluxes. We also analyse the surroundings of the aforementioned points in parameter space and chart the corresponding stability regions. These happen to occur at small values of the cosmological constant compared to the AdS scale.
