Title: The Maslov index in weak symplectic functional analysis
Authors: Bernhelm Booss-Bavnbek and Chaofeng Zhu
Abstract: We recall the Chernoff-Marsden definition of weak symplectic structure and give a rigorous treatment of the functional analysis and geometry of weak symplectic Banach spaces. We define the Maslov index of a continuous path of Fredholm pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in continuously varying Banach spaces. We derive basic properties of this Maslov index and emphasize the new features appearing.
