Title: AdS/QCD, Light-Front Holography, and Color Confinement
Authors: Stanley J. Brodsky and Guy F. de TÃ©ramond
Abstract: A remarkable holographic feature of dynamics in AdS space in five dimensions is that it is dual to Hamiltonian theory in physical space-time, quantized at fixed light-front time {\tau} = t+z/c. This light-front holographic principle provides a precise relation between the bound-state amplitudes in AdS space and the boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the internal structure of hadrons in physical space-time. The fifth dimension coordinate z is dual to the light front variable {\zeta} describing the invariant separation of the quark constituents. The resulting valence Fock-state wavefunction eigensolutions of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion, analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schr\"odinger equation. The soft-wall dilaton profile exp ({\kappa}^2 {\zeta}^2) provides a model for the light-front potential which is color-confining and reproduces well the linear Regge behavior of the light-quark hadron spectrum in both L, the orbital angular momentum, and n, the radial node number. The pion mass vanishes in the chiral limit and other features of chiral symmetry are satisfied. The resulting running QCD coupling displays an infrared fixed point. The elastic and transition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are also found to be well described in this framework. The light-front AdS/QCD holographic approach thus gives a frame-independent analytic first approximation of the color-confining dynamics, spectroscopy, and excitation spectra of relativistic light-quark bound states in QCD.
