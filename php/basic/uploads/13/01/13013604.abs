Title: Massive logarithmic graviton in the critical generalized massive gravity
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We study the generalized massive gravity in three dimensional flat spacetime. A massive logarithmic mode is propagating in the flat spacetime at the critical point where two masses degenerate. Furthermore, we discuss the logarithmic extension of the Galilean conformal algebra (GCA) which may arise from the exotic and standard rank-2 logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) on the boundary of AdS3 spacetime.
