Abstract: A non-critical holographic QCD model constructed in the six dimensional Anti-de-Sitter ($AdS_6$) supergravity background is employed to study a the baryon. It is shown that the size of the baryon is of order one with respect to the $\lambda$, however, it is smaller than the scale of the dual QCD. An effective four dimensional action for the nucleon is obtained in terms of the meson exchange potentials. All meson-nucleon couplings in the non-critical $AdS_6$ background are calculated. Results obtained using our model are compared with predictions of four modern phenomenological interaction models. Also, our numerical results are compared with the results of the Sakai-Sugimoto (SS) model which indicate that the non-critical holographic QCD model can be a good toy to calculate the meson-nucleon couplings.
