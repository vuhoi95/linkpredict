Title: On S-duality of the Superconformal Index on Lens Spaces and 2d TQFT
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Mathew Bullimore and Martin Fluder
Abstract: We consider the 4d superconformal index for ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theories on $S^1 \times L(r,1)$, where $L(r,1)$ is a Lens space. We focus on a one-parameter slice of the three-dimensional fugacity space and in that sector we show S-duality. We do so by rewriting the index in a way that resembles a correlation function of a 2d TFT, which however, we do not identify.
