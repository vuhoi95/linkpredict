Title: Asymptotic symmetries at null infinity and local conformal properties of  spin coefficients
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Pierre-Henry Lambert
Abstract: We show that the symmetry algebra of asymptotically flat four dimensional spacetimes at null infinity in the sense of Newman and Unti is isomorphic to the direct sum of the abelian algebra of infinitesimal conformal rescalings with bms4. We then work out the local conformal properties of the relevant Newman-Penrose coefficients, as well as the surface charges and their algebra.
