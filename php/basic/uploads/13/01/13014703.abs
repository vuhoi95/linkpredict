Title: Anisotropy in a Nonsingular Bounce
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Robert Brandenberger and Patrick Peter
Abstract: Following recent claims relative to the question of large anisotropy production in regular bouncing scenarios, we study the evolution of such anisotropies in a model where an Ekpyrotic phase of contraction is followed by domination of a Galileon-type Lagrangian which generates a non-singular bounce. We show that the anisotropies decrease during the phase of Ekpyrotic contraction (as expected) and that they can be constrained to remain small during the non-singular bounce phase (a non-trivial result). Specifically, we derive the e-folding number of the phase of Ekpyrotic contraction which leads to a present-day anisotropy in agreement with current observational bounds.
