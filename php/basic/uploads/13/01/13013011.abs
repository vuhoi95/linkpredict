Title: Dissipative fields in de Sitter and black hole spacetimes: Quantum  entanglement due to pair production and dissipation
Authors: Julian Adamek and Xavier Busch and Renaud Parentani
Abstract: For free fields, pair creation in expanding universes is associated with the building up of correlations that lead to nonseparable states, i.e., quantum mechanically entangled ones. For dissipative fields, i.e., fields coupled to an environment, there is a competition between the squeezing of the state and the coupling to the external bath. We compute the final coherence level for dissipative fields that propagate in a two-dimensional de Sitter space, and we characterize the domain in parameter space where the state remains nonseparable. We then apply our analysis to (analogue) Hawking radiation by exploiting the close relationship between Lorentz violating theories propagating in de Sitter and black hole metrics. We establish the robustness of the spectrum and find that the entanglement among Hawking pairs is generally much stronger than that among pairs of quanta with opposite momenta.
