Title: Supersymmetric Completion of Gauss-Bonnet Combination in Five Dimensions
Authors: Mehmet Ozkan and Yi Pang
Abstract: Based on superconformal tensor calculus in five dimensions, we construct the supersymmetric completion of Gauss-Bonnet combination. We study the vacuum solutions with AdS_2 x S^3 and AdS_3 x S^2 structures. We also analyze the spectrum around a maximally supersymmetric Minkowski_5.
