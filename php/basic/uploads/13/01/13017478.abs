Title: A noncommutative anomaly through Seiberg-Witten map and non-locally  regularized BV quantization
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Vahid Nikoofard
Abstract: Anomalies are one essential concept for the renormalization of noncommutative (NC) gauge theories. A NC space can be visualized as a deformation of the usual spacetime with the $\star$-product and can be constructed after the quantization of a given space with its symplectic structure. The Seiberg-Witten (SW) map connects NC fields, transformations parameters and gauge potential to their commutative analogs. In this work we used the SW map to calculate the NC version of the anomaly of the BV quantized chiral Schwinger model with nonlocal regularization.
