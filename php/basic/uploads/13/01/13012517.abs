Title: Global gauge anomalies in coset models of conformal field theory
Authors: Paul de Fromont and K. Gawȩdzki and Clément Tauber
Abstract: We study the occurrence of global gauge anomalies in the coset models of two-dimensional conformal field theory that are based on gauged WZW models. A complete classification of the non-anomalous theories for a wide family of gauged rigid adjoint or twisted-adjoint symmetries of WZW models is achieved with the help of Dynkin's classification of Lie subalgebras of simple Lie algebras.
