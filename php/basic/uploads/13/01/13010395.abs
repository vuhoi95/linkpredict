Title: Hawking-Page phase transition in BTZ black hole revisited
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Wontae Kim and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We consider the Hawking-Page phase transition between the BTZ black hole of $M \ge 0$ and the thermal soliton of $M=-1$. In this system, there exists a mass gap so that there does not seem to exist a continuous thermodynamic phase transition. We consistently construct the off-shell free energies of the black hole and the soliton by properly taking into account the conical space. And then, the continuous off-shell free energy to describe tunneling effect can be realized through non-equilibrium solitons.
