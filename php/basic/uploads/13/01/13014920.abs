Title: Massless scalar field in de Sitter spacetime: unitary quantum time  evolution
Authors: Jeronimo Cortez and Daniel Martin-de Blas and Guillermo A. Mena Marugan and Jose M. Velhinho
Abstract: We prove that, under the standard conformal scaling, a massless field in de Sitter spacetime admits an O(4)-invariant Fock quantization such that time evolution is unitarily implemented. This result disproves previous claims in the literature. We discuss the relationship between this quantization with unitary dynamics and the family of O(4)-invariant Hadamard states given by Allen and Folacci, as well as with the Bunch-Davies vacuum.
