Title: n-DBI Gravity in a nutshell
Authors: Flavio S. Coelho and Carlos Herdeiro and Shinji Hirano and Yuki Sato
Abstract: We present a new model of gravity which explicitly breaks Lorentz-invariance by the introduction of a unit time-like vector field, thereby giving rise to an extra (scalar) degree of freedom. We discuss its cosmology, exact solutions and the dynamics of the scalar mode. We show that it predicts inflation without an inflaton and admits the black hole solutions of General Relativity (GR). We argue that the scalar mode is well behaved and contains none of the pathologies previously found in similar models.
