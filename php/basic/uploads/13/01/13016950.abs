Title: Matter in Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Ian Kimpton and Antonio Padilla
Abstract: We consider the role of matter in the non-projectable version of Horava-Liftshitz gravity at both a classical and a quantum level. At the classical level, we construct general forms of matter Lagrangians consistent with the reduced symmetry group and demonstrate that they must be reduced to their relativistic form if they are to avoid sourcing the gravitational Stuckelberg field. At the quantum level we consider one loop corrections to the propagator for a relativistic scalar minimally coupled to gravity at tree level. We find large corrections to the light cone at low energies arising from the strength of the coupling of the scalar graviton to matter. We also find evidence that higher order time derivatives may be generated, which is worrying if this is to be taken seriously as a UV complete theory.
