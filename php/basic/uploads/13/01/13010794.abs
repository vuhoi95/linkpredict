Title: Superstring amplitudes and the associator
Authors: J. M. Drummond and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We investigate a pattern in the $\alpha'$ expansion of tree-level open superstring amplitudes which correlates the appearance of higher depth multiple zeta values with that of simple zeta values in a particular way. We rephrase this relationship in terms of the coaction on motivic multiple zeta values and show that the pattern takes a very simple form, which can be simply explained by relating the amplitudes to the Drinfel'd associator derived from the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. Given this correspondence we show that, at least in the simplest case of the four-point amplitude, the associator can be used to extract the form of the amplitude.
