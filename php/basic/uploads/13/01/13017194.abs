Title: Anisotropic branes
Authors: Souvik Banerjee and Samrat Bhowmick and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: We present a class of anisotropic brane configurations which shows BKL oscillations near their cosmological singularities. Near horizon limits of these solutions represent Kasner space embedded in AdS background. Dynamical probe branes in these geometries inherit anisotropies from the background. Amusingly, for a probe M5 brane, we find that there exists a parameter region where three of its world-volume directions expand while the rest contract.
