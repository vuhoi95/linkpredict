Title: Features of warped geometry in presence of Gauss-Bonnet coupling
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We study the role of the Gauss-Bonnet corrections and two loop higher genus contribution to the gravity action on the Kaluza-Klien modes and their interactions for different bulk fields which enable one to study various phenomenological implications of string loop corrected Gauss-Bonnet modified warped geometry model in one canvas. We have explicitly derived a phenomenological bound on the Gauss-Bonnet parameter so that the required Planck to TeV scale hierarchy can be achieved through the warp factor in the light of recently discovered Higgs like boson at 125 GeV. Moreover due to the presence of small perturbative Gauss-Bonnet as well as string loop corrections we have shown that the warping solution can be obtained for both de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter bulk which is quite distinct from Randall-Sundrum scenario. Finally we have evaluated various interactions among these bulk fields and determined the coupling parameters and the Kaluza- Klien mode masses which is crucial to understand the phenomenology of a string two loop corrected Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet warp geometry.
