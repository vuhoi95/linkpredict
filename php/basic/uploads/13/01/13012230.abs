Title: Off-Shell Scalar Supermultiplet in the Unfolded Dynamics Approach
Authors: N. G. Misuna and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We show how manifestly supersymmetric action for Wess-Zumino model can be constructed within the unfolded dynamics approach. The off-shell unfolded system for N = 1, D = 4 scalar supermultiplet is found. The action is presented in the form of integral of a closed 4-form over any (4, 0) surface in superspace as well as a superspace integral of an integral form or a chiral integral form. The proposed method is argued to provide a most general tool for the analysis of manifestly supersymmetric functionals.
