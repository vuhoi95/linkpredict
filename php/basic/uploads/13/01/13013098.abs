Abstract: The existing observational data on possible variations of fundamental physical constants (FPC) confirm more or less confidently only a variability of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in space and time. A model construction method is described, where variations of $\alpha$ and other FPCs (including the gravitational constant $G$) follow from the dynamics of extra space-time dimensions in the framework of curvature-nonlinear multidimensional theories of gravity. An advantage of this method is a unified approach to variations of different FPCs. A particular model explaining the observable variations of $\alpha$ in space and time has been constructed. It comprises a FRW cosmology with accelerated expansion, perturbed due to slightly inhomogeneous initial data.
