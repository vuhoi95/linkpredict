Title: Shape Dynamics and Gauge-Gravity Duality
Authors: Henrique Gomes and Tim Koslowski
Abstract: The dynamics of gravity can be described by two different systems. The first is the familiar spacetime picture of General Relativity, the other is the conformal picture of Shape Dynamics. We argue that the bulk equivalence of General Relativity and Shape Dynamics is a natural setting to discuss familiar bulk/boundary dualities. We discuss consequences of the Shape Dynamics description of gravity as well as the issue why the bulk equivalence is not explicitly seen in the General Relativity description of gravity.
