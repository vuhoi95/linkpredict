Title: Modulated decay in the multi-component Universe
Authors: Seishi Enomoto and Kazunori Kohri and Tomohiro Matsuda
Abstract: The early Universe after inflation may have oscillations, kinations (nonoscillatory evolution of a field), topological defects, relativistic and non-relativistic particles at the same time. The Universe whose energy density is a sum of those components can be called the multi-component Universe. The components, which may have distinguishable density scalings, may decay modulated. In this paper we study generation of the curvature perturbations caused by the modulated decay in the multi-component Universe.
