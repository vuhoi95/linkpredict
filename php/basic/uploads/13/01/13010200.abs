Title: Finite Zero Point Gravitational Energy in the context of Modified  Dispersion Relations
Authors: Remo Garattini and Gianluca Mandanici
Abstract: We compute the Zero Point Energy in a spherically symmetric background distorted at high energy as predicted by Gravity's Rainbow. In this context we setup a Sturm-Liouville problem with the cosmological constant considered as the associated eigenvalue. The eigenvalue equation is a reformulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We find that the ordinary divergences can here be handled by an appropriate choice of the rainbow's functions, in contrast to what happens in other conventional approaches.
