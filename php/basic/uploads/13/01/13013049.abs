Abstract: A generic feature of viable exponential $F(R)$-gravity is investigated. An additional modification to stabilize the effective dark energy oscillations during matter era is proposed and applied to two viable models. An analysis on the future evolution of the universe is performed. Furthermore, a unified model for early and late-time acceleration is proposed and studied.
