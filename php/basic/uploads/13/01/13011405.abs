Title: Mass Creation From Extra Dimensions
Authors: Dao Vong Duc and Nguyen Mong Giao
Abstract: In this work we consider a mechanism for mass creation based on the periodicity condition dictated from the compactification of extradimensions. It is also shown that the existence of Tachyon having negative square mass is closely related to time- like extradimensions.
