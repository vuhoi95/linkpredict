Abstract: We explore single and multi-loop conformal integrals, such as the ones appearing in dual conformal theories in flat space. Using Mellin amplitudes, a large class of higher loop integrals can be written as simple integro-differential operators on star integrals: one-loop $n$-gon integrals in $n$ dimensions. These are known to be given by volumes of hyperbolic simplices. We explicitly compute the five-dimensional pentagon integral in full generality using Schl\"afli's formula. Then, as a first step to understanding higher loops, we use spline technology to construct explicitly the $6d$ hexagon and $8d$ octagon integrals in two-dimensional kinematics. The fully massive hexagon and octagon integrals are then related to the double box and triple box integrals respectively. We comment on the classes of functions needed to express these integrals in general kinematics, involving elliptic functions and beyond.
