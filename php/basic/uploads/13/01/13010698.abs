Title: On the energy of particle collisions in the ergosphere of the rotating  black holes
Authors: A. A. Grib and Yu. V. Pavlov
Abstract: It is shown that the energy in the centre of mass frame of colliding particles in free fall at any point of the ergosphere of the rotating black hole can grow without limit for fixed energy values on infinity. The effect takes place for large negative values of the angular momentum of one of the particles.
