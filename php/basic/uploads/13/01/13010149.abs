Title: Higher loop mixed correlators in N=4 SYM
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Johannes M. Henn and Jakub Sikorowski
Abstract: We compute analytically the two-loop contribution to the correlation function of the Lagrangian with a four-sided light-like (or null) Wilson loop in N=4 super Yang-Mills. As a non-trivial test of our result, we reproduce the three-loop value of the cusp anomalous dimension upon integration over the insertion point of the Lagrangian. The method we used involved calculating a dual scattering amplitude. Moreover, we give a simple representation of the loop integrand of the latter in twistor variables.
