Title: Twistors, Harmonics and Holomorphic Chern-Simons
Authors: Burkhard U. W. Schwab and Cristian Vergu
Abstract: We show that the off-shell N=3 action of N=4 super Yang-Mills can be written as a holomorphic Chern-Simons action whose Dolbeault operator is constructed from a complex-real (CR) structure of harmonic space. We also show that the local space-time operators can be written as a Penrose transform on the coset SU(3)/(U(1) \times U(1)). We observe a strong similarity to ambitwistor space constructions.
