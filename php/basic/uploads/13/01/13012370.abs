Title: Nonlinear superhorizon curvature perturbation in generic single-field  inflation
Authors: Yu-ichi Takamizu and Tsutomu Kobayashi
Abstract: We develop a theory of nonlinear cosmological perturbations on superhorizon scales for generic single-field inflation. Our inflaton is described by the Lagrangian of the form $W(X,\phi)-G(X,\phi)\Box\phi$ with $X=-\partial^{\mu}\phi\partial_{\mu}\phi/2$, which is no longer equivalent to a perfect fluid. This model is more general than k-inflation, and is called G-inflation. A general nonlinear solution for the metric and the scalar field is obtained at second order in gradient expansion. We derive a simple master equation governing the large-scale evolution of the nonlinear curvature perturbation. It turns out that the nonlinear evolution equation is deduced as a straightforward extension of the corresponding linear equation for the curvature perturbation on uniform $\phi$ hypersurfaces.
