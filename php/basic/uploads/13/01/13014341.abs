Title: Covariant equations of motion for test bodies in gravitational theories  with general nonminimal coupling
Authors: Dirk Puetzfeld and Yuri N. Obukhov
Abstract: We present a covariant derivation of the equations of motion for test bodies for a wide class of gravitational theories with nonminimal coupling, encompassing a general interaction via the complete set of 9 parity-even curvature invariants. The equations of motion for spinning test bodies in such theories are explicitly derived by means of Synge's expansion technique. Our findings generalize previous results in the literature and allow for a direct comparison to the general relativistic equations of motion of pole-dipole test bodies.
