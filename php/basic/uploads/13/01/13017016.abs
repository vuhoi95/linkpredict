Title: Vacuum condensates, flavor mixing and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Antonio Capolupo and Marco Di Mauro
Abstract: Spontaneous supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking is revealed in all phenomena in which vacuum condensates are physically relevant. The dynamical breakdown of SUSY is generated by the condensates themselves, which lift the zero point energy. Evidence is presented in the case of the Wess-Zuimino model, and the flavor mixing case is treated in detail.
