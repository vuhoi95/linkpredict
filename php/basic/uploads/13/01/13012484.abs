Title: Three-body Casimir-Polder interactions
Authors: Kimball A. Milton and Elom Abalo and Prachi Parashar and K. V. Shajesh
Abstract: As part of our program to develop the description of three-body effects in quantum vacuum phenomena, we study the three-body interaction of two anisotropically polarizable atoms with a perfect electrically conducting plate, a generalization of earlier work. Three- and four-scattering effects are important, and lead to nonmonotonic behavior.
