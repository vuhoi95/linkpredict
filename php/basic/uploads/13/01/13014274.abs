Title: Loop effects and infrared divergences in slow-roll inflation
Authors: Klaus Larjo and David A. Lowe
Abstract: Loop corrections to observables in slow-roll inflation are found to diverge no worse than powers of the log of the scale factor, extending Weinberg's theorem to quasi-single field inflation models. Demanding perturbation theory be valid during primordial inflation leads to constraints on the effective lagrangian. This leads to some interesting constraints and coincidences on the landscape of inflationary vacua.
