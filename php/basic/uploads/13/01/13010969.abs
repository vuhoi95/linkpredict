Title: A massive graviton in topologically new massive gravity
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We investigate the topologically new massive gravity in three dimensions. It turns out that a single massive mode is propagating in the flat spacetime, comparing to the conformal Chern-Simons gravity which has no physically propagating degrees of freedom. Also we discuss the realization of the BMS/GCA correspondence.
