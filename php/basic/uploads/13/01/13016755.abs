Abstract: We consider non-Abelian T-duality on N=1 supergravity backgrounds possessing well understood field theory duals. For the case of D3-branes at the tip of the conifold, we dualise along an SU(2) isometry. The result is a type-IIA geometry whose lift to M-theory is of the type recently proposed by Bah et. al. as the dual to certain N=1 SCFT quivers produced by M5-branes wrapping a Riemann surface. In the non-conformal cases we find smooth duals in massive IIA supergravity with a Romans mass naturally quantised. We initiate the interpretation of these geometries in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that the central charge and the entanglement entropy are left invariant by this dualisation. The backgrounds suggest a form of Seiberg duality in the dual field theories which also exhibit domain walls and confinement in the infrared.
