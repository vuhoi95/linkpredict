Authors: F. S. Coelho and C. Herdeiro and C. Rebelo and M. O. P. Sampaio
Abstract: We consider the radiation emitted in a collision of shock waves, in D-dimensional General Relativity (GR), and describe a remarkably simple pattern, hinting at a more fundamental structure, unveiled by the introduction of the parameter D.
