Title: Spectral function of the Bloch-Nordsieck model at finite temperature
Authors: A. Jakovac and P. Mati
Abstract: In this paper we determine the exact fermionic spectral function of the Bloch-Nordsieck model at finite temperature. Analytic results are presented for some special parameters, for other values we have numerical results. The spectral function is finite and normalizable for any nonzero temperature values. The real time dependence of the retarded Green's function is power-like for small times and exhibits exponential damping for large times. Treating the temperature as an infrared regulator, we can also give a safe interpretation of the zero temperature result.
