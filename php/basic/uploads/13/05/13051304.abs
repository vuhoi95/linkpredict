Title: Duality-symmetric actions for non-Abelian tensor fields
Authors: Igor Bandos and Henning Samtleben and Dmitri Sorokin
Abstract: We construct the duality-symmetric actions for a large class of six-dimensional models describing hierarchies of non-Abelian scalar, vector and tensor fields related to each other by first-order (self-)duality equations that follow from these actions. In particular, this construction provides a Lorentz invariant action for non-Abelian self-dual tensor fields. The class of models includes the bosonic sectors of the 6d (1,0) superconformal models of interacting non-Abelian self-dual tensor, vector, and hypermultiplets.
