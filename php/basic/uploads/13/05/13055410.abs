Title: Gauge theory on a space with linear Lie type fuzziness
Authors: M. Khorrami and A. H. Fatollahi and A. Shariati
Abstract: The U(1) gauge theory on a space with Lie type noncommutativity is constructed. The construction is based on the group of translation in Fourier space, which in contrast to space itself is commutative. In analogy with lattice gauge theory, the object playing the role of flux of field strength per plaquette, as well as the action, are constructed. It is observed that the theory, in comparison with ordinary U(1) gauge theory, has an extra gauge field component. This phenomena is reminiscent of similar ones in formulation of SU(N) gauge theory in space with canonical noncommutativity, and also appearance of gauge field component in discrete direction of Connes' construction of the Standard Model.
