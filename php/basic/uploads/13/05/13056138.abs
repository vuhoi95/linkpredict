Authors: Alexander Y. Kamenshchik and Alessandro Tronconi and Giovanni Venturi
Abstract: A general equation, describing the lowest order corrections coming from quantum gravitational effects to the spectrum of cosmological scalar fluctuations is obtained. These corrections are explicitly estimated for the case of a de Sitter evolution.
