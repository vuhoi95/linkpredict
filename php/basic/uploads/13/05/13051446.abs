Title: Thermal Mass and Plasmino for Strongly Interacting Fermions
Authors: Yunseok Seo and Sang-Jin Sin and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We investigate fermion self energy problem in the strongly coupled dense medium in holographic approach. By working out bottom up models as well as top down ones we showed that vanishing thermal mass and non-existence of temperature generated plasmino mode is the universal feature of the strongly interacting fermion system. We identified that the dual of the bulk Rashiba effect, which was recently found by the Herzog et.al, is the presence of the plasmino mode generated by the density.
