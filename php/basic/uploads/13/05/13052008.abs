Title: Stochastic quantization of conformally coupled scalar in AdS
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar and Jae-Hyuk Oh
Abstract: We explore the relation between stochastic quantization and holographic Wilsonian renormalization group flow further by studying conformally coupled scalar in $AdS_{d+1}$. We establish one to one mapping between the radial flow of its double trace deformation and stochastic 2-point correlation function. This map is shown to be identical, up to a suitable field re-definition of the bulk scalar, to the original proposal in arXiv:1209.2242.
