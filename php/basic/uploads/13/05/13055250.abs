Title: N=1 dynamics with T_N theory
Authors: Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Yuji Tachikawa and Wenbin Yan and Kazuya Yonekura
Abstract: We study the dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric systems consisting of the strongly-coupled superconformal theory T_N, SU(N) gauge groups, and fundamental chiral multiplets. We demonstrate that such systems exhibit familiar phenomena such as deformation of the vacuum moduli space, appearance of the dynamical superpotential, and Coulomb branches with N=1 Seiberg-Witten curves. The analysis requires a rather detailed knowledge of the chiral ring of the T_N theory, which will also be discussed at length.
