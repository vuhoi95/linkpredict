Title: Higher order Schrodinger and Hartree-Fock equations
Authors: Remi Carles and Wolfgang Lucha and Emmanuel Moulay
Abstract: The domain of validity of the higher-order Schrodinger equations is analyzed for harmonic-oscillator and Coulomb potentials as typical examples. Then the Cauchy theory for higher-order Hartree-Fock equations with bounded and Coulomb potentials is developed. Finally, the existence of associated ground states for the odd-order equations is proved. This renders these quantum equations relevant for physics.
