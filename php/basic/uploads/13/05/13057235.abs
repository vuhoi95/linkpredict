Title: Chern Simons duality with a fundamental boson and fermion
Authors: Sachin Jain and Shiraz Minwalla and Shuichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We compute the thermal free energy for all renormalizable Chern Simon theories coupled to a single fundamental bosonic and fermionic field in the 't Hooft large N limit. We use our results to conjecture a strong weak coupling duality invariance for this class of theories. Our conjectured duality reduces to Giveon Kutasov duality when restricted to {\cal N}=2 supersymmetric theories and to an earlier conjectured bosonization duality in an appropriate decoupling limit. Consequently the bosonization duality may be regarded as a deformation of Giveon Kutasov duality, suggesting that it is true even at large but finite N.
