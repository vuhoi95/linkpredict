Title: Higher Spin Resolution of a Toy Big Bang
Authors: Chethan Krishnan and Shubho Roy
Abstract: Diffeomorphisms preserve spacetime singularities, whereas higher spin symmetries need not. Since three dimensional de Sitter space has quotients that have big-bang/big-crunch singularities and since dS_3-gravity can be written as an SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory, we investigate SL(3,C) Chern-Simons theory as a higher-spin context in which these singularities might get resolved. As in the case of higher spin black holes in AdS_3, the solutions are invariantly characterized by their holonomies. We show that the dS_3 quotient singularity can be de-singularized by an SL(3,C) gauge transformation that preserves the holonomy: this is a higher spin resolution the cosmological singularity. Our work deals exclusively with the bulk theory, and is independent of the subtleties involved in defining a CFT_2 dual to dS_3 in the sense of dS/CFT.
