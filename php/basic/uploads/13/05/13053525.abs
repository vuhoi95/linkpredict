Abstract: We obtain a Schwarzschild and a Reissner-Nordstrom emergent black holes, by exploring the torsion dynamics in a generalized curvature formulation, underlying an effective D4-brane on S1. It is shown that a constant effective metric, sourced by a background fluctuation in B2-potential, on a D3-brane receives a dynamical quantum correction in presence of an electric charge.
