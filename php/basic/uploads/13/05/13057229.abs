Title: G-structures and Flavouring non-Abelian T-duality
Authors: Alejandro Barranco and Jerome Gaillard and Niall Macpherson and Carlos Nunez and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We examine non-Abelian T-duality on backgrounds preserving N=1 supersymmetry. We show how backgrounds with SU(3)-structure are mapped to backgrounds with SU(2)-structure. We provide the transformation rules for the corresponding pure spinors. We use these techniques to construct new flavoured solutions of type IIA supergravity.
