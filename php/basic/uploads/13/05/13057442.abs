Title: BCFW Deformation and Regge Limit
Authors: Chih-Hao Fu and Jen-Chi Lee and Chung-I Tan and Yi Yang
Abstract: BCFW deformation has served as an extremely useful tool in providing a recursive approach in studying color-ordered gauge amplitudes. This procedure has also been generalized to the study of graviton scattering. An important ingredient of this approach is the ability to identify amplitudes satisfying convergent dispersion relation when the BCFW parameter, z, is treated as a complex variable. In a modified BCFW treatment, we show in what sense the BCFW deformation in the large-z limit can be understood as the Regge limit. We also discuss how the issue of convergent dispersion integral for amplitudes involving external spins relates to the study of super-convergence relation which served as the precursor to the s-t duality relation for flat space string amplitudes.
