Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a self--gravitating magnetized electron gas at finite temperature near the collapsing singularity of a Bianchi-I spacetime. Considering a general and appropriate and physically motivated initial conditions, we transform Einstein--Maxwell field equations into a complete and self--consistent dynamical system amenable for numerical work. The resulting numerical solutions reveal the gas collapsing into both, isotropic ("point-like") and anisotropic ("cigar-like") singularities, depending on the initial intensity of the magnetic field. We provide a thorough study of the near collapse behavior and interplay of all relevant state and kinematic variables: temperature, expansion scalar, shear scalar, magnetic field, magnetization and energy density. A significant qualitative difference in the behavior of the gas emerges in the temperature range $\hbox{T} sim10^{4}\hbox{K}$ and $\hbox{T}\sim 10^{7}\hbox{K}$.
