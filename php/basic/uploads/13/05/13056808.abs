Title: Instanton String and M-Wave in Multiple M5-Branes System
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Hiroshi Isono
Abstract: We consider the non-abelian self-dual two-form theory arXiv:1203.4224 and find new exact solutions. Our solutions are supported by Yang-Mills (anti)instantons in 4-dimensions and describe wave moving in null directions. We argue and provide evidence that these instanton string solutions correspond to M-wave (MW) on the worldvolume of multiple M5-branes. When dimensionally reduced on a circle, the MW/M5 system is reduced to the D0/D4 system with the D0-branes represented by the Yang-Mills instanton of the D4-branes Yang-Mills gauge theory. We show that this picture is precisely reproduced by the dimensional reduction of our instanton string solutions.
