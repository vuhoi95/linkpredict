Title: On the Integrability of Four Dimensional N=2 Gauge Theories in the Omega  Background
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Po-Shen Hsin and Peter Koroteev
Abstract: We continue to investigate the relationship between the infrared physics of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions and various integrable models such as Gaudin, Calogero-Moser and quantum spin chains. We prove interesting dualities among some of these integrable systems by performing different, albeit equivalent, quantizations of the Seiberg-Witten curve of the four dimensional theory. We also discuss conformal field theories related to N=2 4d gauge theories by the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa (AGT) duality and the role of conformal blocks of those CFTs in the integrable systems. As a consequence, the equivalence of conformal blocks of rank two Toda and Novikov-Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZNW) theories on the torus with punctures is found.
