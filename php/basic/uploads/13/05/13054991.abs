Title: Quantum corrections to $AdS_5 \times S^5$ left-invariant superstring  current algebra
Authors: DÃ¡fni F. Z. Marchioro and Daniel Luiz Nedel
Abstract: In this work the pure spinor formulation of the superstring is used to study quantum corrections to the left current OPE algebra of the coset $PSU(2, 2|4)/SO(4, 1) \times SO(5)$ sigma model, which describes the superstring dynamics in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background. In particular, the one loop corrections to the simple poles of the bosonic currents are computed. Unlike the case of the double poles, we show that the simple poles suffer corrections, which are important since the simple poles contribute to the four point amplitudes. We show that the only contribution to the simple poles comes from the pure spinor Lorentz currents.
