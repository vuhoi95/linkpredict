Title: Three-body gravitino decays in the MSSM
Authors: Helmut Eberl and Vassilis C. Spanos
Abstract: We present results from a new calculation of two- and three-body decays of the gravitino including all possible Feynman graphs. The work is done in the R-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, assuming that the gravitino is unstable. We calculate the full width for the three-body decay process Gravitino -> \chi_1 X Y, where \chi_1 is the lightest neutralino that plays the role of the lightest supersymmetric particle, and X, Y are standard model particles. For calculating the squared amplitudes we use the packages FeynArts and FormCalc, with appropriate extensions to accommodate the gravitino with spin 3/2. Our code treats automatically the intermediate exchanged particles that are on their mass shell, using the narrow width approximation. This method considerably simplifies the complexity of the evaluation of the total gravitino width and stabilizes it numerically. At various points of the supersymmetric parameter space, we compare the full two-body and the three-body results with approximations used in the past. In addition, we discuss the relative sizes of the full two-body and the three-body gravitino decay widths. Our results are obtained using the package GravitinoPack, that will be publicly available soon, including various handy features.
