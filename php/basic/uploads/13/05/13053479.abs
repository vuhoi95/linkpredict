Title: From bricks to quasinormal modes: A new perspective on black hole  entropy
Authors: Michele Arzano and Stefano Bianco and Olaf Dreyer
Abstract: Calculations of black hole entropy based on the counting of modes of a quantum field propagating in a Schwarzschild background need to be regularized in the vicinity of the horizon. To obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking result the short distance cut-off needs to be fixed by hand. In this note we give an argument for obtaining this cut-off in a natural fashion. We do this by modelling the black hole by its set of quasinormal modes. The horizon then becomes a extended region: the quantum ergosphere. The interaction of the quantum ergosphere and the quantum field provides a natural regularization mechanism. The width of the quantum ergosphere provides the right cut-off for the entropy calculation. We arrive at a dual picture of black hole entropy. The entropy of the black hole is given both by the entropy of the quantum field in the bulk and the dynamical degrees of freedom on the horizon.
