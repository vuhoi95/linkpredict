Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of integrable systems are special: there is substantial evidence that after a quantum quench they do not thermalize but their asymptotic steady state can be described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE). Most of the studies on the GGE so far have focused on models that can be mapped to quadratic systems while analytic treatment in non-quadratic systems remained elusive. We obtain results on interaction quenches in a non-quadratic continuum system, the 1D Bose gas described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model. We compute local correlators for a non-interacting initial state and arbitrary final interactions as well as two-point functions for quenches to the Tonks-Girardeau regime. We show that in the long time limit integrability leads to significant deviations from the predictions of the grand canonical ensemble.
