Title: Non Abelian Fields in Very Special Relativity
Authors: Jorge Alfaro and Victor O. Rivelles
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fields in the context of very special relativity (VSR). For this we define the covariant derivative and the gauge field gauge transformations, both of them involving a fixed null vector $n_{\mu}$, related to the VSR breaking of the Lorentz group to the Hom(2) or Sim(2) subgroups. As in the Abelian case the gauge field becomes massive. Moreover we show that the VSR gauge transformations form a closed algebra. We then write actions coupling the gauge field to various matter fields (bosonic and fermionic). We mention how we can use the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism to give a flavor dependent VSR mass to the gauge bosons. Finally, we quantize the model using the BRST formalism to fix the gauge. The model is renormalizable and unitary and for non abelian groups, asymptotically free.
