Abstract: We study entanglement entropy for an excited state by making use of the proposed holographic description of the entanglement entropy. For a sufficiently small entangling region and with reasonable identifications we find an equation between entanglement entropy and energy which is reminiscent of the first law of thermodynamics. We then suggest four statements which might be thought of as four laws of entanglement thermodynamics.
