Title: Quantum Reflection as a New Signature of Quantum Vacuum Nonlinearity
Authors: Holger Gies and Felix Karbstein and Nico Seegert
Abstract: We show that photons subject to a spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic field can experience quantum reflection. Based on this observation, we propose quantum reflection as a novel means to probe the nonlinearity of the quantum vacuum in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields.
