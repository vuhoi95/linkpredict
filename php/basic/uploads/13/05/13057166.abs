Title: Three- and Four-point correlators of excited bosonic twist fields
Authors: Pascal Anastasopoulos and Mark D. Goodsell and Robert Richter
Abstract: We compute three- and four-point correlation functions containing excited bosonic twist fields. Our results can be used to determine properties, such as lifetimes and production rates, of massive string excitations localised at D-brane intersections, which could be signatures of a low string scale even if the usual string resonances are inaccessible to the LHC.
