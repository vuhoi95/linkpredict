Title: D-brane Superpotentials and Ooguri-Vafa Invariants of Compact Calabi-Yau  Threefolds
Authors: Feng-Jun Xu and Fu-Zhong Yang
Abstract: We calculate the D-brane superpotentials for two non-Fermat type compact Calabi-Yau manifolds which are the hypersurfaces of the weighed projective spaces in type II string theory. By constructing the open-closed mirror maps, we also compute the Ooguri-Vafa invariants, which are related to the open Gromov-Witten invariants.
