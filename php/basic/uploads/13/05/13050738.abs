Title: Quantization of Black Holes entropy and its cosmological consequences
Authors: Gerardo Cristofano and Giuseppe Maiella and Cosimo Stornaiolo
Abstract: Starting from a quantization relation for primordial extremal black holes with electric and magnetic charges, it is shown that their entropy is quantized. Furthermore the energy levels spacing for such black holes is derived as a function of the level number $n$, appearing in the quantization relation. Some interesting cosmological consequences are presented for small values of $n$. By producing a mismatch between the mass and the charge the black hole temperature is derived and its behavior investigated. Finally extending the quantum relation to Schwarzschild black holes their temperature is found to be in agreement with the Hawking temperature and a simple interpretation of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the black holes is given.
