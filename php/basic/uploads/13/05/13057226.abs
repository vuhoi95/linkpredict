Title: Gauge Field Preheating at the End of Inflation
Authors: J. Tate Deskins and John T. Giblin Jr and Robert R. Caldwell
Abstract: Here we consider the possibility of preheating the Universe via the parametric amplification of a massless, U(1) abelian gauge field. We assume that the gauge field is coupled to the inflaton via a conformal factor with one free parameter. We present the results of high-resolution three-dimensional simulations of this model and show this mechanism efficiently preheats the Universe to a radiation-dominated final state.
