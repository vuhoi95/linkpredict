Title: Is Quantum Gravity a Super-Quantum Theory?
Authors: Lay Nam Chang and Zachary Lewis and Djordje Minic and Tatsu Takeuchi
Abstract: We argue that quantum gravity should be a super-quantum theory, that is, a theory whose non-local correlations are stronger than those of canonical quantum theory. As a super-quantum theory, quantum gravity should display distinct experimentally observable super-correlations of entangled stringy states.
