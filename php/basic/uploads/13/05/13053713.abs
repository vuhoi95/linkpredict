Title: Non-equilibrium Phase Transition from AdS/CFT
Authors: Mohammad Ali-Akbari and Ali Vahedi
Abstract: Using AdS/CFT correspondence we study non-equilibrium phase transition in the presence of a constant external magnetic field. The transition occurs when the sign of differential conductivity reverses. Utilizing numerical method we show that the type of transition depends on the value of magnetic field as well as the temperature of gauge theory. Moreover we show that this transition does not depend on the supersymmetry and the subspace on which the fundamental matter fields live.
