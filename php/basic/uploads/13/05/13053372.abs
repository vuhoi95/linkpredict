Title: Cosmological Zitterbewegung
Authors: Parth Girdhar and Archil Kobakhidze
Abstract: We describe a new phenomenon of zitterbewegung of a free Dirac particle in cosmological spacetimes. Unlike the similar effect theorized by Schrodinger in 1930, the cosmological zitterbewegung is a real, physically attainable effect, which originates from the mixing of positive and negative frequency modes of a field operator in cosmological spacetimes. We briefly discuss the potential for observing this effect in laboratory experiments with trapped ions.
