Title: CDT and the Search for a Theory of Quantum Gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and A. Goerlich and J. Jurkiewicz and R. Loll
Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations provide a non-perturbative regularization of a theory of quantum gravity. We describe how this approach connects with the asymptotic safety program and Ho\vrava-Lifshitz gravity theory, and present the most recent results from computer simulations.
