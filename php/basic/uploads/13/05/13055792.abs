Abstract: The entanglement criterion for continuous variable systems and the conditions under which the uncertainty relations are fulfilled are generalized to the case of a noncommutative (NC) phase-space. The quantum nature and the separability of NC two-mode Gaussian states are examined. It is shown that the entanglement of Gaussian states may be exclusively induced by switching on the noncommutative deformation.
