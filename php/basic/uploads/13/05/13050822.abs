Title: On the Origin of Gravitational Lorentz Covariance
Authors: Justin Khoury and Godfrey E. J. Miller and Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: We provide evidence that general relativity is the unique spatially covariant effective field theory of the transverse, traceless graviton degrees of freedom. The Lorentz covariance of general relativity, having not been assumed in our analysis, is thus plausibly interpreted as an accidental or emergent symmetry of the gravitational sector.
