Title: Aspects of String Cosmology
Authors: Costas Kounnas and Nicolaos Toumbas
Abstract: We review recent progress in string cosmology, where string dualities are applied so as to obtain complete cosmological evolutions, free of any essential singularities. Two classes of models are analyzed. The first class consists of string gas cosmologies associated to certain thermal configurations of type II N=(4,0) models. Finite temperature is introduced along with non-trivial "gravito-magnetic" fluxes that lift the Hagedorn instabilities of the canonical ensemble and restore thermal T-duality symmetry. At a critical maximal temperature additional thermal states become massless sourcing stringy S-branes, which facilitate a bounce between the two dual, asymptotically cold phases. Unlike previous incarnations of pre-Big Bang cosmologies, the models remain perturbative throughout the cosmological evolution. The second class consists of exact solutions to classical string theory that admit a Euclidean description in terms of compact parafermionic worldsheet systems. The Euclidean target space corresponds to a non-singular, compact T-fold, which can be used to construct a normalizable Hartle-Hawking wavefunction for the cosmology.
