Abstract: We show that the recently found AdS-plane and AdS-spherical wave solutions of quadratic curvature gravity also solve the most general higher derivative theory in D-dimensions. More generally, we show that the field equations of such theories reduce to an equation linear in the Ricci tensor for Kerr-Schild spacetimes having type-N Weyl and traceless Ricci tensors.
