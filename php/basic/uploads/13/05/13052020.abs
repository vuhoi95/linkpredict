Title: Precursor of Inflation
Authors: Inyong Cho and Hyeong-Chan Kim and Taeyoon Moon
Abstract: We investigate a nonsingular initial state of the Universe which leads to inflation naturally. The model is described by a scalar field with a quadratic potential in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. The curvature of this initial state is given by the mass scale of the scalar field which is much smaller than the Planck scale. Therefore, in this model, quantum gravity is not necessary in understanding this pre-inflationary stage, no matter how large the energy density becomes. The initial state in this model evolves eventually to a long inflationary period which is similar to the usual chaotic inflation.
