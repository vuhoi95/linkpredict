Title: Gravitational Particle Production in Gravity Theories with Non-minimal  Derivative Couplings
Authors: George Koutsoumbas and Konstantinos Ntrekis and Eleftherios Papantonopoulos
Abstract: We study the gravitational production of heavy X-particles of mass of the order of the inflaton mass, produced after the end of inflation. We find that, in the presence of a derivative coupling of the inflaton field or of the X-field to the Einstein tensor, the number of gravitationally produced particles is suppressed as the strength of the coupling is increased.
