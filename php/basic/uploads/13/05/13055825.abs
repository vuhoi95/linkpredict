Title: Considerations on Gravity as an Entropic Force and Entangled States
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Jorge Ananias Neto
Abstract: Verlinde's ideas considered gravity as an emergent force originated from entropic concepts. This hypothesis generated a huge number of papers through the last recent years concerning classical and quantum approaches about the issue. In a recent paper Kobakhidze, using ultra-cold neutrons experiment, claimed that Verlinde's entropic gravity is not correct. In this letter, by considering the nonadditivity property of the holographic screen, where we assumed that the bits are entangled states, we showed that it is possible to confirm Verlinde's formalism.
