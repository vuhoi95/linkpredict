Title: Quasinormal ringing of Kerr black holes. II. Excitation by particles  falling radially with arbitrary energy
Authors: Zhongyang Zhang and Emanuele Berti and Vitor Cardoso
Abstract: The analytical understanding of quasinormal mode ringing requires an accurate knowledge of the Green's function describing the response of the black hole to external perturbations. We carry out a comprehensive study of quasinormal mode excitation for Kerr black holes. Relying on the formalism developed by Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi, we improve and extend previous calculations of the quasinormal mode residues in the complex frequency plane ("excitation factors" B_q). Using these results we compute the "excitation coefficients" C_q (essentially the mode amplitudes) in the special case where the source of the perturbations is a particle falling into the black hole along the symmetry axis. We compare this calculation with numerical integrations of the perturbation equations, and we show quantitatively how the addition of higher overtones improves the agreement with the numerical waveforms. Our results should find applications in models of the ringdown stage and in the construction of semianalytical template banks for gravitational-wave detectors, especially for binaries with large mass ratios and/or fast-spinning black holes.
