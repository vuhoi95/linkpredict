Abstract: We place observational constraints on slow-variation single-field inflationary models by carrying out the cosmological Monte Carlo simulation with the recent data of Planck combined with the WMAP large-angle polarization, baryon acoustic oscillations, and ACT/SPT temperature data. Our analysis covers a wide variety of models with second-order equations of motion-- including potential-driven slow-roll inflation, non-minimally coupled models, running kinetic couplings, Brans-Dicke theories, potential-driven Galileon inflation, field-derivative couplings to the Einstein tensor, and k-inflation. In the presence of running kinetic exponential couplings, covariant Galileon terms, and field-derivative couplings, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the self-coupling potential gets smaller relative to that in standard slow-roll inflation, but the models lie outside the 68 % CL observational contour. We also show that k-inflation models can be tightly constrained by adding the bounds from the scalar non-Gaussianities. The small-field inflationary models with asymptotic flat Einstein-frame potentials in the regime phi >> M_{pl} generally fit the data very well. These include the models such as Kahler-moduli inflation, non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation, and inflation in Brans-Dicke theories in the presence of the potential V(phi)=3M^2 (phi-M_{pl})^2/4 with the Brans-Dicke parameter omega_{BD}<O(1) (which covers the Starobinsky's model f(R)=R+R^2/(6M^2) as a special case).
