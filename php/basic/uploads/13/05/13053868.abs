Title: Aspects of semilocal BPS vortex in systems with Lorentz symmetry  breaking
Authors: C. H. Coronado Villalobos and J. M. Hoff da Silva and M. B. Hott and H. Belich
Abstract: It is shown the existence of a static self-dual semilocal vortex configuration for the Maxwell-Higgs system with a Lorentz-violating CPT-even term. The dependence of the vorticity upper limit on the Lorentz-break term is also investigated.
