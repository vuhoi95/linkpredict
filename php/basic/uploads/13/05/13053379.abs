Title: Maxwell's equal area law for charged Anti-deSitter black holes
Authors: Euro Spallucci and Anais Smailagic
Abstract: In this paper we present the construction of the Maxwell equal area law in the Hawking temperature graph for a charged black hole in Anti-deSitter background. We are able to find exact solution for the corresponding isotherm and entropies for "gaseous" (large) black holes and "liquid" (near-extremal) black holes. Isothermal construction removes the unphysical, negative heat capacity, regions. Furthermore, extremal black holes turn out to be dual to "un-shrinkable" molecules of Van der Waals real fluid, which may explain their thermodynamical stability.
