Title: Equivalence of 3D Spinning String and Superstring
Authors: Luca Mezincescu and Alasdair J. Routh and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We perform a light-cone gauge quantization of the Ramond closed spinning string in three spacetime dimensions (3D). The spectrum is Lorentz invariant and identical to that of the 3D Green-Schwarz closed superstring with ${\cal N}=2$ space-time supersymmetry, quantized in light-cone gauge.
