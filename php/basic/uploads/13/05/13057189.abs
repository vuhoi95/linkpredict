Title: Splints of root systems on Lie Superalgebras
Authors: B. Ransingh and K. C. Pati
Abstract: This paper classifies the splints of the root system of classical Lie superalgebras as a superalgebraic conversion of the splints of classical root systems. It can be used to derive branching rules, which have potential physical application in theoretical physics.
