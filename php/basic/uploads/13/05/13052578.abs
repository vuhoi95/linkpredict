Title: Intermediate effective interactions and dynamical fermion mass  generation of QCD
Authors: Ming-Fan Li and Mingxing Luo
Abstract: The functional renormalization group equation is expanded to a two-loop form. This two-loop form equation involves one-loop effective action. An intermediate effective action perspective is adopted toward the one-loop effective action. That is to say, the intermediate effective action could not be of the same form of the bare action and one can make an ansatz to it. Thus by focusing on different high dimensional operators, effects of the chosen operators can be investigated. QCD through intermediate fermion-4 interactions is investigated. Of the 6 kinds of fermion-4 interactions generated by one-loop QCD, 4 kinds generate fermion mass while the other 2 kinds degenerate it. The net effect is fermion mass degeneration when dimensionless mass is large. Flow patterns on the $\tilde{m}^2_{\text{phys.}}-\tilde{g}^2$ plane are drawn.
