Title: Reading between the lines of four-dimensional gauge theories
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Nathan Seiberg and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: Starting with a choice of a gauge group in four dimensions, there is often freedom in the choice of magnetic and dyonic line operators. Different consistent choices of these operators correspond to distinct physical theories, with the same correlation functions of local operators in R^4. In some cases these choices are permuted by shifting the theta-angle by 2pi. In other cases they are labeled by new discrete theta-like parameters. Using this understanding we gain new insight into the dynamics of four-dimensional gauge theories and their phases. The existence of these distinct theories clarifies a number of issues in electric/magnetic dualities of supersymmetric gauge theories, both for the conformal N=4 theories and for the low-energy dualities of N=1 theories.
