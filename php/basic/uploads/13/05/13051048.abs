Title: N=1 extension of minimal model holography
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Constantin Candu and Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Michael Groher
Abstract: The CFT dual of the higher spin theory with minimal N = 1 spectrum is determined. Unlike previous examples of minimal model holography, there is no free parameter beyond the central charge, and the CFT can be described in terms of a non-diagonal modular invariant of the bosonic theory at the special value of the 't Hooft parameter lambda=1/2. As evidence in favour of the duality we show that the symmetry algebras as well as the partition functions agree between the two descriptions.
