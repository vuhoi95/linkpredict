Authors: Ren Zhao and Hui-Hua Zhao and Meng-Sen Ma and Li-Chun Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we study the phase structure and equilibrium state space geometry of charged topological dilaton black holes in $(n+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. By considering the pairs of parameters $(P\sim V)$ and $(Q\sim U)$ as variables, we analyze the phase structure and critical phenomena of black holes and discuss the relation between the two kinds of critical phenomena. We find that the phase structures and critical phenomena drastically depend on the cosmological constant $l$ (or the static electric charge $Q$ of the black holes), dimensionality $n$ and dilaton field $\Phi $.
