Title: A quantum cosmological model in Hořava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: O. Obregón and J. A. Preciado
Abstract: A Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Kantowski-Sachs model is derived within the framework of the minimal quantum gravity theory proposed by Ho\v{r}ava. We study the solution to this equation in the ultraviolet limit for the specific case where the {\lambda} parameter of the theory takes its relativistic value {\lambda} = 1. It is observed that the minisuperspace variables switch their role compared with their usual infrared (General Relativity) behavior.
