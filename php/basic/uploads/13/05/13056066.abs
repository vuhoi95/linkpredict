Title: Mixing with descendant fields in perturbed minimal CFT models
Authors: Armen Poghosyan and Hayk Poghosyan
Abstract: We extend the analysis of the RG trajectory connecting successive minimal CFT models ${\cal M}_p$ and ${\cal M}_{p-1}$ for $p\gg 1$, performed by A. Zamolodchikov, to the fields $\varphi_{n,n\pm 3}$. This required a close investigation of mixing with the descendant fields at the level 2. In particular we identify those specific linear combinations of UV fields which flow to the IR fields $\varphi_{n+3,n}$ and $\varphi_{n-3,n}$. We report also the results of the calculation of the same mixing coefficients through the recent RG domain wall approach by Gaiotto. These results are in complete agreement with the leading order perturbation theory.
