Title: Holographic entanglement entropy in imbalanced superconductors
Authors: Arghya Dutta and Sujoy Kumar Modak
Abstract: We study the behavior of holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) for imbalanced holographic superconductors. We employ a numerical approach to consider the robust case of fully back-reacted gravity system. The hairy black hole solution is found by using our numerical scheme. Then it is used to compute the HEE for the superconducting case. The cases we study show that in presence of a mismatch between two chemical potentials, below the critical temperature, superconducting phase has a lower HEE in comparison to the AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black hole phase. Interestingly, the effects of chemical imbalance are different in the contexts of black hole and superconducting phases. For black hole, HEE increases with increasing imbalance parameter while it behaves oppositely for the superconducting phase. The implications of these results are discussed.
