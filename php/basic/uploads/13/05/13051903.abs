Title: The rigid limit of N=2 supergravity
Authors: Bobby E. Gunara and Jan Louis and Paul Smyth and Luca Tripodi and Roberto Valandro
Abstract: In this paper we review the rigid limit of N=2 supergravity coupled to vector and hypermultiplets. In particular we show how the respective scalar field spaces reduce to their global counterparts. In the hypermultiplet sector we focus on the relation between the local and rigid c-map.
