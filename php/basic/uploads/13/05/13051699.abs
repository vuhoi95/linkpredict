Title: Finite Energy Electroweak Dyon
Authors: Y. M. Cho and Kyoungtae Kim and J. H. Yoon
Abstract: The recent MoEDAL experiment at LHC to detect the electroweak monopole makes the theoretical prediction of the monopole mass an urgent issue. We discuss different ways to estimate the mass of the electroweak monopole. We first present a scaling argument which indicates that the mass of the electroweak monopole to be around 4 TeV. To justify this we construct finite energy analytic dyon solutions which could be viewed as the regularized Cho-Maison dyon, modifying the coupling strengths of the electromagnetic interaction of $W$-boson in the standard model. Our result demonstrates that a genuine electroweak monopole whose mass scale is much smaller than the grand unification scale can exist, which can actually be detected at the present LHC.
