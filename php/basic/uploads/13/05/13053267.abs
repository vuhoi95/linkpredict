Title: Holographic Thermalization from Kerr-AdS
Authors: Irina Aref'eva and Andrey Bagrov and Alexey S. Koshelev
Abstract: We study thermalization of a strongly coupled theory holographically dual to a thin shell of null dust with non-zero angular momentum collapsing to Kerr-AdS. We calculate thermalization time for two point correlation functions. It happens that in the 3-dimensional case the thermalization time is just proportional to the distance between points where the correlator is evaluated. This is a very surprising and rather unexpected generalization of the same relation in the case of zero momentum.
