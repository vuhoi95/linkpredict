Title: The quantum angular Calogero-Moser model
Authors: Mikhail Feigin and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: The rational Calogero-Moser model of n one-dimensional quantum particles with inverse-square pairwise interactions (in a confining harmonic potential) is reduced along the radial coordinate of R^n to the `angular Calogero-Moser model' on the sphere S^{n-1}. We discuss the energy spectrum of this quantum system, its degeneracies and the eigenstates. The spectral flow with the coupling parameter yields isospectrality for integer increments. Decoupling the center of mass before effecting the spherical reduction produces a `relative angular Calogero-Moser model', which is analyzed in parallel. We generalize our considerations to the Calogero-Moser models associated with Coxeter groups. Finally, we attach spin degrees of freedom to our particles and extend the results to the spin-Calogero system.
