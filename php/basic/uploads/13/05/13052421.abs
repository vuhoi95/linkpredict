Abstract: We compute the two-loop Sudakov form factor in three-dimensional N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory, using generalised unitarity. As an intermediate step, we derive the non-planar part of the one-loop four-point amplitude in terms of box integrals. Our result for the Sudakov form factor is given by a single non-planar tensor integral with uniform degree of transcendentality, and is in agreement with the known infrared divergences of two-loop amplitudes in ABJM theory. We also discuss a number of interesting properties satisfied by related three-dimensional integral functions.
