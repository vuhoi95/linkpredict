Title: One dyonic instanton in 5d maximal SYM theory
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Andreas Gustavsson
Abstract: We study the one-instanton sector of 5d U(N) maximal SYM theory. By using the moduli space approximation we obtain all the 1/4-BPS bound states of one dyonic instanton when a vev is given to one of the SYM scalar fields that breaks U(N) maximally. We compute the corresponding 1/4-BPS index and partition function and find agreement with arXiv:1110.2175.
