Authors: K. Andrzejewski and J. Gonera and P. Kosiński and P. Maślanka
Abstract: We consider the dynamics invariant under the action of l-conformal Galilei group using the method of nonlinear realizations. We find that by an appropriate choice of the coset space parametrization one can achieve the complete decoupling of the equations of motion. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are constructed. The results are compared with those obtained by Galajinsky and Masterov [Nucl. Phys. B860, (2013), 212].
