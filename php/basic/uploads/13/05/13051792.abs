Title: Reflection Positivity for Majoranas
Authors: Arthur Jaffe and Fabio L. Pedrocchi
Abstract: We establish reflection positivity for Gibbs trace states defined by a certain class of Hamiltonians that describe the interaction of Majoranas on a lattice. These Hamiltonians may include many-body interactions, as long as the signs of the associated coupling constants satisfy certain restrictions. We show that reflection positivity holds on an even subalgebra of Majoranas.
