Title: Emergent Potentials in Consistent Higher Derivative N=1 Supergravity
Authors: Fotis Farakos and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: By employing consistent supersymmetric higher derivative terms, we show that the supersymmetric theories may have a sector where the scalar potential does no longer have the conventional form. The theories under consideration contain consistent higher-derivative terms which do not give rise to instabilities and ghost states. The chiral auxiliaries are still not propagating and can be integrated out. Their elimination gives rise to emerging potentials even when there is not a superpotential to start with. This novel feature of higher derivative supersymmetric chiral models is also extended to vector multiplets both in global and local supersymmetry. In particular, in supergravity, the emerging potentials give rise always to a de Sitter vacuum signaling supersymmetry breaking.
