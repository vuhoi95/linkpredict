Title: Three-BMN Correlation Functions: Integrability vs. String Field Theory  One-Loop Mismatch
Authors: Waldemar Schulgin and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: We compare calculations of the three-point correlation functions of BMN operators at the one-loop (next-to-leading) order in the scalar SU(2) sector from the integrability expression recently suggested by Gromov and Vieira, and from the string field theory expression based on the effective interaction vertex by Dobashi and Yoneya. A disagreement is found between the form-factors of the correlation functions in the one-loop contributions. The order-of-limits problem is suggested as a possible explanation of this discrepancy.
