Title: Double Handled Brane Tilings
Authors: Stefano Cremonesi and Amihay Hanany and Rak-Kyeong Seong
Abstract: We classify the first few brane tilings on a genus 2 Riemann surface and identify their toric Calabi-Yau moduli spaces. These brane tilings are extensions of tilings on the 2-torus, which represent one of the largest known classes of 4d N=1 superconformal field theories for D3-branes. The classification consists of 16 distinct genus 2 brane tilings with up to 8 quiver fields and 4 superpotential terms. The Higgs mechanism is used to relate the different theories.
