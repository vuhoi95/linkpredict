Title: Fluid Mechanics of Strings
Authors: Daniel Schubring and Vitaly Vanchurin
Abstract: We consider conserved currents in an interacting network of one-dimensional objects (or strings). Singular currents localized on a single string are considered in general, and a formal procedure for coarse-graining over many strings is developed. This procedure is applied to strings described by the Nambu-Goto action such as cosmic strings. In addition to conserved currents corresponding to the energy-momentum tensor, we consider an antisymmetric tensor of conserved currents related to the string tangent vector. Under the assumption of local equilibrium we derive a complete set of hydrodynamic equations for strings.
