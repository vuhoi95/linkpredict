Title: Sum Rule for the ADM Mass and Tensions in Planar AdS Spacetimes
Authors: Basem Mahmoud El-Menoufi and Benjamin Ett and David Kastor and Jennie Traschen
Abstract: An asymptotically planar AdS spacetimes is characterized by its ADM mass and tensions. We define an additional ADM charge Q associated with the scaling Killing vector of AdS, show that Q is given by a certain sum over the ADM mass and tensions and that Q vanishes on solutions to the Einstein equation with negative cosmological constant. The sum rule for the mass and tensions thus established corresponds in an AdS/CFT context to the vanishing of the trace of the boundary stress tensor. We also show that an analogous sum rule holds for local planar sources of stress-energy sources in AdS. In a simple model consisting of a static, plane symmetric source we find that the perturbative stress-energy tensor must be tracefree.
