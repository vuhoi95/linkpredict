Title: The Froissart--Martin Bound for $ππ$ Scattering in QCD
Authors: David Greynat and Eduardo de Rafael
Abstract: The Froissart--Martin bound for total $\pi\pi$ scattering cross sections is reconsidered in the light of QCD properties such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the counting rules for a large number of colours $\Nc$.
