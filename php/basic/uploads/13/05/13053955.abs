Title: Quantum Energy Teleportation without Limit of Distance
Authors: Masahiro Hotta and Jiro Matsumoto and Go Yusa
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is, from an operational viewpoint of distant protocol users, the transportation of energy via local operations and classical communication. QET has various links to fundamental research fields, including black hole physics, the quantum theory of Maxwell's demon, and condensed-matter entanglement. There are promising signs that QET will be experimentally verified using the chiral boson fields of quantum Hall edge currents. In this Letter, we prove that, using the vacuum state of a quantum field, the upper bound of the amount of energy teleported by QET is inversely proportional to the transfer distance. This distance bound can be overcome by using squeezed states with local-vacuum regions.
