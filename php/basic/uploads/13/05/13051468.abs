Abstract: From pure Yang-Mills action for the $SL(5,\mathbb{R})$ group in four Euclidean dimensions we obtain a gravity theory in the first order formalism. Besides the Einstein-Hilbert term, the effective gravity has a cosmological constant term, a curvature squared term, a torsion squared term and a matter sector. The cosmological constant term may account for dark energy and the matter field can be associated with dark matter. To obtain such geometrodynamical theory, asymptotic freedom and the Gribov parameter (soft BRST symmetry breaking) are crucial. Particularly, Newton and cosmological constant are related to these parameters and they also run as functions of the energy scale. One-loop computations are performed and the results are interpreted.
