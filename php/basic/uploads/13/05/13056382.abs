Title: Quantum Restoration of Broken Symmetry in one Dimensional Loop Space
Authors: Pinaki Patra and Tanmay Mandal and Jyoti Prasad Saha
Abstract: For 1 Dimensional loop space, a nonlinear nonlocal transformation of fields is given to make the action of the self-interacting quantum field to the free one. A specific type of Classically broken symmetry is restored in Quantum theory. 1-D Sine Gordon system and Sech interactions are treated as the explicit example.
