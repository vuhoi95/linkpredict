Title: Particlelike distributions of the Higgs field nonminimally coupled to  gravity
Authors: Andre Fuzfa and Massimiliano Rinaldi and Sandrine Schlogel
Abstract: When the Higgs field is nonminimally coupled to gravity, there exists a family of spherically symmetric particlelike solutions to the field equations. These monopoles are the only globally regular and asymptotically flat distributions with finite energy of the Higgs field around compact objects. Moreover, spontaneous scalarization is strongly amplified for specific values of their mass and compactness.
