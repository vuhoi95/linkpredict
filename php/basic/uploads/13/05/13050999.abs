Title: Multi-Point Virtual Structure Constants and Mirror Computation of  CP^2-model
Authors: Masao Jinzenji and Masahide Shimizu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a geometrical approach to mirror computation of genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of CP^2. We use multi-point virtual structure constants, which are defined as intersection numbers of a compact moduli space of quasi maps from CP^1 to CP^2 with 2+n marked points. We conjecture that some generating functions of them produce mirror map and the others are translated into generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants via the mirror map. We generalize this formalism to open string case. In this case, we have to introduce infinite number of deformation parameters to obtain results that agree with some known results of open Gromov-Witten invariants of CP^2. We also apply multi-point virtual structure constants to compute closed and open Gromov-Witten invariants of a non-nef hypersurface in projective space. This application simplifies the computational process of generalized mirror transformation.
