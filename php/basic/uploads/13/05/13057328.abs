Title: Off-diagonal Bethe ansatz and exact solution of a topological spin ring
Authors: Junpeng Cao and Wen-Li Yang and Kangjie Shi and Yupeng Wang
Abstract: A general method is proposed for constructing the Bethe ansatz equations of integrable models without U(1) symmetry. As an example, the exact spectrum of the XXZ spin ring with M{\" o}bius like topological boundary condition is derived by constructing a modified T-Q relation based on the functional connection between the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and the quantum determinant of the monodromy matrix. With the exact solution, the elementary excitations of the topological XX spin ring is discussed in detail. It is found that the excitation spectrum indeed shows a nontrivial topological nature.
