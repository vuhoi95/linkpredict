Title: Charged black rings from inverse scattering
Authors: Jorge V. Rocha and Maria J. Rodriguez and Oscar Varela and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: The inverse scattering method of Belinsky and Zakharov is a powerful method to construct solutions of vacuum Einstein equations. In particular, in five dimensions this method has been successfully applied to construct a large variety of black hole solutions. Recent applications of this method to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory, for the special case of Kaluza-Klein dilaton coupling, has led to the construction of the most general black ring in this theory. In this contribution, we review the inverse scattering method and its application to the EMd theory. We illustrate the efficiency of these methods with a detailed construction of an electrically charged black ring.
