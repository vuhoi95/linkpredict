Title: Novel aspects of C-theories in Cosmology
Authors: Tomi S. Koivisto and David F. Mota and Marit Sandstad
Abstract: The field equations in FRW background for the so called C-theories are presented and investigated. In these theories the usual Ricci scalar is substituted with $f(\mathcal{R})$ where $\mathcal{R}$ is a Ricci scalar related to a conformally scaled metric $\hat{g}_{\mu\nu} = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{R})g_{\mu\nu}$, where the conformal factor itself depends on $\mathcal{R}$. It is shown that homogeneous perturbations of this Ricci scalar around general relativity FRW background of a large class of these theories are either inconsistent or unstable.
