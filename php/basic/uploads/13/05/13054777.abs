Title: Unitary representations of N-conformal Galilei group
Authors: K. Andrzejewski and J. Gonera
Abstract: All unitary irreducible representations of centrally extended (N-odd) N-conformal Galilei group are constructed. The "on-shell" action of the group is derived and shown to coincide, in special but most important case, with that obtained in: J. Gomis, K. Kamimura, Phys. Rev. {\bf D85} (2012), 045023.
