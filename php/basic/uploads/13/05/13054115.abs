Title: Spatial modulation and topological current in holographic QCD matter
Authors: Kenji Fukushima and Pablo Morales
Abstract: We investigate an impact of the axial-vector interaction on spatial modulation of quark matter. A magnetic field coupled with baryon density leads to a topological axial current, so that the effect of the axial-vector interaction is crucially enhanced then. Using the Sakai-Sugimoto model we have found that, contrary to a naive expectation, the spatially modulated phase is less favored for a stronger magnetic field, which is realized by the presence of topological current.
