Authors: Farrin Payandeh and Toradj Mohammad Pur and Mohsen Fathi and Zahra Gh. Moghaddam
Abstract: In this paper we first introduce the famous Klein paradox. Afterwards by proposing the Krein quantization approach and taking the negative modes into account, we will show that the expected and exact current densities, could be achieved without confronting any paradox.
