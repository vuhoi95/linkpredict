Authors: Tajron Juric and Stjepan Meljanac and Rina Strajn
Abstract: The quantum phase space described by Heisenberg algebra possesses undeformed Hopf algebroid structure. The $\kappa$-deformed phase space with noncommutative coordinates is realized in terms of undeformed quantum phase space. There are infinitely many such realizations related by similarity transformations. For a given realization we construct corresponding coproducts of commutative coordinates and momenta (bialgebroid structure). The $\kappa$-deformed phase space has twisted Hopf algebroid structure. General method for the construction of twist operator (satisfying cocycle and normalization condition) corresponding to deformed coalgebra structure is presented. Specially, twist for natural realization (classical basis) of $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime is presented. The cocycle condition, $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra and $R$-matrix are discussed. Twist operators in arbitrary realizations are constructed from the twist in the given realization using similarity transformations. Some examples are presented. The important physical applications of twists, realizations, $R$-matrix and Hopf algebroid structure are discussed.
