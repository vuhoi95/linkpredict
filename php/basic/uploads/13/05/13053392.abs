Title: The Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Cosmological B-L Breaking
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Valerie Domcke and Kohei Kamada and Kai Schmitz
Abstract: Cosmological B-L breaking is a natural and testable mechanism to generate the initial conditions of the hot early universe. If B-L is broken at the grand unification scale, the false vacuum phase drives hybrid inflation, ending in tachyonic preheating. The decays of heavy B-L Higgs bosons and heavy neutrinos generate entropy, baryon asymmetry and dark matter and also control the reheating temperature. The different phases in the transition from inflation to the radiation dominated phase produce a characteristic spectrum of gravitational waves. We calculate the complete gravitational wave spectrum due to inflation, preheating and cosmic strings, which turns out to have several features. The production of gravitational waves from cosmic strings has large uncertainties, with lower and upper bounds provided by Abelian Higgs strings and Nambu-Goto strings, implying \Omega_GW h^2 ~ 10^{-13} - 10^{-8}, much larger than the spectral amplitude predicted by inflation. Forthcoming gravitational wave detectors such as eLISA, advanced LIGO, ET, and BBO/DECIGO will reach the sensitivity needed to test the predictions from cosmological B-L breaking.
