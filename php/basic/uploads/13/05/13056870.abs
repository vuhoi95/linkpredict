Title: 5d superconformal indices at large N and holography
Authors: Oren Bergman and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Gabi Zafrir
Abstract: We propose a general formula for the perturbative large N superconformal index of 5d quiver fixed point theories that have an AdS(6)xS(4)/Z(n) supergravity dual. This index is obtained from the parent theory by projecting to orbifold-invariant states and adding the twisted sector contributions. Our result agrees with expectations from the dual supergravity description. We test our formula against the direct computation of the index for Z(2) and Z(3) and find complete agreement.
