Title: 1/16 BPS States in N=4 SYM
Authors: Chi-Ming Chang and Xi Yin
Abstract: We investigate the problem of counting 1/16 BPS operators in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory at weak coupling. We present the complete set of 1/16 BPS operators in the infinite N limit, which agrees with the counting of free BPS multi-graviton states in the gravity dual AdS5xS5. Further, we conjecture that all 1/16 BPS operators in N=4 SYM are of the multi-graviton form, and give numerical evidences for this conjecture. We discuss the implication of our conjecture and the seeming failure in reproducing the entropy of large 1/16 BPS black holes in AdS5.
