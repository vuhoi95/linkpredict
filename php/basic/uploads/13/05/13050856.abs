Title: The entropy of a hole in spacetime
Authors: Vijay Balasubramanian and Bartlomiej Czech and Borun D. Chowdhury and Jan de Boer
Abstract: We compute the gravitational entropy of 'spherical Rindler space', a time-dependent, spherically symmetric generalization of ordinary Rindler space, defined with reference to a family of observers traveling along non-parallel, accelerated trajectories. All these observers are causally disconnected from a spherical region H (a 'hole') located at the origin of Minkowski space. The entropy evaluates to S = A/4G, where A is the area of the spherical acceleration horizon, which coincides with the boundary of H. We propose that S is the entropy of entanglement between quantum gravitational degrees of freedom supporting the interior and the exterior of the sphere H.
