Title: A Note on Supersymmetric Chiral Bosons
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: In this note we extend the Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin formalism for chiral bosons in two dimensions to $N=(1,1)$ and $N=(2,2)$ superspace. In the latter case the formalism is developed for chiral, twisted chiral and semi-chiral superfields.
