Title: Doubling of the Algebra and Neutrino Mixing within Noncommutative  Spectral Geometry
Authors: Maria Vittoria Gargiulo and Mairi Sakellariadou and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We study physical implications of the doubling of the algebra, an essential element in the construction of the noncommutative spectral geometry model, proposed by Connes and his collaborators as offering a geometric explanation for the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions. Linking the algebra doubling to the deformed Hopf algebra, we build Bogogliubov transformations and show the emergence of neutrino mixing.
