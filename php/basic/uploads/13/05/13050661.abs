Title: Stable and decaying bound states on the naked Reissner-Nordstr√∂m  background
Authors: Valentin D. Gladush and Dmitry A. Kulikov
Abstract: We present a quantum mechanical study of the bound states of a neutral scalar particle on the curved background described by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) spacetime that corresponds to a naked singularity. We show that there occurs both the metastable, \textit{i.e.} decaying bound states and the stable ones. The corresponding energy spectra are calculated in the leading WKB approximation and the comparison with the RN black hole quasinormal mode spectrum is made. The metastable bound states on the naked singularity background turn out to be more long-living than the quasinormal modes for the black hole with the same mass.
