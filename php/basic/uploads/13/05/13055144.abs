Title: Attractive Electromagnetic Casimir Stress on a Spherical Dielectric  Shell
Authors: N. Graham and M. Quandt and H. Weigel
Abstract: Based on calculations involving an idealized boundary condition, it has long been assumed that the stress on a spherical conducting shell is repulsive. We use the more realistic case of a Drude dielectric to show that the stress is attractive, matching the generic behavior of Casimir forces in electromagnetism. We trace the discrepancy between these two cases to interactions between the electromagnetic quantum fluctuations and the dielectric material.
