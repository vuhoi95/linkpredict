Title: The fate of Lorentz frame in the vicinity of black hole singularity
Authors: Douglas G. Moore and V. H. Satheeshkumar
Abstract: General Relativity is known to break down at singularities. However, it is expected that quantum corrections become important when the curvature is of the order of Planck scale avoiding the singularity. By calculating the effect of tidal forces on a freely falling inertial frame, and assuming the least possible size of the frame to be of the Planck length, we show that the Lorentz frames cease to exist at a finite distance from the singularity. Within that characteristic radius, one cannot apply General Relativity nor Quantum Field Theory as we know them today. Additionally we consider other quantum length scales and impose limits on the distances from the singularity at which those theories can conceivably be applied within a Lorentz frame.
