Title: Subtracted Geometry from Harrison Transformations: II
Authors: Anurag Sahay and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: We extend our previous study (arXiv:1203.5088) to the case of five-dimensional multi-charge black holes, thus showing that these configurations and their subtracted geometries also lie in a 3d duality orbit. In order to explore the 3d duality orbit, we do a timelike reduction from 5d to 4d and a spacelike reduction from 4d to 3d. We present our analysis in the notation of Euclidean N=2 supergravity and its c-map. We also relate our analysis to that of Cveti\v{c}, Guica, and Saleem.
