Title: A Calculus for Higher Spin Interactions
Authors: Euihun Joung and Massimo Taronna and Andrew Waldron
Abstract: Higher spin theories can be efficiently described in terms of auxiliary St\"uckelberg or projective space field multiplets. By considering how higher spin models couple to scale, these approaches can be unified in a conformal geometry/tractor calculus framework. We review these methods and apply them to higher spin vertices to obtain a generating function for massless, massive and partially massless three-point interactions.
