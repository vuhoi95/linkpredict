Title: Generalized fluxes in matrix compactifications
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Larisa Jonke
Abstract: In the recent years a lot of attention is focused on unconventional string compactifications. A variety of different but related frameworks was developed in order to address issues such as duality invariance, non-geometry and non-commutativity in string theory. In this contribution we review and clarify the approach that goes through matrix models. Furthermore, we discuss some connections of this framework to other related approaches.
