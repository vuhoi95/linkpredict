Title: Five-Dimensional Maximally Supersymmetric Yang-Mills in Supergravity  Backgrounds
Authors: Clay Cordova and Daniel L. Jafferis
Abstract: We determine the action for five-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills in off-shell supergravity backgrounds. The resulting theory contains novel five-dimensional BF type couplings as well as cubic scalar interactions which vanish in flat space.
