Title: Universe Acceleration in Brane World Models
Authors: C. Chiou-Lahanas and G. A. Diamandis and B. C. Georgalas
Abstract: We examine the cosmology induced on a brane moving in the background of a five-dimensional black hole, solution of the string effective action. The evolution, determined by the Israel junction conditions is found to be compatible with an accelerating universe with the present day acceleration coming after a decelerating phase. The possible species of the energy-momentum tensor, localized on the brane, for these solutions to be valid are discussed.
