Abstract: An interesting class of background field configurations in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are the O(2)xO(3) symmetric fields, originally introduced by S.L. Adler in 1972. Those backgrounds have some instanton-like properties and yield a one-loop effective action that is highly nontrivial, but amenable to numerical calculation. Here, we use the recently developed "partial-wave-cutoff method" for a full mass range numerical analysis of the effective action for the "standard" O(2)xO(3) symmetric field, modified by a radial suppression factor. At large mass, we are able to match the asymptotics of the physically renormalized effective action against the leading two mass levels of the inverse mass expansion. For small masses, with a suitable choice of the renormalization scheme we obtain stable numerical results even in the massless limit. We analyze the N - point functions in this background and show that, even in the absence of the radial suppression factor, the two-point contribution to the effective action is the only obstacle to taking its massless limit. The standard O(2)xO(3) background leads to a chiral anomaly term in the effective action, and both our perturbative and nonperturbative results strongly suggest that the small-mass asymptotic behavior of the effective action is, after the subtraction of the two-point contribution, dominated by this anomaly term as the only source of a logarithmic mass dependence. This confirms a conjecture by M. Fry.
