Title: Schrodinger Sigma Models and Jordanian Twists
Authors: Io Kawaguchi and Takuya Matsumoto and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We proceed to study the integrable structures of two-dimensional non-linear sigma models defined on three-dimensional Schrodinger spacetimes. We show that anisotropic Lax pairs are equivalent with isotropic Lax pairs with flat conserved currents under non-local gauge transformations. Then a quite non-trivial realization of the undeformed Yangian symmetry Y(sl(2)) is revealed after an appropriate gauge fixing, which is determined by comparing the gauge transformation to a quantum Jordanian twist. As a result, an exotic symmetry found in arXiv:1209.4147 may be interpreted as a Jordanian deformation of Y(sl(2)).
