Abstract: We present an extension of the deformation method applied to self-dual solutions of generalized Abelian Higgs-Chern-Simons models. Starting from a model defined by a potential $V(| \phi |)$ and a non-canonical kinetic term $\omega(| \phi |) | D_{\mu}\phi |^2$ whose analytical domain wall solutions are known, we show that this method allows to obtain an uncountable number of new analytical solutions of new models defined by other functions $\widetilde{V}$ and $\widetilde{\omega}$. We present some examples of deformation functions leading to new families of models and their associated analytic solutions.
