Title: Large N=4 Holography
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Rajesh Gopakumar
Abstract: The class of 2d minimal model CFTs with higher spin AdS3 duals is extended to theories with large N=4 superconformal symmetry. We construct a higher spin theory based on the global D(2,1|alpha) superalgebra, and propose a large N family of cosets as a dual CFT description. We also indicate how a non-abelian version of this Vasiliev higher spin theory might give an alternative description of IIB string theory on an AdS3 x S3 x S3 x S1 background.
