Title: Superhorizon entanglement entropy from particle decay in inflation
Authors: Louis Lello and Daniel Boyanovsky and Richard Holman
Abstract: In inflationary cosmology all particle states decay as a consequence of the lack of kinematic thresholds. The decay of an initial single particle state yields an \emph{entangled quantum state of the product particles}. We generalize and extend a manifestly unitary field theoretical method to obtain the time evolution of the quantum state. We consider the decay of a light scalar field with mass $M\ll H$ with a cubic coupling in de Sitter space-time. Radiative corrections feature an infrared enhancement manifest as poles in $\Delta=M^2/3H^2$ and we obtain the quantum state in an expansion in $\Delta$. To leading order in $\Delta$ the pure state density matrix describing the decay of a particle with sub-horizon wavevector is dominated by the emission of superhorizon quanta, describing \emph{entanglement between superhorizon and subhorizon fluctuations and correlations across the horizon}. Tracing over the superhorizon degrees of freedom yields a mixed state density matrix from which we obtain the entanglement entropy. Asymptotically this entropy grows with the \emph{physical} volume as a consequence of more modes of the decay products crossing the Hubble radius. A generalization to localized wave packets is provided. The cascade decay of single particle states into many particle states is discussed. We conjecture on \emph{possible} impact of these results on non-gaussianity and on the ``low multipole anomalies'' of the CMB.
