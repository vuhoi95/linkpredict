Title: Complex scalar field in strictly stationary  Einstein-Maxwell-axion-dilaton spacetime with negative cosmological constant
Authors: Bartlomiej Bakon and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: We proved that strictly stationary Einstein-Maxwell-axion-dilaton spacetime with negative cosmological constant could not support a nontrivial configuration of complex scalar fields. We considered the general case of the arbitrary number of U(1) gauge fields in the theory under consideration.
