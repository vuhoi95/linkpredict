Title: BPS Black Holes in AdS4 from M-theory
Authors: Nick Halmagyi and Michela Petrini and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We study supersymmetric black holes in $AdS_4$ in the framework of four dimensional gauged $\N=2$ supergravity coupled to hypermultiplets. We derive the flow equations for a general electrically gauged theory where the gauge group is Abelian and, restricting them to the fixed points, we derive the gauged supergravity analogue of the attractor equations for theories coupled to hypermultiplets. The particular models we analyze are consistent truncations of M-theory on certain Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds. We study the space of horizon solutions of the form $AdS_2\times \Sigma_g$ with both electric and magnetic charges and find a four-dimensional solution space when the theory arises from a reduction on $Q^{111}$. For other $SE_7$ reductions, the solutions space is a subspace of this. We construct explicit examples of spherically symmetric black holes numerically.
