Title: Non-locality of the C- and D-theories
Authors: Marit Sandstad and Tomi S. Koivisto and David F. Mota
Abstract: Apparent similarities between non-local theories of gravity and the so-called C-theories are pointed out. It is shown that some simple C-theories can be mapped exactly into a previously considered type of ghost-free nonlocal gravity. This may introduce a useful tool to tackle some infinite-order derivative theories and raises the possibility of describing renormalisable gravity in a new context of D-theories.
