Title: Conformal Blocks in the Large D Limit
Authors: A. Liam Fitzpatrick and Jared Kaplan and David Poland
Abstract: We derive conformal blocks in an inverse spacetime dimension expansion. In this large D limit, the blocks are naturally written in terms of a new combination of conformal cross-ratios. We comment on the implications for the conformal bootstrap at large D.
