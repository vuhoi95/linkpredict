Title: Worldsheet Instanton Corrections to 522-brane Geometry
Authors: Tetsuji Kimura and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study worldsheet instanton corrections to the exotic 522-brane geometry in type II string theory. The BPS vortices in the N=(4,4) gauged linear sigma model modify the geometry of the 522-brane. We find that the modification of the geometry is understood by the localization in the T-dualized winding direction.
