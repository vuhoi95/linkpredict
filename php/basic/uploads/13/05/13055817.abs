Title: Lorentz Invariant CPT Violation for a Class of Nonlocal Thirring Model
Authors: Pinaki Patra and Jyoti Prasad Saha
Abstract: It is possible to construct Lorentz invariant CPT violating models for Nonlocal Quantum Field Theory. In this article, we present a class of Nonlocal Thirring Models, in which the CPT invariance is violated while the Lorentz invariance is present. As a result, in certain cases the mass-splitting between particle and antiparticle are identified.
