Title: Effective theory for the Vainshtein mechanism from the Horndeski action
Authors: Kazuya Koyama and Gustavo Niz and Gianmassimo Tasinato
Abstract: Starting from the general Horndeski action, we derive the most general effective theory for scalar perturbations around flat space that allows us to screen fifth forces via the Vainshtein mechanism. The effective theory is described by a generalization of the Galileon Lagrangian, which we use to study the stability of spherically symmetric configurations exhibiting the Vainshtein effect. In particular, we discuss the phenomenological consequences of a scalar-tensor coupling that is absent in the standard Galileon Lagrangian. This coupling controls the superluminality and stability of fluctuations inside the Vainshtein radius in a way that depends on the density profile of a matter source. Particularly we find that the vacuum solution is unstable due to this coupling.
