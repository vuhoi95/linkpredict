Title: Higgs bundles and (A,B,A)-branes
Authors: David Baraglia and Laura P. Schaposnik
Abstract: Through the action of anti-holomorphic involutions on a compact Riemann surface, we construct families of (A,B,A)-branes in the moduli spaces of G_c-Higgs bundles on the Riemann surface. We study the geometry of these (A,B,A)-branes in terms of spectral data and show they have the structure of real integrable systems.
