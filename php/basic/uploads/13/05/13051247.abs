Title: No-Scale Supergravity Realization of the Starobinsky Model of Inflation
Authors: John Ellis and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos and Keith A. Olive
Abstract: We present a model for cosmological inflation based on a no-scale supergravity sector with an SU(2,1)/U(1) Kahler potential, a single modulus T and an inflaton superfield Phi described by a Wess-Zumino model with superpotential parameters (mu, lambda). This model yields a scalar spectral index n_s and a tensor-to-scalar ratio r that are compatible with the Planck measurements for values of lambda simeq mu/3M_P. For the specific choice lambda = mu/3M_P, the model is a no-scale supergravity realization of the R+R^2 Starobinsky model.
