Title: Weak-coupling analysis of the single-site large-N gauge theory coupled  to adjoint fermions
Authors: Robert Lohmayer and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: We consider the leading-order expression at weak-coupling for a single-site large-N gauge theory coupled to adjoint fermions. We study the case of overlap and wilson fermions. We extend the theory to real values of the number of fermion flavors and restrict ourselves to asymptotically free theories. Using a four-dimensional density function for the distribution of the eigenvalues of the link variables, we show that it is possible to recover the infinite-volume continuum limit for a certain range of fermion flavors if we use fermions with a bare mass of zero. Our use of the four-dimensional density function is supported by a direct analysis of the lattice action.
