Title: Current conservation in charge conjugation parity time reversal symmetry  (CPT) violating gauge-invariant nonlocal Thirring model
Authors: Pinaki Patra and Jyoti Prasad Saha
Abstract: Charge conjugation, parity transformation and time reversal symmetry (CPT) violation and Lorentz invariance can coexist in the framework of non-local field theory. In this article we have proposed a class of Charge conjugation, parity transformation and time reversal symmetry (CPT) violating Lorentz invariant nonlocal gauge-invariant models, which can be termed as non-local Thirring models. The conserved currents in this aspect are obtained.
