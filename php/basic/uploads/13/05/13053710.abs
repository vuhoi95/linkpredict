Title: Effective state, Hawking radiation and quasi-normal modes for Kerr black  holes
Authors: C. Corda and S. H. Hendi and R. Katebi and N. O. Schmidt
Abstract: The non-strictly continuous character of the Hawking radiation spectrum generates a natural correspondence between Hawking radiation and black hole (BH) quasi-normal modes (QNM). In this work, we generalize recent results on this important issue to the framework of Kerr BHs (KBH). We show that also for the KBH, QNMs can be naturally interpreted in terms of quantum levels. Thus, the emission or absorption of a particle is in turn interpreted in terms of a transition between two different levels. At the end of the paper, we also generalize some concepts concerning the "effective state" of a KBH.
