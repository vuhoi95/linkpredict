Title: Stability of the Self-accelerating Universe in Massive Gravity
Authors: Nima Khosravi and Gustavo Niz and Kazuya Koyama and Gianmassimo Tasinato
Abstract: We study linear perturbations around time dependent spherically symmetric solutions in the Lambda_3 massive gravity theory, which self-accelerate in the vacuum. We find that the dynamics of the scalar perturbations depend on the coordinate choice for the background solutions. For particular choices of coordinates there is a symmetry enhancement, leaving no propagating scalar degrees of freedom at linear order in perturbations. In contrast, any other coordinate choice propagates a single scalar mode. We find that the Hamiltonian of this scalar mode is unbounded from below for all self-accelerating solutions, signalling an instability.
