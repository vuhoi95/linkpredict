Title: On form factors and Macdonald polynomials
Authors: Michael Lashkevich and Yaroslav Pugai
Abstract: We are developing the algebraic construction for form factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory proposed in [B.Feigin, M.Lashkeivch, 2008]. We show that the operators corresponding to the null vectors in this construction are given by the degenerate Macdonald polynomials with rectangular partitions and the parameters $t=-q$ on the unit circle. We obtain an integral representation for the null vectors and discuss its simple applications.
