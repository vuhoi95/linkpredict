Title: Conformal and gauge invariant spin-2 field equations
Authors: C. S. O. Mayor and G. Otalora and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: Using an approach based on the Casimir operators of the de Sitter group, the conformal invariant equations for a fundamental spin-2 field are obtained, and their consistency discussed. It is shown that, only when the spin-2 field is interpreted as a 1-form assuming values in the Lie algebra of the translation group, rather than a symmetric second-rank tensor, the field equation is both conformal and gauge invariant.
