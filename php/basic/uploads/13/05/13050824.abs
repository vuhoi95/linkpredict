Title: The Observed Squeezed Limit of Cosmological Three-Point Functions
Authors: Enrico Pajer and Fabian Schmidt and Matias Zaldarriaga
Abstract: The squeezed limit of the three-point function of cosmological perturbations is a powerful discriminant of different models of the early Universe. We present a conceptually simple and complete framework to relate any primordial bispectrum in this limit to late time observables, such as the CMB temperature bispectrum and the scale-dependent halo bias. We employ a series of convenient coordinate transformations to capture the leading non-linear effects of cosmological perturbation theory on these observables. This makes crucial use of Fermi Normal Coordinates and their conformal generalization, which we introduce here and discuss in detail. As an example, we apply our formalism to standard slow-roll single-field inflation. We show explicitly that Maldacena's results for the squeezed limits of the scalar bispectrum [proportional to (ns-1) in comoving gauge] and the tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum lead to no deviations from a Gaussian universe, except for projection effects. In particular, the primordial contributions to the squeezed CMB bispectrum and scale dependent halo bias vanish, and there are no primordial "fossil" correlations between long-wavelength tensor perturbations and small-scale perturbations. The contributions to observed correlations are then only due to projection effects such as gravitational lensing and redshift perturbations.
