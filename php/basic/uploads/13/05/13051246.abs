Title: Anti-selfdual Connections On The Quantum Projective Plane: Instantons
Authors: Francesco D'Andrea and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: We study one-instantons, that is anti-selfdual connections with instanton number 1, on the quantum projective plane with orientation which is reversed with respect to the usual one. The orientation is fixed by a suitable choice of a basis element for the rank 1 free bimodule of top forms. The noncommutative family of solutions is foliated, each non-singular leaves being isomorphic to the quantum projective plane itself.
