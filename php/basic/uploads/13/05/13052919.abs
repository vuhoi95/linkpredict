Title: Cosmic evolution from phase transition of 3-dimensional flat space
Authors: Arjun Bagchi and Stephane Detournay and Daniel Grumiller and Joan Simon
Abstract: Flat space cosmology spacetimes are exact time-dependent solutions of 3-dimensional gravity theories, such as Einstein gravity or topologically massive gravity. We exhibit a novel kind of phase transition between these cosmological spacetimes and the Minkowski vacuum. At sufficiently high temperature (rotating) hot flat space tunnels into a universe described by flat space cosmology.
