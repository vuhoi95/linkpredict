Title: Note on Construction of Dual-trace Factor in Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Chih-Hao Fu and Yi-Jian Du and Bo Feng
Abstract: In this note we provide a new construction of BCJ dual-trace factor using the kinematic algebra proposed in arXiv:1105.2565 and arXiv:1212.6168. Different from the construction given in arXiv:1304.2978 based on the proposal of arXiv:1103.0312, the method used in this note exploits the adjoint representation of kinematic algebra and the use of inner product in dual space. The dual-trace factor defined in this way naturally satisfies cyclic symmetry condition but not KK-relation, just like the trace of U(N) Lie algebra satisfies cyclic symmetry condition, but not KK-relation. In other words the new construction naturally leads to formulation sharing more similarities with the color decomposition of Yang-Mills amplitude.
