Title: N = (2, 2) Non-Linear sigma-Models: A Synopsis
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We review N=(2,2) supersymmetric non-linear sigma-models in two dimensions and their relation to generalized Kahler and Calabi-Yau geometry. We illustrate this with an explicit non-trivial example.
