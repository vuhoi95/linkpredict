Title: Partial breaking of global supersymmetry and super particle actions
Authors: S. Bellucci and N. Kozyrev and S. Krivonos and A. Sutulin
Abstract: We argue the conjecture that the on-shell component super particle actions have a universal form, in which the physical fermions enter the action through the ein-bein and the space-time derivatives of the matter fields, only. We explicitly constructed the actions for the super particles in $D=3$ realizing the $N=4\cdot 2^{k} \rightarrow N=2\cdot 2^k$ pattern of supersymmetry breaking, and in $D=5$ with the $N=16$ supersymmetry broken down to the $N=8$ one. All constructed actions have indeed a universal form, confirming our conjecture. Our construction is strictly based on the assumption that in the system we have one half breaking of the global supersymmetry, and on the very special choice of the superspace coordinates and component fields.
