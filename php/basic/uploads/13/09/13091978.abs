Abstract: Neutron star models in perturbative $f(R)$ gravity are considered with realistic equations of state. In particular, we consider the FPS, SLy and other equations of state and a case of piecewise equation of state for stars with quark cores. The mass-radius relations for $f(R)=R+R(e^{-R/R_{0}}-1)$ model and for $R^2$ models with logarithmic and cubic corrections are obtained. In the case of $R^2$ gravity with cubic corrections, we obtain that at high central densities ($\rho>10\rho_{ns}$, where $\rho_{ns}=2.7\times 10^{14}$ g/cm$^{3}$ is the nuclear saturation density), stable star configurations exist. The minimal radius of such stars is close to $9$ km with maximal mass $\sim 1.9 M_{\odot}$ (SLy equation). A similar situation takes place for AP4 and BSK20 EoS. Such an effect can give rise to more compact stars than in General Relativity. If observationally identified, such objects could constitute a formidable signature for modified gravity at astrophysical level. Another interesting result can be achieved in modified gravity with only a cubic correction. For some EoS, the upper limit of neutron star mass increases and therefore these EoS can describe realistic star configurations (although, in General Relativity, these EoS are excluded by observational constraints).
