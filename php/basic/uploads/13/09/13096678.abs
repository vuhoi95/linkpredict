Title: Stability of D-brane embeddings in nontrivial backgrounds
Authors: Lilia Anguelova and Peter Suranyi and L. C. R. Wijewardhana
Abstract: We propose a new analytical method for determining whether nonsupersymmetric probe branes embedded in nontrivial backgrounds are perturbatively stable or not. The method is based on a relationship between zero mass solutions of the relevant DBI equations of motion and tachyonic solutions. Furthermore, due to the above relation, the question, of whether a classical solution is stable or not, can be answered simply by studying the derivatives of that solution with respect to its integration constants. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of this method by applying it to several interesting examples.
