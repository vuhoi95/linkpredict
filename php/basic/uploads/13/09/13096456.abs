Abstract: Recently, the XXX spin chain with arbitrary boundary fields was successfully solved [1] via the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz method [2]. The correctness and the completeness of this solution were numerically verified by Nepomechie for one choice of the parameterizations [3]. In this paper, we discuss further the completeness of another parameterization of the Bethe ansatz equations and its reduction to the parallel boundary field case. The numerical results show that when the relative angle between the boundary fields turns to zero, both the T-Q relations and the Bethe ansatz equations are reduced to the ones obtained by the conventional Bethe ansatz methods. This allows us to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the Bethe roots of the unparallel boundary field case and those of the parallel boundary field case. In the thermodynamic limit, those two sets of Bethe roots tend to the same and the contribution of the relative angle to the energy is in the order of 1/N.
