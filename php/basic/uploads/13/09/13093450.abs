Title: Non-linear evolution of unintegrated gluon density at large values of  coupling constant
Authors: Krzysztof Kutak and Piotr Sur√≥wka
Abstract: We propose an evolution equation for unintegrated gluon densities that is valid for large values of the QCD coupling constant $\bar{\alpha} _s$. Our approach is based on the linear resummation model introduced by Sta\'{s}to. We generalize the model including a non-linear term in the diffusive regime. The validity of the diffusive evolution at strong coupling is supported by the AdS/CFT consideration, as well as perturbative arguments. We solve the evolution equation numerically and extract the saturation scale, which we compare with the weak coupling counterpart.
