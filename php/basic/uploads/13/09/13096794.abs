Title: Lifshitz Field Theories at Non-Zero Temperature, Hydrodynamics and  Gravity
Authors: Carlos Hoyos and Bom Soo Kim and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider a covariant formulation of field theories with Lifshitz scaling, and analyze the energy-momentum tensor and the scale symmetry Ward identity. We derive the equation of state and the ideal Lifshitz hydrodynamics in agreement with arXiv:1304.7481, where they were determined by using thermodynamics and symmetry properties. We construct the charged ideal Lifshitz hydrodynamics in the generating functional framework as well as in the gravitational holographic dual description. At the first viscous order, an analysis of the entropy current reveals two additional transport coefficients (one dissipative and one dissipationless) compared to the neutral case, contributing to the charge current and to the asymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor.
