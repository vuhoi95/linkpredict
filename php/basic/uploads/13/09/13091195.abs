Title: Real structures on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles
Authors: David Baraglia and Laura P. Schaposnik
Abstract: We construct triples of commuting real structures on the moduli space of Higgs bundles, whose fixed loci are branes of type (B, A, A), (A, B, A) and (A, A, B). We study the real points through the associated spectral data and describe the topological invariants involved using KO, KR and equivariant K-theory.
