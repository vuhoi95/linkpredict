Title: Spectral Sum Rules and Magneto-Roton as Emergent Graviton in Fractional  Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: Siavash Golkar and Dung X. Nguyen and Dam T. Son
Abstract: We consider gapped fractional quantum Hall states on the lowest Landau level when the Coulomb energy is much smaller than the cyclotron energy. We introduce two spectral densities, \rho_T(\omega) and \bar \rho_T(\omega), which are proportional to the probabilities of absorption of circularly polarized gravitons by the quantum Hall system. We prove three sum rules relating these spectral densities with the shift S, the q^4 coefficient of the static structure factor S_4, and the high-frequency shear modulus of the ground state \mu_\infty, which is precisely defined. We confirm an inequality, first suggested by Haldane, that S_4 is bounded from below by |S-1|/8. The Laughlin wavefunction saturates this bound, which we argue to imply that systems with ground state wavefunctions close to Laughlin's absorb gravitons of predominantly one circular polarization. We consider a nonlinear model where the sum rules are saturated by a single magneto-roton mode. In this model, the magneto-roton arises from the mixing between oscillations of an internal metric and the hydrodynamic motion. Implications for experiments are briefly discussed.
