Title: Donaldson-Thomas Invariants of 2-Dimensional sheaves inside threefolds  and modular forms
Authors: Amin Gholampour and Artan Sheshmani
Abstract: Motivated by S-duality modularity conjectures in string theory, we study the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of 2-dimensional sheaves inside a nonsingular threefold X. Our main case of study in this paper is when X is given by a surface fibration over a curve with the canonical bundle of X pulled back from the base curve. We study the Donaldson-Thomas invariants as defined in of the 2-dimensional Gieseker stable sheaves in X supported on the fibers. In case where X is a K3 fibration, analogous to the Gromov-Witten theory formula established in work of Maulik-Pandharipande, we express these invariants in terms of the Euler characteristic of the Hilbert scheme of points on the fiber and the Noether-Lefschetz numbers of the fibration, and prove that the invariants have modular properties.
