Title: N=1 Supersymmetric Non-Abelian Compensator Mechanism for Extra Vector  Multiplet
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present a variant formulation of N=1 supersymmetric compensator mechanism for an arbitrary non-Abelian group in four dimensions. This formulation resembles our previous variant supersymmetric compensator mechanism in 4D. Our field content consists of the three multiplets: (i) A Non-Abelian Yang-Mills multiplet (A_\mu^I, \lambda^I, C_{\mu\nu\rho}^I), (ii) a tensor multiplet (B_{\mu\nu}^I, \chi^I, \varphi^I) and an extra vector multiplet (K_\mu^I, \rho^I, C_{\mu\nu\rho}^I) with the index I for the adjoint representation of a non-Abelian gauge group. The C_{\mu\nu\rho}^I is originally an auxiliary field dual to the conventional auxiliary field D^I for the extra vector multiplet. The vector K_\mu^I and the tensor C_{\mu\nu\rho}^I get massive, after absorbing respectively the scalar \varphi^I and the tensor B_{\mu\nu}^I. The superpartner fermion \rho^I acquires a Dirac mass shared with \chi^I. We fix all non-trivial cubic interactions in the total lagrangian, all quadratic terms in supersymmetry transformations, and all quadratic interactions in field equations. The action invariance and the super-covariance of all field equations are confirmed up to the corresponding orders.
