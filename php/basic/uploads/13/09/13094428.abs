Title: Indefinite theta functions and black hole partition functions
Authors: Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Michele Cirafici and Rogerio Jorge and Suresh Nampuri
Abstract: We explore various aspects of supersymmetric black hole partition functions in four-dimensional toroidally compactified heterotic string theory. These functions suffer from divergences owing to the hyperbolic nature of the charge lattice in this theory, which prevents them from having well-defined modular transformation properties. In order to rectify this, we regularize these functions by converting the divergent series into indefinite theta functions, thereby obtaining fully regulated single-centered black hole partitions functions.
