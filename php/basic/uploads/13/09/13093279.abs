Abstract: We study the structure of neutron stars in $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$ theory of gravity (Starobinsky model), in an exact and non-perturbative approach. In this model, apart from the standard General Relativistic junction conditions, two extra conditions, namely the continuity of the curvature scalar and its first derivative needs to be satisfied. For an exterior Schwarzschild solution, the curvature scalar and its derivative has to be zero at the stellar surface. We show that for some equation of state (EoS) of matter, matching all conditions at the surface of the star is impossible. Hence the model brings two major fine-tuning problems: (i) only some particular classes of EoS are consistent with Schwarzschild at the surface and (ii) given that EoS, only a very particular set of boundary conditions at the centre of the star will satisfy the given boundary conditions at the surface. Hence we show that this model (and subsequently many other f(R) models where uniqueness theorem is valid) is highly unnatural, for the existence of compact astrophysical objects. This is because the EoS of a compact star should be completely determined by the physics of nuclear matter at high density and not the theory of gravity.
