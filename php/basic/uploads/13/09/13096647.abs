Title: The BFKL equation, Mueller-Navelet jets and single-valued harmonic  polylogarithms
Authors: Vittorio Del Duca and Lance J. Dixon and Claude Duhr and Jeffrey Pennington
Abstract: We introduce a generating function for the coefficients of the leading logarithmic BFKL Green's function in transverse-momentum space, order by order in alpha_s, in terms of single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. As an application, we exhibit fully analytic azimuthal-angle and transverse-momentum distributions for Mueller-Navelet jet cross sections at each order in alpha_s. We also provide a generating function for the total cross section valid to any number of loops.
