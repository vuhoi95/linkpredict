Title: A magnetic instability of the non-Abelian Sakai-Sugimoto model
Authors: Nele Callebaut and David Dudal
Abstract: In this follow-up paper of 1105.2217 we further discuss the occurrence of a magnetically induced tachyonic instability of the rho meson in the two-flavour Sakai-Sugimoto model, uplifting two remaining approximations in the previous paper. That is, firstly, the magnetically induced splitting of the branes is now taken into account, evaluating without approximations the symmetrized trace which enters in the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action. This leads to an extra mass generating effect for the charged heavy-light rho meson through a holographic Higgs mechanism. Secondly, we compare the results in the approximation to second order in the field strength to the results using the full DBI-action. Both improvements cause an increase of the critical magnetic field for the onset of rho meson condensation. In addition, the stability in the scalar sector in the presence of the magnetic field is discussed.
