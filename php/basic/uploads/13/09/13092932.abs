Title: Oscillatory inflation in non-minimal derivative coupling model
Authors: H. Mohseni Sadjadi and Parviz Goodarzi
Abstract: Inflation during rapid oscillation of a scalar field in non-minimal derivative coupling model is discussed. Cosmological perturbations originated in this stage are studied and consistency of the results with observational constraints coming from Planck 2013 data are investigated.
