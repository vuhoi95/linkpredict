Title: Classification of 4d N=2 gauge theories
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We classify all possible four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric UV-complete gauge theories composed of semi-simple gauge groups and hypermultiplets. We also give appropriate references for all theories with known Seiberg-Witten solutions.
