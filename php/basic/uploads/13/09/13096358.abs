Title: The mechanism why colliders could create quasi-stable black holes
Authors: R. Torres and F. Fayos and O. Lorente-Espin
Abstract: It has been postulated that black holes could be created in particle collisions within the range of the available energies for nowadays colliders (LHC). In this paper we analyze the evaporation of a type of black holes that are candidates for this specific behaviour, namely, small black holes on a brane in a world with large extra-dimensions. We examine their evolution under the assumption that energy conservation is satisfied during the process and compare it with the standard evaporation approach. We claim that, rather than undergoing a quick total evaporation, black holes become quasi-stable. We comment on the (absence of) implications for safety of this result. We also discuss how the presence of black holes together with the correctness of the energy conservation approach might be experimentally verified.
