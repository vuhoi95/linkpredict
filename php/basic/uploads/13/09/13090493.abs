Title: Anthropic Bounds on Lambda from the No-Boundary Quantum State
Authors: James Hartle and Thomas Hertog
Abstract: We show that anthropic selection emerges inevitably in the general framework for prediction in quantum cosmology. There the predictions of anthropic reasoning depend on the prior implied by the universe's quantum state. To illustrate this we compute the probabilities specified by the no-boundary wave function for our observations at the present time of the values of Lambda and Q in an inflationary landscape model in which both quantities vary. Within the anthropic range of values the no-boundary state yields an approximately flat distribution on Lambda and strongly favors small values of Q. This restores Weinberg's successful prediction of Lambda.
