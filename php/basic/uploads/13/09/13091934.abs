Title: Galileogenesis: A new cosmophenomenological zip code for reheating  through R-parity violating coupling
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Arnab Dasgupta
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an idea of leptogenesis scenario in higher derivative gravity induced DBI Galileon framework {\it aka Galileogenesis} in presence of one-loop R-parity violating couplings in the background of a low energy effective supergravity setup. We have studied extensively the detailed feature of reheating constraints and the cosmophenomenological consequences of thermal gravitino dark matter in light of PLANCK and PDG data. Finally we have also established a direct cosmological connection among dark matter relic abundance, reheating temperature and tensor-to-scalar ratio in the context of DBI Galileon inflation.
