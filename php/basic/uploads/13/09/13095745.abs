Title: Quantum beats of the rigid rotor
Authors: K. Kowalski and J. Rembieli≈Ñski
Abstract: The dynamics is investigated of a free particle on a sphere (rigid rotor or rotator) that is initially in a coherent state. The instability of coherent states with respect to the free evolution leads to nontrivial time-development of averages of observables representing the position of a particle on a sphere that can be interpreted as quantum beats.
