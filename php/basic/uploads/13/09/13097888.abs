Title: Inner Product in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Ashaq Hussain Sofi and Muhammad Ashraf Shah
Abstract: In this paper we will analyse the inner product for a general tensor field theory. We will first analyse a generalized inner product for scalar field theories. Then we will use it to construct a inner product for tensor field theories. We will use this inner product to construct the two-point function.
