Abstract: A study of the zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator in the maximal Abelian gauge is presented in the case of the gauge group SU(2) and for different Euclidean space-time dimensions. Explicit examples of classes of normalizable zero modes and corresponding gauge field configurations are constructed by taking into account two boundary conditions, namely: i) the finite Euclidean Yang-Mills action, ii) the finite Hilbert norm.
