Title: False Theta Functions and the Verlinde formula
Authors: Thomas Creutzig and Antun Milas
Abstract: We discover new analytic properties of classical partial and false theta functions and their potential applications to representation theory of W-algebras and vertex algebras in general. More precisely, motivated by clues from conformal field theory, first, we are able to determine modular-like transformation properties of regularized partial and false theta functions. Then, after suitable identification of regularized partial/false theta functions with the characters of atypical modules for the singlet vertex algebra W(2,2p-1), we formulate and prove a Verlinde-type formula for the fusion rules of irreducible W(2,2p-1)-modules.
