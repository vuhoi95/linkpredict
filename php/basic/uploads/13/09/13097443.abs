Title: Entropic uncertainty relations under the relativistic motion
Authors: Jun Feng and Yao-Zhong Zhang and Mark D. Gould and Heng Fan
Abstract: The uncertainty principle bounds our ability to simultaneously predict two incompatible observables of a quantum particle. Assisted by a quantum memory to store the particle, this uncertainty could be reduced and quantified by a new Entropic Uncertainty Relation (EUR). In this Letter, we explore how the relativistic motion of the system would affect the EUR in two sample scenarios. First, we show that the Unruh effect of an accelerating particle would surely increase the uncertainty if the system and particle entangled initially. On the other hand, the entanglement could be generated from nonuniform motion once the Unruh decoherence is prevented by utilizing the cavity. We show that, in a uncertainty game between an inertial cavity and a nonuniformly accelerated one, the uncertainty evolves periodically with respect to the duration of acceleration segment. Therefore, with properly chosen cavity parameters, the uncertainty bound could be protected. Implications of our results for gravitation are also discussed.
