Title: On the Supersymmetric Completion of $R+R^2$ Gravity and Cosmology
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Renata Kallosh and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We revisit and clarify the supersymmetric versions of $R+ R^2$ gravity, in view of the renewed interest to these models in cosmology. We emphasize that the content of the dual standard supergravity theory in the old minimal formulation necessarily includes two massive chiral multiplets, that we call the inflaton and the goldstino. We point out that the presence of these multiplets is model independent in the old minimal formulation and therefore any theory that contains a single chiral multiplet fails to be a supersymmetric generalization of the $R+R^2$ gravity. The supergravity interactions of the two chiral multiplets are encoded in a superpotential mass term and an arbitrary Kahler potential for the goldstino multiplet. The implication for cosmology of the supersymmetric $R+R^2$ gravity is also discussed.
