Title: Isospinning baby Skyrmion solutions
Authors: Richard A. Battye and Mareike Haberichter
Abstract: We perform full two-dimensional (2D) numerical relaxations of isospinning soliton solutions in the baby Skyrme model in which the global $O(3)$ symmetry is broken by the 2D analogue of the pion mass term in the Skyrme model. In our calculations we explicitely allow the isospinning solitons to deform and to break the symmetries of the static configurations. We find that stable isospinning baby Skyrme solutions can be constructed numerically for all angular frequencies $\omega\le \text{min}(\mu,1)$, where $\mu$ is the mass parameter of the model. Stable, rotationally-symmetric baby Skyrmion solutions for higher angular velocities are simply an artefact of the hedgehog approximation. Isospinning multisoliton solutions of topological charge $B$ turn out to be unstable to break up into their $B$ charge-1 constituents at some critical breakup frequency value. Furthermore, we find that for $\mu$ sufficiently large the rotational symmetry of charge-2 baby Skyrmions becomes broken at a critical angular frequency $\omega$.
