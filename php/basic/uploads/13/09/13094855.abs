Title: Low energy dynamics of gapless and quasi-gapless modes of vortices in  superfluid $^3$He-B
Authors: Adam J Peterson and Mikhail Shifman
Abstract: We discuss the low energy effective dynamics of gapless excitations of the mass vortices of systems similar to the Ginzburg-Landau description of superfluid helium-3 in the bulk B phase. Our approach is to determine the vortex solution by considering a specific ansatz for the order parameter and minimizing the free energy. The conditions on the $\beta_i$ coefficients required for the stability of the various solutions for the order parameter are calculated. By considering the symmetries that are broken by the vortex solutions we are able to generate the moduli fields associated with the low energy excitations of the vortices. Using these fields we determine the effective free energy describing the dynamics of these excitations.
