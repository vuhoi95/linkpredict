Title: On supersymmetric Chern-Simons-type theories in five dimensions
Authors: Sergei M. Kuzenko and Joseph Novak
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the supersymmetric non-Abelian Chern-Simons action in conventional five-dimensional N=1 superspace. Our construction makes use of the superform formalism to generate supersymmetric invariants. Similar ideas are applied to construct supersymmetric actions for off-shell supermultiplets with an intrinsic central charge. In particular, the large tensor multiplet is described in superspace for the first time.
