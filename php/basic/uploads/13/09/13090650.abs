Title: An Index for Intersecting Branes in Matrix Models
Authors: Harold Steinacker and Jochen Zahn
Abstract: We introduce an index indicating the occurrence of chiral fermions at the intersection of branes in matrix models. This allows to discuss the stability of chiral fermions under perturbations of the branes.
