Title: Friedmann equations and emergence of cosmic space
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Daeho Lee
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Padmanabhan's conjecture for the emergence of cosmic space [arXiv:1206.4916] holds for the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe in Einstein gravity but does not hold for the non-flat case unless one uses the aerial volume instead of the proper volume. Doing this, we also show that various works extending Padmanabhan's conjecture to non-Einstein and non-flat cases have serious shortfalls. This analysis is done using the Friedmann equation with the further assumptions of the holographic principle and the equipartition rule of energy.
