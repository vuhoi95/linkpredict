Title: Deformed supersymmetric gauge theories from the fluxtrap background
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: The fluxtrap background of string theory provides a transparent and algorithmic way of constructing supersymmetric gauge theories with both mass and Omega-type deformations in various dimensions. In this article, we review a number of deformed supersymmetric gauge theories in two and four dimensions which can be obtained via the fluxtrap background from string or M-theory. Such theories, the most well-known being Omega-deformed super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, have met with a lot of interest in the recent literature. The string theory treatment offers many new avenues of analysis and applications, such as for example the study of the gravity duals for deformed N=4 gauge theories.
