Title: Avoidance of a Landau Pole by Flat Contributions in QED
Authors: Lutz Klaczynski and Dirk Kreimer
Abstract: We consider massless Quantum Electrodynamics in momentum scheme and carry forward an approach based on Dyson-Schwinger equations to approximate both the $\beta$-function and the renormalized photon self-energy [Y11]. Starting from the Callan-Symanzik equation, we derive a renormalization group (RG) recursion identity which implies a non-linear ODE for the anomalous dimension and extract a sufficient but not necessary criterion for the existence of a Landau pole. This criterion implies a necessary condition for QED to have no such pole. Solving the differential equation exactly for a toy model case, we integrate the corresponding RG equation for the running coupling and find that even though the $\beta$-function entails a Landau pole it exhibits a flat contribution capable of decreasing its growth, in other cases possibly to the extent that such a pole is avoided altogether. Finally, by applying the recursion identity, we compute the photon propagator and investigate the effect of flat contributions on both spacelike and timelike photons.
