Title: Entanglement Entropy of Extremal BTZ
Authors: Pawel Caputa and Vishnu Jejjala and Hesam Soltanpanahi
Abstract: In this note, we use entanglement entropy as a tool to explore the universal properties of CFTs dual to extremal BTZ black holes. We demonstrate that the entanglement entropies computed in the CFTs at the boundary of the extremal BTZ and the boundary of the near-horizon limit of the extremal BTZ are in perfect agreement and have the form appropriate to a two-dimensional CFT with only the chiral part excited and the anti-chiral in the ground state. Furthermore, we analyze the universal limits of the entanglement entropy and recover the correct value of the thermal entropy for large entangling intervals and the first-law like relation for the small interval.
