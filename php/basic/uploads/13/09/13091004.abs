Title: Massive N=2 Gauge Theories at Large N
Authors: J. G. Russo and K. Zarembo
Abstract: Using exact results obtained from localization on S^4, we explore the large N limit of N=2 super-Yang-Mills theories with massive matter multiplets. We focus on three cases: N=2* theory, describing a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation, SU(N) super-Yang-Mills with 2N massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental, and super-QCD with massive quarks. When the radius of the four-sphere is sent to infinity the theories at hand are described by solvable matrix models, which exhibit a number of interesting phenomena including quantum phase transitions at finite 't Hooft coupling.
