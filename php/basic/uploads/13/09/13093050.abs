Title: BPS spectrum of Argyres-Douglas theory via spectral network
Authors: Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Chan Y. Park and Wenbin Yan
Abstract: We study the BPS spectrum of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory of Argyres-Douglas type, obtained via twisted compactification of six-dimensional $A_{N-1}$ $(2,0)$ theory on a sphere with an irregular puncture, by using spectral networks. We give strong evidence of the equivalence of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories from six-dimensional theories of different ranks by systematically comparing the chamber structure and wall-crossing phenomena.
