Title: Thermal R-current correlators from AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Xuanmin Cao and Lian Liu and Hui Liu
Abstract: We calculate all components of thermal R-current correlators from AdS/CFT correspondence for non-zero momentum and energy. In zero momentum limit, we find an analytic expression for the components Gxx(Gyy). The dielectric function of strong coupling is also presented and compared with that in weak coupling.
