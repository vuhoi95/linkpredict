Title: Leptogenesis and Primordial Magnetic Fields
Authors: Andrew J. Long and Eray Sabancilar and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: The anomalous conversion of leptons into baryons during leptogenesis is shown to produce a right-handed helical magnetic field; in contrast, the magnetic field produced during electroweak baryogenesis is known to be left-handed. If the cosmological medium is turbulent, the magnetic field evolves to have a present day coherence scale and field strength that are of astrophysical interest. Observations of the amplitude, coherence scale, and helicity of the intergalactic magnetic field promise to provide a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model and the very early universe.
