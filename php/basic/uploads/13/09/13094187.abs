Title: Meson Spectra and Thermodynamics in Soft-Wall AdS/QCD
Authors: Sean P. Bartz and Joseph I. Kapusta
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence may offer new and useful insights into the non- perturbative regime of strongly coupled gauge theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics. Soft-wall AdS/QCD models have reproduced the linear trajectories of meson spectra by including background dilaton and chiral condensate fields. Efforts to derive these background fields from a scalar potential have so far been unsuccessful in satisfying the UV boundary conditions set by the AdS/CFT dictionary while reproducing the IR behavior needed to obtain the correct chiral symmetry breaking and meson spectra. We present a three-field scalar parametrization that includes the dilaton field and the chiral and glueball condensates. This model is consistent with linear trajectories for the meson spectra and the correct mass-splitting between the vector and axial-vector mesons. We also present the resulting meson trajectories.
