Title: Tinkertoys for the Twisted D-Series
Authors: Oscar Chacaltana and Jacques Distler and Anderson Trimm
Abstract: We study 4D N=2 superconformal field theories that arise from the compactification of 6D N=(2,0) theories of type D_N on a Riemann surface, in the presence of punctures twisted by a Z_2 outer automorphism. Unlike the untwisted case, the family of SCFTs is in general parametrized, not by M_{g,n}, but by a branched cover thereof. The classification of these SCFTs is carried out explicitly in the case of the D_4 theory, in terms of three-punctured spheres and cylinders, and we provide tables of properties of twisted punctures for the D_5 and D_6 theories. We find realizations of Spin(8) and Spin(7) gauge theories with matter in all combinations of vector and spinor representations with vanishing beta-function, as well as Sp(3) gauge theories with matter in the 3-index traceless antisymmetric representation.
