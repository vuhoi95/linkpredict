Title: The R-operator for Modular Double
Authors: D. Chicherin and S. Derkachov
Abstract: We construct the R-operator -- solution of the Yang-Baxter equation acting in the tensor product of two infinite-dimensional representations of Faddeev's modular double. This R-operator intertwines the product of two L-operators associated with the modular double and it is built from three basic operators generating the permutation group of four parameters S_4.
