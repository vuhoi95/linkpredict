Authors: L. Ts. Adzhemyan and M. V. Kompaniets
Abstract: We present a new approach to calculation of anomalous dimensions in the framework of $\epsilon$-expansion and renormalization group method. This approach allows one to skip the calculation of renormalization constants and express anomalous dimensions in terms of renormalized diagrams, which are presented in a form suitable for numerical calculations. This approach can be easily automated and extended to a wide range of models. The power of this approach is illustrated on 5 loop calculations of beta-function and anomalous dimensions in $\phi^4$ model.
