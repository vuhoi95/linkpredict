Title: The Ultraviolet Properties of N=4 Supergravity at Four Loops
Authors: Zvi Bern and Scott Davies and Tristan Dennen and Alexander V. Smirnov and Vladimir A. Smirnov
Abstract: We demonstrate that pure N=4 supergravity is ultraviolet divergent at four loops. The form of the divergence suggests that it is due to the rigid U(1) duality-symmetry anomaly of the theory. This is the first known example of an ultraviolet divergence in a pure ungauged supergravity theory in four dimensions. We use the duality between color and kinematics to construct the integrand of the four-loop four-point amplitude, whose ultraviolet divergence is then extracted by standard integration techniques.
