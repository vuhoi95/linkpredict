Authors: Josef Kluso≈à and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We propose new version of massive $F(R)$ gravity which is natural generalization of convenient massive ghost-free gravity. Its Hamiltonian formulation in scalar-tensor frame is developed. We show that such $F(R)$ theory is ghost-free. The cosmological evolution of such theory is investigated. Despite the strong Bianchi identity constraint the possibility of cosmic acceleration (especially, in the presence of cold dark matter) is established. Ghost-free massive $F(R,T)$ gravity is also proposed.
