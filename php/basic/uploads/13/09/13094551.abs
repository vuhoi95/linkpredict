Title: Hilltop Supernatural Inflation and SUSY Unified Models
Authors: Kazunori Kohri and C. S. Lim and Chia-Min Lin and Yukihiro Mimura
Abstract: In this paper, we consider high scale (100 TeV) supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking and realize the idea of hilltop supernatural inflation in concrete particle physics models based on flipped-SU(5) and Pati-Salam models in the framework of supersymmetric grand unified theories (SUSY GUTs). The inflaton can be a flat direction including right-handed sneutrino and the waterfall field is a GUT Higgs. The spectral index is $n_s=0.96$ which fits very well with recent data by PLANCK satellite. There is no both thermal and non-thermal gravitino problems. Non-thermal leptogenesis can be resulted from the decay of right-handed sneutrino which plays (part of) the role of inflaton.
