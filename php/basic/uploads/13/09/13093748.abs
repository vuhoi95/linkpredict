Abstract: We reconstruct $F(R)$ gravity models with exponential and power-law forms of the scale factor in which bounce cosmology can be realized. We explore the stability of the reconstructed models with analyzing the perturbations from the background solutions. Furthermore, we study an $F(R)$ gravity model with a sum of exponentials form of the scale factor, where the bounce in the early universe as well as the late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized in a unified manner. As a result, we build a second order polynomial type model in terms of $R$ and show that it could be stable. Moreover, when the scale factor is expressed by an exponential form, we derive $F(R)$ gravity models of a polynomial type in case of the non-zero spatial curvature and that of a generic type in that of the zero spatial curvature. In addition, for an exponential form of the scale factor, an $F(R)$ bigravity model realizing the bouncing behavior is reconstructed. It is found that in both the physical and reference metrics the bouncing phenomenon can occur, although in general the contraction and expansion rates are different each other.
