Title: Heterotic Model Building: 16 Special Manifolds
Authors: Yang-Hui He and Seung-Joo Lee and Andre Lukas and Chuang Sun
Abstract: We study heterotic model building on 16 specific Calabi-Yau manifolds constructed as hypersurfaces in toric four-folds. These 16 manifolds are the only ones among the more than half a billion manifolds in the Kreuzer-Skarke list with a non-trivial first fundamental group. We classify the line bundle models on these manifolds, both for SU(5) and SO(10) GUTs, which lead to consistent supersymmetric string vacua and have three chiral families. A total of about 29000 models is found, most of them corresponding to SO(10) GUTs. These models constitute a starting point for detailed heterotic model building on Calabi-Yau manifolds in the Kreuzer-Skarke list. The data for these models can be downloaded here: http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/projects/CalabiYau/toricdata/index.html
