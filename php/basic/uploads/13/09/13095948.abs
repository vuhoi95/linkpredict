Title: S-duality of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Anson Hook and Gonzalo Torroba
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing pairs of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories related by S-duality. Starting from a known S-duality of supersymmetric theories realized on the worldvolume of D3 branes in type IIB string theory, a new duality is obtained by replacing the D3-branes with antibranes. Large classes of dual pairs of nonsupersymmetric theories can be obtained in this way, with different interactions and matter content (chiral and vector-like). The approach is illustrated on gauge theories realized on three-branes and fractional branes probing orbifold singularities. The duality sheds light on the dynamics of gauge theories and their possible infrared phases by providing concrete magnetic dual descriptions of strongly coupled theories. Some of the models share various properties with QCD, including confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. More generally, these theories feature fermions in multiple two-index representations and could realize intriguing phases such as a free magnetic phase with chiral symmetry breaking or mixed phases where an interacting fixed point coexists with a confining phase.
