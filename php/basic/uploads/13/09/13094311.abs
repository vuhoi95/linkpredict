Title: The SU(3) Beta Function from Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory
Authors: R. Horsley and H. Perlt and P. E. L. Rakow and G. Schierholz and A. Schiller
Abstract: The SU(3) beta function is computed from Wilson loops to 20th order numerical stochastic perturbation theory. An attempt is made to include massless fermions, whose contribution is known analytically to 4th order. The question whether the theory admits an infrared stable fixed point is addressed.
