Title: The Statics Dielectric Function and Interaction Potential In Strong  Coupling With AdS/CFT
Authors: Lian Liu and Xuan-min Cao and Hui Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the static dielectric function and interaction potential in strong coupling limit with AdS/CFT correspondence. The dielectric function is depressed compared with that in weak coupling. The interaction potential then presents a weaker screening characteristics in strong coupling, which indicates a smaller Debye mass compared with weak coupling.
