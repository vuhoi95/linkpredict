Title: Monodromy of Inhomogeneous Picard-Fuchs Equations
Authors: Robert A. Jefferson and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: We study low-degree curves on one-parameter Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, and their contribution to the space-time superpotential in a superstring compactification with D-branes. We identify all lines that are invariant under at least one permutation of the homogeneous variables, and calculate the inhomogeneous Picard-Fuchs equation. The irrational large volume expansions satisfy the recently discovered algebraic integrality. The bulk of our work is a careful study of the topological integrality of monodromy under navigation around the complex structure moduli space. This is a powerful method to recover the single undetermined integration constant that is itself also of arithmetic significance. The examples feature a variety of residue fields, both abelian and non-abelian extensions of the rationals, thereby providing a glimpse of the arithmetic D-brane landscape.
