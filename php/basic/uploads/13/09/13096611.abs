Title: Simple groups stabilizing polynomials
Authors: Skip Garibaldi and Robert Guralnick
Abstract: We study the problem of determining, for a polynomial function $f$ on a vector space $V$, the linear transformations $g$ of $V$ such that $f g = f$. In case $f$ is invariant under a simple algebraic group $G$ acting irreducibly on $V$, we note that the subgroup of $GL(V)$ stabilizing $f$ often has identity component $G$ and we give applications realizing various groups, including the largest exceptional group $E_8$, as automorphism groups of polynomials and algebras. We show that starting with a simple group $G$ and an irreducible representation $V$, one can almost always find an $f$ whose stabilizer has identity component $G$ and that no such $f$ exists in the short list of excluded cases. This relies on our core technical result, the enumeration of inclusions $G < H \le SL(V)$ such that $V/H$ has the same dimension as $V/G$. The main results of this paper are new even in the special case where $k$ is the complex numbers.
