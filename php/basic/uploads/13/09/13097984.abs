Abstract: Using the recently proposed differential hierarchy (Z-expansion) technique, we obtain a general expression for the HOMFLY polynomials in two arbitrary symmetric representations of link families, including Whitehead and Borromean links. Among other things, this allows us to check and confirm the recent conjecture of arXiv:1304.5778 that the large representation limit (the same as considered in the knot volume conjecture) of this quantity matches the prediction from mirror symmetry consideration. We also provide, using the evolution method, the HOMFLY polynomial in two arbitrary symmetric representations for an arbitrary member of the one-parametric family of 2-component 3-strand links, which includes the Hopf and Whitehead links.
