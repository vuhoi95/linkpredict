Title: The two-loop soft current in dimensional regularization
Authors: Claude Duhr and Thomas Gehrmann
Abstract: The soft current describes the factorization behavior of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) scattering amplitudes in the limit of vanishing energy of one of the external partons. It is process-independent and can be expanded in a perturbative series in the coupling constant. To all orders in the dimensional regularization parameter, we compute the two-loop correction to the soft current for processes involving two hard partons.
