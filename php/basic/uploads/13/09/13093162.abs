Title: Generalized quasi-dilaton theory
Authors: Antonio De Felice and A. Emir Gumrukcuoglu and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: Recently the first example of a unitary theory of Lorentz-invariant massive gravity allowing for stable self-accelerating de Sitter solutions was found, extending the quasidilaton theory. In this paper we further generalize this new action for the quasidilaton field by introducing general Lagrangian terms which are consistent with the quasidilaton symmetry while leading to second order equations of motion. We find that the structure of the theory, compared to the simplest stable example, does not change on introducing these new terms.
