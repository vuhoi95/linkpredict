Title: n+1 Dimensional Gravity duals to quantum criticalities with spontaneous  symmetry breaking
Authors: Ding-fang Zeng and Kai Zhao
Abstract: We reexamine the charged AdS domain wall solution to the Einstein-Abelian-Higgs model proposed by Gubser et al as holographic superconductors at quantum critical points and comment on their statement about the uniqueness of gravity solutions. We generalize their explorations from 3+1 dimensions to arbitrary $n+1$Ds and find that the $n+1\geqslant5$D charged AdS domain walls are unstable against electric perturbations.
