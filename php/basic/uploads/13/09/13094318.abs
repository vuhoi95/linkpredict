Title: Isorotating Baby Skyrmions
Authors: A. Halavanau and Yakov Shnir
Abstract: We discuss how internal rotation with fixed angular frequency can affect the solitons in the baby Skyrme model in which the global O(3) symmetry is broken to the SO(2). Two particular choices of the potential term are considered, the "old" potential and the "new" double vacuum potential, We do not impose any assumptions about the symmetry on the fields. Our results confirm existence of two types of instabilities determined by the relation between the mass parameter of the potential and the angular frequency.
