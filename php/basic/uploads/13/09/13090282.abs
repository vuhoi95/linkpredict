Title: Born-Infeld Monopoles and Instantons
Authors: Atsushi Nakamula and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We show that in certain non-Abelian Born-Infeld-Higgs theories there are monopole solutions obeying Bogomol'nyi-like equations in the Prasad-Sommerfield limit. We also discuss the existence of instanton solution in an SU(2) Born-Infeld theory.
