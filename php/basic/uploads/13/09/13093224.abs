Title: Nambu-Goldstone modes in segregated Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Hiromitsu Takeuchi and Kenichi Kasamatsu
Abstract: Nambu-Goldstone modes in immiscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates are studied theoretically. In a uniform system, a flat domain wall is stabilized and then the translational invariance normal to the wall is spontaneously broken in addition to the breaking of two U(1) symmetries in the presence of two complex order parameters. We clarify properties of the low-energy excitations and identify that there exist two Nambu-Goldstone modes: in-phase phonon with a linear dispersion and ripplon with a fractional dispersion. The signature of the characteristic dispersion can be verified in segregated condensates in a harmonic potential.
