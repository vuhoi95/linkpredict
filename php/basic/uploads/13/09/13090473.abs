Title: Running Couplings in Quantum Theory of Gravity Coupled with Gauge Fields
Authors: Gaurav Narain and Ramesh Anishetty
Abstract: In this paper we study the coupled system of non-abelian gauge fields with higher-derivative gravity. Charge renormalization is investigated in this coupled system. It is found that the leading term in the gauge coupling beta function comes due to interaction of gauge fields with gravitons. This is shown to be a universal quantity in the sense that it doesn't depend on the gauge coupling and the gauge group, but may depend on the other couplings of the action (gravitational and matter). The coupled system is studied at one-loop. It is found that the leading term of gauge beta function is zero at one-loop in four dimensions. The effect of gauge fields on the running of gravitational couplings is investigated. The coupled system of gauge field with higher-derivative gravity is shown to satisfy unitarity when quantum corrections are taken in to account. Moreover, it is found that Newton constant goes to zero at short distances. In this renormalizable and unitary theory of gauge field coupled with higher-derivative gravity, the leading term of the gauge beta function, found to be universal for all gauge groups, is further studied in more detail by isolating it in the context of abelian gauge theories coupled with gravity in four dimensions. Using self-duality of abelian gauge theories in four dimensions, this term of the gauge beta function is shown to be zero to all loops. This is found to be independent of the gravity action, regularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. An explicit one-loop computation for arbitrary gravity action further demonstrates the vanishing of this term in the gauge beta function in four dimensions, independent of the regularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. Consequences of this are discussed.
