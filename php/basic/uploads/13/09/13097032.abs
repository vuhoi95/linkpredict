Authors: Zheng-Cheng Gu and Zhenghan Wang and Xiao-Gang Wen
Abstract: The Z_2 topological order in Z_2 spin liquid and in exactly soluble Kitaev toric code model is the simplest topological order for 2+1D bosonic systems. More general 2+1D bosonic topologically ordered states can be constructed via exact soluble string-net models. However, the most important topologically ordered phases of matter are arguably the fermionic fractional quantum Hall states. Topological phases of matter for fermion systems are strictly richer than their bosonic counterparts because locality has different meanings for the two kinds of systems. In this paper, we describe a simple fermionic version of the toric code model to illustrate many salient features of fermionic exactly soluble models and fermionic topologically ordered states.
