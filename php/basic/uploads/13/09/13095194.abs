Title: Construction of dynamics and time-ordered exponential for unbounded  non-symmetric Hamiltonians
Authors: Shinichiro Futakuchi and Kouta Usui
Abstract: We prove under certain assumptions that there exists a solution of the Schrodinger or the Heisenberg equation of motion generated by a linear operator H acting in some complex Hilbert space H, which may be unbounded, not symmetric, or not normal. We also prove that, under the same assumptions, there exists a time evolution operator in the interaction picture and that the evolution operator enjoys a useful series expansion formula. This expansion is considered to be one of the mathematically rigorous realizations of so called "time-ordered exponential", which is familiar in the physics literature. We apply the general theory to prove the existence of dynamics for the mathematical model of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) quantized in the Lorenz gauge, the interaction Hamiltonian of which is not even symmetric or normal.
