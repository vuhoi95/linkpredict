Title: Coexistence of two vector order parameters: a holographic model for  ferromagnetic superconductivity
Authors: Andrea Amoretti and Alessandro Braggio and Nicola Maggiore and Nicodemo Magnoli and Daniele Musso
Abstract: We study a generalization of the standard holographic p-wave superconductor featuring two interacting vector order parameters. Basing our argument on the symmetry and linear response properties of the model, we propose it as a holographic effective theory describing a strongly coupled ferromagnetic superconductor. We show that the two order parameters undergo concomitant condensations as a manifestation of an intrinsically interlaced electric/magnetic dynamics. Such intertwined dynamics is confirmed by the study of the transport properties. We characterize thoroughly the equilibrium and the linear response (i.e. optical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility) of the model at hand by means of a probe approximation analysis. Some insight about the effects of backreaction in the normal phase can be gained by analogy with the s-wave unbalanced holographic superconductor.
