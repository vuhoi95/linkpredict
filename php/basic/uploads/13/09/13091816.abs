Abstract: We construct a fermion system in a multi-kink-antikink soliton background, and present in an explicit form all its trapped configurations (bound state solutions) as well as scattering states. This is achieved by exploiting an exotic N=4 centrally extended nonlinear supersymmetry of completely isospectral pairs of reflectionless Schrodinger systems with potentials to be n-soliton solutions for the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The obtained reflectionless Dirac system with a position-dependent mass is shown to possess its own exotic nonlinear supersymmetry associated with the matrix Lax-Novikov operator being a Darboux-dressed momentum. In the process, we get an algebraic recursive representation for the multi-kink-antikink backgrounds, and establish their relation to the the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. We also indicate how the results can be related to the physics of self-consistent condensates based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations.
