Title: Four-Dimensional Asymptotically AdS Black Holes with Scalar Hair
Authors: P. A. Gonzalez and Eleftherios Papantonopoulos and Joel Saavedra and Yerko Vasquez
Abstract: We present a new family of asymptotically AdS four-dimensional black hole solutions with scalar hair of a gravitating system consisting of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity with a self-interacting potential. For a certain profile of the scalar field we solve the Einstein equations and we determine the scalar potential. Thermodynamically we show that there is a critical temperature below which there is a phase transition of a black hole with hyperbolic horizon to the new hairy black hole configuration.
