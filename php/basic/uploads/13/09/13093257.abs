Title: Marginal Deformations of Non-Relativistic Field Theories
Authors: Davron Mallayev and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz and Zhibai Zhang
Abstract: We construct the supergravity duals of marginal deformations of a (0,2) Landau-Ginsburg theory that describes the supersymmetric lowest Landau level. These deformations preserve supersymmetry and it is proposed that they are associated with the introduction of a phase in the (0,2) superpotential. We also consider marginal deformations of various field theories that exhibit Schrodinger symmetry and Lifshitz scaling. This includes countably-infinite examples with dynamical exponent z=2 based on the Sasaki-Einstein spaces Y^{p,q} and L^{p,q,r}, as well as an example with general dynamical exponent z >= 1.
