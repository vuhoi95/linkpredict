Title: Field localization and mass generation in an alternative 5-dimensional  brane model
Authors: Preston Jones and Gerardo Munoz and Doug Singleton and Triyanta
Abstract: This proceedings is based on a talk given at the APS DPF 2013 on an alternative 5-dimensional brane world model which is related to but has some physically distinct features from the Randall-Sundrum brane world model. The spin dependent localization of 5D fields for the alternative model are different and in some ways superior to the original Randall- Sundrum Model. The alternative model also exhibits a cutoff in the lo-calization of massive scalar fields not seen in the Randall-Sundrum and includes a self consistent mass prediction of two possible scalar bosons. Setting the warping factor in the new model consistent with a 126 GeV localized scalar boson predicts the existence of a second scalar boson at 177 GeV. This second scalar boson could be localized or non localized depending on the type of warping factor.
