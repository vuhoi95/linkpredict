Abstract: We report a study of the dependence of 4D SU(N) gauge theories on the topological theta term at finite temperature, and in particular in the large-N limit. We show that the theta dependence drastically changes across the deconfinement transition. The low-temperature phase is characterized by a large-N scaling with theta/N as relevant variable, while in the high-temperature phase the free energy is essentially determined by the dilute instanton-gas approximation, with a simple theta dependence of the free-energy density proportional to 1-Cos(theta).
