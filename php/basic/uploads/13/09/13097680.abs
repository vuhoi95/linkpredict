Title: Newtonian Hydrodynamics with General Relativistic Pressure
Authors: Jai-chan Hwang and Hyerim Noh
Abstract: We present the general relativistic pressure correction terms in Newtonian hydrodynamic equations to the nonlinear order: these are equations (\ref{mass-conservation-Mink})-(\ref{Poisson-eq-Mink}). The derivation is made in the zero-shear gauge based on the fully nonlinear formulation of cosmological perturbation in Einstein's gravity. The correction terms {\it differ} from many of the previously suggested forms in the literature based on hand-waving manners. We confirm our results by comparing with (i) the nonlinear perturbation theory, (ii) the first order post-Newtonian approximation, and (iii) the special relativistic limit, and by checking (iv) the consistency with full Einstein's equation.
