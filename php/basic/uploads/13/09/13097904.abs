Title: Missing solution in a Cornell potential
Authors: L. B. Castro and A. S. de Castro
Abstract: Missing bound-state solutions for fermions in the background of a Cornell potential consisting of a mixed scalar-vector-pseudoscalar coupling is examined. Charge-conjugation operation, degeneracy and localization are discussed.
