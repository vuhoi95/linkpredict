Title: Relevance of the axial anomaly at the finite-temperature chiral  transition in QCD
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the finite-temperature chiral transition in QCD with two light flavors, in the case of an effective suppression of the the U(1)_A symmetry breaking induced by the axial anomaly, which implies the symmetry breaking U(2)_L X U(2)_R -> U(2)_V, instead of SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R -> SU(2)_V. For this purpose, we perform a high-order field-theoretical perturbative study of the renormalization-group (RG) flow of the corresponding three-dimensional multiparameter Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Phi4 theory with the same symmetry-breaking pattern. We confirm the existence of a stable fixed point (FP), and determine its attraction domain in the space of the bare quartic parameters. Therefore, the chiral QCD transition might be continuous also if the U(1)_A symmetry is effectively restored at Tc. However, the corresponding universality class differs from the O(4) vector universality class which would describe a continuous transition in the presence of a substantial U(1)_A symmetry breaking at Tc. We estimate the critical exponents of the U(2)_L X U(2)_R -> U(2)_V universality class by computing and analyzing their high-order perturbative expansions. These results are important to discriminate among the different scenarios for the scaling behavior of QCD with two light flavors close to the chiral transition.
