Authors: Yi Ling and Chao Niu and Jian-Pin Wu and Zhuo-Yu Xian
Abstract: We construct an ionic lattice background in the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory in four dimensional space time. The optical conductivity of the dual field theory on the boundary is investigated. Due to the lattice effects, we find the imaginary part of the conductivity is manifestly suppressed in the zero frequency limit, while the DC conductivity approaches a finite value such that the previous delta function reflecting the translation symmetry is absent. Such a behavior can be exactly fit by the Drude law at low frequency. Moreover, we find that the modulus of the optical conductivity exhibits a power-law behavior at intermediate frequency regime. Our results provides further support for the universality of such power-law behavior recently disclosed in Einstein-Maxwell theory by Horowitz, Santos and Tong.
