Abstract: In the large 't Hooft coupling limit, the hadronic size of baryon is small and nucleon-nucleon potential is obtained from massless pseudo-scalar exchanges and an infinite tower of spin one mesons exchanges. In this paper we use the holographic nucleon-nucleon interaction and obtain the corresponding potential and binding energy for deuteron and tritium nuclei. The obtained potentials are repulsive at short distances and clearly become zero by increasing distance as we expected.
