Title: Recent developments in transport phenomena in Weyl semimetals
Authors: Pavan Hosur and Xiaoliang Qi
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed great advancements in the science and engineering of systems with unconventional band structures, seeded by studies of graphene and topological insulators. While the band structure of graphene simulates massless relativistic electrons in two dimensions, topological insulators have bands that wind non-trivially over momentum space in a certain abstract sense. Over the last couple of years, enthusiasm has been burgeoning in another unconventional and topological (although, not quite in the same sense as topological insulators) phase -- the Weyl Semimetal. In this phase, electrons mimic Weyl fermions that are well-known in high-energy physics, and inherit many of their properties, including an apparent violation of charge conservation known as the Chiral Anomaly. In this review, we recap some of the unusual transport properties of Weyl semimetals discussed in the literature so far, focusing on signatures whose roots lie in the anomaly. We also mention several proposed realizations of this phase in condensed matter systems, since they were what arguably precipitated activity on Weyl semimetals in the first place.
