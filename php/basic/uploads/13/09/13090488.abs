Title: A Holographic Model of Two-Band Superconductor
Authors: Wen-Yu Wen and Mu-Sheng Wu and Shang-Yu Wu
Abstract: We construct a holographic two-band superconductor model with interband Josephson coupling. We investigate the effects the Josephson coupling has on the superconducting condensates and the critical temperature for their formation numerically, as well as analytically where possible. We calculate the AC conductivity and find it qualitatively similar to the single band superconductor. We investigate the nodal structure of our holographic two-band superconductor from the low temperature behavior of the thermal conductivity and find it nodeless.
