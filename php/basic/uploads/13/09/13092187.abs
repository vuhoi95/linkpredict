Title: Theory of intersecting loops on a torus
Authors: J. E. Nelson and R. F. Picken
Abstract: We continue our investigation into intersections of closed paths on a torus, to further our understanding of the commutator algebra of Wilson loop observables in 2+1 quantum gravity, when the cosmological constant is negative. We give a concise review of previous results, e.g. that signed area phases relate observables assigned to homotopic loops, and present new developments in this theory of intersecting loops on a torus. We state precise rules to be applied at intersections of both straight and crooked/rerouted paths in the covering space $\mathbb{R}^2$. Two concrete examples of combinations of different rules are presented.
