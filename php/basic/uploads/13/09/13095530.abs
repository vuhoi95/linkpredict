Title: Quantum Pfaffians and Hyper-Pfaffians
Authors: Naihuan Jing and Jian Zhang
Abstract: The concept of the quantum Pfaffian is rigorously examined and refurbished using the new method of quantum exterior algebras. We derive a complete family of Pl\"ucker relations for the quantum linear transformations, and then use them to give an optimal set of relations required for the quantum Pfaffian. We then give the formula between the quantum determinant and the quantum Pfaffian and prove that any quantum determinant can be expressed as a quantum Pfaffian. Finally the quantum hyper-Pfaffian is introduced, and we prove a similar result of expressing quantum determinants in terms of quantum hyper-Pfaffians at modular cases.
