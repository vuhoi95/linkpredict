Title: An integrable deformation of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring action
Authors: Francois Delduc and Marc Magro and Benoit Vicedo
Abstract: An integrable deformation of the type IIB AdS_5 x S^5 superstring action is presented. The deformed field equations, Lax connection, and kappa-symmetry transformations are given. The original psu(2,2|4) symmetry is expected to become q-deformed.
