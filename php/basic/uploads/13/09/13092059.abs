Title: Quantum Field Theory Analysis of Polarizations Correlations,  Entanglement and Bell's Inequality: Explicit Processes
Authors: N. Yongram and E. B. Manoukian
Abstract: This paper provides explicit and detailed quantum field theory (QFT) computations of polarizations correlations of emerging particles in several processes in QED, Electroweak Theory, and even in particle productions from strings, and hence are based on dynamical theries. The novel properties observed in the computations of such polarizations correlations, as predicted by QFT, is that they depend on the speed of the colliding particles, and, in some cases, even on coupling parameters ratios as well as on mass ratios of the underlying theory. These investigations clearly show that arguments based simply on combining spins to generate probabilities of such polarization correlations are not reliable. The novel properties obtained, with details of derivations provided here, hopefully would call for experiments on polarizations correlations which would monitor speeds of colliding particles, and, would, in turn, lead to new tests of the fundamental interactions of QFT such as of QED and of the Electroweak Theory.
