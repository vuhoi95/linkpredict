Title: Hidden Kerr/CFT at finite frequencies
Authors: David A. Lowe and Ilies Messamah and Antun Skanata
Abstract: Massless fields propagating in a generic Kerr black hole background enjoy a hidden SL(2,R)xSL(2,R) symmetry. We determine how the exact mode functions decompose into representations of this symmetry group. This extends earlier results on the low frequency limit of the massless scalar case to finite frequencies and general spin. As an application, we numerically determine the parameters of the representations that appear in quasinormal modes. These results represent a first step to formulating a more precise mapping to a holographic dual conformal field theory for generic black holes.
