Abstract: We conjecture that the level k U(N) Chern-Simons theory coupled to free anticommuting scalar matter in the fundamental is dual to non-minmal higher-spin Vasiliev gravity in dS4 with parity-violating phase \theta0 = \pi N/2k and Neumann boundary conditions for the scalar. Related conjectures are made for fundamental commuting spinor matter and critical theories. This generalizes a recent conjecture relating the minimal Type A Vasiliev theory in dS4 to the Sp(N) model with fundamental real anti-commuting scalars.
