Abstract: Gauge bosons associated to new gauge symmetries under which the standard model particles are not charged are predicted in many extensions of the standard model of particles and interactions. We show that under very general conditions, the average energy-momentum tensor of these rapidly oscillating vector fields is isotropic for any locally inertial observer. This result has a fundamental importance in order to consider coherent vector fields as a viable alternative to support models of dark matter, dark energy or inflation.
