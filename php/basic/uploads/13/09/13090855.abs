Title: Auxiliary fields in open gauge theories
Authors: N. Djeghloul and A. Meziane and M. Tahiri
Abstract: We show that for open gauge theories, it is possible to build an off-shell Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) algebra together with an invariant extension of the classical action. This is based on the introduction of auxiliary fields, after having defined an on-shell invariant quantum action, where the gauge-fixing action is written as in Yang-Mills type theories up to a modified BRST operator. An application to simple supergravity is performed.
