Title: On Resolutions of Cosmological Singularities in Higher-Spin Gravity
Authors: Benjamin Burrington and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Nicholas Rombes
Abstract: We study the resolution of certain cosmological singularity in the context of higher-spin three-dimensional gravity. We consider gravity coupled to a spin-3 field realized as Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $SL(3,\mathbb{C})$. In this context we elaborate and extend a singularity resolution scheme proposed by Krishnan and Roy. We discuss the resolution of a big-bang singularity in the case of gravity coupled to a spin-4 field realized as Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $SL(4,\mathbb{C})$. In all these cases we show the existence of gauge transformations that do not change the holonomy of the Chern-Simons gauge potential and lead to metrics without the initial singularity. We argue that such transformations always exist in the context of gravity coupled to a spin-N field when described by Chern-Simons with gauge group $SL(N,\mathbb{C})$.
