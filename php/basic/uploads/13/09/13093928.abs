Abstract: We propose a CPT-even and Lorentz-violating dimension-five nonminimal coupling between fermionic and gauge fields, involving the CPT-even and Lorentz-violating gauge tensor of the Standard-Model Extension. This nonminimal coupling modifies the nonrelativistic regime of Dirac particles, inducing new effects such as an electric-Zeeman-like spectrum splitting and an anomalous-like contribution to the electron magnetic moment. These new effects allow to constrain the magnitude of this nonminimal coupling in 1 part in $10^{16}.$
