Title: Probing renormalization group flows using entanglement entropy
Authors: Hong Liu and MÃ¡rk Mezei
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of renormalized entanglement entropy introduced in [1]. In particular, we investigate its behavior near an IR fixed point using holographic duality. We develop techniques which, for any static holographic geometry, enable us to extract the large radius expansion of the entanglement entropy for a spherical region. We show that for both a sphere and a strip, the approach of the renormalized entanglement entropy to the IR fixed point value contains a contribution that depends on the whole RG trajectory. Such a contribution is dominant, when the leading irrelevant operator is sufficiently irrelevant. For a spherical region such terms can be anticipated from a geometric expansion, while for a strip whether these terms have geometric origins remains to be seen.
