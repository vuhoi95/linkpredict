Title: Electrostatic Interaction due to Patch Potentials on Smooth Conducting  Surfaces
Authors: C. D. Fosco and F. C. Lombardo and F. D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We evaluate the electrostatic interaction energy between two surfaces, one flat and the other slightly curved, in terms of the two-point autocorrelation functions for patch potentials on each one of them, and of a single function $\psi$ which defines the curved surface. The resulting interaction energy, a functional of $\psi$, is evaluated up to the second order in a derivative expansion approach. We derive explicit formulae for the coefficients of that expansion as simple integrals involving the autocorrelation functions, and evaluate them for some relevant patch-potential profiles and geometries
