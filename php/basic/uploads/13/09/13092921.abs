Title: On Scale and Conformal Invariance in Four Dimensions
Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Zohar Komargodski and Adam Schwimmer and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We study the implications of scale invariance in four-dimensional quantum field theories. Imposing unitarity, we find that infinitely many matrix elements vanish in a suitable kinematical configuration. This vanishing is a nontrivial necessary condition for conformality. We provide an argument why this is expected to be a sufficient condition as well, thereby linking scale and conformal invariance in unitary theories. We also discuss possible exceptions to our argument.
