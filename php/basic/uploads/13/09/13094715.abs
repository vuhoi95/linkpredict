Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking: To Probe Anisotropy and Magnetic Field in QGP
Authors: Mohammad Ali-Akbari and Hajar Ebrahim
Abstract: We discuss the (spontaneous) chiral symmetry breaking in a strongly coupled anisotropic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in the presence of the magnetic field, using holography. The physical quantities related to the chiral symmetry breaking (m;B_c) distinguish between the effects of the anisotropy and magnetic field on the plasma. Anisotropy affects the system similar to the temperature and for its larger values heavier quarks can live in the QGP without getting condensed. Raising the anisotropy in the system will also increase the value of the critical magnetic field, B_c, at which the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking happens. Both of these growths are even more when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the anisotropy direction. Such behaviour persists in the high temperature limit where the temperature is kept fixed. However, when the entropy density is held fixed, as one increases the anisotropy, lighter mesons melt when the magnetic field is applied along the anisotropy direction, in contrast to when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the anisotropy direction.
