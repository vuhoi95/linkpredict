Title: Baryon as dyonic instanton-II. Baryon mass versus chiral condensate
Authors: A. Gorsky and P. N. Kopnin and A. Krikun
Abstract: We discuss the description of baryon as the dyonic instanton in holographic QCD. The solution generalizes the Skyrmion taking into account the infinite tower of vector and axial mesons as well as the chiral condensate. We construct the solution with unit baryon charge and study the dependence of its mass on the chiral condensate. The elegant explanation of the Ioffe's formula has been found and we speculate on the relation between physical scales of the chiral and conformal symmetry breaking.
