Title: Higher order non-linear parameters with PLANCK
Authors: Jinn-Ouk Gong and Tomo Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate how higher order non-linear parameters affect lower order ones through loop effects. We calculate the loop corrections up to two-loops and explicitly show that the tree contribution is stable against loop terms in most cases. We argue that, nevertheless, observational constraints on non-linear parameters such as fNL and tauNL can also give a limit even for higher order ones due to the loop contribution. We discuss these issues both for single-source and multi-source cases.
