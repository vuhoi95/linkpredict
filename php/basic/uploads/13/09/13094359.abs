Title: Jet quenching in a strongly interacting plasma - A lattice approach
Authors: Marco Panero and Kari Rummukainen and Andreas Sch√§fer
Abstract: The phenomenon of jet quenching, related to the momentum broadening of a high-energy parton, provides important experimental evidence for the production of a strongly coupled, deconfined medium in heavy-ion collisions. Its theoretical description has been addressed in a number of works, both perturbatively and non-perturbatively (using the gauge-gravity duality). In this contribution, following a proposal by Caron-Huot, we discuss a novel approach to this problem, enabling one to extract non-perturbative information on this real-time phenomenon from simulations on a Euclidean lattice.
