Abstract: It was argued in a number of papers that the gravitational potential calculated by using the modified QFT that follows from the Planck-length deformed uncertainty relation implies the existence of black-hole remnants of the order of the Planck-mass. Usually this sort of QFTs are endowed with two specific features, the modified dispersion relation, which is universal, and the concept of minimum length, which, however, is not universal. While the emergence of the minimum-length most readily leads to the idea of the black hole remnants, here we examine the behaviour of the potential that follows from the Planck-length deformed QFT in absence of the minimum length and show that it might also lead to the formation of the Planck mass black holes in some particular cases. The calculations are made for higher-dimensional case as well. Such black hole remnants might be considered as a possible candidates for the dark-matter.
