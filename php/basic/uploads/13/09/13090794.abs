Title: Comments on holographic current algebras and asymptotically flat four  dimensional spacetimes at null infinity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and CÃ©dric Troessaert
Abstract: We follow the spirit of a recent proposal to show that previous computations for asymptotically flat spacetimes in four dimensions at null infinity can be re-interpreted in terms of a well-defined holographic current algebra for the time component of the currents. The analysis is completed by the current algebra for the spatial components.
