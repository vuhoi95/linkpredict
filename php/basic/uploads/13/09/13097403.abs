Abstract: Based on the connection between Tsallis nonextensive statistics and fractional dimensional space, in this work we have introduced, with the aid of Verlinde's formalism, the Newton constant in a fractal space as a function of the nonextensive constant. With this result we have constructed a curve that shows the direct relation between Tsallis nonextensive parameter and the dimension of this fractal space. We have demonstrated precisely that there are ambiguities between the results due to Verlinde's approach and the ones due to fractional calculus formalism. We have shown precisely that these ambiguities appear only for spaces with dimensions different from three. Hence, we believe that this is a result in favor of our three dimensional world.
