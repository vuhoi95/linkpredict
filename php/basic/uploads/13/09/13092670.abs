Title: Quantum-to-classical transition of primordial cosmological perturbations  in de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory: the bouncing scenario
Authors: N. Pinto-Neto and G. B. Santos and W. Struyve
Abstract: In a previous work we have exhibited a clear description of the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological quantum fluctuations in the inflationary scenario using the de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory. These fluctuations are believed to seed the small inhomogeneities, which are then responsible for the formation of large scale structures. In this work we show that using the de Broglie-Bohm theory it is also possible to describe the quantum-to-classical transition of primordial perturbations which takes place around a bouncing phase, even if the latter is caused by quantum effects due to the quantization of the background geometry.
