Title: Instabilities near the QCD phase transition in the holographic models
Authors: Umut Gursoy and Shu Lin and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: The paper discusses phenomena close to the critical QCD temperature, using the holographic model. One issue studied is the overcooled high-T phase, in which we calculate quasi normal sound modes. We do not find instabilities associated with other first order phase transitions, but nevertheless observe drastic changes in sound propagation/dissipation. The rest of the paper considers a cluster of the high-T phase in the UV in coexistence with the low-T phase, in a simplified ansatz in which the wall separating them is positioned only in the holographic coordinate. This allows to find the force on the wall and classical motion of the cluster. When classical motion is forbidden, we evaluate tunneling probability through the remaining barrier.
