Abstract: We consider a quantum scalar field with {\lambda}{\phi}^4 interaction in curved spacetimes. The quantum effects are taken into account nonperturbatively using the Hartree approximation to the 2PI effective action. Although this approximation has been considered in many previous works, we reconsider it using a consistent nonperturbative renormalization procedure, which we extend to general curved spacetimes. We obtain the renormalized equations for the mean field and for the propagator of the fluctuations, showing explicitly their independence on the arbitrary scale introduced by the regularization scheme. We apply our results to the particular case of de Sitter spacetime and discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking. The results depend strongly on the renormalization procedure.
