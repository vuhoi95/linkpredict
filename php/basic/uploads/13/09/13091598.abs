Title: 2D fuzzy Anti-de Sitter space from matrix models
Authors: Danijel Jurman and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We study the fuzzy hyperboloids AdS^2 and dS^2 as brane solutions in matrix models. The unitary representations of SO(2,1) required for quantum field theory are identified, and explicit formulae for their realization in terms of fuzzy wavefunctions are given. In a second part, we study the (A)dS^2 brane geometry and its dynamics, as governed by a suitable matrix model. In particular, we show that trace of the energy-momentum tensor of matter induces transversal perturbations of the brane and of the Ricci scalar. This leads to a linearized form of Henneaux-Teitelboim-type gravity, illustrating the mechanism of emergent gravity in matrix models.
