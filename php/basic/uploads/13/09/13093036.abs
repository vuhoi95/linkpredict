Authors: Kentaro Hori and Chan Y. Park and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We consider the low-energy limit of the two-dimensional theory on k M2-branes suspended between a straight M5-brane and a curved M5-brane. We argue that it is described by an N=(2,2) supersymmetric gauge theory with no matter fields but with a non-trivial twisted superpotential, and also by an N=(2,2) supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg model, such that the (twisted) superpotentials are determined by the shape of the M5-branes. We find particular cases realize Kazama-Suzuki models. Evidence is provided by the study of ground states, chiral rings, BPS spectra and S^2 partition functions of the systems.
