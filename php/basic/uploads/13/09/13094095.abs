Title: Scale Invariance plus Unitarity Implies Conformal Invariance in Four  Dimensions

Abstract: We give a non-perturbative proof that any 4D unitary and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a conserved scale current is in fact conformally invariant. We show that any scale invariant theory (unitary or not) must have either a vanishing anomaly for global scale transformations or an operator of spin 2 and dimension 2. Neither of these possibilities is allowed for unitary theories, proving the result. This is also a strong constraint on non-unitary Euclidean theories with scale but not conformal invariance, suggesting the conjecture that all such theories are free field theories.
