Title: Yang-Baxter operators and scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N} = 4$  super-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: D. Chicherin and S. Derkachov and R. Kirschner
Abstract: Yangian symmetry of amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory is formulated in terms of eigenvalue relations for monodromy matrix operators. The Quantum Inverse Scattering Method provides the appropriate tools to treat the extended symmetry and to recover as its consequences many known features like cyclic and inversion symmetry, BCFW recursion, Inverse Soft Limit construction, Grassmannian integral representation, $\mathrm{R}$-invariants and on-shell diagram approach.
