Title: Gauss-Bonnet correction to Holographic thermalization: two-point  functions, circular Wilson loops and entanglement entropy
Authors: Yong-Zhuang Li and Shao-Feng Wu and Guo-Hong Yang
Abstract: We study the thermalization of a class of 4-dimensional strongly coupled theories dual to a 5-dimensional AdS-Vaidya spacetime with Gauss-Bonnet curvature corrections. We probe the thermalization using the two-point functions, the expectation values of circular Wilson loops and entanglement entropy. When boundary separation is small, we observe that the thermalization times of these observables have the weak dependence on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha $. In addition, the growth rate of entanglement entropy density is nearly volume-independent. We also show that a new kind of swallow-tail behavior may exhibit in the thermalization of the two-point function when $\alpha $ is negative and $\ell$ is large enough. At large negative $\alpha $ ($\alpha \lesssim -0.1$) the relationship between the critical thermalization time of entanglement entropy and the boundary separation encounters certain \textquotedblleft phase transition\textquotedblright .
