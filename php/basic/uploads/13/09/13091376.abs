Title: Effect of spin rotation coupling on spin transport
Authors: Debashree Chowdhury and B. Basu
Abstract: We have studied the spin rotation coupling(SRC) as an ingredient to explain different spin related issues. This special kind of coupling can play the role of a Dresselhaus like coupling in certain conditions. Consequently, one can control the spin splitting, induced by the Dresselhaus like term, which is unusual in semiconductor heterostucture. Within this framework, we also study the renormalization of the spin dependent electric field and spin current due to the $\vec{k} . \vec{p}$ perturbation, by taking into account the interband mixing in the rotating system. In this paper we predict the enhancement of the spin dependent electric field resulting from the renormalized spin rotation coupling. The renormalization factor of the spin electric field is different from that of the SRC or Zeeman coupling. The effect of renormalized SRC on spin current and Berry curvature is also studied. Interestingly, in presence of this SRC induced SOC it is possible to describe spin splitting as well as spin galvanic effect in semiconductors.
