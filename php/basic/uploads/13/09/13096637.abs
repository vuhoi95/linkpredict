Title: The number of cosmic string loops
Authors: Jose J. Blanco-Pillado and Ken D. Olum and Benjamin Shlaer
Abstract: Using recent simulation results, we provide the mass and speed spectrum of cosmic string loops. This is the quantity of primary interest for many phenomenological signatures of cosmic strings, and it can be accurately predicted using recently acquired detailed knowledge of the loop production function. We emphasize that gravitational smoothing of long strings does not play any role in determining the total number of existing loops. We derive a bound on the string tension imposed by recent constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background from pulsar timing arrays, finding $G\mu \leq 2.8\times 10^{-9}$. We also provide a derivation of the Boltzmann equation for cosmic string loops in the language of differential forms.
