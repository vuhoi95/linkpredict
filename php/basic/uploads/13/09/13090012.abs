Title: Temporal Chiral Spiral in Strong Magnetic Fields
Authors: Tomoya Hayata and Yoshimasa Hidaka and Arata Yamamoto
Abstract: Vacuum properties of quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic and finite electric fields are investigated. We show that when a uniform electric field is instantaneously applied in the parallel direction to a strong magnetic field, it induces temporal oscillation of the chiral and pion condensates. This is a temporal analog to the chiral spiral. The oscillation originates with the propagation of the collective mode, which is protected by the axial anomaly and thus nondissipative.
