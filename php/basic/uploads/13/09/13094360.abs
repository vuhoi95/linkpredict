Abstract: We have considered the localization of resonant bosonic states described by a scalar field $\Phi$ trapped in tube-like topological defects. The tubes are formed by radial symmetric defects in $(2,1)$ dimensions, constructed with two scalar fields $\phi$ and $\chi$, and embedded in the $(3,1)-$dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The general coupling between the topological defect and the scalar field $\Phi$ is given by the potential $\eta F(\phi,\chi)\Phi^2$. After a convenient decomposition of the field $\Phi$, we find that the amplitudes of the radial modes satisfy Schr\"odinger-like equations whose eigenvalues are the masses of the bosonic resonances. Specifically, we have analyzed two simple couplings: the first one is $F(\phi,\chi)=\chi^2$ for a fourth-order potential and, the second one is a sixth-order interaction characterized by $F(\phi,\chi)=(\phi\chi)^2$% . In both cases the Schr\"odinger-like equations are numerically solved with appropriated boundary conditions. Several resonance peaks for both models are obtained and the numerical analysis showed that the fourth-order potential generates more resonances than the sixth-order one.
