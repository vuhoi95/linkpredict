Title: Quantum ordering for quantum geodesic functions of orbifold Riemann  surfaces
Authors: Leonid Chekhov and Marta Mazzocco
Abstract: We determine the explicit quantum ordering for a special class of quantum geodesic functions corresponding to geodesics joining exactly two orbifold points or holes on a non-compact Riemann surface. We discuss some special cases in which these quantum geodesic functions form sub--algebras of some abstract algebras defined by the reflection equation and we extend our results to the quantisation of matrix elements of the Fuchsian group associated to the Riemann surface in Poincar\'e uniformization. In particular we explore an interesting relation between the deformed $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the Zhedanov algebra AW(3).
