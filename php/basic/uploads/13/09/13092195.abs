Title: A new pentagon identity for the tetrahedron index
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Hjalmar Rosengren
Abstract: Recently Kashaev, Luo and Vartanov, using the reduction from a four-dimensional superconformal index to a three-dimensional partition function, found a pentagon identity for a special combination of hyperbolic Gamma functions. Following their idea we have obtained a new pentagon identity for a certain combination of so-called tetrahedron indices arising from the equality of superconformal indices of dual three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories and give a mathematical proof of it.
