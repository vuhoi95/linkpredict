Title: AdS braneworld with Backreaction
Authors: Neven Bilic and Gary B. Tupper
Abstract: We review the tachyon model derived from the dynamics of a 3-brane moving in the AdS5 bulk. The bulk geometry is based on the Randall-Sundrum II model extended to include the radion. The effective tachyon Lagrangian is modified due to the back-reaction of the brane on the bulk geometry.
