Title: Attractor Solutions in Scalar-Field Cosmology
Authors: Grant N. Remmen and Sean M. Carroll
Abstract: Models of cosmological scalar fields often feature "attractor solutions" to which the system evolves for a wide range of initial conditions. There is some tension between this well-known fact and another well-known fact: Liouville's theorem forbids true attractor behavior in a Hamiltonian system. In universes with vanishing spatial curvature, the field variables (\phi,\dot\phi) specify the system completely, defining an effective phase space. We investigate whether one can define a unique conserved measure on this effective phase space, showing that it exists for m^2\phi^2 potentials and deriving conditions for its existence in more general theories. We show that apparent attractors are places where this conserved measure diverges in the (\phi,\dot\phi) variables and suggest a physical understanding of attractor behavior that is compatible with Liouville's theorem.
