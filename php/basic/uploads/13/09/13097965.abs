Title: Ramond singular vectors and Jack superpolynomials
Authors: L. Alarie-Vezina and P. Desrosiers and P. Mathieu
Abstract: The explicit formula for the superconformal singular vectors in the Neveu-Schwarz sector has been obtained recently, via its symmetric polynomial representation, as a sum of Jack superpolynomials. Here we present the analogous, but slightly more complicated, closed-form expression for the Ramond singular vectors.
