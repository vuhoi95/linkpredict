Title: On Nonrelativistic Diffeomorphism Invariance
Authors: Oleg Andreev and Michael Haack and Stefan Hofmann
Abstract: We study certain aspects of the recently proposed notion of nonrelativistic diffeomorphism invariance. In particular, we consider specific examples of invariant actions, extended gauge symmetry as well as an application to the theory of quantum Hall effect. We also discuss an alternative approach based on Horava-Lifshitz gravity.
