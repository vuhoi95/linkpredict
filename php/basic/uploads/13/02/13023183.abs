Title: Lattice BRST without Neuberger 0/0 problem
Authors: Lorenz von Smekal and Manon Bischoff
Abstract: We illustrate in a simple toy model how the methods of SUSY quantum mechanics and topological quantum field theory can be used for covariant gauge-fixing with unbroken BRST symmetry on a finite lattice.
