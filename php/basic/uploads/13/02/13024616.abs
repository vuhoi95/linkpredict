Title: Uniqueness of extreme horizons in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Carmen Li and James Lucietti
Abstract: We consider stationary extreme black hole solutions to the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions, allowing for a negative cosmological constant. We prove that any axisymmetric black hole of this kind possesses a near-horizon AdS(2) symmetry and deduce its near-horizon geometry must be that of the abelian embedded extreme Kerr-Newman (AdS) black hole. We also show that the near-horizon geometry of any static black hole is a direct product of AdS(2) and a constant curvature space.
