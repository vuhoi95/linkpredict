Title: Constitutive relations and Schroedinger's formulation of nonlinear  electromagnetic theories
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Sergio Ferrara
Abstract: We present a systematic study of nonlinear and higher derivatives extensions of electromagnetism. We clarify when action functionals S[F] can be explicitly obtained from arbitrary (not necessarily self-dual) nonlinear equations of motion. We show that the "Deformed twisted self-duality condition" proposal originated in the context of supergravity counterterms is actually the general framework needed to discuss self-dual theories starting from a variational principle. We generalize to nonlinear and higher derivatives theories Schroedinger formulation of Born-Infeld theory, and for the latter, and more in general for nonlinear theories, we derive a closed form expression of the corresponding deformed twisted self-duality conditions. This implies that the hypergeometric expression entering these duality conditions and leading to Born-Infeld theory satisfies a hidden quartic equation.
