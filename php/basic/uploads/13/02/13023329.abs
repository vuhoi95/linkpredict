Title: Least-action principle and path-integral for classical mechanics
Authors: E. Cattaruzza and E. Gozzi and A. Francisco Neto
Abstract: In this paper we show how the equations of motion of a superfield, which makes its appearance in a path-integral approach to classical mechanics, can be derived without the need of the least-action principle
