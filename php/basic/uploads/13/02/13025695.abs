Title: Quantum matter in quantum space-time
Authors: Martin Bojowald and Golam Mortuza Hossain and Mikhail Kagan and Casey Tomlin
Abstract: Quantum matter in quantum space-time is discussed using general properties of energy-conservation laws. As a rather radical conclusion, it is found that standard methods of differential geometry and quantum field theory on curved space-time are inapplicable in canonical quantum gravity, even at the level of effective equations.
