Title: Scattering Amplitudes of Massive N=2 Gauge Theories in Three Dimensions
Authors: Abhishek Agarwal and Arthur E. Lipstein and Donovan Young
Abstract: We study the scattering amplitudes of mass-deformed Chern-Simons theories and Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories with N=2 supersymmetry in three dimensions. In particular, we derive the on-shell supersymmetry algebras which underlie the scattering matrices of these theories. We then compute various 3 and 4-point on-shell tree-level amplitudes in these theories. For the mass-deformed Chern-Simons theory, odd-point amplitudes vanish and we find that all of the 4-point amplitudes can be encoded elegantly in superamplitudes. For the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, we obtain all of the 4-point tree-level amplitudes using a combination of perturbative techniques and algebraic constraints and we comment on difficulties related to computing amplitudes with external gauge fields using Feynman diagrams. Finally, we propose a BCFW recursion relation for mass-deformed theories in three dimensions and discuss the applicability of this proposal to mass-deformed N=2 theories.
