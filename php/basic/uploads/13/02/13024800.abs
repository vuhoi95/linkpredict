Title: Redundancies in Nambu-Goldstone Bosons
Authors: Haruki Watanabe and Hitoshi Murayama
Abstract: We propose a simple criterion to identify when Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) for different symmetries are redundant. It solves an old mystery why crystals have phonons for spontaneously broken translations but no gapless excitations for equally spontaneously broken rotations. Similarly for a superfluid, the NGB for spontaneously broken Galilean symmetry is redundant with phonons. The most nontrivial example is Tkachenko mode for a vortex lattice in a superfluid, where phonons are redundant to the Tkachenko mode which is identified as the Boboliubov mode.
