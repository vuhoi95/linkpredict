Title: On the power spectrum generated during inflation
Authors: Mar Bastero-Gil and Arjun Berera and Namit Mahajan and Raghavan Rangarajan
Abstract: Recently there have been differing viewpoints on how to evaluate the curvature power spectrum generated during inflation. Since the primordial curvature power spectrum is the seed for structure formation and provides a link between observations and inflationary parameters, it is important to resolve any disagreements over the expression for the power spectrum. In this article we discuss these differing viewpoints and indicate issues that are relevant to both approaches. We then argue why the standard expression is valid.
