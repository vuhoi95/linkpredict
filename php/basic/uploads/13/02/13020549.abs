Title: Restricted Galileons
Authors: Lasha Berezhiani and Giga Chkareuli and Gregory Gabadadze
Abstract: We study Galileon theories that emerge in ghost-free massive gravity. In particular, we focus on a sub-class of these theories where the Galileons can be completely decoupled from the tensor Lagrangian. These Galileons differ from generic ones -- they have interrelated coefficients of the cubic and quartic terms, and most importantly, a non-standard coupling to external stress-tensors, governed by the same coefficient. We show that this theory has no static stable spherically symmetric solutions that would interpolate from the Vainshtein region to flat space; these two regions cannot be smoothly matched for the sign of the coefficient for which fluctuations are stable. Instead, for this sign choice, a solution in the Vainshtein domain is matched onto a cosmological background. Small fluctuations above this solution are stable, and sub-luminal. We discuss observational constraints on this theory, within the quantum effective Lagrangian approach, and argue that having a graviton mass of the order of the present-day Hubble parameter, is consistent with the data. Last but not least, we also present a general class of cosmological solutions in this theory, some of which exhibit the de-mixing phenomenon, previously found for the self-accelerated solution.
