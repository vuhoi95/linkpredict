Title: Squeezed primordial bispectrum from general vacuum state
Authors: Jinn-Ouk Gong and Misao Sasaki
Abstract: We study the general relation between the power spectrum and the squeezed limit of the bispectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation produced during single-field slow-roll inflation when the initial state is a general vacuum. Assuming the scale invariance of the power spectrum, we derive a formula for the squeezed limit of the bispectrum, represented by the parameter fNL, which is not slow-roll suppressed and is found to contain a single free parameter for a given amplitude of the power spectrum. Then we derive the conditions for achieving a scale-invariant fNL, and discuss a few examples.
