Abstract: Cosmological perturbations due to statistical thermal fluctuations in a single fluid characterized by an arbitrary equation of state are computed. Formulas to predict the scalar and tensor perturbation spectra and nongaussianity parameters at a given temperature are derived. These results are relevant to any cosmological scenario where cosmic structures may have been seeded thermally instead of originating purely from quantum vacuum fluctuations.
