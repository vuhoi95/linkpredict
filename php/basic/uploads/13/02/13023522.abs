Title: Fermion Self Energy Correction in Light-Front QED using Coherent State  Basis
Authors: Jai D. More and Anuradha Misra
Abstract: We discuss IR divergences in lepton mass renormalization in Light-Front Quantum Electrodynamics (LFQED) in Feynman gauge. We consider LFQED with Pauli-Villars fields and using old-fashioned time ordered perturbation theory (TOPT), we show that our earlier result regarding cancellation of true IR divergences upto $O(e^4)$ in coherent state basis holds in Feynman gauge also.
