Title: Supersymmetric Boundary Conditions in Three Dimensional N = 2 Theories
Authors: Tadashi Okazaki and Satoshi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We study supersymmetric boundary conditions in 3-dimensional N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg models and abelian gauge theories. In the Landau-Ginzburg model the boundary conditions that preserve (1,1) supersymmetry (A-type) and (2,0) supersymmetry (B-type) on the boundary are classified in terms of subspaces of the target space ("brane"). An A-type brane is a Lagrangian submanifold on which the imaginary part of the superpotential is constant, while a B-type brane is a holomorphic submanifold on which the superpotential is constant. We also consider the N = 2 Maxwell theory with boundary and the abelian duality. Finally we make some comments on N = 2 SQED with boundary condition and the mirror symmetry.
