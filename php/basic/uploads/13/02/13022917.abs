Title: Critical Exponents for Supercooled Liquids
Authors: Ethan Dyer and Jaehoon Lee and Sho Yaida
Abstract: We compute critical exponents governing universal features of supercooled liquids through the effective theory of an overlap field. The correlation length diverges with the Ising exponent; the size of dynamically heterogeneous patches grows more rapidly; and the relaxation time obeys a generalized Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann relation.
