Title: Generalized variational procedure: An application to non-perturbative  QCD
Authors: Osvaldo Civitarese and Peter Otto Hess and Davis Arturo Amor-Quiroz
Abstract: We present a generalized variational procedure oriented to the algebraic solution of many body Hamiltonians expressed in bosonic and fermionic variables. The method specializes in the non-perturbative regime of the solutions. As an example, we focus on the application of the method to non-perturbative QCD.
