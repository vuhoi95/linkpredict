Title: Scale invariance and superfluid turbulence
Authors: Siddhartha Sen and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We construct a Schroedinger field theory invariant under local spatial scaling. It is shown to provide an effective theory of superfluid turbulence by deriving, analytically, the observed Kolmogorov 5/3 law and to lead to a Biot-Savart interaction between the observed filament excitations of the system as well.
