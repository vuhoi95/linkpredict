Abstract: The fermionic condensate and vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor, for a massive fermionic field on the background of anti-de Sitter spacetime, in the geometry of two parallel boundaries with bag boundary conditions, are investigated. Vacuum expectation values, expressed as series involving the eigenvalues of the radial quantum number, are neatly decomposed into boundary-free, single-boundary-induced, and second-boundary-induced parts, with the help of the generalized Abel-Plana summation formula. In this way, the renormalization procedure is very conveniently reduced to the one corresponding to boundary-free AdS spacetime. The boundary-induced contributions to the fermionic condensate and to the vacuum expectation value of the energy density are proven to be everywhere negative. The vacuum expectation values are exponentially suppressed at distances from the boundaries much larger than the curvature radius of the AdS space. Near the boundaries, effects related with the curvature of the background spacetime are shown to be subdominant and, to leading order, all known results for boundaries in the Minkowski bulk are recovered. Zeta function techniques are successfully used for the evaluation of the total vacuum energy in the region between the boundaries. It is proven that the resulting interaction forces between them are attractive and that, for large separations, they also decay exponentially. Finally, our results are extended and explicitly translated to fermionic Casimir densities in braneworld scenarios of Randall-Sundrum type.
