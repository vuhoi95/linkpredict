Title: Perturbation theory in (2,2) signature
Authors: Stanislav Srednyak and George Sterman
Abstract: We identify a natural analytic continuation in four dimensions from Minkowski signature to a signature with two time-like momentum components. For two, three and four-point diagrams at fixed external momenta, this continuation can be implemented as a countour deformation that leaves dependence on the momenta unchanged. For arbitrary ultraviolet-finite scalar diagrams it is possible to do two integrals per loop in terms of simple poles in the new signature. This results in a representation of any such diagram as a sum of terms, each with two remaining integrals per loop.
