Title: A Complete Model for R-parity Violation
Authors: Csaba Cs√°ki and Ben Heidenreich
Abstract: We present a complete model whose low energy effective theory is the R-parity violating NMSSM with a baryon number violating udd vertex of the MFV SUSY form, leading to prompt LSP decay and evading the ever stronger LHC bounds on low-scale R-parity conserving supersymmetry. MFV flavor structure is enforced by gauging an SU(3) flavor symmetry at high energies. After the flavor group is spontaneously broken, mass mixing between the standard model fields and heavy vector-like quarks and leptons induces hierarchical Yukawa couplings which depend on the mixing angles. The same mechanism generates the udd coupling, explaining its shared structure. A discrete R-symmetry is imposed which forbids all other dangerous lepton and baryon-number violating operators (including Planck-suppressed operators) and simultaneously solves the mu problem. While flavor constraints require the flavor gauge bosons to be outside of the reach of the LHC, the vector-like top partners could lie below 1 TeV.
