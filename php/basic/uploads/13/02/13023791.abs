Title: Rotating fermions
Authors: Victor E. Ambru≈ü and Elizabeth Winstanley
Abstract: We investigate the rigidly rotating quantum thermal distribution of fermions in flat space-time. We find that thermal states diverge on the speed of light surface. We remove the divergences by enclosing the system inside a cylindrical boundary and investigate thermal expectation values and the Casimir effect for two sets of boundary conditions.
