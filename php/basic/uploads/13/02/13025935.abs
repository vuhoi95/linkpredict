Title: Complex Classical Fields and Partial Wick Rotations
Authors: Arthur Jaffe and Christian D. JÃ¤kel and Roberto E. Martinez II
Abstract: We study some examples of complex, classical, scalar fields within the new framework that we introduced in a previous work. In these particular examples, we replace the usual functional integral by a complex functional arising from partial Wick rotation of a quantum field. We generalize the Feynman-Kac relation to this setting, and use it to establish the spectral condition on a cylinder. We also consider positive-temperature states.
