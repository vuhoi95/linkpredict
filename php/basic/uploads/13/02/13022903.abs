Title: Slavnov-Taylor identities, non-commutative gauge theories and infrared  divergences
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Harald Grosse and Jean-Christophe Wallet
Abstract: In this work we clarify some properties of the one-loop IR divergences in non-Abelian gauge field theories on non-commutative 4-dimensional Moyal space. Additionally, we derive the tree-level Slavnov-Taylor identities relating the two, three and four point functions, and verify their consistency with the divergent one-loop level results. We also discuss the special case of two dimensions.
