Title: Quantization of the inhomogeneous Bianchi I model: quasi-Heisenberg  picture
Authors: S. L. Cherkas and V. L. Kalashnikov
Abstract: The quantization scheme is suggested for a spatially inhomogeneous 1+1 Bianchi I model. The scheme consists in quantization of the equations of motion and gives the operator (so-called quasi-Heisenberg) equations describing an explicit evolution of a system. Some particular gauge suitable for quantization is proposed. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation is considered in the vicinity of zero scale factor and it is used to construct a space, where the quasi-Heisenberg operators act. Spatial discretization as a UV regularization procedure is suggested for the equations of motion.
