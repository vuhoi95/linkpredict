Title: CMB Anisotropies by Collapsing Textures
Authors: Kepa Sousa and Jon Urrestilla
Abstract: CMB photons passing through a collapsing texture knot receive an energy shift, creating characteristic cold and hot spots on the sky. We calculate the anisotropy pattern produced by collapsing texture knots of arbitrary shape. The texture dynamics are solved numerically on a Minkowski background.
