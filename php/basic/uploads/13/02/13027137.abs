Title: Unimodular Cosmological Space-times
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Mario Herrero-Valea
Abstract: Some cosmological solutions of the unimodular theory of gravity are studied. These solutions can always be mapped to solutions of Einstein's general relativity in an appropiate frame. Constant scalar potentials however do not gravitate. Some physical consequences are pointed out.
