Title: General black holes, untwisted
Authors: Mirjam Cvetiƒç and Monica Guica and Zain H. Saleem
Abstract: We use solution-generating techniques to construct interpolating geometries between general asymptotically flat, charged, rotating, non-extremal black holes in four and five dimensions and their subtracted geometries. In the four-dimensional case, this is achieved by the use of Harrison transformations, whereas in the five-dimensional case we use STU transformations. We also give the interpretation of these solution-generating transformations in terms of string (pseudo)-dualities, showing that they correspond to combinations of T-dualities and Melvin twists. Upon uplift to one dimension higher, these dualities allow us to "untwist" general black holes to AdS_3 times a sphere.
