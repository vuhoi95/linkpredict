Title: A Comprehensive Model of Dark Energy, Inflation AND Black Holes
Authors: Peter L. Biermann and Benjamin C. Harms
Abstract: We derive two new equations of quantum gravity and combine them with reinterpretations of previously proposed concepts of dark energy, black holes, inflation, the arrow of time and the energy at which rest-mass first manifests itself into a theory which may be a first step toward a comprehensive description of all these phenomena. The resulting theory also predicts new tests which can be experimentally checked within a few years.
