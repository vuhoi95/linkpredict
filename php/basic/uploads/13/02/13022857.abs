Title: From Hypercomplex to Holomorphic Symplectic Structures
Authors: Wei Hong and Mathieu Sti√©non
Abstract: The notions of holomorphic symplectic structures and hypercomplex structures on Courant algebroids are introduced and then proved to be equivalent. These generalize hypercomplex triples and holomorphic symplectic 2-forms on manifolds respectively. Basic properties of such structures are established.
