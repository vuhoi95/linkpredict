Title: The Holography of F-maximization
Authors: Daniel Z. Freedman and Silviu S. Pufu
Abstract: We find new supersymmetric backgrounds of ${\cal N} = 8$ gauged supergravity in four Euclidean dimensions that are dual to deformations of ABJM theory on $S^3$. The deformations encode the most general choice of $U(1)_R$ symmetry used to define the theory on $S^3$. We work within an ${\cal N} = 2$ truncation of the ${\cal N} = 8$ supergravity theory obtained via a group theory argument. We find perfect agreement between the $S^3$ free energy computed from our supergravity backgrounds and the previous field theory computations of the same quantity based on supersymmetric localization and matrix model techniques.
