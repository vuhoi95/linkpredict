Title: Wilson loops in supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter theories and duality
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Brian Willett
Abstract: We study the algebra of BPS Wilson loops in 3d gauge theories with N=2 supersymmetry and Chern-Simons terms. We argue that new relations appear on the quantum level, and that in many cases this makes the algebra finite-dimensional. We use our results to propose the mapping of Wilson loops under Seiberg-like dualities and verify that the proposed map agrees with the exact results for expectation values of circular Wilson loops. In some cases we also relate the algebra of Wilson loops to the equivariant quantum K-ring of certain quasi projective varieties. This generalizes the connection between the Verlinde algebra and the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian found by Witten.
