Title: The spectrum of gravitational waves in an f(R) model with a bounce
Authors: Mariam Bouhmadi-Lopez and Joao Morais and Alfredo B. Henriques
Abstract: We present an inflationary model preceded by a bounce in a metric $f(R)$ theory. In this model, modified gravity affects only the early stages of the universe. We analyse the predicted spectrum of the gravitational waves in this scenario using the method of the Bogoliubov coefficients. We show that there are distinctive (oscillatory) signals on the spectrum for very low frequencies; i.e., corresponding to modes that are currently entering the horizon.
