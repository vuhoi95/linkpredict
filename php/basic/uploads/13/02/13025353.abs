Title: Gauge Models in D Dimensions
Authors: Douglas Moore and Jared Greenwald and Gerald Cleaver
Abstract: Utilizing the Gauge Framework, software under development at Baylor University, we explicitly construct all layer 1 weakly coupled free fermionic heterotic string (WCFFHS) gauge models up to order 32 in four to ten large spacetime dimensions. These gauge models are well suited to large scale systematic surveys and, while they offer little phenomenologically, are useful for understanding the structure of the WCFFHS region of the string landscape. Herein we present the gauge groups statistics for this swath of the landscape for both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models.
