Abstract: Our aim in this work is to study the nonequilibrium behavior of the topological quantum phase transition in the transverse Wen-plaquette model. We show that under the effect of a nonadiabatic driving the system exhibits a new topological phase and a rich phase diagram. We define generalized topological order parameters by considering cycle-averaged expectation values of string operators in a Floquet state
