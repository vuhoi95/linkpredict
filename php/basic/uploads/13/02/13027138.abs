Title: Quantum Harmonic Black Holes
Authors: R. Casadio and A. Orlandi
Abstract: Inspired by the recent conjecture that black holes are condensates of gravitons, we investigate a simple model for the black hole degrees of freedom that is consistent both from the point of view of Quantum mechanics and of General Relativity. Since the two perspectives should "converge" into a unified picture for small, Planck size, objects, we expect our construction is a useful step for understanding the physics of microscopic, quantum black holes. In particular, we show that a harmonically trapped condensate gives rise to two horizons, whereas the extremal case (corresponding to a remnant with vanishing Hawking temperature) naturally falls out of its spectrum.
