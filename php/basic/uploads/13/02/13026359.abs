Title: 2d CDT is 2d Horava-Lifshitz quantum gravity
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Lisa Glaser and Yuki Sato and Yoshiyuki Watabiki
Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a lattice theory where aspects of quantum gravity can be studied. Two-dimensional CDT can be solved analytically and the continuum (quantum) Hamiltonian obtained. In this article we show that this continuum Hamiltonian is the one obtained by quantizing two-dimensional projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity.
