Title: Conformal symmetry superalgebras
Authors: Paul de Medeiros and Stefan Hollands
Abstract: We show how the rigid conformal supersymmetries associated with a certain class of pseudo-Riemannian spin manifolds define a Lie superalgebra. The even part of this superalgebra contains conformal isometries and constant R-symmetries. The odd part is generated by twistor spinors valued in a particular R-symmetry representation. We prove that any manifold which admits a conformal symmetry superalgebra of this type must generically have dimension less than seven. Moreover, in dimensions three, four, five and six, we provide the generic data from which the conformal symmetry superalgebra is prescribed. For conformally flat metrics in these dimensions, and compact R-symmetry, we identify each of the associated conformal symmetry superalgebras with one of the conformal superalgebras classified by Nahm. We also describe several examples for Lorentzian metrics that are not conformally flat.
