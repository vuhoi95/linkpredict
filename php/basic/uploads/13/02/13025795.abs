Abstract: The holographic renormalization group (RG) flows in certain self-dual two dimensional QFT's models are studied. They are constructed as holographic duals to specific New Massive 3d Gravity (NMG) models coupled to scalar matter with "partially self-dual" superpotentials. The standard holographic RG constructions allow us to derive the exact form of their $\beta$- functions in terms of the corresponding NMG's domain walls solutions. By imposing invariance of the free energy, the central function and of the anomalous dimensions under specific matter field's duality transformation, we have found the conditions on the superpotentials of two different NMG's models, such that their dual 2d QFT's are related by a simple strong-weak coupling transformation.
