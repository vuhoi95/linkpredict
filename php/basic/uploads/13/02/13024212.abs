Authors: Fiki T. Akbar and Bobby E. Gunara and Triyanta and Freddy P. Zen
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the local existence of the bosonic part of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions with general couplings. We start with the Lagrangian of the vector and chiral multiplets with general couplings and scalar potential turned on. Then, for the sake of simplicity, we set all fermions vanish at the level of equations of motions, so we only have the bosonic parts of the theory. We apply Segal's general theory to show the local existence of solutions of equations of motions by taking Kahler potential to be bounded above by U(n) symmetric Kahler potential and the first derivative of gauge couplings to be at most linear growth functions.
