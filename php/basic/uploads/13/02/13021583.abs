Title: An Entropy Formula for Higher Spin Black Holes via Conical Singularities
Authors: Per Kraus and Tomonori Ugajin
Abstract: We consider the entropy of higher spin black holes in 2+1 dimensions using the conical singularity approach. By introducing a conical singularity along a non contractible cycle and carefully evaluating its contribution to the Chern Simons action, we derive a simple expression for the entropy of a general stationary higher spin black hole. The resulting formula is shown to satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, and yields agreement with previous results based on integrating the first law.
