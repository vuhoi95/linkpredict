Title: Energy momentum tensor correlators in hot Yang-Mills theory: holography  confronts lattice and perturbation theory
Authors: K. Kajantie and Martin Krssak and Aleksi Vuorinen
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of energy momentum tensor correlators in strongly coupled large-N_c Yang-Mills theory at nonzero temperature, working within the Improved Holographic QCD model. In particular, we determine the spectral functions and corresponding imaginary time correlators in the bulk and shear channels, and compare the results to recent perturbative and lattice calculations where available. For the bulk channel imaginary time correlator, for which all three results exist, lattice data is seen to favor the holographic prediction over the perturbative one over a wide range of temperatures.
