Title: Dynamical Lifshitz-type solutions and aging phenomena
Authors: Kunihito Uzawa and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We consider time-dependent Lifshitz-type solutions in type IIB supergravity. The solutions describe a time evolution from Lifshitz spacetimes to AdS spaces. We argue the holographic relation of them to aging phenomena in condensed matter physics. The solutions have no time-translation invariance and possess the dynamical scaling symmetry with z_c=2. In addition, the time evolution corresponds to slow (nonexponential) dynamics from nonequilibrium states to the equilibrium. We also discuss a mechanism of quantum quench to generate nonequilibrium states.
