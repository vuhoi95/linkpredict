Title: Classical limits of quantum mechanics on a non-commutative configuration  space
Authors: Fabio Benatti and Laure Gouba
Abstract: We consider a model of non-commutative Quantum Mechanics given by two harmonic oscillators over a non-commutative two dimensional configuration space. We study possible ways of removing the non-commutativity based on the classical limit context known as anti-Wick quantization. We show that removal of non-commutativity from the configuration space and from the canonical operators are not commuting operations.
