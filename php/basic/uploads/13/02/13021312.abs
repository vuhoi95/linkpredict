Title: Fixed Functionals in Asymptotically Safe Gravity
Authors: Maximilian Demmel and Frank Saueressig and Omar Zanusso
Abstract: We summarize the status of constructing fixed functionals within the f(R)-truncation of Quantum Einstein Gravity in three spacetime dimensions. Focusing on curvatures much larger than the IR-cutoff scale, it is shown that the fixed point equation admits three different scaling regimes: for classical and quantum dominance the equation becomes linear and has power-law solutions, while the balanced case gives rise to a generalized homogeneous equation whose order is reduced by one and whose solutions are non-analytical.
