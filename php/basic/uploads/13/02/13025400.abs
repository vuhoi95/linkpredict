Title: 3j-symbol for the modular double of SL_q(2,R) revisited
Authors: S. E. Derkachov and L. D. Faddeev
Abstract: Modular double of quantum group SL_q(2,R) with |q|=1 has a series of selfadjoint irreducible representations parameterized by s. Ponsot and Teschner considered a decomposition of the tensor product of two representations into irreducibles. In our paper we give more detailed derivation and some new proofs.
