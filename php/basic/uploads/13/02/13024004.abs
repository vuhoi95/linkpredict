Title: Generalizing the Connes Moscovici Hopf algebra to contain all rooted  trees
Authors: Susama Agarwala and Colleen Delaney
Abstract: This paper defines a generalization of the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra, $\mathcal{H}(1)$ that contains the entire Hopf algebra of rooted trees. A relationship between the former, a much studied object in non-commutative geometry, and the later, a much studied object in perturbative Quantum Field Theory, has been established by Connes and Kreimer. The results of this paper open the door to study the cohomology of the Hopf algebra of rooted trees.
