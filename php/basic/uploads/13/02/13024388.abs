Title: On the geometry of the Batalin-Vilkovisky Laplacian
Authors: Arthemy V. Kiselev and Sietse Ringers
Abstract: We define a jet-space analog of the BV-Laplacian, avoiding delta-functions and infinite constants; instead we show that the main properties of the BV-Laplacian and its relation to the Schouten bracket originate from the underlying jet-space geometry.
