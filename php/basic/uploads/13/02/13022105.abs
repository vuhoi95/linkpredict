Title: An alternative IIB embedding of F(4) gauged supergravity
Authors: Jaehoon Jeong and Özgür Kelekci and Eoin Ó Colgáin
Abstract: Through the construction of a complete non-linear Kaluza-Klein reduction ansatz from type IIB supergravity to Romans' F(4) gauged supergravity, we identify a recently discovered supersymmetric AdS_6 solution as the IIB uplift of the supersymmetric vacuum of Romans' theory. We present new IIB uplifts of a number of known solutions of Romans' theory and comment on supersymmetry in higher-dimensions where it is expected.
