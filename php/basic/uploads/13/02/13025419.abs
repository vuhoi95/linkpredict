Title: Extended geometry and gauged maximal supergravity
Authors: G. Aldazabal and M. Graña and D. Marqués and J. A. Rosabal
Abstract: We consider generalized diffeomorphisms on an extended mega-space associated to the U-duality group of gauged maximal supergravity in four dimensions, E_7. Through the bein for the extended metric we derive dynamical (field-dependent) fluxes taking values in the representations allowed by supersymmetry, and obtain their quadratic constraints from gauge consistency conditions. A covariant generalized Ricci tensor is introduced, defined in terms of a connection for the generalized diffeomorphisms. We show that for any torsionless and metric-compatible generalized connection, the Ricci scalar reproduces the scalar potential of gauged maximal supergravity. We comment on how these results extend to other groups and dimensions.
