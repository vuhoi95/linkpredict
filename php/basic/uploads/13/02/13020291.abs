Title: Stable Bound Orbits of Massless Particles around a Black Ring
Authors: Takahisa Igata and Hideki Ishihara and Yohsuke Takamori
Abstract: We study the geodesic motion of massless particles in singly rotating black ring spacetimes. We find stable stationary orbits of massless particles in toroidal spiral shape in the case that the thickness parameter of a black ring is less than a critical value. Furthermore, there exist nonstationary massless particles bounded in a finite region outside the horizon. This is the first example of stable bound orbits of massless particles around a black object.
