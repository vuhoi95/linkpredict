Title: Exceptional geometry and tensor fields
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Joakim Edlund and Anna Karlsson
Abstract: We present a tensor calculus for exceptional generalised geometry. Expressions for connections, torsion and curvature are given a unified formulation for different exceptional groups E_n(n). We then consider "tensor gauge fields" coupled to the exceptional generalised gravity. Many of the properties of forms on manifolds are carried over to these fields.
