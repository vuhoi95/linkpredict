Title: Inflation in Higher Dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology
Authors: Isha Pahwa and Debajyoti Choudhury and T. R. Seshadri
Abstract: A Gauss-Bonnet term naturally appears in the action for gravity when one considers the existence of space time with dimensions more than 1+3. A variety of inflationary models can be obtained within such a framework, once the scale factor for the hidden dimension(s) is not constrained to be the same as that of the visible ones. In particular, the need for an adhoc inflaton field is eliminated. The phase space has a rich structure with different types of solutions, both stable and unstable. For a large class of solutions, the scale factors rapidly approach an asymptotic exponential form. Furthermore, sufficient inflation can be obtained for only a modest compression of the hidden world, if the latter is of a sufficiently large dimension.
