Title: On the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD
Authors: Tina K. Herbst and Jan M. Pawlowski and Bernd-Jochen Schaefer
Abstract: We discuss the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD by means of dynamical chiral effective models. Quark and meson fluctuations are included via the functional renormalization group. We study the influence of confinement in addition to the impact of fluctuations by comparing the results of the chiral models to their Polyakov-loop extended versions. Furthermore, we discuss the mass sensitivity of the phase structure and thermodynamics and find interesting modifications close to the chiral limit.
