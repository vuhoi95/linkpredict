Title: The Solution to the Problem of Time in Shape Dynamics
Authors: Julian Barbour and Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati
Abstract: The absence of unique time evolution in Einstein's spacetime description of gravity leads to the hitherto unresolved `problem of time' in quantum gravity. Shape Dynamics is an objectively equivalent representation of gravity that trades spacetime refoliation invariance for three-dimensional conformal invariance. Its logical completion presented here gives a dimensionless description of gravitational dynamics. We show that in this framework the classical problem of time is completely solved. Since a comparable definitive solution is impossible within the spacetime description, we believe Shape Dynamics provides a key ingredient for the creation of quantum gravity.
