Title: Exact momentum fluctuations of an accelerated quark in N=4 super  Yang-Mills
Authors: Bartomeu Fiol and Blai Garolera and Genis Torrents
Abstract: In this work we consider a heavy quark moving with constant proper acceleration in the vacuum of any four dimensional conformal field theory. We argue that the two-point function of its momentum fluctuations is exactly captured by the Bremsstrahlung function that gives the total radiated power. For the particular case of N=4 SU(N) SYM this function is exactly known, so in this case we obtain an explicit expression for the momentum diffusion coefficient, and check that various limits of this result are reproduced by probe computations in AdS_5. Finally, we evaluate this transport coefficient for a heavy quark accelerated in the vacuum of N=4 SU(3) SYM, and comment on possible lessons of our results for the study of heavy quarks traversing the super Yang-Mills plasma.
