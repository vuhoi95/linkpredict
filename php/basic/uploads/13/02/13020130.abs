Title: Symmetries and Consistency Relations in the Large Scale Structure of the  Universe
Authors: A. Kehagias and A. Riotto
Abstract: We study the symmetries enjoyed by the Newtonian equations of motion of the non-relativistic dark matter fluid coupled to gravity which give rise to the phenomenon of gravitational instability. We also discuss some consistency relations involving the soft limit of the (n + 1)-correlator functions of matter and galaxy overdensities.
