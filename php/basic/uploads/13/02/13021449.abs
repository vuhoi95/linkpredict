Title: Quantum Excitations in Time-Dependent Backgrounds
Authors: Matthew Kolopanis and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: We give a technique for calculating the occupation number of quantum fields in time-dependent backgrounds by using the relation between one-dimensional {\em quantum} oscillators and two-dimensional {\em classical} oscillators. We illustrate our method by giving closed analytical results for the time-dependent spectrum of occupation numbers during gravitational collapse in 3+1 dimensions.
