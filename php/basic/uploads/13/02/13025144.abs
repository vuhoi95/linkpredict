Title: Colored HOMFLY polynomials from Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Satoshi Nawata and P. Ramadevi and Zodinmawia
Abstract: We elaborate the Chern-Simons field theoretic method to obtain colored HOMFLY invariants of knots and links. Using multiplicity-free quantum 6j-symbols for U_q(sl_N), we present explicit evaluations of the HOMFLY invariants colored by symmetric representations for a variety of knots, two-component links and three-component links.
