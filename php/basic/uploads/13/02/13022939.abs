Title: Fermion Zero Modes for Abelian BPS Monopoles
Authors: Bobby Cheng and Chris Ford
Abstract: Fermion zero modes for abelian BPS monopoles are considered. In the spherically symmetric case the normalisable zero modes are determined for arbitrary monopole charge N. If N>1 the zero modes are zero along $N-1$ half-lines emanating from the monopole.
