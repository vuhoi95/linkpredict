Authors: Iryna Zahladko and Askold Duviryak
Abstract: We consider a scalar Yukawa-like model in the framework of partially reduced quantum field theory. The reduced Lagrangian of the model consists of free scalar field terms and nonlocal current interaction term. Hamiltonian expressions for conserved quantities arose from a Lorentz-invariance of the model in the momentum representation have been found in the first-order approximation with respect to a coupling constant squared. Canonical quantization of the system is performed. It is shown that the obtained conserved quantities and previously founded the Hamiltonian and the momentum of the system satisfy the commutational relations of the Poincare group. The expression for S-matrix in the current approximation is found. Unitarity of this operator is proven by direct calculation.
