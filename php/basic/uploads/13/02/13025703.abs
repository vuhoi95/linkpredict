Title: Holographic Local Quenches and Entanglement Density
Authors: Masahiro Nozaki and Tokiro Numasawa and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We propose a free falling particle in an AdS space as a holographic model of local quench. Local quenches are triggered by local excitations in a given quantum system. We calculate the time-evolution of holographic entanglement entropy. We confirm a logarithmic time-evolution, which is known to be typical in two dimensional local quenches. To study the structure of quantum entanglement in general quantum systems, we introduce a new quantity which we call entanglement density and apply this analysis to quantum quenches. We show that this quantity is directly related to the energy density in a small size limit. Moreover, we find a simple relationship between the amount of quantum information possessed by a massive object and its total energy based on the AdS/CFT.
