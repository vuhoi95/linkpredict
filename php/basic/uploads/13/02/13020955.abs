Title: "Warm" Tachyon Matter from Back-reaction on the Brane
Authors: Neven Bilic and Gary B. Tupper
Abstract: We study a 3-brane moving in the five-dimensional bulk of the Randall-Sundrum II model. By including back-reaction of the brane on the bulk geometry we obtain a tachyon model with a linear barotropic equation of state.
