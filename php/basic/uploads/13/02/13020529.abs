Abstract: By implementing a genetic algorithm we search for stable vacua in Type IIB non-geometric flux compactification on an isotropic torus with orientifold 3-planes. We find that the number of stable dS and AdS vacua are of the same order. Moreover we find that in all dS vacua the multi-field slow-roll inflationary conditions are fulfilled. Specifically we observe that inflation is driven by the axio-dilaton and the K\"ahler moduli. We also comment on the existence of one stable dS vacuum in the presence of exotic orientifolds.
