Title: On the Casimir repulsion in sphere-plate geometry
Authors: Irina G. Pirozhenko and Michael Bordag
Abstract: The electromagnetic vacuum energy is considered in the presence of a perfectly conducting plane and a ball with dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$, $\mu\ne1$. The attention is focused on the Casimir repulsion in this system caused by magnetic permeability of the sphere. In the case of perfectly permeable sphere, $\mu=\infty$, the vacuum energy is estimated numerically. The short and long distance asymptotes corresponding to the repulsive force and respective low temperature corrections and high temperature limits are found for a wide range of $\mu$. The constraints on the Casimir repulsion in this system are discussed.
