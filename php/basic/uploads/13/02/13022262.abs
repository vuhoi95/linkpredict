Abstract: We consider the Riemann-Cartan geometry as a basis for the Einstein-Sciama-Kibble theory coupled to spinor fields: we focus on $f(R)$ and conformal gravities, regarding the flag-dipole spinor fields, type-(4) spinor fields under the Lounesto classification. We study such theories in specific cases given for instance by cosmological scenarios: we find that in such background the Dirac equation admits solutions that are not Dirac spinor fields, but in fact the aforementioned flag-dipoles ones. These solutions are important from a theoretical perspective, as they evince that spinor fields are not necessarily determined by their dynamics, but also a discussion on their structural (algebraic) properties must be carried off. Furthermore, the phenomenological point of view is shown to be also relevant, since for isotropic Universes they circumvent the question whether spinor fields do undergo the Cosmological Principle.
