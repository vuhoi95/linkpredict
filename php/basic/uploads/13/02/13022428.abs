Title: Hydrodynamics and transport coefficients in an infrared-deformed  soft-wall AdS/QCD model at finite temperature
Authors: Shingo Takeuchi and Yue-Liang Wu
Abstract: We extend an infrared-deformed soft-wall anti de-Sitter/QCD model at zero temperature to a model at finite temperature and perform hydrodynamics. To have the infalling boundary condition to make the hydrodynamic analysis possible, we treat the infrared energy scale factor in our metric as a temperature-depending parameter. Then, by carrying out the hydrodynamic analysis, we compute the transport coefficients, the diffusion constant, and the shear viscosity, through the linear response theory.
