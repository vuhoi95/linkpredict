Title: A Comment on Continuous Spin Representations of the Poincar√© Group and  Perturbative String Theory
Authors: Anamaria Font and Fernando Quevedo and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We make a simple observation that the massless continuous spin representations of the Poincar\'e group are not present in perturbative string theory constructions. This represents one of the very few model-independent low-energy consequences of these models.
