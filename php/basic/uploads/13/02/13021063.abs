Title: Inertial effect on spin orbit coupling and spin transport
Authors: B. Basu and Debashree Chowdhury
Abstract: We theoretically study the renormalization of inertial effects on the spin dependent transport of conduction electrons in a semiconductor by taking into account the interband mixing on the basis of k.p perturbation theory. In our analysis, for the generation of spin current we have used the extended Drude model where the spin orbit coupling plays an important role. We predict enhancement of the spin current resulting from the rerormalized spin orbit coupling effective in our model in cubic and non cubic crystal. Attention has been paid to clarify the importance of gauge fields in the spin transport of this inertial system. A theoretical proposition of a perfect spin filter has been done through the Aharanov Casher like phase corresponding to this inertial system. For a time dependent acceleration, effect of $\vec{k} . \vec{p}$ perturbation on the spin current and spin polarization has also been addressed. Furthermore, achievement of a tunable source of polarized spin current through the non uniformity of the inertial spin orbit coupling strength has also been discussed.
