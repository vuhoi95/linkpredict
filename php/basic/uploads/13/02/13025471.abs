Title: Milli-Charged Dark Matter in Quantum Gravity and String Theory
Authors: Gary Shiu and Pablo Soler and Fang Ye
Abstract: We examine the milli-charged dark matter scenario from a string theory perspective. In this scenario, kinetic and mass mixings of the photon with extra U(1) bosons are claimed to give rise to small electric charges, carried by dark matter particles, whose values are determined by continuous parameters of the theory. This seems to contradict folk theorems of quantum gravity that forbid the existence of irrational charges in theories with a single massless gauge field. By considering the underlying structure of the U(1) mass matrix that appears in type II string compactifications, we show that milli-charges arise exclusively through kinetic mixing, and require the existence of at least two exactly massless gauge bosons.
