Title: Superconducting Dome from Holography
Authors: Suman Ganguli and Jimmy A. Hutasoit and George Siopsis
Abstract: We find a regime in which a strongly coupled striped superconductor features a superconducting dome. This regime is signified by i) a modulating chemical potential that averages to zero, and ii) a superconducting order parameter that has a scaling dimension larger than 3/2 but less than or equal to 3. We also find that in this regime, the order parameter exhibits a mild dependence on the modulation wavelength of the stripe.
