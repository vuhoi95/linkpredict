Title: Exact Kahler Potential for Calabi-Yau Fourfolds
Authors: Yoshinori Honma and Masahide Manabe
Abstract: We study quantum Kahler moduli space of Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Our analysis is based on the recent work by Jockers et al. which gives a novel method to compute the Kahler potential on the quantum Kahler moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifold. In contrast to Calabi-Yau threefold, the quantum nature of higher dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold is yet to be fully elucidated. In this paper we focus on the Calabi-Yau fourfold. In particular, we conjecture the explicit form of the quantum-corrected Kahler potential. We also compute the genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants and test our conjecture by comparing the results with predictions from mirror symmetry. Local toric Calabi-Yau varieties are also discussed.
