Title: On the gauge features of gravity on a Lie algebroid structure
Authors: S. Fabi and B. Harms and S. Hou
Abstract: We present the geometric formulation of gravity based on the mathematical structure of a Lie Algebroid. We show that this framework provides the geometrical setting to describe the gauge propriety of gravity.
