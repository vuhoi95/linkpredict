Title: Modulated Ground State of Gravity Theories with Stabilized Conformal  Factor
Authors: Alfio Bonanno and Martin Reuter
Abstract: We discuss the stabilization of the conformal factor by higher derivative terms in a conformally reduced $R+R^2$ Euclidean gravity theory. The flat spacetime is unstable towards the condensation of modes with nonzero momentum, and they "condense" in a modulated phase above a critical value of the coupling $\beta$ of the $R^2$ term. By employing a combination of variational, numerical and lattice methods we show that in the semiclassical limit the corresponding functional integral is dominated by a single nonlinear plane wave of frequency $\approx 1/\sqrt{\beta} \lp$. We argue that the ground state of the theory is characterized by a spontaneous breaking of translational invariance at Planckian scales.
