Title: Analytic and Algorithmic Aspects of Generalized Harmonic Sums and  Polylogarithms
Authors: Jakob Ablinger and Johannes Bl√ºmlein and Carsten Schneider
Abstract: In recent three--loop calculations of massive Feynman integrals within Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and, e.g., in recent combinatorial problems the so-called generalized harmonic sums (in short $S$-sums) arise. They are characterized by rational (or real) numerator weights also different from $\pm 1$. In this article we explore the algorithmic and analytic properties of these sums systematically. We work out the Mellin and inverse Mellin transform which connects the sums under consideration with the associated Poincar\'{e} iterated integrals, also called generalized harmonic polylogarithms. In this regard, we obtain explicit analytic continuations by means of asymptotic expansions of the $S$-sums which started to occur frequently in current QCD calculations. In addition, we derive algebraic and structural relations, like differentiation w.r.t. the external summation index and different multi-argument relations, for the compactification of $S$-sum expressions. Finally, we calculate algebraic relations for infinite $S$-sums, or equivalently for generalized harmonic polylogarithms evaluated at special values. The corresponding algorithms and relations are encoded in the computer algebra package {\tt HarmonicSums}.
