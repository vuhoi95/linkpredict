Title: Strictly static spacetimes and positive mass in the  Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Seiju Ohashi
Abstract: In the Einstein gravity, it is well-known that strictly stationary and vacuum regular spacetime should be the Minkowski spacetime. In the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, we shall show the similar statement, that is, strictly static(no event horizon), vacuum and asymptotically flat spacetimes with conformally static slices are the Minkowski spacetime when the curvature corrections are small.
