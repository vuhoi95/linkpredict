Title: U-geometry : SL(5)
Authors: Jeong-Hyuck Park and Yoonji Suh
Abstract: Recently Berman and Perry constructed a four-dimensional M-theory effective action which manifests SL(5) U-duality. Here we propose an underlying differential geometry of it, under the name `SL(5) U-geometry' which generalizes the ordinary Riemannian geometry in an SL(5) compatible manner. We introduce a `semi-covariant' derivative that can be converted into fully covariant derivatives after anti-symmetrizing or contracting the SL(5) vector indices appropriately. We also derive fully covariant scalar and Ricci-like curvatures which constitute the effective action as well as the equation of motion.
