Title: Energy conditions in $f(R,G)$ gravity
Authors: K. Atazadeh and F. Darabi
Abstract: Modified gravity is one of the most favorable candidates for explaining the current accelerating expansion of the Universe. In this regard, we study the viability of an alternative gravitational theory, namely $f(R,G)$, by imposing energy conditions. We consider two forms of $f(R,G)$, commonly discussed in the literature, which account for the stability of cosmological solutions. We construct the inequalities obtained by energy conditions and specifically apply the weak energy condition using the recent estimated values of the Hubble, deceleration, jerk and snap parameters to probe the viability of the above-mentioned forms of $f(R, G)$.
