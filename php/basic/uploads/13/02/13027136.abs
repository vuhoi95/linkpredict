Title: Logarithmic correlators or responses in non-relativistic analogues of  conformal invariance
Authors: Malte Henkel and Shahin Rouhani
Abstract: Recent developments on emergence of logarithmic terms in correlators or response functions of models which exhibit dynamical symmetries analogous to conformal invariance in not necessarily relativistic systems are reviewed. The main examples of these are logarithmic Schr\"odinger-invariance and logarithmic conformal Galilean invariance. Some applications of these ideas to statistical physics are described.
