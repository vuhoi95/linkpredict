Authors: Steven Duplij and Elisabetta Di Grezia and Giampiero Esposito and Albert Kotvytskiy
Abstract: This paper studies non-linear constitutive equations for gravitoelectromagnetism. Eventually, the problem is solved of finding, for a given particular solution of the gravity-Maxwell equations, the exact form of the corresponding non-linear constitutive equations.
