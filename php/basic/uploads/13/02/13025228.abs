Title: Supersymmetry on Three-dimensional Lorentzian Curved Spaces and Black  Hole Holography
Authors: Kiril Hristov and Alessandro Tomasiello and Alberto Zaffaroni
Abstract: We study N <= 2 superconformal and supersymmetric theories on Lorentzian threemanifolds with a view toward holographic applications, in particular to BPS black hole solutions. As in the Euclidean case, preserved supersymmetry for asymptotically locally AdS solutions implies the existence of a (charged) "conformal Killing spinor" on the boundary. We find that such spinors exist whenever there is a conformal Killing vector which is null or timelike. We match these results with expectations from supersymmetric four-dimensional asymptotically AdS black holes. In particular, BPS bulk solutions in global AdS are known to fall in two classes, depending on their graviphoton magnetic charge, and we reproduce this dichotomy from the boundary perspective. We finish by sketching a proposal to find the dual superconformal quantum mechanics on the horizon of the magnetic black holes.
