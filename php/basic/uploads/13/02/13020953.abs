Title: A Boltzmann treatment for the vorton excess problem
Authors: Patrick Peter and Christophe Ringeval
Abstract: We derive and solve a Boltzmann equation governing the cosmological evolution of the number density of current carrying cosmic string loops, whose centrifugally supported equilibrium configurations are also referred to as vortons. The phase space is three-dimensional and consists of the time variable, the loop size, and a conserved quantum number. Our approach includes gravitational wave emission, a possibly finite lifetime for the vortons and works with any initial loop distribution and for any loop production function. We then show how our results generalize previous approaches on the vorton excess problem by tracking down the time evolution of the various sub-populations of current-carrying loops in a string network.
