Title: One-loop Chern-Simons terms in five dimensions
Authors: Federico Bonetti and Thomas W. Grimm and Stefan Hohenegger
Abstract: We compute one-loop corrections to five-dimensional gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons terms induced by integrating out charged massive fields. The considered massive fields are spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 fermions, as well as complex two-forms with first order kinetic terms. Consistency with six-dimensional gravitational anomalies of (1,0) and (2,0) theories is shown by interpreting the massive fields as excited Kaluza-Klein modes in a circle compactification. The results are in accordance with the geometric predictions of the M-theory to F-theory duality as well as the comparison with an explicit one-loop computation in heterotic string theory compactified on K3 x S^1.
