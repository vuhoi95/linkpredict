Title: Canonical Thermal Pure Quantum State
Authors: Sho Sugiura and Akira Shimizu
Abstract: A thermal equilibrium state of a quantum many-body system can be represented by a typical pure state, which we call a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state. We construct the canonical TPQ state, which corresponds to the canonical ensemble of the conventional statistical mechanics. Only a single realization of the TPQ state gives all variables of statistical-mechanical interest. We show that TPQ states corresponding to different ensembles give identical thermodynamic results, and they are related by simple analytic transformations. We have thus completed the TPQ formulation of statistical mechanics. We also show that it has great advantages in practical applications.
