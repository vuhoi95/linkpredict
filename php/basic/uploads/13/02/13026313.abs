Title: SU(5/3) Superalgebra and Its Representations of Fundamental Particles
Authors: Chang-Ho Kim and Seung Kook Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We study the lowest dimensional typical and atypical representations of SU(5/3) superalgebra as a possible unified gauge theory having a natural SU(5) subalgebra with SU(3) extra structure, which will be used to accommodate three generations of fundamental particles. By using Kac-Dynkin weight techniques, we find that all known quarks and leptons can be really accommodated in one atypical irreducible representation of SU(5/3).
