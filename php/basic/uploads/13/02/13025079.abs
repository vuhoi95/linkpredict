Abstract: We construct a new class of perturbative extremal charged rotating black hole solutions in five dimensions in the Einstein--Born-Infeld theory. We start with an extremal five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole seed in which the two possible angular momenta have equal magnitude, and add Born-Infeld electrical charge keeping the extremality condition as a constraint. The perturbative parameter is assumed to be the electric charge $q$ and the perturbations are performed up to 4th order. We also study some physical properties of these black holes. It is shown that the perturbative parameter $q$ and the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$ modify the values of the physical quantities of the black holes. The solution suggests that the magnetic moment and gyromagnetic ratio of the black hole spacetime change sign when the Born-Infeld character of the solution starts to depart strongly from the Maxwell limit. We venture an interpretation for the effect.
