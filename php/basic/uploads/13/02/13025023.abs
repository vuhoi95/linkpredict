Title: Lorentz Violation in the Higgs Sector and Noncommutative Standard Model
Authors: S. Aghababaei and M. Haghighat and A. Kheirandish
Abstract: The noncommutative standard model apparently violates the Lorentz symmetry. We compare the Lorentz violating terms in the Higgs sector of the noncommutative standard model with their counterparts in the standard model extension. We show that the Lorentz violating parameters in the Higgs sector can be expressed directly in terms of the noncommutative parameter without any background field. The absence of the background field enhances the obtained bounds on the noncommutative parameter from the standard model extension.
