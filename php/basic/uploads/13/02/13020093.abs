Title: Gauss-Bonnet dark energy by Lagrange multipliers
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Andrey N. Makarenko and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: A string-inspired effective theory of gravity, containing Gauss-Bonnet invariant interacting with a scalar field, is considered in view of obtaining cosmological dark energy solutions. A Lagrange multiplier is inserted into the action in order to achieve the cosmological reconstruction by selecting suitable forms of couplings and potentials. Several cosmological exact solutions (including dark energy of quintessence, phantom or Little Rip type) are derived in presence and in absence of the Lagrange multiplier showing the difference in the two dynamical approaches. In the models that we consider, the Lagrange multiplier behaves as a sort of dust fluid that realizes the transitions between matter dominated and dark energy epochs. The relation between Lagrange multipliers and Noether symmetries is discussed.
