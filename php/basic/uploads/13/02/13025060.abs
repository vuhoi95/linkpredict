Title: Fermionic Corrections to Fluid Dynamics from BTZ Black Hole
Authors: L. G. C. Gentile and P. A. Grassi and A. Mezzalira
Abstract: We reconstruct the complete fermionic orbit of the non-extremal BTZ black hole by acting with finite supersymmetry transformations. The solution satisfies the exact supergravity equations of motion to all orders in the fermonic expansion and the final result is given in terms of fermionic bilinears. By fluid/gravity correspondence, we derive linearized Navier-Stokes equations and a set of new differential equations from Rarita-Schwinger equation. We compute the boundary energy-momentum tensor and we interpret the result as a perfect fluid with a modified definition of fluid velocity. Finally, we derive the modified expression for the entropy of the black hole in terms of the fermionic bilinears.
