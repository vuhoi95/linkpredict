Title: Is the Higgs a sign of extra dimensions?
Authors: Hiroto So and Kazunori Takenaga
Abstract: We introduce a 4-dimensional cutoff in the scenario of gauge-Higgs unification to control the ultraviolet behavior. A one-loop effective potential for a Higgs field and the Higgs mass are obtained with the cutoff. We find an {\it interrelation} between the 4-dimensional cutoff and the scale of extra dimensions, which is concretized through the Higgs mass. Combining this interrelation and the recently discovered Higgs boson at LHC, we obtain an interesting constraint for the 4-dimensional cutoff and the extra dimensional scale.
