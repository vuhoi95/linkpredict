Title: A Self-consistent Model of the Black Hole Evaporation
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Yoshinori Matsuo and Yuki Yokokura
Abstract: We construct a self-consistent model which describes a black hole from formation to evaporation including the back reaction from the Hawking radiation. In the case where a null shell collapses, at the beginning the evaporation occurs, but it stops eventually, and a horizon and singularity appear. On the other hand, in the generic collapse process of a continuously distributed null matter, the black hole evaporates completely without forming a macroscopically large horizon nor singularity. We also find a stationary solution in the heat bath, which can be regarded as a normal thermodynamic object.
