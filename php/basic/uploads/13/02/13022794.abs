Title: New Cosmological Solutions in Nonlocal Modified Gravity
Authors: I. Dimitrijevic and B. Dragovich and J. Grujic and Z. Rakic
Abstract: We consider some cosmological aspects of nonlocal modified gravity with $\Lambda$ term, where nonlocality is of the type $R \mathcal{F}(\Box) R$. Using ansatz of the form $\Box R = r R +s,$ we find a few a(t) nonsingular bounce cosmological solutions for all three values of spatial curvature parameter k. We also discuss this modified gravity model from F(R) theory point of view.
