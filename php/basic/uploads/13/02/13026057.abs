Title: Triality, Periodicity and Stability of SO(8) Gauged Supergravity
Authors: Andrea Borghese and Adolfo Guarino and Diederik Roest
Abstract: While electromagnetic duality is a symmetry of many supergravity theories, this is not the case for the N=8 gauged theory. It was recently shown that this rotation leads to a one-parameter family of SO(8) supergravities. It is an open question what the period of this parameter is. This issue is investigated in the SO(4) invariant sectors of the theory. We classify such critical points and find a novel branch of non-supersymmetric and unstable solutions, whose embedding is related via triality to the two known ones. Secondly, we show that the three branches of solutions lead to a Pi/4 periodicity of the vacuum structure. The general interrelations between triality and periodicity are discussed. Finally, we comment on the connection to other gauge groups as well as the possibility to achieve (non-)perturbative stability around AdS/Mkw/dS transitions.
