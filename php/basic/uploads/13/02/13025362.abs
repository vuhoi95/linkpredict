Title: Remarks on the Aharonov-Casher dynamics in a CPT-odd Lorentz-violating  background
Authors: E. O. Silva and F. M. Andrade
Abstract: The Aharonov-Casher problem in the presence of a Lorentz-violating background nonminimally coupled to a spinor and a gauge field is examined. Using an approach based on the self-adjoint extension method, an expression for the bound state energies is obtained in terms of the physics of the problem by determining the self-adjoint extension parameter.
