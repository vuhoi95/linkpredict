Title: The Coulomb problem on a 3-sphere and Heun polynomials
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Vahagn Yeghikyan
Abstract: The paper studies the quantum mechanical Coulomb problem on a 3-sphere. We present a special parametrization of the ellipto-spheroidal coordinate system suitable for the separation of variables. After quantization we get the explicit form of the spectrum and present an algebraic equation for the eigenvalues of the Runge-Lentz vector. We also present the wave functions expressed via Heun polynomials.
