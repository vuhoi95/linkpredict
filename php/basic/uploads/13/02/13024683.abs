Title: From non-semisimple Hopf algebras to correlation functions for  logarithmic CFT
Authors: Jurgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert and Carl Stigner
Abstract: We use factorizable finite tensor categories, and specifically the representation categories of factorizable ribbon Hopf algebras H, as a laboratory for exploring bulk correlation functions in local logarithmic conformal field theories. For any ribbon Hopf algebra automorphism omega of H we present a candidate for the space of bulk fields and endow it with a natural structure of a commutative symmetric Frobenius algebra. We derive an expression for the corresponding bulk partition functions as bilinear combinations of irreducible characters; as a crucial ingredient this involves the Cartan matrix of the category. We also show how for any candidate bulk state space of the type we consider, correlation functions of bulk fields for closed oriented world sheets of any genus can be constructed that are invariant under the natural action of the relevant mapping class group.
