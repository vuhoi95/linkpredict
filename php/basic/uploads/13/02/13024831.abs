Title: Modified gravity: walk through accelerating cosmology
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We review the accelerating (mainly, dark energy) cosmologies in modified gravity. Special attention is paid to cosmologies leading to finite-time future singularities in $F(R)$, $F(G)$ and $\mathcal{F}(R,G)$ modified gravities. The removal of the finite-time future singularities via addition of $R^2$-term which simultaneously unifies the early-time inflation with late-time acceleration is also briefly mentioned. Accelerating cosmology including the scenario unifying inflation with dark energy is considered in $F(R)$ gravity with Lagrange multipliers. In addition, we examine domain wall solutions in $F(R)$ gravity. Furthermore, covariant higher derivative gravity with scalar projectors is explored.
