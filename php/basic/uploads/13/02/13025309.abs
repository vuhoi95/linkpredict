Title: Novel Features of the Transport Coefficients in Lifshitz Black Branes
Authors: Jia-Rui Sun and Shang-Yu Wu and Hai-Qing Zhang
Abstract: We study the transport coefficients, including the conductivities and shear viscosity of the non-relativistic field theory dual to the Lifshitz black brane with multiple U(1) gauge fields by virtue of the gauge/gravity duality. Focusing on the case of double U(1) gauge fields, we systematically investigate the electric, thermal and thermoelectric conductivities for the dual non-relativistic field theory. In the large frequency regime, we find a nontrivial power law behavior in the electric AC conductivity when the dynamical critical exponent z>1 in (2+1)-dimensional field theory. The relations between this novel feature and the `symmetric hopping model' in condensed matter physics are discussed. In addition, we also show that the Kovtun-Starinets-Son bound for the shear viscosity to the entropy density is not violated by the additional U(1) gauge fields and dilaton in the Lifshitz black brane.
