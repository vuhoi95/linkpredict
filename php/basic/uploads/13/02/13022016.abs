Title: Petrov type I Condition and Dual Fluid Dynamics
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Li Li and Qing Yang and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: Recently Lysov and Strominger [arXiv:1104.5502] showed that imposing Petrov type I condition on a $(p+1)$-dimensional timelike hypersurface embedded in a $(p+2)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein gravity reduces the degrees of freedom in the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface to that of a fluid on the hypersurface, and that the leading-order Einstein constraint equations in terms of the mean curvature of the embedding give the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of the dual fluid. In this paper we show that the non-relativistic fluid dual to vacuum Einstein gravity does not satisfy the Petrov type I condition at next order, unless additional constraint such as the irrotational condition is added. In addition, we show that this procedure can be inversed to derive the non-relativistic hydrodynamics with higher order corrections through imposing the Petrov type I condition, and that some second order transport coefficients can be extracted, but the dual "Petrov type I fluid" does not match the dual fluid constructed from the geometry of vacuum Einstein gravity in the non-relativistic limit. We discuss the procedure both on the finite cutoff surface via the non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion and on the highly accelerated surface via the near horizon expansion.
