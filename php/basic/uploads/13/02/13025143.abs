Title: Multiplicity-free quantum 6j-symbols for U_q(sl_N)
Authors: Satoshi Nawata and P. Ramadevi and Zodinmawia
Abstract: We conjecture a closed form expression for the simplest class of multiplicity-free quantum 6j-symbols for U_q(sl_N). The expression is a natural generalization of the quantum 6j-symbols for U_q(sl_2) obtained by Kirillov and Reshetikhin. Our conjectured form enables computation of colored HOMFLY polynomials for various knots and links carrying arbitrary symmetric representations.
