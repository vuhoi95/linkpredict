Title: On the relation between the modular double of U_q(sl(2,R)) and the  quantum Teichmueller theory
Authors: I. Nidaiev and J. Teschner
Abstract: We exhibit direct relations between the modular double of U_q(sl(2,R)) and the quantum Teichmueller theory. Explicit representations for the fusion- and braiding operations of the quantum Teichmueller theory are immediate consequences. Our results include a simplified derivation of the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition for the principal series of representation of the modular double of U_q(sl(2,R)).
