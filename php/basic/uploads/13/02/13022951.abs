Title: A K matrix Construction of Symmetry Enriched Phases of Matter
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung and Yidun Wan
Abstract: We construct in the K matrix formalism concrete examples of symmetry enriched topological phases, namely intrinsically topological phases with global symmetries. We focus on the Abelian and non-chiral topological phases and demonstrate by our examples how the interplay between the global symmetry and the fusion algebra of the anyons of a topologically ordered system determines the existence of gapless edge modes protected by the symmetry and that a (quasi)-group structure can be defined among these phases. Our examples include phases that display charge fractionalization and more exotic non-local anyon exchange under global symmetry that correspond to general group extensions of the global symmetry group.
