Title: The Breton-Manko equatorially antisymmetric binary configuration  revisited
Authors: V. S. Manko and R. I. Rabadan and E. Ruiz
Abstract: The Breton-Manko solution for two identical counter-rotating Kerr-Newman charged masses is rewritten in the physical parametrization involving Komar quantities. The new form of the solution turns out to be very convenient for verifying that the black-hole sector of the Bret\'on-Manko binary configuration saturates a recent geometric inequality for interacting black holes with struts discovered by Gabach Clement.
