Title: Classification of complete projective special real surfaces
Authors: Vicente Cort√©s and Malte Dyckmanns and David Lindemann
Abstract: We determine all complete projective special real surfaces. By the supergravity r-map, they give rise to complete projective special K\"ahler manifolds of dimension 6, which are distinguished by the image of their scalar curvature function. By the supergravity c-map, the latter manifolds define in turn complete quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds of dimension 16.
