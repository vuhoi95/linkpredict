Title: Volume Law for the Entanglement Entropy in Non-local QFTs
Authors: Noburo Shiba and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple class of non-local field theories whose ground state entanglement entropy follows a volume law as long as the size of subsystem is smaller than a certain scale. We will confirm this volume law both from numerical calculations and from analytical estimation. This behavior fits nicely with holographic results for spacetimes whose curvatures are much smaller than AdS spaces such as those in the flat spacetime.
