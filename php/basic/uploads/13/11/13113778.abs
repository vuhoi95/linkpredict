Title: Twisted reduction in large N QCD with adjoint Wilson fermions
Authors: Antonio Gonz√°lez-Arroyo and Masanori Okawa
Abstract: The twisted space-time reduced model of large $N$ QCD with various flavours of adjoint Wilson fermions is constructed applying the symmetric twist boundary conditions with flux $k$. The models with one and two flavours show distinctive behaviours. For the two flavor case, the string tension, calculated at $N=289$, approaches zero as we decrease the quark mass in a way consistent with the theory being governed by an infrared fixed point. In contrast, the string tension for the case of a single adjoint Wilson fermion remains finite as the quark mass decreases to zero, supporting that this is a confining theory.
