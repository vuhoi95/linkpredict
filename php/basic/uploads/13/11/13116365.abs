Title: Modified Dynamical Supergravity Breaking and Off-Diagonal Super-Higgs  Effects
Authors: Tamara Gheorghiu and Olivia Vacaru and Sergiu Vacaru
Abstract: We argue that generic off-diagonal vacuum and nonvacuum solutions for Einstein manifolds mimic physical effects in modified gravity theories (MGTs) and encode certain models of the $f(R,T,...)$, Ho\v{r}ava type with dynamical Lorentz symmetry breaking, induced effective mass for the graviton etc. Our main goal is to investigate the dynamical breaking of local supersymmetry determined by off-diagonal solutions in MGTs and encoded as effective Einstein spaces. This includes the Deser-Zumino super-Higgs effect, for instance, for a one-loop potential in a (simple but representative) model of $\mathcal{N}=1, D=4$ supergravity. We develop and apply new geometrical techniques which allows us to decouple the gravitational field equations and integrate them in a very general form with the metric and vielbein fields depending on all the spacetime coordinates via means of various generating and integration functions and parameters. We study how solutions in MGTs may be related to the dynamical generation of a gravitino mass and supersymmetry breaking.
