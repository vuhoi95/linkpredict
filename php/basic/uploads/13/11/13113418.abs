Title: Particle-like Q-balls
Authors: E. Ya. Nugaev and M. N. Smolyakov
Abstract: Usually the charge and the energy of stable Q-balls vary in a wide range or are even unbounded. In the present paper we study an interesting possibility that this range is parametrically small. In this case the spectra of stable Q-balls look similar to the one of free particles.
