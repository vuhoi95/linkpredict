Title: Color/kinematics duality for general abelian orbifolds of N=4 super  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Marco Chiodaroli and Qingjun Jin and Radu Roiban
Abstract: To explore color/kinematics duality for general representations of the gauge group we formulate the duality for general abelian orbifolds of the SU(N), N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, which have fields in the bi-fundamental representation, and use it to construct explicitly complete four-vector and four-scalar amplitudes at one loop. For fixed number of supercharges, graph-organized L-loop n-point integrands of all orbifold theories are given in terms of a fixed set of polynomials labeled by L representations of the orbifold group. In contrast to the standard duality-satisfying presentation of amplitudes of the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, each graph may appear several times with different internal states. The color and R-charge flow provide a way to deform the amplitudes of orbifold theories to those of more general quiver gauge theories which do not necessarily exhibit color/kinematics duality on their own. Based on the organization of amplitudes required by the duality between color and kinematics in orbifold theories we show how the amplitudes of certain non-factorized matter-coupled supergravity theories can be found through a double-copy construction. We also carry out a comprehensive search for theories with fields solely in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and amplitudes exhibiting color/kinematics duality for all external states and find an interesting relation between supersymmetry and existence of the duality.
