Title: Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Theory from a Hubbard-like Model
Authors: Giandomenico Palumbo and Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: Here, we provide a simple Hubbard-like model of spin-$1/2$ fermions that gives rise to the SU(2) symmetric Thirring model that is equivalent, in the low-energy limit, to Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons model. First, we identify the regime that simulates the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. Then, we suitably extend this model so that it gives rise to the SU(2) level $k$ Chern-Simons theory with $k\geq2$ that can support non-Abelian anyons. This is achieved by introducing multiple fermionic species and modifying the Thirring interactions, while preserving the SU(2) symmetry. Our proposal provides the means to theoretically and experimentally probe non-Abelian SU(2) level $k$ topological phases.
