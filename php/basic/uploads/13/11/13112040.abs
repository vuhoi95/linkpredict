Title: External Sources in Lee-Wick Theories
Authors: F. A. Barone and G. Flores-Hidalgo and A. A Nogueira
Abstract: We investigate some peculiar aspects of the so called Lee-Wick Electrodynamics focusing on physical effects produced by the presence of sources for the vector field. The interactions between stationary charges distributions along parallel branes with arbitrary dimensions is investigated and the energy of a point charge is discussed. Some physical phenomena produced in the vicinity of a Dirac string are also investigated. We consider the Lee-Wick theory for the scalar field, where it can emerge some interesting effects with no counterpart for the vector gauge field theory.
