Title: Gravitational Pressure and the Accelerating Universe
Authors: K. H. C. Castello-Branco and J. F. da Rocha-Neto
Abstract: In the context of the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity, which is an alternative geometrical formulation of General Relativity (rather than an alternative theory of gravity), which is based on torsion and tetrad fields (rather than on curvature and metric), we apply a definition for a stress-energy-momentum tensor that naturally arises in this framework. Specially, that quantity leads to a very simple definition of pressure that, for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, includes the pressure of matter, the "vacuum pressure" (due to a cosmological constant) and, moreover, the pressure of the \textit{gravitational field} itself. We have computed that total pressure over a spherical surface of the FRW universe, for any curvature index. In particular, when we considered a spatially flat universe, and by resorting to the current observational data on the cosmological observables, we have found that pressure is negative and the corresponding energy density associated to it is remarkably close to the actual \textit{critical density} of the universe. We interpret this as the effect of the pressure of the gravitational field as being responsible for the present accelerated expansion of the universe, instead of assuming an exotic, totally unknown, \textit{ad hoc} form of energy, namely, the so-called "dark energy".
