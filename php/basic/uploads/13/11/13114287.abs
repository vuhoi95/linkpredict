Title: On chiral symmetry in extended nonlinear supersymmetry
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We study the equations of the motion for Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermions in the nonlinear representation of supersymmetry (NLSUSY) and show in N-extended NLSUSY that those equations under massless conditions are satisfied, provided the NG fermions are chiral eigenstates. The physical significance of the result is discussed in the context of NLSUSY general relativity through the relations between nonlinear and linear SUSY theories, which gives a new insight into the chiral symmetry for the low energy particle physics.
