Title: Magnetic catalysis in flavored ABJM
Authors: Niko Jokela and Alfonso V. Ramallo and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We study the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in the ABJM Chern-Simons matter theory with unquenched flavors in the Veneziano limit. We consider a magnetized D6-brane probe in the background of a flavored black hole which includes the backreaction of massless smeared flavors in the ABJM geometry. We find a holographic realization for the running of the quark mass due to the dynamical flavors. We compute several thermodynamic quantities of the brane probe and analyze the effects of the dynamical quarks on the fundamental condensate and on the phase diagram of the model. The dynamical flavors have an interesting effect on the magnetic catalysis. At zero temperature and fixed magnetic field, the magnetic catalysis is suppressed for small bare quark masses whereas it is enhanced for large values of the mass. When the temperature is non-zero there is a critical magnetic field, above which the magnetic catalysis takes place. This critical magnetic field decreases with the number of flavors, which we interpret as an enhancement of the catalysis.
