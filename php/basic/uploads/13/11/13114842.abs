Title: Hints of 5d Fixed Point Theories from Non-Abelian T-duality
Authors: Yolanda Lozano and Eoin O Colgain and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the putative 5d fixed point theory that should be dual, through the holographic correspondence, to the new supersymmetric AdS(6) solution constructed in Lozano et al. This solution is the result of a non-Abelian T-duality transformation on the known supersymmetric AdS(6) solution of massive Type IIA. The analysis of the charge quantization conditions seems to put constraints on the global properties of the background, which, combined with the information extracted from considering probe branes, suggests a 2-node quiver candidate for the dual CFT.
