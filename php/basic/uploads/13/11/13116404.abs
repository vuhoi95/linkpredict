Title: Tailoring Non-Compact Spin Chains
Authors: Pedro Vieira and Tianheng Wang
Abstract: We study three-point correlation functions of local operators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at weak coupling using integrability. We consider correlation functions involving two scalar BPS operators and an operator with spin, in the so called SL(2) sector. At tree level we derive the corresponding structure constant for any such operator. We also conjecture its one loop correction. To check our proposals we analyze the conformal partial wave decomposition of known four-point correlation functions of BPS operators. In perturbation theory, we extract from this decomposition sums of structure constants involving all primaries of a given spin and twist. On the other hand, in our integrable setup these sum rules are computed by summing over all solutions to the Bethe equations. A perfect match is found between the two approaches.
