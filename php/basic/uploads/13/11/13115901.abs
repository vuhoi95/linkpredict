Title: M-theory Compactifications to Three Dimensions with M2-brane Potentials
Authors: Cezar Condeescu and Andrei Micu and Eran Palti
Abstract: We study a class of compactifications of M-theory to three dimensions that preserve N=2 supersymmetry and which have the defining feature that a probe space-time filling M2 brane feels a non-trivial potential on the internal manifold. Using M-theory/F-theory duality such compactifications include the uplifts of 4-dimensional N=1 type IIB compactifications with D3 potentials to strong coupling. We study the most general 8-dimensional manifolds supporting these properties, derive the most general flux that induces an M2 potential, and show that it is parameterised in terms of two real vectors. We study the supersymmetry equations when only this flux is present and show that over the locus where the M2 potential is non-vanishing the background takes the form of a Calabi-Yau three-fold fibered over a 2-dimensional base spanned by the flux vectors, while at the minima of the potential the flux vanishes. Allowing also for non-vanishing four-form flux with one leg in the internal directions we find that the Calabi-Yau three-fold in the fibration is replaced by an SU(3)-structure manifold with torsion classes satisfying 2 W_4=-W_5.
