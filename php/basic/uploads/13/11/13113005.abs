Abstract: We study the thermalization process in highly occupied non-Abelian plasmas at weak coupling. The non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems is classical in nature and can be simulated with real-time lattice gauge theory techniques. We provide a detailed discussion of this framework and elaborate on the results reported in~\cite{Berges:2013eia} along with novel findings. We demonstrate the emergence of universal attractor solutions, which govern the non-equilibrium evolution on large time scales both for non-expanding and expanding non-Abelian plasmas. The turbulent attractor for a non-expanding plasma drives the system close to thermal equilibrium on a time scale $t\sim Q^{-1} \alpha_s^{-7/4}$. The attractor solution for an expanding non-Abelian plasma leads to a strongly interacting albeit highly anisotropic system at the transition to the low-occupancy or quantum regime. This evolution in the classical regime is, within the uncertainties of our simulations, consistent with the ``bottom up'' thermalization scenario~\cite{Baier:2000sb}. While the focus of this paper is to understand the non-equilibrium dynamics in weak coupling asymptotics, we also discuss the relevance of our results for larger couplings in the early time dynamics of heavy ion collision experiments.
