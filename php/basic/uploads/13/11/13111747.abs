Title: Naked Singularities are not Singular in Distorted Gravity
Authors: Remo Garattini and Barun Majumder
Abstract: We compute the Zero Point Energy (ZPE) induced by a naked singularity with the help of a reformulation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. A variational approach is used for the calculation with Gaussian Trial Wave Functionals. The one loop contribution of the graviton to the ZPE is extracted keeping under control the UltraViolet divergences by means of a distorted gravitational field. Two examples of distortion are taken under consideration: Gravity's Rainbow and Noncommutative Geometry. Surprisingly we find that the ZPE is no more singular when we approach the singularity.
