Title: Kaluza-Klein multidimensional models with Ricci-flat internal spaces:  the absence of the KK particles
Authors: Alexey Chopovsky and Maxim Eingorn and Alexander Zhuk
Abstract: In this paper we consider a multidimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK) model with a Ricci-flat internal space, e.g., a Calabi-Yau manifold. We perturb this background metrics by a system of gravitating masses, e.g., astrophysical objects such as our Sun. We suppose that these masses are pressureless in the external space but they have relativistic pressure in the internal space. We show that metric perturbations do not depend on coordinates of the internal space and gravitating masses should be uniformly smeared over the internal space. This means, first, that KK modes corresponding to the metric fluctuations are absent and, second, particles should be only in the ground quantum state with respect to the internal space. In our opinion, these results look very unnatural. According to statistical physics, any nonzero temperature should result in fluctuations, i.e. in KK modes. We also get formulae for the metric correction terms which enable to calculate the gravitational tests: the deflection of light, the time-delay of the radar echoes and the perihelion advance.
