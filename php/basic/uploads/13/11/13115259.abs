Title: Multi-faced Black Janus and Entanglement
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Hyunsoo Min
Abstract: To the second order of the deformation parameter, we construct the black brane solutions, which are dual to the multiple interface deformations of conformal field theories. We compute their thermodynamic quantities from the gravity and the field theory sides, and find a precise agreement, confirming the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The correlation of two separate interfaces induces a Casimir energy and an interesting form of correlated entropy contribution. We comment on the properties of the interface lattice system too.
