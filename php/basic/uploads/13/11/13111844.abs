Title: Tolman IV solution in the Randall-Sundrum Braneworld
Authors: J Ovalle and F Linares
Abstract: In the context of the Randall-Sundrum braneworld, the minimal geometric deformation approach (MGD) is used to generate an exact analytic interior solution to four-dimensional effective Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric compact distribution. This solution represents the braneworld version of the well known Tolman IV solution in General Relativity. By using this analytic solution, an exhaustive analysis of the braneworld effects on realistic stellar interiors is developed, finding strong evidences in favor of the hypothesis that compactness is reduced due to bulk effects on stellar configurations.
