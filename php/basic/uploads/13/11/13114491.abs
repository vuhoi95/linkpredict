Title: Geometric invariants as detector of Hawking and Unruh effects and  quantum field theory in curved space
Authors: Antonio Capolupo and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: We report on the recent results revealing the presence of geometric invariants in all the phenomena in which vacuum condensates appear and we show that Aharonov--Anandan phase can be used to provide the evidence of phenomena like Hawking and Unruh effects and to test some behavior of quantum field theory in curved space. A very precise quantum thermometer can be also built by using geometric invariants.
