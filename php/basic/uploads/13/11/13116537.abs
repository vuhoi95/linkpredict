Title: Calculation of glueball spectra in supersymmetric theories via  holography
Authors: Ivan Gordeli and Dmitry Melnikov
Abstract: Lattice simulations currently present the only way to access nonperturbative data in strongly coupled theories from a first principle calculation. However, in supersymmetric theories this valuable tool is not available due to the technical sign problem. We are going to demonstrate that in the case of glueball spectra a good quantitative estimate for the lightest states of low spin can be obtained by means of the holographic approach. We will review the results of the calculation in the singlet glueball sector of the N=1 supersymmetric Klebanov-Strassler model. We come up with a prediction of the spectrum of lightest glueballs in (large Nc) N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
