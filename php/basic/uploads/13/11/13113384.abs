Title: Generalized Kerr/CFT correspondence with electromagnetic field
Authors: Cheng-Yong Zhang and Yu Tian and Xiao-Ning Wu
Abstract: The electrovac axisymmetric extreme isolated horizon/CFT correspondence is considered. By expansion techniques under the Bondi-like coordinates, it is proved that the near horizon geometry of electrovac axisymmetric extreme isolated horizon is unique. Furthermore, explicit coordinate transformation between the Bondi-like coordinates and the Poincare-type coordinates for the near horizon metric of the extreme Kerr-Newmann spacetime is found. Based on these analyses and the thermodynamics of the isolated horizon, then, the Kerr/CFT correspondence is generalized to nonstationary extreme black holes with electromagnetic fields.
