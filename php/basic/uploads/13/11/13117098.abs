Title: Self-dual soliton solutions in a Chern-Simons-CP(1) model with a  nonstandard kinetic term
Authors: Rodolfo Casana and Lucas Sourrouille
Abstract: A generalization of the Chern-Simons-CP(1) model is considered by introducing a nonstandard kinetic term. For a particular case, of this nonstandard kinetic term, we show that the model support self-dual Bogomolnyi equations. The BPS energy has a bound proportional to the sum of the magnetic flux and the CP(1) topological charge. The self-dual equations are solved analytically and verified numerically.
