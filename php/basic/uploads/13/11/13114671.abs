Abstract: Recently, we found the supersymmetric counterpart of the spectral triple. When we restrict the representation space to the fermionic functions of matter fields, the counterpart which we name "the triple" reduces to the original spectral triple which defines noncommutative geometry. We see that the fluctuation to the supersymmetric Dirac operator induced by algebra in the triple generates vector supermultiplet which mediates gauge interaction. Following the supersymmetric version of spectral action principle, we calculate the heat kernel expansion of the square of fluctuated Dirac operator and obtain the correct supersymmetric Yang-Mills action with U(N) gauge symmetry.
