Title: An inverse scattering formalism for STU supergravity
Authors: Despoina Katsimpouri and Axel Kleinschmidt and Amitabh Virmani
Abstract: STU supergravity becomes an integrable system for solutions that effectively only depend on two variables. This class of solutions includes the Kerr solution and its charged generalizations that have been studied in the literature. We here present an inverse scattering method that allows to systematically construct solutions of this integrable system. The method is similar to the one of Belinski and Zakharov for pure gravity but uses a different linear system due to Breitenlohner and Maison and here requires some technical modifications. We illustrate this method by constructing a four-charge rotating solution from flat space. A generalization to other set-ups is also discussed.
