Title: Three-generation Asymmetric Orbifold Models from Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Florian Beye and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Shogo Kuwakino
Abstract: Using Z3 asymmetric orbifolds in heterotic string theory, we construct N=1 SUSY three-generation models with the standard model gauge group SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y and the left-right symmetric group SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}. One of the models possesses a gauge flavor symmetry for the Z3 twisted matter.
