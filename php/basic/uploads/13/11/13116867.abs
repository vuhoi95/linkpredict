Abstract: We construct the Perelomov number coherent states for any three $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra generators and study some of their properties. We introduce three operators which act on Perelomov number coherent states and close the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We show that the most general $SU(1,1)$ coherence-preserving Hamiltonian has the Perelomov number coherent states as eigenfunctions, and we obtain their time evolution. We apply our results to obtain the non-degenerate parametric amplifier eigenfunctions, which are shown to be the Perelomov number coherent states of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
