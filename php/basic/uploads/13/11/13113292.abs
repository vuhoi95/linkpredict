Title: Holographic Q-lattices
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for constructing black hole solutions that are holographically dual to strongly coupled field theories with explicitly broken translation invariance. Using a classical gravitational theory with a continuous global symmetry leads to constructions that involve solving ODEs. We study in detail $D=4$ Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a complex scalar field with a simple mass term. We construct black holes dual to metallic phases which exhibit a Drude-type peak in the optical conductivity, but there is no evidence of an intermediate scaling that has been reported in other holographic lattice constructions. We also construct black holes dual to insulating phases which exhibit a suppression of spectral weight at low frequencies. We show that the model also admits a novel $AdS_3\times\mathbb{R}$ solution.
