Title: An ansatz for one dimensional steady state configurations
Authors: Han-Chih Chang and Andreas Karch and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We conjecture a universal formula for the heat current of a steady state connecting two asymptotic equilibrium systems in d-dimensional conformal field theories. Our proposal is verified by comparing it to exact expressions in 1+1 dimensions and linear hydrodynamics as well as numerical simulations in an Israel-Stewart like theory of second order viscous hydrodynamics.
