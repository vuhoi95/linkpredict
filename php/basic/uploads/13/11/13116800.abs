Abstract: We present a new approach to computing energy-energy correlations in gauge theories that exploits their relation to correlation functions and bypasses the use of scattering amplitudes. We illustrate its power by calculating energy-energy correlations in the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (N=4 SYM) in the next-to-leading order approximation.
