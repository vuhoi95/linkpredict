Title: Geometric Constructions Underlying Relativistic Description of Spin on  the Base of Non-Grassmann Vector-Like Variable
Authors: Alexei A. Deriglazov and Andrey M. Pupasov-Maksimov
Abstract: Basic notions of Dirac theory of constrained systems have their analogs in differential geometry. Combination of the two approaches gives more clear understanding of both classical and quantum mechanics, when we deal with a model with complicated structure of constraints. In this work we describe and discuss the spin fiber bundle which appeared in various mechanical models where spin is described by vector-like variable.
