Title: Approaching the BFKL pomeron via integrable classical solutions
Authors: Romuald A. Janik and Pawel Laskos-Grabowski
Abstract: We identify classical string solutions which directly give the classical part of the strong coupling pomeron intercept. The relevant solution is a close cousin of the GKP folded string, which is not surprising given the known relation with twist-2 operators. Our methods are applicable, however, also for nonzero conformal spin where we do not have a clear link with anomalous dimensions of a concrete class of operators. We analyze the BFKL folded string from the algebraic curve perspective and investigate its possible particle content.
