Title: New Regimes of Stringy (Holographic) Pomeron and High Multiplicity pp  and pA Collisions
Authors: Edward Shuryak and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: Holographic AdS/QCD models of the Pomeron unite a string-based description of hadronic reactions of the pre-QCD era with the perturbative BFKL approach. The specific version we will use due to Stoffers and Zahed, is based on a semiclassical quantization of a "tube" (closed string exchange or open string virtual pair production) in its Euclidean formulation using the scalar Polyakov action. This model has a number of phenomenologically successful results. The periodicity of a coordinate around the tube allows the introduction of a Matsubara time and therefore an effective temperature Teff on the string. We observe that at the LHC energies and for sufficiently small impact parameter, Teff approaches and even exceeds the Hagedorn temperature of the QCD strings. Based on studies of the stringy thermodynamics of pure gauge theories we suggest that there should exist two new regimes of the Pomeron: the "near-critical" and the "post-critical" ones. In the former one, string excitations create a high entropy "string ball", with high energy and entropy but small pressure/free energy. If heavy enough this ball becomes a (dual) black hole (BH). As the intrinsic temperature of the string exceeds the Hagedorn temperature, the ball becomes a post-critical explosive "QGP ball". The hydrodynamical explosion resulting from this scenario was predicted by us to have radial flow exceeding that ever seen even in heavy ion collisions, which was recently confirmed by CMS and ALICE at LHC. We also discuss the elastic scattering profile, finding some hints for new phases in it, as well as two-particle correlations.
