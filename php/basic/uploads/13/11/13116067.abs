Title: Yangian-Like Symmetry of Probe-Brane Actions
Authors: Arthur Lipstein and John H. Schwarz
Abstract: We demonstrate that world-volume actions describing probe branes in anti de Sitter space have an infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra that is reminiscent of Yangian symmetry. Two essential ingredients are responsible for this symmetry. The first is an inversion symmetry of anti de Sitter space. The second is the compensating gauge transformations that are required to properly describe global symmetries after gauge fixing the general coordinate invariance.
