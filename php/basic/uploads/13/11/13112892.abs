Title: Probing Hawking and Unruh effects and quantum field theory in curved  space by geometric invariants
Authors: Antonio Capolupo and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: The presence of noncyclic geometric invariant is revealed in all the phenomena where particle generation from vacuum or vacuum condensates appear. Aharonov--Anandan invariants then can help to study such systems and can represent a new tool to be used in order to provide laboratory evidence of phenomena particulary hard to be detected, such as Hawking and Unruh effects and some features of quantum field theory in curved space simulated by some graphene morphologies. It is finally suggested that a very precise quantum thermometer can be built by exploiting geometric invariants properties.
