Title: Cosmological solutions in F(T) gravity with the presence of spinor  fields
Authors: Ratbay Myrzakulov and Diego Saez-Gomez and Petr Tsyba
Abstract: The presence of spinor fields is considered in the framework of some extensions of teleparallel gravity, where the Weitzenb\"ock connection is assumed. Some well known models as the Chaplygin gas and its generalizations are reconstructed in terms of a spinor field in the framework of teleparallel gravity. In addition, the {\Lambda}CDM model is also realized with the presence of a spinor field where a simple self-intercating term is considered and the corresponding action is reconstructed. Other cosmological solutions and the reconstruction of the gravitational action in terms of the scalar torsion is studied.
