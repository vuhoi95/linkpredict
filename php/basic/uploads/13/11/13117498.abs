Title: Noncommutative Space-time from Quantized Twistors
Authors: Jerzy Lukierski and Mariusz Woronowicz
Abstract: We consider the relativistic phase space coordinates (x_{\mu},p_{\mu}) as composite, described by functions of the primary pair of twistor coordinates. It appears that if twistor coordinates are canonicaly quantized the composite space-time coordinates are becoming noncommutative. We obtain deformed Heisenberg algebra which in order to be closed should be enlarged by the Pauli-Lubanski four-vector components. We further comment on star-product quantization of derived algebraic structures which permit to introduce spin-extended deformed Heisenberg algebra.
