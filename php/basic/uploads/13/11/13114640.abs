Title: A direct relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in  temporally odd-number lattice QCD
Authors: Takahiro M. Doi and Hideo Suganuma and Takumi Iritani
Abstract: In the lattice QCD formalism, we derive a gauge-invariant analytical relation connecting the Polyakov loop and the Dirac modes on a temporally odd-number lattice, where the temporal lattice size is odd, with the normal (nontwisted) periodic boundary condition. This analytical relation indicates that low-lying Dirac modes have little contribution to the Polyakov loop. Using lattice QCD simulations, we numerically confirm the analytical relation and the negligible contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop at the quenched level, i.e., the Polyakov loop is almost unchanged by removing low-lying Dirac-mode contribution from the QCD vacuum generated by lattice QCD in both confinement and deconfinement phases. Thus, we conclude that there is no one-to-one correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. As a new method, modifying the Kogut-Susskind formalism, we develop a method for spin-diagonalizing the Dirac operator on the temporally odd-number lattice.
