Title: Gribov gap equation at finite temperature
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora and Pablo Pais and Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo
Abstract: In this paper the Gribov gap equation at finite temperature is analyzed. The solutions of the gap equation (which depend explicitly on the temperature) determine the structure of the gluon propagator within the semi-classical Gribov approach. The present analysis is consistent with the standard confinement scenario for low temperatures, while for high enough temperatures, deconfinement takes place and a free gluon propagator is obtained. It also suggests the presence of the so-called semi-quark-gluon-plasma phase in between the confined and quark-gluon plasma phases.
