Abstract: Using the proposal for holographic entanglement entropy in higher derivative gravities, we compute holographic entanglement entropy for the conformal gravity in four dimensions which turns out to be finite. However, if one subtracts the contribution of the four dimensional Gauss-Bonnet term, the corresponding entanglement entropy has a divergent term and indeed restricted to an Einstein solution of the conformal gravity, the resultant entanglement entropy is exactly the same as that in the Einstein gravity. We will also make a comment on the first law of the entanglement thermodynamics for the conformal gravity in four dimensions.
