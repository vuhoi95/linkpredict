Title: Supersymmetry of hyperbolic monopoles
Authors: Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill and Moustafa Gharamti
Abstract: We investigate what supersymmetry says about the geometry of the moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles. We construct a three-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Higgs theory on hyperbolic space whose half-BPS configurations coincide with (complexified) hyperbolic monopoles. We then study the action of the preserved supersymmetry on the collective coordinates and show that demanding closure of the supersymmetry algebra constraints the geometry of the moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles, turning it into a so-called pluricomplex manifold, thus recovering a recent result of Bielawski and Schwachh\"ofer.
