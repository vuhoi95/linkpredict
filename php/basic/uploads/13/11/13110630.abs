Abstract: We present a method to obtain spectral functions at finite temperature and density from the Functional Renormalization Group. Our method is based on a thermodynamically consistent truncation of the flow equations for 2-point functions with analytically continued frequency components in the originally Euclidean external momenta. For the uniqueness of this continuation at finite temperature we furthermore implement the physical Baym-Mermin boundary conditions. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by calculating the mesonic spectral functions in the quark-meson model along the temperature axis of the phase diagram, and at finite quark chemical potential along the fixed-temperature line that crosses the critical endpoint of the model.
