Title: New Kinetic Interactions for Massive Gravity?
Authors: Claudia de Rham and Andrew Matas and Andrew J. Tolley
Abstract: We show that there can be no new Lorentz invariant kinetic interactions free from the Boulware-Deser ghost in four dimensions in the metric formulation of gravity, beyond the standard Einstein-Hilbert, up to total derivatives. We use dimensional deconstruction as a way to motivate a non-linear ansatz for potential new ghost free kinetic interactions for massive gravity, bi-gravity and multi-gravity in four and higher dimensions. These interactions descend from Lovelock terms, and so naively one might expect the interactions to be ghost free. However we show that these new interactions inevitably lead to more than five propagating degrees of freedom. We then perform a general perturbative analysis in four dimensions, and show that the only term with two derivatives that does not introduce a ghost is the Einstein-Hilbert term. This result extends to all orders in perturbations.
