Title: Dirac solutions for quaternionic potentials
Authors: Stefano De Leo and Sergio Giardino
Abstract: In this paper, the quaternionic Dirac equation is solved for quaternionic potentials, iV0+jW0. The study shows two different solutions. The first solution contains particles and anti-particles and leads to the diffusion, tunneling and Klein energy zones. The complex limit is recovered from this solution. The second solution, which does not have a complex counterpart, can be seen as a V0-antiparticle or |W0|-particle.
