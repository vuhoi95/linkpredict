Title: S-Duality for D3-Brane in NS-NS and R-R Backgrounds
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Chen-Te Ma
Abstract: We construct the low-energy effective field theory for a D3-brane in constant R-R 2-form potential background as the S-dual theory of a D3-brane in NS-NS B-field background. Despite the non-Abelian algebra of the noncommutative U(1) gauge symmetry, the electromagnetic duality transformation can be carried out to all orders, and the dual Lagrangian is given in a compact form. The gauge algebra is found to be a mixture of a deformed area-preserving diffeomorphism and the usual U(1) gauge symmetry.
