Title: Dark Energy from holographic theories with hyperscaling violation
Authors: Mariano Cadoni and Matteo Ciulu
Abstract: We show that analytical continuation maps scalar solitonic solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity, interpolating between an hyperscaling violating and an Anti de Sitter (AdS) region, in flat FLRW cosmological solutions sourced by a scalar field. We generate in this way exact FLRW solutions that can be used to model cosmological evolution driven by dark energy (a quintessence field) and usual matter. In absence of matter, the flow from the hyperscaling violating regime to the conformal AdS fixed point in holographic models corresponds to cosmological evolution from power-law expansion at early cosmic times to a de Sitter (dS) stable fixed point at late times. In presence of matter, we have a scaling regime at early times, followed by an intermediate regime in which dark energy tracks matter. At late times the solution exits the scaling regime with a sharp transition to a dS spacetime. The phase transition between hyperscaling violation and conformal fixed point observed in holographic gravity has a cosmological counterpart in the transition between a scaling era and a dS era dominated by the energy of the vacuum.
