Title: Holographic entanglement entropy of semi-local quantum liquids
Authors: Johanna Erdmenger and Da-Wei Pang and Hansj√∂rg Zeller
Abstract: We consider the holographic entanglement entropy of $(d+2)$-dimensional semi-local quantum liquids, for which the dual gravity background in the deep interior is $AdS_{2}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}$ multiplied by a warp factor which depends on the radial coordinate. The entropy density of this geometry goes to zero in the extremal limit. The thermodynamics associated with this semi-local background is discussed via dimensional analysis and scaling arguments. For the case of an asymptotically AdS UV completion of this geometry, we show that the entanglement entropy of a strip and an annulus exhibits a phase transition as a typical length of the different shapes is varied, while there is no sign of such a transition for the entanglement entropy of a sphere. Moreover, for the spherical entangling region, the leading order contribution to the entanglement entropy in the IR is calculated analytically. It exhibits an area law behaviour and agrees with the numerical result.
