Title: CMB anomalies from an inflationary model in string theory
Authors: Zhi-Guo Liu and Zong-Kuan Guo and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: Recent Planck measurements show some CMB anomalies on large angular scales, which confirms the early observations by WMAP. We show that an inflationary model, in which before the slow-roll inflation the Universe is in a superinflationary phase, can generate a large-scale cutoff in the primordial power spectrum, which may account for not only the power suppression on large angular scales, but also a large dipole power asymmetry in the CMB. We discuss an implementation of our model in string theory.
