Title: Supersymmetric Janus Solutions in Four Dimensions
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Krzysztof Pilch and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We use maximal gauged supergravity in four dimensions to construct the gravity dual of a class of supersymmetric conformal interfaces in the theory on the world-volume of multiple M2-branes. We study three classes of examples in which the $(1+1)$-dimensional defects preserve $(4,4)$, $(0,2)$ or $(0,1)$ supersymmetry. Many of the solutions have the maximally supersymmetric $AdS_4$ vacuum dual to the $\mathcal{N}=8$ ABJM theory on both sides of the interface. We also find new special classes of solutions including one that interpolates between the maximally supersymmetric vacuum and a conformal fixed point with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and $G_2$ global symmetry. We find another solution that interpolates between two distinct conformal fixed points with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and $G_2$ global symmetry. In eleven dimensions, this $G_2$ to $G_2$ solution corresponds to a domain wall across which a magnetic flux reverses orientation.
