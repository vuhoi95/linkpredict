Title: UV descriptions of composite Higgs models without elementary scalars
Authors: James Barnard and Tony Gherghetta and Tirtha Sankar Ray
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional UV descriptions of composite Higgs models without elementary scalars, in which four-fermion interactions are introduced to an underlying gauge theory like in the gauged NJL model. When the anomalous dimension of the fermion bilinear is large, these interactions drive the spontaneous global symmetry breaking in the model, with the Higgs identified as a Nambu-Goldstone boson. The UV descriptions support composite top partner operators, also with large anomalous dimensions, thereby providing an explicit realisation of the idea of partial compositeness. In particular, the composite SO(6)/SO(5) model can be described by an Sp gauge theory with four flavours of fermion, together with a vector-like pair of fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation and charged under SU(3) colour. These fermions confine to produce both the Higgs and top partner bound states. Our methods can also be applied to different coset groups, suggesting that four-fermion operators can describe the underlying UV dynamics of other composite Higgs models.
