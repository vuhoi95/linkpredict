Title: Chern-Simons Superconductor
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: We study the effect of a bulk Chern-Simons (CS) term on 3+1 dimensional type II superconductor in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We holographically compute the super-current and find that it is non-local in nature. It receives non trivial corrections due to presence of the CS term. Considering a large limit of a parameter "lambda" (we call this limit as long wave length limit), which is effectively the high temperature limit of the theory, we find that this non-local super-current boils down to a local quantity. The leading term (without the CS term) of this current matches with the result of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. We compute the effect of the CS term on GL current and find that the effect is highly suppressed at large temperature (~1/T^4). Finally, free energy of the vortex configuration has been calculated. The free energy also receives non trivial correction at the order of 1/lambda^2 in the long wave length approximation.
