Title: Shooting String Holography of Jet Quenching at RHIC and LHC
Authors: Andrej Ficnar and Steven S. Gubser and Miklos Gyulassy
Abstract: We derive a new formula for jet energy loss using finite endpoint momentum shooting strings initial conditions in SYM plasmas to overcome the difficulties of previous falling string holographic scenarios. We apply the new formula to compute the nuclear modification factor RAA and the elliptic flow parameter v2 of light hadrons at RHIC and LHC. We show furthermore that Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature corrections to the AdS5 geometry improve the agreement with the recent data.
