Title: Hairy planar black holes in higher dimensions
Authors: Andres Acena and Andres Anabalon and Dumitru Astefanesei and Robert Mann
Abstract: We construct exact hairy planar black holes in D-dimensional AdS gravity. These solutions are regular except at the singularity and have stress-energy that satisfies the null energy condition. We present a detailed analysis of their thermodynamical properties and show that the first law is satisfied. We also discuss these solutions in the context of AdS/CFT duality and construct the associated c-function.
