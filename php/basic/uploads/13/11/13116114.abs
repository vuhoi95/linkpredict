Authors: D. Arnaudov and R. C. Rashkov and T. Vetsov
Abstract: There have been recent advances in the construction of algebraic curves for certain classes of string solutions in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this paper we obtain the Lax operators and associated spectral curves for circular and folded string solutions in $\,\textrm{AdS}_5\times S^5$. In addition, we provide an original approach for the reconstruction of string solutions in $\,S^3$ from their corresponding curves.
