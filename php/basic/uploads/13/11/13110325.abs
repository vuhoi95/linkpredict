Abstract: In this paper, the main properties of (3+1)-dimensional $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls are examined. In particular, it is shown that the relation $\frac{dE}{dQ}=\omega$ holds for such gauged Q-balls in the general case. As a consequence, it is shown that the well-known estimate for the maximal charge of stable gauged Q-balls was derived by means of an inconsistent procedure and can not be considered as correct. A simple method for obtaining the main characteristics of gauged Q-balls using only the nongauged background solution for the scalar field in the case, when the back-reaction of the gauge field on the scalar field is small and the linearized theory can be used, is proposed. The criteria of applicability of the linearized theory, which do not reduce to the demand of the smallness of the coupling constant, are established. Some interesting properties of gauged Q-balls, as well as the advantages of the proposed method, are demonstrated by the example of two models, admitting, in the linear approximation in the perturbations, exact analytic solutions for gauged Q-balls.
