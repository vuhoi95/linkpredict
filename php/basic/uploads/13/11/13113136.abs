Title: Quantum corrections to extremal black brane solutions
Authors: Susanne Barisch-Dick and Gabriel Lopes Cardoso and Michael Haack and Alvaro Veliz-Osorio
Abstract: We discuss quantum corrections to extremal black brane solutions in N=2 U(1) gauged supergravity in four dimensions. We consider modifications due to a certain class of higher-derivative terms as well as perturbative corrections to the prepotential. We use the entropy function formalism to assess the impact of these corrections on singular brane solutions and we give a few examples. We then use first-order flow equations to construct solutions that interpolate between quantum corrected fixed points of the associated potentials.
