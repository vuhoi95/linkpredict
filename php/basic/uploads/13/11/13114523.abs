Title: Investigating Unitarity in Presence of Anomalous Couplings
Authors: Mamta Dahiya and Sukanta Dutta and Rashidul Islam
Abstract: We perform a model independent analysis of the helicity amplitudes at high energy for all the $2\to2$ scattering processes involving gauge and Higgs bosons in the presence of anomalous $WWV$, $WWVV$, $VVH$, $VVHH$ ($V\equiv Z,\gamma$ and $W^\pm$), $HHHH$ and $HHH$ interactions. We obtain the perturbative unitarity constraints on anomalous couplings by demanding the vanishing of terms proportional to $s^2$ and $s^{3/2}$ in the helicity amplitudes. Using these constraints, we also compute the upper bound on all the anomalous couplings from terms linear in $s$. Further, assuming all anomalous couplings to have arisen only from dimension six operators, we show that the perturbative unitarity violation can be evaded up to $\sim$ 9 TeV corresponding to the best fit values of $f_{WW}/\Lambda^2$ and $f_{BB}/\Lambda^2$ from the combined analysis of Tevatron and LHC data.
