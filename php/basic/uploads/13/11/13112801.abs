Abstract: Inspired from the inflation brane world cosmology, we study the thermodynamics of a black hole solution in two dimensional dilaton gravity with an arctangent potential background. We first derive the two dimensional black hole geometry, then we examine its asymptotic behaviors. More precisely, we find that such behaviors exhibit properties appearing in some known cases including the Anti de Sitter and the Schwarzchild black holes. Using the complex path method, we compute the Hawking radiation. The entropy function can be related to the value of the potential at the horizon.
