Title: More on thermal probes of a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma
Authors: Viktor Jahnke and Andres Luna and Leonardo Patino and Diego Trancanelli
Abstract: We extend the analysis of 1211.2199, where the photon production rate of an anisotropic strongly coupled plasma with Nf<<Nc massless quarks was considered. We allow here for non-vanishing quark masses and study how these affect the spectral densities and conductivities. We also compute another important probe of the plasma, the dilepton production rate. We consider generic angles between the anisotropic direction and the photon and dilepton wave vectors, as well as arbitrary quark masses and arbitrary values of the anisotropy parameter. Generically, the anisotropy increases the production rate of both photons and dileptons, compared with an isotropic plasma at the same temperature.
