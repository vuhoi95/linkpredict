Title: On transition of non-stationary waves
Authors: Kenzo Ishikawa and Yutaka Tobita
Abstract: The probability of the events that the final states are detected with or interact with the nucleus in a finite time interval T was found to be, $P=\text T \Gamma_0 +P^{(d)}$. $\Gamma_0$ is computed with Fermi's golden rule, and does not depend on the nuclear wave functions. $P^{(d)}$ is not given by Fermi's golden rule, and depends on the nuclear wave functions. In the electron mode of pion decays, $\Gamma_0$ is proportional to $m_e^2$ but $P^{(d)}$ for the event that the neutrino is detected is proportional to $m_{\nu}^{-2}$. $P^{(d)}$ does not hold the helicity suppression satisfied in $\Gamma_0$ and is inevitable in non-stationary quantum phenomena.
