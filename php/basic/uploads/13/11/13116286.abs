Title: Heat Kernels on the AdS(2) cone and Logarithmic Corrections to Extremal  Black Hole Entropy
Authors: Rajesh Kumar Gupta and Shailesh Lal and Somyadip Thakur
Abstract: We develop new techniques to efficiently evaluate heat kernel coefficients for the Laplacian in the short-time expansion on spheres and hyperboloids with conical singularities. We then apply these techniques to explicitly compute the logarithmic contribution to black hole entropy from an N=4 vector multiplet about a Z(N) orbifold of the near-horizon geometry of quarter--BPS black holes in N=4 supergravity. We find that this vanishes, matching perfectly with the prediction from the microstate counting. We also discuss possible generalisations of our heat kernel results to higher-spin fields over Z(N) orbifolds of higher-dimensional spheres and hyperboloids.
