Title: Quantum ideal hydrodynamics on the lattice
Authors: Tommy Burch and Giorgio Torrieri
Abstract: After discussing the problem of defining the hydrodynamic limit from microscopic scales, we give an introduction to ideal hydrodynamics in the Lagrange picture, and show that it can be viewed as a field theory, which can be quantized using the usual Feynman sum-over-paths prescription. We then argue that this picture can be connected to the usually neglected thermal microscopic scale in the hydrodynamic expansion. After showing that this expansion is generally non-perturbative, we show how the lattice can be used to understand the impact quantum and thermal fluctuations can have on the fluid behavior.
