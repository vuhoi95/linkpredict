Title: Gravitomagnetism and Non-commutative Geometry
Authors: Behrooz Malekolkalami and Mehrdad Farhoudi
Abstract: Similarity between the gravitoelectromagnetism and the electromagnetism is discussed. We show that the gravitomagnetic field (similar to the magnetic field) can be equivalent to the non-commutative effect of the momentum sector of the phase space when one maintains only the first order of the non-commutative parameters. This is performed through two approaches. In one approach, by employing the Feynman proof, the existence of a Lorentz-like force in the gravitoelectromagnetism is indicated. The appearance of such a force is subjected to the slow motion and the weak field approximations for stationary fields. The analogy between this Lorentz-like force and the motion equation of a test particle in a non-commutative space leads to the mentioned equivalency. In fact, this equivalency is achieved by the comparison of the two motion equations. In the other and quietly independent approach, we demonstrate that a gravitomagnetic background can be treated as a Dirac constraint. That is, the gravitoelectromagnetic field can be regarded as a constrained system from the sense of the Dirac theory. Indeed, the application of the Dirac formalism for the gravitoelectromagnetic field reveals that the phase space coordinates have non-commutative structure from the view of the Dirac bracket. Particularly, the gravitomagnetic field as a weak field induces the non-trivial Dirac bracket of the momentum sector which displays the non-commutativity.
