Title: The trouble with twisting (2,0) theory
Authors: Louise Anderson and Hampus Linander
Abstract: We consider a twisted version of the abelian $(2,0)$ theory placed upon a Lorenzian six-manifold with a product structure, $M_6=C \times M_4 $. This is done by an investigation of the free tensor multiplet on the level of equations of motion, where the problem of its formulation in Euclidean signature is circumvented by letting the time-like direction lie in the two-manifold $C$ and performing a topological twist along $M_4$ alone. A compactification on $C$ is shown to be necessary to enable the possibility of finding a topological field theory. The hypothetical twist along a Euclidean $C$ is argued to amount to the correct choice of linear combination of the two supercharges scalar on $M_4$. This procedure is expected and conjectured to result in a topological field theory, but we arrive at the surprising conclusion that this twisted theory contains no $Q$-exact and covariantly conserved stress tensor unless $M_4$ has vanishing curvature. This is to our knowledge a phenomenon which has not been observed before in topological field theories. In the literature, the setup of the twisting used here has been suggested as the origin of the conjectured AGT-correspondence, and our hope is that this work may somehow contribute to the understanding of it.
