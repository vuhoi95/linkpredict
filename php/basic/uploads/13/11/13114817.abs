Abstract: We develop a deformation method for attaining new magnetic monopole analytical solutions consistent with generalized Yang-Mills-Higgs model introduced recently. The new solutions fulfill the usual radially symmetric ansatz and the boundary conditions suitable to assure finite energy configurations. We verify our prescription by studying some particular cases involving both exactly and partially analytical initial configurations whose deformation leads to new analytic BPS monopoles. The results show consistency among the models, the deformation procedure and the profile of the new solutions.
