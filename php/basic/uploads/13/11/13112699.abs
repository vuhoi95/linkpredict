Abstract: Via numerical and analytical methods, the effects of the Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$ on holographic superconductors are studied in some detail, including $s$ wave and $p$ wave models. Working in the probe limit, we find that the behaviors of holographic models indeed depend on concrete value of $z$. We obtain the condensation and conductivity in both Lifshitz black hole and soliton backgrounds with general $z$. For both $s$ wave and $p$ wave models in the black hole backgrounds, as $z$ increases, the phase transition becomes more difficult and the growth of conductivity is suppressed. For the Lifshitz soliton backgrounds, when $z$ increases ($z=1,~2,~3$), the critical chemical potential decreases in the $s$ wave cases but increases in the $p$ wave cases. For $p$ wave models in both Lifshitz black hole and soliton backgrounds, the anisotropy between the AC conductivity in different spatial directions is suppressed when $z$ increases. The analytical results uphold the numerical results.
