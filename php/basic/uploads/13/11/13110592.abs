Title: Local free-fall Temperature of GMGHS Black Holes
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Jaedong Choi and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We obtain a (5+1)-dimensional global flat embedding of the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger spacetime in Einstein frame, and a (5+2)-dimensional global flat embedding in string frame. We show that the local free-fall temperatures for freely falling observers in each frames are finite at the event horizons, while the local temperatures for fiducial observers are divergent. We also observe that the local free-fall temperatures differ between the two frames.
