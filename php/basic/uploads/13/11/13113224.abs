Title: Non-Gaussian signatures of general inflationary trajectories
Authors: Jonathan S. Horner and Carlo R. Contaldi
Abstract: We carry out a numerical calculation of the bispectrum in generalised trajectories of canonical, single--field inflation. The trajectories are generated in the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) formalism based on Hubble Slow Roll (HSR) parameters. The calculation allows generally shape and scale dependent bispectra, or dimensionless $f_{NL}$, in the out-of-slow-roll regime. The distributions of $f_{NL}$ for various shapes and HSR proposals are shown as an example of how this procedure can be used within the context of Monte Carlo exploration of inflationary trajectories. We also show how allowing out-of-slow-roll behaviour can lead to a bispectrum that is relatively large for equilateral shapes.
