Title: Geometrization of N-Extended 1-Dimensional Supersymmetry Algebras
Authors: Charles Doran and Kevin Iga and Greg Landweber and Stefan Mendez-Diez
Abstract: The problem of classifying off-shell representations of the $N$-extended one-dimensional super Poincar\'{e} algebra is closely related to the study of a class of decorated graphs known as Adinkras. We show that these combinatorial objects possess a form of emergent supergeometry: Adinkras are equivalent to very special super Riemann surfaces with divisors. The method of proof critically involves Grothendieck's theory of "dessins d'enfants'', work of Cimasoni-Reshetikhin expressing spin structures on Riemann surfaces via dimer models, and an observation of Donagi-Witten on parabolic structure from ramified coverings of super Riemann surfaces.
