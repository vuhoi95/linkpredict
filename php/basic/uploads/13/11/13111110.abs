Title: Localization and real Jacobi forms
Authors: Sujay K. Ashok and Nima Doroud and Jan Troost
Abstract: We calculate the elliptic genus of two dimensional abelian gauged linear sigma models with (2,2) supersymmetry using supersymmetric localization. The matter sector contains charged chiral multiplets as well as Stueckelberg fields coupled to the vector multiplets. These models include theories that flow in the infrared to non-linear sigma models with target spaces that are non-compact Kahler manifolds with U(N) isometry and with an asymptotically linear dilaton direction. The elliptic genera are the modular completions of mock Jacobi forms that have been proposed recently using complementary arguments. We also compute the elliptic genera of models that contain multiple Stueckelberg fields from first principles.
