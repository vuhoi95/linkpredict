Title: Resummation of scalar correlator in higher spin black hole background
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We consider the proposal that predicts holographic duality between certain 2D minimal models at large central charge and Vasiliev 3D higher spin gravity with a single complex field. We compute the scalar correlator in the background of a higher spin black hole at order $\mathcal O(\alpha^{5})$ in the chemical potential $\alpha$ associated with the spin-3 charge. The calculation is performed at generic values of the symmetry algebra $\mbox{hs}[\lambda]$ parameter $\lambda$ and for the scalar in three different representations. We then study the perturbative data in the large $\lambda$ limit and discover remarkable regularities. This leads to formulate a closed formula for the resummation of the leading and subleading terms that scale like $\mathcal O(\alpha^{n}\lambda^{2n})$ and $\mathcal O(\alpha^{n}\,\lambda^{2n-1})$ respectively.
