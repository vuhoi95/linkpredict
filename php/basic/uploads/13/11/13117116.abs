Title: Dirac Sigma Models from Gauging
Authors: Vladimir Salnikov and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: The G/G WZW model results from the WZW-model by a standard procedure of gauging. G/G WZW models are members of Dirac sigma models, which also contain twisted Poisson sigma models as other examples. We show how the general class of Dirac sigma models can be obtained from a gauging procedure adapted to Lie algebroids in the form of an equivariantly closed extension. The rigid gauge groups are generically infinite dimensional and a standard gauging procedure would give a likewise infinite number of 1-form gauge fields; the proposed construction yields the requested finite number of them. Although physics terminology is used, the presentation is kept accessible also for a mathematical audience.
