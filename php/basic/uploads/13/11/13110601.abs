Title: On hyperbolicity violations in cosmological models with vector fields
Authors: Alexey Golovnev and Aleksandr Klementev
Abstract: Cosmological models with vector fields received much attention in recent years. Unfortunately, most of them are plagued with severe instabilities or other problems. In particular, it was noted by G. Esposito-Farese, C. Pitrou and J.-Ph. Uzan in arXiv:0912.0481 that the models with a non-linear function of the Maxwellian kinetic term do always imply violations of hyperbolicity somewhere in the phase space. In this work we make this statement more precise in several respects and show that those violations may not be present around spatially homogeneous configurations of the vector field.
