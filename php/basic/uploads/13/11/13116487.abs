Title: Quadratic Palatini gravity and stable black hole remnants
Authors: Francisco S. N. Lobo and Gonzalo J. Olmo and D. Rubiera-Garcia
Abstract: We present a four-dimensional Planck-scale corrected quadratic extension of General Relativity (GR) where no a priori relation between metric and connection is imposed (Palatini formalism). Static spherically symmetric electrovacuum solutions are obtained in exact analytical form. The macroscopic properties of these solutions are in excellent agreement with GR, though the region around the central singularity is modified. In fact, the singularity is generically replaced by a wormhole supported by the electric field, which provides a non-trivial topology to the space-time. Moreover, for a certain charge-to-mass ratio the geometry is completely regular everywhere. For such regular solutions, the horizon disappears in the microscopic regime below a critical number of charges ($N<17$), yielding a set of massive objects that could be naturally identified as black hole remnants.
