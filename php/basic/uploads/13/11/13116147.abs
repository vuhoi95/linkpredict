Title: Branched Hamiltonians and Supersymmetry
Authors: Thomas L Curtright and Cosmas K Zachos
Abstract: Some examples of branched Hamiltonians are explored both classically and in the context of quantum mechanics, as recently advocated by Shapere and Wilczek. These are in fact cases of switchback potentials, albeit in momentum space, as previously analyzed for quasi-Hamiltonian chaotic dynamical systems in a classical setting, and as encountered in analogous renormalization group flows for quantum theories which exhibit RG cycles. A basic two-worlds model, with a pair of Hamiltonian branches related by supersymmetry, is considered in detail.
