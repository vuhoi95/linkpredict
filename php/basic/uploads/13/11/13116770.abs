Title: Supergravity Inflation with Broken Shift Symmetry and Large  Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio
Authors: Tianjun Li and Zhijin Li and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We propose a class of inflation models with potential V(\phi)=\alpha \phi^n exp(-\beta^m \phi^m). We show that such kind of inflaton potentials can be realized in supergravity theory with a small shift symmetry breaking term in the K\"ahler potential. We find that the models with (m=1, n=1), (m=1, n=2), (m=2, n=1), and (m=2, n=3/2) can easily accommodate the Planck results. In particular, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is larger than 0.01 in the 1\sigma region. Thus, these models generate the typical large field inflation, and can be tested at the future Planck and QUBIC experiments.
