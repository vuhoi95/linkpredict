Title: Heat kernel coefficients on Kahler manifolds
Authors: Kefeng Liu and Hao Xu
Abstract: Polterovich proved a remarkable closed formula for heat kernel coefficients of the Laplace operator on compact Riemannian manifolds involving powers of Laplacians acting on the distance function. In the case of K\"ahler manifolds, we prove a combinatorial formula simplifying powers of the complex Laplacian and use it to derive a graph theoretic formula for heat kernel coefficients based on Polterovich's formula.
