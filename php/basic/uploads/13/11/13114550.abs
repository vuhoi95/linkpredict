Title: The shortened KK spectrum of IIB supergravity on Y^{p,q}
Authors: Arash Arabi Ardehali and James T. Liu and Phillip Szepietowski
Abstract: We examine the shortened KK spectrum of IIB supergravity compactified on Y^{p,q} and conjecture that the spectrum we have obtained is complete. The (untwisted) shortened spectrum on S^5/Z_{2p} and T^{1,1}/Z_p are obtained as special cases when p=q and q=0, respectively. Knowledge of the shortened spectrum allows us to compute the superconformal index of these theories and to find agreement with earlier calculations from the dual field theories. We also employ the shortened spectrum to perform a 1/N^2 test of AdS/CFT by holographically reproducing the difference of the central charges, c-a=p/8, of the dual CFTs.
