Title: Logarithmic Exotic Conformal Galilean Algebras
Authors: Malte Henkel and Ali Hosseiny and Shahin Rouhani
Abstract: Logarithmic representations of the conformal Galilean algebra (CGA) and the Exotic Conformal Galilean algebra ({\sc ecga}) are constructed. This can be achieved by non-decomposable representations of the scaling dimensions or the rapidity indices, specific to conformal galilean algebras. Logarithmic representations of the non-exotic CGA lead to the expected constraints on scaling dimensions and rapidities and also on the logarithmic contributions in the co-variant two-point functions. On the other hand, the {\sc ecga} admits several distinct situations which are distinguished by different sets of constraints and distinct scaling forms of the two-point functions. Two distinct realisations for the spatial rotations are identified as well. The first example of a reducible, but non-decomposable representation, without logarithmic terms in the two-point function is given.
