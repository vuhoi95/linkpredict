Title: Behind the Horizon in AdS/CFT
Authors: Erik Verlinde and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We extend the recent proposal of Papadodimas and Raju of a CFT construction of operators inside the black hole interior to arbitrary non-maximally mixed states. Our construction builds on the general prescription given in earlier work, based on ideas from quantum error correction. We indicate how the CFT state dependence of the interior modes can be removed by introducing an external system, such as an observer, that is entangled with the CFT.
