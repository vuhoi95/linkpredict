Authors: Shankhadeep Chakrabortty and Somdeb Chakraborty and Najmul Haque
Abstract: We employ methods of gauge/string duality to analyze the Brownian motion and the concomitant Langevin equation of a heavy quark in a strongly coupled, thermal, anisotropic Yang-Mills plasma. We consider fluctuations both along and perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy and study the effects of anisotropy on the drag coefficient, the diffusion constant and the Langevin coefficient for both the directions. We also verify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for Brownian motion in an anisotropic medium.
