Title: Dyonic AdS black holes in maximal gauged supergravity
Authors: David D. K. Chow and Geoffrey Comp√®re
Abstract: We present two new classes of dyonic anti-de Sitter black hole solutions of 4-dimensional maximal N=8, SO(8) gauged supergravity. They are: (1) static black holes of N=2, U(1)^4 gauged supergravity with 4 electric and 4 magnetic charges, with spherical, planar or hyperbolic horizons; and (2) rotating black holes of N=2, U(1)^2 gauged supergravity with 2 electric and 2 magnetic charges. We study their thermodynamics, and point out that the formulation of a consistent thermodynamics for dyonic anti-de Sitter black holes is dependent on the existence of boundary conditions for the gauge fields. We identify several distinct classes of boundary conditions for gauge fields in U(1)^4 supergravity. We study a general family of metrics containing the rotating solutions, and find Killing-Yano tensors with torsion in two conformal frames, which underlie separability.
