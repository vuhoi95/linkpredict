Title: Charge-mass ratio bound and optimization in the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling  model of Hawking radiation
Authors: Kyung Kiu Kim and Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: In this letter, we study the mutual information hidden in the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling model of Hawking radiation for Reissner-Norstrom black holes. We argue that the condition of nonnegativity of mutual information suggests bound(s) for charge-mass ratio of emitted particles. We further view the radiation as an optimization process and discuss its effect on time evolution of a charged black hole.
