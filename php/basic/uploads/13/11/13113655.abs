Title: Far from equilibrium energy flow in quantum critical systems
Authors: M. J. Bhaseen and Benjamin Doyon and Andrew Lucas and Koenraad Schalm
Abstract: We investigate far from equilibrium energy transport in strongly coupled quantum critical systems. Combining results from gauge-gravity duality, relativistic hydrodynamics, and quantum field theory, we argue that long-time energy transport occurs via a universal steady-state for any spatial dimensionality. This is described by a boosted thermal state. We determine the transport properties of this emergent steady state, including the average energy flow and its long-time fluctuations.
