Title: Thermodynamic and classical instability of AdS black holes in  fourth-order gravity
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Taeyoon Moon
Abstract: We study thermodynamic and classical instability of AdS black holes in fourth-order gravity. These include the BTZ black hole in new massive gravity, Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, and higher-dimensional AdS black holes in fourth-order gravity. All thermodynamic quantities which are computed using the Abbot-Deser-Tekin method are used to study thermodynamic instability of AdS black holes. On the other hand, we investigate the $s$-mode Gregory-Laflamme instability of the massive graviton propagating around the AdS black holes. We establish the connection between the thermodynamic instability and the GL instability of AdS black holes in fourth-order gravity. This may show the Gubser-Mitra conjecture which holds for AdS black holes found from fourth-order gravity.
