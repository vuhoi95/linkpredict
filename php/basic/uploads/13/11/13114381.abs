Abstract: We address the problem of nonperturbative calculations on the light front in quantum field theory regularized by Pauli-Villars method. As a preliminary step we construct light front Hamiltonians in (2+1)-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ model, for the cases without and with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The renormalization of these Hamiltonians in Pauli-Villars regularization is carried out via comparison of all-order perturbation theory, generated by these Hamiltonians, and the corresponding covariant perturbation theory in Lorentz coordinates.
