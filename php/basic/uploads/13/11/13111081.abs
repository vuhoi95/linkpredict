Title: Brans-Dicke theory in the local potential approximation
Authors: Dario Benedetti and Filippo Guarnieri
Abstract: We study the Brans-Dicke theory with arbitrary potential within a functional renormalization group framework. Motivated by the asymptotic safety scenario of quantum gravity and by the well-known relation between f(R) gravity and Brans-Dicke theory at the classical level, we concentrate our analysis on the fixed-point equation for the potential in four dimensions and with Brans-Dicke parameter omega equal to zero. For two different choices of gauge, we study the resulting equations by examining both local and global properties of the solutions, by means of analytical and numerical methods. As a result of our analysis we do not find any nontrivial fixed point in one gauge, but we find a continuum of fixed points in the other one. We interpret such inconsistency as a result of the restriction to omega equal to zero, and thus we suggest that it indicates a failure of the equivalence between f(R) gravity and Brans-Dicke theory at the quantum level.
