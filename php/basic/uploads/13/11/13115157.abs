Title: A simple holographic model of momentum relaxation
Authors: Tomas Andrade and Benjamin Withers
Abstract: We consider a holographic model consisting of Einstein-Maxwell theory in (d+1) bulk spacetime dimensions with (d-1) massless scalar fields. Momentum relaxation is realised simply through spatially dependent sources for operators dual to the neutral scalars, which can be engineered so that the bulk stress tensor and resulting black brane geometry are homogeneous and isotropic. We analytically calculate the DC conductivity, which is finite. In the d=3 case, both the black hole geometry and shear-mode current-current correlators are those of a sector of massive gravity.
