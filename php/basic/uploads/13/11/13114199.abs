Title: 5-Brane Webs, Symmetry Enhancement, and Duality in 5d Supersymmetric  Gauge Theory
Authors: Oren Bergman and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez and Gabi Zafrir
Abstract: We present a number of investigations of 5d ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories that make use of 5-brane web constructions and the 5d superconformal index. These include an observation of enhanced global symmetry in the 5d fixed point theory corresponding to $SU(N)$ gauge theory with Chern-Simons level $\pm N$, enhanced global symmetries in quiver theories, and dualities between quiver theories and non-quiver theories. Instanton contributions play a crucial role throughout.
