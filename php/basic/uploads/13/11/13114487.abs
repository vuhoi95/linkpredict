Title: Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking probed by geometric invariants
Authors: Antonio Capolupo and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: The presence of the Aharonov-Anandan invariant in phenomena in which vacuum condensates are physically relevant can help to reveal the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking induced by condensates. The analysis is presented in the case of the Wess--Zumino model. The manifestation of the Aharonov-Anandan invariant of atoms and their superpartners, generated at non-zero temperature, could reveal the signature of SUSY violation in a recently proposed experimental setup based on an optical lattice in which SUSY is broken at non-zero temperature.
