Title: The $\mathcal{N}=1$ Chiral Multiplet on $T^2\times S^2$ and  Supersymmetric Localization
Authors: Cyril Closset and Itamar Shamir
Abstract: We compute the supersymmetric partition function of an $\mathcal{N}=1$ chiral multiplet coupled to an external Abelian gauge field on complex manifolds with $T^2 \times S^2$ topology. The result is locally holomorphic in the complex structure moduli of $T^2\times S^2$. This computation illustrates in a simple example some recently obtained constraints on the parameter dependence of supersymmetric partition functions. We also devise a simple method to compute the chiral multiplet partition function on any four-manifold $\mathcal{M}_4$ preserving two supercharges of opposite chiralities, via supersymmetric localization. In the case of $\mathcal{M}_4=S^3\times S^1$, we provide a path integral derivation of the previously known result, the elliptic gamma function, which emphasizes its dependence on the $S^3 \times S^1$ complex structure moduli.
