Title: Un-Casimir effect
Authors: Antonia M. Frassino and Piero Nicolini and Orlando Panella
Abstract: In this paper we present the un-Casimir effect, namely the study of the Casimir energy related to the presence of an un-particle component in addition to the electromagnetic field contribution. We derive this result by considering modifications of the Feynman propagator in the unparticle sector. The contribution of unparticles turns out to be the integral of Casimir energies for particles at fixed mass with a weight depending on the scaling dimension. The distinctive feature of the un-Casimir effect is a fractalization of metallic plates. This fact emerges through a new dependence of the Casimir energy on the distance between plates, that scales with a continuous power controlled by the scaling dimension. More importantly the un-Casimir effect offers a reliable testbed for unparticle physics. We find bounds on the unparticle scale that are independent on the effective coupling constant describing the interaction between the scale invariant sector and ordinary matter. Therefore the un-Casimir effect, contrary to what found in previous unparticle physics situations (\textit{e.g.} g-2 and a variety LEP/LHC data analyses), actually removes the ambiguity associated to the value of such a coupling. We also discuss some of the possible implications for unparticle physics when non-perfect conducting plates are considered.
