Title: A First Experimental Limit on In-matter Torsion from Neutron Spin  Rotation in Liquid He-4
Authors: Ralf Lehnert and H. Yan and W. M. Snow
Abstract: We report the first experimental upper bound to our knowledge on possible in-matter torsion interactions of the neutron from a recent search for parity violation in neutron spin rotation in liquid He-4. Our experiment constrains a coefficient $\zeta$ consisting of a linear combination of parameters involving the time components of the torsion fields $T^\mu$ and $A^\mu$ from the nucleons and electrons in helium which violates parity. We report an upper bound of $|\zeta|<9.1x10^{-23}$ GeV at 68% confidence level and indicate other physical processes that could be analyzed to constrain in-matter torsion.
