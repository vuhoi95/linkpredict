Abstract: We present new results towards the construction of the most general black hole solutions in four-dimensional Fayet-Iliopoulos gauged supergravities. In these theories black holes can be asymptotically AdS and have arbitrary mass, angular momentum, electric and magnetic charges and NUT charge. Furthermore, a wide range of horizon topologies is allowed (compact and noncompact) and the complex scalar fields have a nontrivial radial and angular profile. We construct a large class of solutions in the simplest single scalar model with prepotential $F = -i X^0 X^1$ and discuss their thermodynamics. Moreover, various approaches and calculational tools for facing this problem with more general prepotentials are presented.
