Title: Superdescendants of the D1D5 CFT and their dual 3-charge geometries
Authors: Stefano Giusto and Rodolfo Russo
Abstract: We describe how to obtain the gravity duals of semiclassical states in the D1-D5 CFT that are superdescendants of a class of RR ground states. On the gravity side, the configurations we construct are regular and asymptotically reproduce the 3-charge D1-D5-P black hole compactified on $S^1\times T^4$. The geometries depend trivially on the $T^4$ directions but non-trivially on the remaining 6D space. In the decoupling limit, they reduce to asymptotically AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ spaces that are dual to CFT states obtained by acting with (exponentials of) the operators of the superconformal algebra. As explicit examples, we generalise the solution first constructed in arXiv:1306.1745 and discuss another class of states that have a more complicated dual geometry. By using the free orbifold description of the CFT we calculate the average values for momentum and the angular momenta of these configurations. Finally we compare the CFT results with those obtained in the bulk from the asymptotically $M^{1,4} \times S^1\times T^4$ region.
