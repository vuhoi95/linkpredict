Title: Transition electromagnetic form factor in the Minkowski space  Bethe-Salpeter approach
Authors: J. Carbonell and V. A. Karmanov
Abstract: Using the solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in Minkowski space for bound and scattering states found in previous works, we calculate the transition electromagnetic form factor describing the electro-disintegration of a bound system.
