Title: Baryonic sphere: a spherical domain wall carrying baryon number
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We construct a spherical domain wall which has baryon charge distributed on a sphere of finite radius in a Skyrme model with a sixth order derivative term and a modified mass term. Its distribution of energy density likewise takes the form of a sphere. In order to localize the domain wall at a finite radius we need a negative coefficient in front of the Skyrme term and a positive coefficient of the sixth order derivative term to stabilize the soliton. Increasing the pion mass pronounces the shell-like structure of the configuration.
