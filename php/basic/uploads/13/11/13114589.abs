Title: A Higher-Spin Chern-Simons Theory of Anyons
Authors: Nicolas Boulanger and Per Sundell and Mauricio Valenzuela
Abstract: We propose Chern-Simons models of fractional-spin fields interacting with ordinary tensorial higher-spin fields and internal color gauge fields. For integer and half-integer values of the fractional spins, the model reduces to finite sets of fields modulo infinite-dimensional ideals. We present the model on-shell using Fock-space representations of the underlying deformed-oscillator algebra.
