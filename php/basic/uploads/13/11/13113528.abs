Abstract: A new version of the q-deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics (q-SQM), which is inspired by the Tamm--Dankoff-type (TD-type) deformation of quantum harmonic oscillator, is constructed. The obtained algebra of q-SQM is similar to that in Spiridonov's approach. However, within our version of q-SQM, the ground state found explicitly in the special case of superpotential yiealding q-superoscillator turns out to be non-Gaussian and takes the form of special (TD-type) q-deformed Gaussian.
