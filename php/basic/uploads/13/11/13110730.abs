Title: A step towards exploring the features of Gravidilaton sector in  Randall-Sundrum scenario via lightest Kaluza-Klein graviton mass
Authors: Sayantan Choudhury and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: In this paper we study the role of the 5D Gauss-Bonnet corrections and two loop higher genus contribution to the gravity action in type IIB string theory inspired low energy supergravity theory in the light of gravidilatonic interactions on the lightest Kaluza-Klein graviton mass spectrum. From the latest constraints on the lightest Kaluza-Klein graviton mass as obtained from the ATLAS dilepton search in 7 TeV proton-proton collision, we have shown that due to the presence of Gauss-Bonnet and string loop corrections, the warping solution in an ${\bf AdS_{5}}$ bulk is quite distinct from Randall-Sundrum scenario. We discuss the constraints on the model parameters to fit with present ATLAS data.
