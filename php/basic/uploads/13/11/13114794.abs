Title: Torsional Newton-Cartan Geometry and Lifshitz Holography
Authors: Morten H. Christensen and Jelle Hartong and Niels A. Obers and Blaise Rollier
Abstract: We obtain the Lifshitz UV completion in a specific model for z=2 Lifshitz geometries. We use a vielbein formalism which enables identification of all the sources as leading components of well-chosen bulk fields. We show that the geometry induced from the bulk onto the boundary is a novel extension of Newton-Cartan geometry with a specific torsion tensor. We explicitly compute all the vevs including the boundary stress-energy tensor and their Ward identities. After using local symmetries/Ward identities the system exhibits 6+6 sources and vevs. The FG expansion exhibits, however, an additional free function which is related to an irrelevant operator whose source has been turned off. We show that this is related to a second UV completion.
