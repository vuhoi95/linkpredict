Title: Horava-Lifshitz Gravity Effects on Casimir Energy in Weak Field  Approximation and Infrared Regime
Authors: C. R. Muniz and V. B. Bezerra and M. S. Cunha
Abstract: We calculate the renormalized vacuum energy of a massless scalar field confined between two nearby parallel plates formed by ideal uncharged conductors, placed tangentially to the surface of a sphere with mass M and radius R. This study will take into account the static and spherically symmetric solution of Horava-Lifshitz gravity found by Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS), in both weak field and infrared limits. A slight amplification of the Casimir force between the conducting plates is found. Thermal corrections to the Casimir energy are analyzed. Based on current Casimir effect measurements, a constraint on the $\omega$ parameter of KS metric is also obtained.
