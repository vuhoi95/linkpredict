Title: Cyclic Leibniz rule: a formulation of supersymmetry on lattice
Authors: Mitsuhiro Kato and Makoto Sakamoto and Hiroto So
Abstract: For the purpose of constructing supersymmetric(SUSY) theories on lattice, we propose a new type relation on lattice -cyclic Leibniz rule(CLR)- which is slightly different from an ordinary Leibniz rule. Actually, we find that CLR can enlarge the number of SUSYs and construct more Nicolai mappings in a quantum-mechanical model. In this model, the exact mass degeneracy between fermion and boson is shown.
