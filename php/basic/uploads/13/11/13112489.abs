Title: Quantum gravity via supersymmetry and holography
Authors: Henriette Elvang and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We review the approach to quantum gravity based on supersymmetry, strings, and holography. This includes a survey of black holes in higher-dimensions, supersymmetry and supergravity, as well as string theory, black hole microstates, and the gauge/gravity duality. This presentation will appear as a chapter in "General Relativity and Gravitation: A Centennial Perspective", to be published by Cambridge University Press.
