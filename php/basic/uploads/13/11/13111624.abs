Title: Transgression field theory for interacting topological insulators
Authors: Özgür Açık and Ümit Ertem
Abstract: We consider effective topological field theories of quantum Hall systems and time-reversal invariant topological insulators that are Chern-Simons and BF field theories. The edge states of these systems are related to the gauge invariance of the effective actions. For the edge states at the interface of two topological insulators, transgression field theory is proposed as a gauge invariant effective action. Transgression actions of Chern-Simons theories for (2+1)D and (4+1)D and BF theories for (3+1)D are constructed. By using transgression actions, the edge states are written in terms of the bulk connections of effective Chern-Simons and BF theories.
