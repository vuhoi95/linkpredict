Title: External Sources in Field-Antifield Formalism
Authors: Igor A. Batalin and Klaus Bering
Abstract: We introduce external sources J_A directly into the quantum master action W of the field-antifield formalism instead of the effective action. The external sources J_A lead to a set of BRST-invariant functions W^A that are in antisymplectic involution. As a byproduct, we encounter quasi--groups with open gauge algebras.
