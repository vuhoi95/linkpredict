Abstract: A six dimensional standing-wave braneworld model has been constructed. It consists in an anisotropic 4-brane generated by standing gravitational waves whose source is normal matter. In this model the compact (on-brane) dimension is assumed to be sufficiently small in order to describe our universe (hybrid compactification). The bulk geometry is non-static, unlike most of the braneworld models in the literature. The principal feature of this model is the fact that the source is not a phantom like scalar field, as the original standing-wave model that was proposed in five dimensions and its six dimensional extension recently proposed in the literature. Here it was obtained a solution in the presence of normal matter what assures that the model is stable. Also our model is the first standing wave brane model in the literature which can be applied successfully to the hierarchy problem. Additionally, we have shown that the zero-mode for the scalar and fermionic fields are localized around the brane. Particularly for the scalar field we show that it is localized on the brane, regardless the warp factor is decreasing or increasing. This is in contrast to the case of the local string-like defect where the scalar field is localized for a decreasing warp factor only.
