Title: Time evolution as refining, coarse graining and entangling
Authors: Bianca Dittrich and Sebastian Steinhaus
Abstract: We argue that refining, coarse graining and entangling operators can be obtained from time evolution operators. This applies in particular to geometric theories, such as spin foams. We point out that this provides a construction principle for the physical vacuum in quantum gravity theories and more generally allows to construct a (cylindrically) consistent continuum limit of the theory.
