Title: Geonic black holes and remnants in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld  gravity
Authors: Gonzalo J. Olmo and D. Rubiera-Garcia and Helios Sanchis-Alepuz
Abstract: We show that electrically charged solutions within the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld theory of gravity replace the central singularity by a wormhole supported by the electric field. As a result, the total energy associated with the electric field is finite and similar to that found in the Born-Infeld electromagnetic theory. When a certain charge-to-mass ratio is satisfied, in the lowest part of the mass and charge spectrum the event horizon disappears yielding stable remnants. We argue that quantum effects in the matter sector can lower the mass of these remnants from the Planck scale down to the TeV scale.
