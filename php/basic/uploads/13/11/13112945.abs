Title: New N=1 Dualities from M5-branes and Outer-automorphism Twists
Authors: Prarit Agarwal and Jaewon Song
Abstract: We generalize recent construction of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT from wrapping six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory on a Riemann surface to the case of $D$-type with outer-automorphism twists. This construction allows us to build various dual theories for a class of $\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver theories of $SO-USp$ type. In particular, we find there are five dual frames to $SO(2N)/USp(2N-2)/G_2$ gauge theories with $(4N-4)/4N/8$ fundamental flavors, where three of them are non-Lagrangian. We check the dualities by computing the anomaly coefficients and the superconformal indices. In the process we verify that the index of $D_4$ theory on a certain three punctured sphere with $Z_2$ and $Z_3$ twist lines exhibits the expected symmetry enhancement from $G_2 \times USp(6)$ to $E_7$.
