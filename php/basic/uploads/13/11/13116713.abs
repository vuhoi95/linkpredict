Title: Generating Functional in String Field Theory
Authors: Am-Gil Ri and Tae-Song Kim and Song-Jin Im
Abstract: In our paper, we introduce a path integral of general functional field in order to build the path integral formalism in string field theory from the fact that a string field is a functional field, and describe a method for calculating it in the case of "Gauss-type". We also obtain the generating functional of an open bosonic string and the corresponding Feynman diagram.
