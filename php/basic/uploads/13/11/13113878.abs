Title: Solutions to position-dependent mass quantum mechanics for a new class  of hyperbolic potentials
Authors: H. R. Christiansen and M. S. Cunha
Abstract: We analytically solve the position-dependent mass (PDM) 1D Schr\"odinger equation for a new class of hyperbolic potentials $V_q^p(x) = -V_0\frac{\sinh^px}{\cosh^qx}, \, p= -2, 0, \dots q$ [see C. A. Downing, J. Math. Phys. 54 072101 (2013)] among which several hyperbolic single- and double-wells. For a solitonic mass distribution, $m(x)=m_0\,\text{sech}^2(x)$, we obtain exact analytic solutions to the resulting differential equations. For several members of the class, the quantum mechanical problems map into confluent Heun differential equations. The PDM Poschl-Teller potential is considered and exactly solved as a particular case.
