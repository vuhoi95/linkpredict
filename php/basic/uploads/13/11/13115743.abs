Abstract: We develop a variational formulation of a particle with spin in a curved space-time background. The model is based on a singular Lagrangian which provides equations of motion, a fixed value of spin and Frenkel condition on spin-tensor. Comparing our equations with those of Papapetrou we conclude that the Frenkel electron in a gravitational field has the same behavior as a rotating body in the pole-dipole and leading-spin approximation. Due to constraints presented in the formulation, position space is endowed with a noncommutative structure induced by the spin of the particle. Therefore, the model provides a physically interesting example of a noncommutative particle in a curved background.
