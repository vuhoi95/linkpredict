Title: Higher Order Theories and its Relationship with Noncommutativity
Authors: Oscar Sánchez-Santos and José David Vergara
Abstract: We present a relationship between noncommutativity and higher order time derivative theories using a method perturbative. We introduce a generalization of the Chern-Simons Quantum Mechanics for higher order time derivatives. This model presents noncommutativity in a natural way when we project to states of low energy. Compared with the usual model, our system presents noncommutativity without the necessity of taking the limit of strong field. We quantized the theory using a Bopp's shift of the noncommutative variables and we obtain an spectrum without negatives energies. In addition we extend the model to high order derivatives and noncommutativity with variable dependent parameter.
