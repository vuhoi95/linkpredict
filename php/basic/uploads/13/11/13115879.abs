Title: Angular Momentum Generation by Parity Violation
Authors: Hong Liu and Hirosi Ooguri and Bogdan Stoica
Abstract: We generalize our holographic derivation of spontaneous angular momentum generation in 2 + 1 dimensions in several directions. We consider cases when a parity violating perturbation responsible for the angular momentum generation can be non-marginal (while in our previous paper we restricted to a marginal perturbation), including all possible two-derivative interactions, with parity violations triggered both by gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons terms in the bulk. We make only a minimal assumption about the bulk geometry that it is asymptotically AdS, respects the Poincar\'e symmetry in 2 + 1 dimensions, and has a horizon. In this generic setup, we find a remarkably concise and universal formula for the expectation value of the angular momentum density, to all orders in the parity violating perturbation.
