Abstract: Using the coset approach (nonlinear realization) we construct component actions for a superparticle in three-dimensional spacetime with N=4 supersymmetry partially broken to N=2. These actions may contain an anyonic term and the square of the first extrinsic worldline curvature. We present the supercharges for the unbroken and broken supersymmetries as well as the Hamiltonian for the supersymmetric anyon. In terms of the nonlinear realization superfields, the superspace actions take a simple form in all cases.
