Title: Cosmological dynamics and dark energy from non-local infrared  modifications of gravity
Authors: Stefano Foffa and Michele Maggiore and Ermis Mitsou
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the cosmological dynamics of a recently proposed infrared modification of the Einstein equations, based on the introduction of a non-local term constructed with $m^2g_{\mu\nu}\Box^{-1} R$, where $m$ is a mass parameter. The theory generates automatically a dynamical dark energy component, that can reproduce the observed value of the dark energy density without introducing a cosmological constant. Fixing $m$ so to reproduce the observed value $\Omega_{\rm DE}\simeq 0.68$, and writing $w(a)=w_0+(1-a) w_a$, the model provides a neat prediction for the equation of state parameters of dark energy, $w_0\simeq -1.042$ and $w_a\simeq -0.020$. We show that, because of some freedom in the definition of $\Box^{-1}$, one can extend the construction so to define a more general family of non-local models. However, in a first approximation this turns out to be equivalent to adding an explicit cosmological constant term on top of the dynamical dark energy component. This leads to an extended model with two parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and $m$. Even in this extension the EOS parameter $w_0$ is always on the phantom side, in the range $-1.33 < w_0\leq -1$, and there is a prediction for the relation between $w_0$ and $w_a$.
