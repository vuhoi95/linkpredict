Abstract: We investigate the main features of the flat Friedmann-Lema{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models in the f(T) teleparallel gravity. In particular, a general approach to find out exact cosmological solutions in f (T) gravity is discussed. Instead of taking into account phenomenological models, we consider as a selection criterion, the existence of Noether symmetries in the cosmological f(T) point-like Lagrangian. We find that only power-law models admit extra Noether symmetries. A complete analysis of such cosmological models is developed.
