Title: Unified description for kappa-deformations of orthogonal groups
Authors: Andrzej Borowiec and Anna Pachol
Abstract: In this paper we provide universal formulas describing Drinfeld-type quantization of inhomogeneous orthogonal groups determined by a metric tensor of an arbitrary signature living in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension. The metric tensor does not need to be in diagonal form and kappa-deformed coproducts are presented in terms of classical generators. It opens the possibility for future applications in deformed general relativity. The formulas depend on the choice of an additional vector field which parameterizes classical r-matrices. Non-equivalent deformations are then labeled by the corresponding type of stability subgroups. For the Lorentzian signature it covers three (non-equivalent) Hopf-algebraic deformations: time-like, space-like (a.k.a. tachyonic) and light-like (a.k.a. light-cone) quantizations of the Poincare algebra. Finally the existence of the so-called Majid-Ruegg (non-classical) basis is reconsidered.
