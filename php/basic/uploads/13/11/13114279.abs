Title: The nucleation of false vacuum bubbles with compact geometries
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Chul H. Lee and Wonwoo Lee and Changheon Oh
Abstract: We investigate and classify the possible types of false vacuum bubbles in Einstein gravity. The false vacuum bubbles can occur only if gravity is taken into account. We show that there exist solutions only with compact geometries. The analytic computations for the radius and nucleation rate of a vacuum bubble are evaluated using the thin-wall approximation. We discuss possible cosmological implications of our new solutions.
