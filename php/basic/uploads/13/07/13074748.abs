Title: Effective equation of state for running vacuum: "mirage" quintessence  and phantom dark energy
Authors: Spyros Basilakos and Joan Sola
Abstract: Past analyses of the equation of state (EoS) of the Dark Energy (DE) were not incompatible with a phantom phase near our time. This has been the case in the years of WMAP observations, in combination with the remaining cosmological observables. Such situation did not completely disappear from the data collected from the Planck satellite mission. In it the EoS analysis may still be interpreted as suggesting w<-1, and so a mildly evolving DE cannot be discarded. In our opinion the usual ansatzs made on the structure of the EoS for dynamical DE models (e.g. quintessence and the like) are too simplified. In this work we examine in detail some of these issues and suggest that a general class of models with a dynamical vacuum energy density could explain the persistent phantom anomaly, despite there is no trace of real phantom behavior in them. The spurious or "mirage" effect is caused by an attempt to describe them as if the DE would be caused by fundamental phantom scalar fields. Remarkably, the effective DE behavior can also appear as quintessence in transit to phantom, or vice versa.
