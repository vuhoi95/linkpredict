Title: Constituent Quarks and Gluons, Polyakov loop and the Hadron Resonance  Gas Model
Authors: E. Megias and E. Ruiz Arriola and L. L. Salcedo
Abstract: Based on first principle QCD arguments, it has been argued in arXiv:1204.2424[hep-ph] that the vacuum expectation value of the Polyakov loop can be represented in the hadron resonance gas model. We study this within the Polyakov-constituent quark model by implementing the quantum and local nature of the Polyakov loop hep-ph/0412308, hep-ph/0607338. The existence of exotic states in the spectrum is discussed.
