Title: On the effective superpotential in the generic higher-derivative  superfield supersymmetric three-dimensional gauge theory
Authors: F. S. Gama and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov
Abstract: We formulate a generic three-dimensional superfield higher-derivative gauge theory coupled to the matter, which, in certain cases reduces to the three-dimensional scalar super-QED, or supersymmetric Maxwell-Chern-Simons or Chern-Simons theories with matter. For this theory, we explicitly calculate the one-loop effective potential.
