Title: Flat limits of curved interacting cosmic fluids
Authors: Spiros Cotsakis and Georgia Kittou
Abstract: We study curved isotropic cosmologies filled with two interacting fluids near their time singularities. We find that a number of these universes asymptote to flat limits in the sense that their asymptotic properties become indistinguishable from those of flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models on approach to the singularity along any asymptotic direction. In particular, there are no essential singularities in these models. We discuss connections of this result with possible extensions of the cosmic no hair theorem to the case of two interacting fluids, and also provide links to a quantum cosmological treatment of real and complex Euclidean such solutions.
