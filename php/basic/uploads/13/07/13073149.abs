Title: 5D Super Yang-Mills on $Y^{p,q}$ Sasaki-Einstein manifolds
Authors: Jian Qiu and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: On any simply connected Sasaki-Einstein five dimensional manifold one can construct a super Yang-Mills theory which preserves at least two supersymmetries. We study the special case of toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds known as $Y^{p,q}$ manifolds. We use the localisation technique to compute the full perturbative part of the partition function. The full equivariant result is expressed in terms of certain special function which appears to be a curious generalisation of the triple sine function. As an application of our general result we study the large $N$ behaviour for the case of single hypermultiplet in adjoint representation and we derive the $N^3$-behaviour in this case.
