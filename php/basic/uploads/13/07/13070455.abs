Title: Two-colour QCD with heavy quarks at finite densities
Authors: Kurt Langfeld and Jan M. Pawlowski
Abstract: We extend the density-of-states approach to gauge systems (LLR method) to QCD at finite temperature and density with heavy quarks. The approach features an exponential error suppression and yields the Polyakov loop probability distribution function over a range of more than hundred orders of magnitude. SU(2) gauge theory is considered in the confinement and the high-temperature phase, and at finite densities of heavy quarks. In the latter case, a smooth rise of the density with the chemical potential is observed, and no critical phenomenon associated with deconfinement due to finite densities is found.
