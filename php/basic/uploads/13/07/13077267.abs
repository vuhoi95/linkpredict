Title: Holographic turbulence
Authors: Allan Adams and Paul M. Chesler and Hong Liu
Abstract: We construct turbulent black holes in asymptotically AdS_4 spacetime by numerically solving Einstein equations. Both the dual holographic fluid and bulk geometry display signatures of an inverse cascade with the bulk geometry being well approximated by the fluid/gravity gradient expansion. We argue that statistically steady-state black holes dual to d dimensional turbulent flows have horizons which are approximately fractal with fractal dimension D=d+4/3.
