Title: Vector boson excitations near deconfined quantum critical points
Authors: Yejin Huh and Philipp Strack and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We show that the N\'eel states of two-dimensional antiferromagnets have low energy vector boson excitations in the vicinity of deconfined quantum critical points. We compute the universal damping of these excitations arising from spin-wave emission. Detection of such a vector boson will demonstrate the existence of emergent topological gauge excitations in a quantum spin system.
