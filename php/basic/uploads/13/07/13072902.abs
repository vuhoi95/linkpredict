Abstract: We study F-theory compactifications with up to two Abelian gauge group factors that are based on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 4-folds describable as generic hypersurfaces. Special emphasis is put on elliptic fibrations based on generic Bl^2 P^2[3]-fibrations. These exhibit a Mordell-Weil group of rank two corresponding to two extra rational sections which give rise to two Abelian gauge group factors. We show that an alternative description of the same geometry as a complete intersection makes the existence of a holomorphic zero-section manifest, on the basis of which we compute the U(1) generators and a class of gauge fluxes. We analyse the fibre degenerations responsible for the appearance of localised charged matter states, whose charges, interactions and chiral index we compute geometrically. We implement an additional SU(5) gauge group by constructing the four inequivalent toric tops giving rise to SU(5) x U(1) x U(1) gauge symmetry and analyse the matter content. We demonstrate that notorious non-flat points can be avoided in well-defined Calabi-Yau 4-folds. These methods are applied to the remaining possible hypersurface fibrations with one generic Abelian gauge factor. We analyse the local limit of our SU(5) x U(1) x U(1) models and show that one of our models is not embeddable into E8 due to recombination of matter curves that cannot be described as a Higgsing of E8. We argue that such recombination forms a general mechanism that opens up new model building possibilities in F-theory.
