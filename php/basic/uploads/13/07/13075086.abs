Abstract: Non-thermal cosmological histories are capable of greatly increasing the available parameter space of different particle physics dark matter (DM) models and are well-motivated by the ubiquity of late-decaying gravitationally coupled scalars in UV theories like string theory. A non-thermal DM model is presented in the context of LARGE Volume Scenarios in type IIB string theory. The model is capable of addressing both the moduli-induced gravitino problem as well as the problem of overproduction of axionic dark radiation and/or DM. We show that the right abundance of neutralino DM can be obtained in both thermal under and overproduction cases for DM masses between O(GeV) to O(TeV). In the latter case the contribution of the QCD axion to the relic density is totally negligible, while in the former case it can be comparable to that of the neutralino thus resulting in a multi-component DM scenario.
