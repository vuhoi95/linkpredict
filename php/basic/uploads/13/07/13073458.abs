Title: Scrambling in the Black Hole Portrait
Authors: Gia Dvali and Daniel Flassig and Cesar Gomez and Alexander Pritzel and Nico Wintergerst
Abstract: Recently a quantum portrait of black holes was suggested according to which a macroscopic black hole is a Bose-Einstein condensate of soft gravitons stuck at the critical point of a quantum phase transition. We explain why quantum criticality and instability are the key for efficient generation of entanglement and consequently of the scrambling of information. By studying a simple Bose-Einstein prototype, we show that the scrambling time, which is set by the quantum break time of the system, goes as $\log N \,$ for $N$ the number of quantum constituents or equivalently the black hole entropy.
