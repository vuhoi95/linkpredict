Title: Two Point Pade Approximants and Duality
Authors: Tom Banks and T. J. Torres
Abstract: We propose the use of two point Pade approximants to find expressions valid uniformly in coupling constant for theories with both weak and strong coupling expansions. In particular, one can use these approximants in models with a strong/weak duality, when the symmetries do not determine exact expressions for some quantity.
