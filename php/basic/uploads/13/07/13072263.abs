Title: Topological solutions in ungauged Supergravity
Authors: A. de la Cruz-Dombriz and M. Montero and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: A new general class of solutions of ungauged four-dimensional Supegravity, in one-to-one correspondence with spherically symmetric, static black-hole solutions and Lifshitz solutions with Hyperscaling violation (\emph{hvLif}) is studied. The causal structure of the space-time is then elucidated.
