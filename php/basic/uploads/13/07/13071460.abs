Abstract: In this work we aim at the question of holographic phase transitions and conductivity in two dimensional systems with Lifshitz scaling. We take the gravity side candidate for a dual description as the black hole solution of New Massive Gravity. We aim at the effects due to the Lifshitz scaling in comparison with the relativistic case. The order parameters indicate a second order phase transition. We find as an interesting result a series of peaks in the conductivity for certain values of the frequency. The relevance of such frequencies for real systems is discussed.
