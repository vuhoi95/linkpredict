Title: Generalized Bootstrap Equations and possible implications for the NLO  Odderon
Authors: J. Bartels and G. P. Vacca
Abstract: We formulate and discuss generalized bootstrap equations in nonabelian gauge theories. They are shown to hold in the leading logarithmic approximation. Since their validity is related to the self-consistency of the Steinmann relations for inelastic production amplitudes they can be expected to be valid also in NLO. Specializing to the N=4 SYM, we show that the validity in NLO of these generalized bootstrap equations allows to find the NLO Odderon solution with intercept exactly at one, a result which is valid also for the planar limit of QCD.
