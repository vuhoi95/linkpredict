Title: A formal introduction to Horndeski and Galileon theories and their  generalizations
Authors: Cedric Deffayet and Daniele A Steer
Abstract: We review different constructions of Galileon theories in both flat and curved space, and for both single scalar field models as well as multi-field models. Our main emphasis is on the formal mathematical properties of these theories and their construction.
