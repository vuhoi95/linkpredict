Title: Perturbations of W(infinity) CFTs
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Kewang Jin and Wei Li
Abstract: The holographic duals of higher spin theories on AdS_3 are described by the large N limit of a family of minimal model CFTs, whose symmetry algebra is equivalent to W(infinity)[lambda]. We study perturbations of these limit theories, and show that they possess a marginal symmetry-preserving perturbation that describes switching on the 1/N corrections. We also test our general results for the specific cases of lambda=0,1, where free field realisations are available.
