Title: Gauge/Gravity Duality and the Black Hole Interior
Authors: Donald Marolf and Joseph Polchinski
Abstract: We present a further argument that typical black holes with field theory duals have firewalls at the horizon. This argument makes no reference to entanglement between the black hole and any distant system, and so is not evaded by identifying degrees of freedom inside the black hole with those outside. We also address the ER=EPR conjecture of Maldacena and Susskind, arguing that the correlations in generic highly entangled states cannot be geometrized as a smooth wormhole.
