Title: 3d dualities from 4d dualities for orthogonal groups
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Shlomo S. Razamat and Nathan Seiberg and Brian Willett
Abstract: We extend recent work on the relation of 4d and 3d IR dualities of supersymmetric gauge theories with four supercharges to the case of orthogonal gauge groups. The distinction between different SO(N) gauge theories in 4d plays an important role in this relation. We show that the 4d duality leads to a 3d duality between an SO(N_c) gauge theory with N_f flavors and an SO(N_f-N_c+2) theory with N_f flavors and extra singlets, and we derive its generalization in the presence of Chern-Simons terms. There are two different O(N) theories in 3d, which we denote by O(N)_\pm, and we also show that the O(N_c)_- gauge theory is dual to a Spin(N_f-N_c+2) theory, and derive from 4d the known duality between O(N_c)_+ and O(N_f-N_c+2)_+. We verify the consistency of these 3d dualities by various methods, including index computations.
