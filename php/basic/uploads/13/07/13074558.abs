Title: Dressing the Electron Star in a Holographic Superconductor
Authors: Francesco Nitti and Giuseppe Policastro and Thomas Vanel
Abstract: We construct new asymptotically AdS_4 solutions dual to 2+1 CFTs at finite density and zero temperature by combining the ingredients of the electron star and the holographic superconductor. The solutions, which we call "compact electron stars", contain both a fermionic fluid and charged scalar hair in the bulk. We show that the new solutions are thermodynamically favoured in the region of parameter space where they exist. Along the boundary of this region, we find evidence for a continuous phase transition between the holographic superconductor and the compact star solution.
