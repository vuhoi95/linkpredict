Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics inside and outside of black-branes in anti de Sitter space by numerical simulations using double-null formalism. We prepare a charged planar matter shell which, due to a negative cosmological constant, collapses and dynamically forms a black-brane with an apparent horizon, a singularity and a Cauchy horizon. The gravitational collapse cannot form a naked overcharged black-brane and hence weak cosmic censorship is safe. Although mass inflation occurs, the effect is much milder than in the case of charged black holes; hence, strong cosmic censorship seems not to be safe. We observed the scalar field dynamics outside the horizon. There should remain a non-trivial scalar field combination - 'charge cloud' - between the horizon and the boundary. This can give some meaning in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
