Title: Higher spin theory in 3-dimensional flat space
Authors: Hamid Afshar and Arjun Bagchi and Reza Fareghbal and Daniel Grumiller and Jan Rosseel
Abstract: We present the first example of a non-trivial higher spin theory in 3-dimensional flat space. We propose flat-space boundary conditions and prove their consistency for this theory. We find that the asymptotic symmetry algebra is a (centrally extended) higher spin generalization of the Bondi- Metzner-Sachs algebra, which we describe in detail. We also address higher spin analogues of flat space cosmology solutions and possible generalizations.
