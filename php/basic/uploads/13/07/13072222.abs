Title: On Three-Algebra and Bi-Fundamental Matter Amplitudes and Integrability  of Supergravity
Authors: Yu-tin Huang and Henrik Johansson and Sangmin Lee
Abstract: We explore tree-level amplitude relations for SU(N)xSU(M) bi-fundamental matter theories. Embedding the group-theory structure in a Lie three-algebra, we derive Kleiss-Kuijf-like relations for bi-fundamental matter theories in general dimension. We investigate the three-algebra color-kinematics duality for these theories. Unlike the Yang-Mills two-algebra case, the three-algebra Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations depend on the spacetime dimension and on the detailed symmetry properties of the structure constants. We find the presence of such relations in three and two dimensions, and absence in D>3. Surprisingly, beyond six point, such relations are absent in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory for general gauge group, while the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson theory, and its supersymmetry truncations, obey the color-kinematics duality like clockwork. At four and six points the relevant partial amplitudes of the two theories are bijectively related, explaining previous results in the literature. In D=2 the color-kinematics duality gives results consistent with integrability of two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=16$ supergravity: The four-point amplitude satisfies a Yang-Baxter equation; the six- and eight-point amplitudes vanish for certain kinematics away from factorization channels, as expected from integrability.
