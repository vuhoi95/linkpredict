Title: Nonflat time-variable dark energy cosmology
Authors: Anatoly Pavlov and Shawn Westmoreland and Khaled Saaidi and Bharat Ratra
Abstract: We generalize the time-variable dark energy scalar field $\Phi$ model ($\Phi$CDM) to nonflat space. We show that even in the space-curvature-dominated epoch the scalar field solution is a time-dependent fixed point or attractor, with scalar field energy density that grows relative to the energy density in spatial curvature. This is the first example of a physically consistent and complete model of dynamical dark energy in a nonflat geometry.
