Title: On the higher-spin charges of conical defects
Authors: Andrea Campoleoni and Stefan Fredenhagen
Abstract: The conical defect solutions in higher-spin gauge theories on 2+1 dimensional space-times with AdS-asymptotics are conjectured to correspond to certain primary fields in the dual conformal field theory on the boundary. In this note we prove that indeed all higher-spin charges match.
