Title: Generalization of the hypervirial and Feynman-Hellman theorems
Authors: Teimuraz Nadareishvili and Anzor Khelashvili
Abstract: Using well-known methods we generalize (hyper)virial theorems to case of singular potential. Discussion is carried on for most general second order differential equation, which involves all physically interesting cases, such as Schr\"odinger and two-body Klein-Gordon equations with singular potentials. Some physical consequences are discussed. The connection with Feynman-Hellmann like theorems are also considered and some relevant differences are underlined.
