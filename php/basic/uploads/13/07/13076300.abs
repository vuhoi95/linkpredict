Title: Towards harmonic superfield formulation of $N=4$, $USp(4)$ SYM theory  with the central charge
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and N. G. Pletnev
Abstract: We develop a superfield formulation of $\cN=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauged central charge in $USp(4)$ harmonic superspace. Component formulation of this theory was given by Sohnius, Stelle and West \cite{SSW80} but its superfield formulation has not been constructed so far. We construct the superfield action, corresponding to this model, and show that it reproduces the component action from \cite{SSW80}.
