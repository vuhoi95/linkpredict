Title: The Isospin Asymmetry in Anomalous Fluid Dynamics
Authors: D. Capasso and V. P. Nair and J. Tekel
Abstract: The dynamics of fluids in which the constituent particles carry nonabelian charges can be described succinctly in terms of group-valued variables via a generalization of the co-adjoint orbit action for particles. This formalism, which is particularly suitable for incorporating anomalies, has previously been used for the chiral magnetic and chiral vorticity effects. Here we consider the similar effect for the isospin which corresponds to an angular asymmetry for neutral pions.
