Title: Deformed Supersymmetric Mechanics
Authors: E. Ivanov and S. Sidorov
Abstract: Motivated by a recent interest in curved rigid supersymmetries, we construct a new type of N=4, d=1 supersymmetric systems by employing superfields defined on the cosets of the supergroup SU(2|1). The relevant worldline supersymmetry is a deformation of the standard N=4, d=1 supersymmetry by a mass parameter m. As instructive examples we consider, at the classical and quantum levels, the models associated with the supermultiplets (1,4,3) and (2,4,2) and find out interesting interrelations with some previous works on non-standard d=1 supersymmetry. In particular, the d=1 systems with "weak supersymmetry" are naturally reproduced within our SU(2|1) superfield approach as a subclass of the (1,4,3) models. A generalization to the N=8, d=1 case implies the supergroup SU(2|2) as the candidate deformed worldline supersymmetry.
