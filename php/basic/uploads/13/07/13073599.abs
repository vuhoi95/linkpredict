Title: Field localization and Nambu Jona-Lasinio mass generation mechanism in  an alternative 5-dimensional brane model
Authors: Preston Jones and Gerardo Munoz and Douglas Singleton and Triyanta
Abstract: We consider a 5-dimensional brane world model with a single brane which is distinct from the well known Randall-Sundrum model. We discuss the similarities and differences between our brane model and the Randall-Sundrum brane model. In particular we focus on the localization of 5D fields with different spins -- spin 0, spin 1/2, spin 1 -- to the brane, and a self-consistent mass generation mechanism. We find that the brane model studied here has different (and in some cases superior) localization properties for fields/particles with different spins to the brane, as compared to the original 5-dimensional brane models. In addition this alternative 5D brane model exhibits a self generation mechanism which recalls the self-consistent approach of Nambu and Jona-Lasinio.
