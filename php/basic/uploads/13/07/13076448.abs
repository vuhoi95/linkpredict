Title: Variational approach to the inhomogeneous chiral phase in quark matter
Authors: S. Karasawa and T. Tatsumi
Abstract: The inhomogeneous chiral phase is discussed in QCD at finite temperature and/or density. We study the phase diagram on the density-temperature plane by taking into account the effect of the current mass by a variational method. It is demonstrated that our framework well describes the inhomogeneous phase over the whole phase region.
