Title: AdS Dyonic Black Hole and its Thermodynamics
Authors: H. Lu and Y. Pang and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We obtain spherically-symmetric and $\R^2$-symmetric dyonic black holes that are asymptotic to anti-de Sitter space-time (AdS), which are solutions in maximal gauged four-dimensional supergravity, with just one of the U(1) fields carrying both the electric and magnetic charges $(Q,P)$. We study the thermodynamics, and find that the usually-expected first law does not hold unless P=0, Q=0 or P=Q. For general values of the charges, we find that the first law requires a modification with a new pair of thermodynamic conjugate variables. We show that they describe the scalar hair that breaks some of the asymptotic AdS symmetries.
