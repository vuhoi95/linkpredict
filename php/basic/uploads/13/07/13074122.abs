Title: (N+1)-dimensional Lorentzian evolving wormholes supported by polytropic  matter
Authors: Mauricio Cataldo and Sebastian Bahamonde and Fernanda Arostica
Abstract: In this paper we study $(N+1)$-dimensional evolving wormholes supported by energy satisfying a polytropic equation of state. The considered evolving wormhole models are described by a constant redshift function and generalizes the standard flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The polytropic equation of state allows us to consider in $(3+1)$-dimensions generalizations of the phantom energy and the generalized Chaplygin gas sources.
