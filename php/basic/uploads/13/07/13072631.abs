Title: Orbifold Family Unification on 6 Dimensions
Authors: Yuhei Goto and Yoshiharu Kawamura and Takashi Miura
Abstract: We study the possibility of family unification on the basis of SU(N) gauge theory on the 6-dimensional space-time, $M^4\times T^2/Z_N$. We obtain enormous numbers of models with three families of SU(5) matter multiplets and those with three families of the standard model multiplets, from a single massless Dirac fermion with a higher-dimensional representation of SU(N), through the orbifold breaking mechanism.
