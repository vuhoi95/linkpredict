Title: Crystalline Geometries from Fermionic Vortex Lattice
Authors: M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar and Ali Mollabashi
Abstract: We study charged Dirac fermions on an AdS$_2\times R^2$ background with a non-zero magnetic field. Under certain boundary conditions, we show that the charged fermion can make the background unstable, resulting in spontaneously formation of a vortex lattice. We observe that an electric field emerges in the back-reacted solution due to the vortex lattice constructed from spin polarized fermions. This electric field may be extended to the UV boundary which leads to a finite charge density. We also discuss corrections to the thermodynamic functions due to the lattice formation.
