Title: Nonlocal action for the super-Weyl anomalies: A new representation
Authors: Daniel Butter and Sergei M. Kuzenko
Abstract: Using the recently discovered N=1 supersymmetric extension of the conformal fourth-order scalar operator (introduced originally by Fradkin and Tseytlin and also known as the "Paneitz operator" or "Riegert operator"), we derive a new representation for the nonlocal action generating the super-Weyl anomalies.
