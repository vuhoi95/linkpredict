Title: Integrable systems on semidirect product Lie groups
Authors: S. Capriotti and H. Montani
Abstract: We study integrable systems on the semidirect product of a Lie group and its Lie algebra as the representation space of the adjoint action. Regarding the tangent bundle of a Lie group as phase space endowed with this semidirect product Lie group structure, we construct a class of symplectic submanifolds equipped with a Dirac bracket on which integrable systems (in the Adler-Kostant-Symes sense) are naturally built through collective dynamics. In doing so, we address other issues as factorization, Poisson-Lie structures and dressing actions. We show that the procedure becomes recursive for some particular Hamilton functions, giving rise to a tower of nested integrable systems.
