Title: Quantization of n coupled scalar field theory
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: We study a model of n coupled scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime where all masses degenerate, which is considered as a toy model of polycritical gravity on AdS spacetime. We quantize this model within the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) scheme by introducing n Faddeev-Popov (FP) ghost fields. Extending a BRST quartet generated by two scalars and two FP ghosts to n scalars and n FP ghosts, there remains a physical subspace with positive norm for odd n, but there exists only the vacuum for even n. This clearly shows a non-triviality of odd-higher order derivative scalar field theories. This is helpful to understand the truncation mechanism which is used to obtain a unitary conformal field theory dual to linearized polycritical gravity. It turns out that the truncation mechanism is nothing but a general quartet mechanism appeared when introducing the FP ghost action.
