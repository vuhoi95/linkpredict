Title: Gauge Invariant Overlaps for Identity-Based Marginal Solutions
Authors: Isao Kishimoto and Tomohiko Takahashi
Abstract: We investigate identity-based solutions associated with marginal deformations in open string field theory. We find that the identity-based marginal solutions can be represented as a difference of wedge-based solutions plus an integration of a deformed BRST exact state. Using this expression, the gauge invariant overlap can be calculated analytically for the identity-based solutions. Moreover, we show that, by gauge transformation, the overlap is transformed into a disk correlation function with the integrations of currents at the boundary.
