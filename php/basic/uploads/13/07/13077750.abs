Title: Monte Carlo techniques in small-x physics: Formal studies and  phenomenology
Authors: G. Chachamis and A. Sabio Vera
Abstract: We discuss the solution to the BFKL equation in the adjoint representation at LO and NLO accuracy for the N = 4 SUSY theory. We use Monte Carlo techniques to study numerically the Gluon Green's function at LO and NLO directly written in the transverse momentum space which allows for the factorization of its infrared divergencies. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our approach to phenomenological searches for the BKP Odderon at the LHC.
