Title: Semiclassical Strings on Curved Branes
Authors: Sagar Biswas and Kamal L Panigrahi
Abstract: We study semiclassical strings in the near horizon geometry of certain curved branes. We investigate the rigidly rotating strings in the near horizon geometry of NS5-branes wrapped on AdS3 x S3 and in the presence of background NS-NS flux. We study several string solutions corresponding to giant magnon, single spike and more general folded strings for the fundamental string in this background. We comment that in the S-dual background the situation changes drastically.
