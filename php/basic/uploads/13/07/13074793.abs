Title: Topological Quantum Field Theory, Nonlocal Operators, and Gapped Phases  of Gauge Theories
Authors: Sergei Gukov and Anton Kapustin
Abstract: We revisit the role of loop and surface operators as order parameters for gapped phases of four-dimensional gauge theories. We show that in some cases surface operators are confined, and that this fact can be used to distinguish phases which are not distinguished by the Wilson-'t Hooft criterion. The long-distance behavior of loop and surface operators which are neither confined nor screened is controlled by a 4d TQFT. We construct these TQFTs for phases which are characterized by the presence of electrically and/or magnetically charged condensates. Interestingly, the TQFT describing a phase with a nonabelian monopole condensate is based on the theory of nonabelian gerbes. We also show that in phases with a dyonic condensate the low-energy theta-angle is quantized.
