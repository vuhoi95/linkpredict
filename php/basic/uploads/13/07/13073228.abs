Title: Evidence for Maximal Acceleration and Singularity Resolution in  Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Carlo Rovelli and Francesca Vidotto
Abstract: A simple argument indicates that covariant loop gravity (spinfoam theory) predicts a maximal acceleration, and hence forbids the development of curvature singularities. This supports the results obtained for cosmology and black holes using canonical methods.
