Title: Unoriented Quivers with Flavour
Authors: Massimo Bianchi and Gianluca Inverso and Jose Francisco Morales and Daniel Ricci Pacifici
Abstract: We discuss unoriented quivers with flavour that arise from D3-branes at local orbifold singularities, in the presence of Omega-planes and non-compact D7-branes. We produce a wide class of unoriented quiver gauge theories, including new instances of N=1 superconformal theories. We then consider unoriented D-brane instanton corrections of both `gauge' and `exotic' kinds. In particular, we show that conformal symmetry can be dynamically broken via the generation of exotic superpotentials. Finally we discuss aspects of the recently proposed N=1 remnant of N=4 S-duality. We identify new candidate dual pairs for the C^3/Z_n series of unoriented quiver gauge theories with n odd.
