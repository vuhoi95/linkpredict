Title: $F(R)$ nonlinear massive theories of gravity and their cosmological  implications
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Francis Duplessis and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear massive gravitational theory which includes $F(R)$ modifications. This construction inherits the benefits of the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley model and is free of the Boulware-Deser ghost due to the existence of a Hamiltonian constraint accompanied by a nontrivial secondary one. The scalar perturbations in a cosmological background can be stabilized at the linear level for a wide class of the $F(R)$ models. The linear scalar mode arisen from the $F(R)$ sector can absorb the nonlinear longitudinal graviton, and hence, our scenario demonstrates the possibility of a gravitational Goldstone theorem. Finally, due to the combined contribution of the $F(R)$ and graviton-mass sectors, the proposed theory allows for a large class of cosmological evolutions, such as the simultaneous and unified description of inflation and late-time acceleration.
