Title: The dilaton Wess-Zumino action in higher dimensions
Authors: Florent Baume and Boaz Keren-Zur
Abstract: We present a general formula for the Wess-Zumino action associated with the Weyl anomaly, given in a curved background for any even number of dimensions. The result is obtained by considering a finite Weyl transformation of counterterms in dimensional regularization.
