Title: Reflection matrices from Hadamard-type Temperley-Lieb R-matrices
Authors: J. Avan and P. P. Kulish and G. Rollet
Abstract: We classify non-operatorial matrices K solving Skylanin's quantum reflection equation for all R-matrices obtained from the newly defined general rank- n Hadamard type representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_N(\sqrt n)$. They are characterized by a universal set of algebraic equations in a specific canonical basis uniquely defined from the "Master matrix" associated to the chosen realization of Temperley-Lieb algebra
