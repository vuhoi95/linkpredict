Title: Bose-Fermi competition in holographic metals
Authors: Yan Liu and Koenraad Schalm and Ya-Wen Sun and Jan Zaanen
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of a finite density system with both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. There is no evidence for a universal bose-dominated ground state. Instead, depending on the relative conformal weights the preferred groundstate is either pure AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom, a holographic superconductor, an electron star, or a novel mixed state that is best characterized as a hairy electron star.
