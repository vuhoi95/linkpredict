Title: Critical exponents in quantum Einstein gravity
Authors: S. Nagy and B. Fazekas and L. Juhasz and K. Sailer
Abstract: The quantum Einstein gravity is treated by the functional renormalization group method using the Einstein-Hilbert action. The ultraviolet non-Gaussian fixed point is determined and its corresponding exponent of the correlation length is calculated for a wide range of regulators. It is shown that the exponent provides a minimal sensitivity to the parameters of the regulator which correspond to the Litim's regulator.
