Title: Black Hole's Information Group
Authors: Gia Dvali and Cesar Gomez
Abstract: We suggest a group-theoretic approach to black holes, which is remotely analogous to the eightfold-way for mesons. As the black hole symmetry group we single out the group SO(2N+1) with N the black hole entropy. The Hilbert space is identified with the spinor irrep of SO(2N+1). Evaporation processes of m-quanta are associated to the breaking SO(2N+1) to SO(2(N-m)+1) X SO(2m). Under these assumptions we get a group-theoretic understanding of the evaporation process and of some typical time scales of black holes, such as Page's and scrambling times. We also discuss from the group theory point of view the mechanism of generation of entanglement both between the black hole and the radiated quanta as well as among the black hole constituents themselves.
