Title: Asymptotically flat spacetimes in three-dimensional higher spin gravity
Authors: Hernan A. Gonzalez and Javier Matulich and Miguel Pino and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: A consistent set of asymptotic conditions for higher spin gravity in three dimensions is proposed in the case of vanishing cosmological constant. The asymptotic symmetries are found to be spanned by a higher spin extension of the BMS3 algebra with an appropriate central extension. It is also shown that our results can be recovered from the ones recently found for asymptotically AdS3 spacetimes by virtue of a suitable gauge choice that allows to perform the vanishing cosmological constant limit.
