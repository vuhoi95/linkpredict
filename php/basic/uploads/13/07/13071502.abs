Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the study of supersymmetric gauge theories we propose a very compact formulation of spectral duality between XXZ spin chains. The action of the quantum duality is given by the Fourier transform in the spectral parameter. We investigate the duality in various limits and, in particular, prove it for q-->1, i.e. when it reduces to the XXX/Gaudin duality. We also show that the universal difference operators are given by the normal ordering of the classical spectral curves.
