Authors: Domagoj Kovačević and Stjepan Meljanac and Andjelo Samsarov and Zoran Škoda
Abstract: General realizations, star products and plane waves for kappa-Minkowski spacetime are considered. Systematic construction of general hermitian realization is presented, with special emphasis on noncommutative plane waves and hermitian star product. Few examples are elaborated and possible physical applications are mentioned.
