Abstract: We present a new approach to discuss two dimensional chiral and non-chiral hydrodynamics with gauge and gravitational anomalies. Exact constitutive relations for the stress tensor and charge current are obtained. For the chiral theory, the constitutive relations may be put in the ideal (chiral) fluid form whereas the constitutive relations corresponding to non-chiral case do not take the ideal fluid form. The constitutive relations in the presence of both gravity and gauge sectors are new. These expressions, in the absence of the gauge sector, reproduce the results obtained in the gradient expansion approach.
