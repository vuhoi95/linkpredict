Abstract: We present a complete two-loop analysis of the quantum expectation value for circular BPS Wilson loops in ABJ(M) theories. We examine in details the 1/2 BPS case, that requires non-trivial fermionic couplings with the contour, finding perfect agreement with the exact matrix model answer at zero framing. The result is obtained through a careful application of DRED regularization scheme, combined with a judicious rearrangement of the relevant perturbative contributions that reduces the computation to simple integrals. We carefully analyze the contribution of fermions that is crucial for the consistency with the localization procedure and point out the arising of pivotal evanescent terms, discussing their meaning in relation to Ward identities.
