Title: More On Critical Collapse of Axion-Dilaton System in Dimension Four
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Ehsan Hatefi
Abstract: We complete our previous study of critical gravitational collapse in the axion-dilaton system by analysing the hyperbolic and parabolic ans\"atze. As could be expected, the corresponding Choptuik exponents in four-dimensions differ from the elliptic case.
