Title: Fluid/Gravity Correspondence, Second Order Transport and Gravitational  Anomaly
Authors: Eugenio Megias and Francisco Pena-Benitez
Abstract: We study the transport properties of a relativistic fluid affected by chiral and gauge-gravitational anomalies. The computation is performed in the framework of the fluid/gravity correspondence for a 5 dim holographic model with Chern-Simons terms in the action. We find new anomalous and non anomalous transport coefficients, as well as new contributions to the existing ones coming from the mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly. Consequences for the shear waves dispersion relation are analyzed.
