Authors: D. Momeni and R. Myrzakulov and M. Raza
Abstract: In this paper, we analytically compute the basic parameters of the p-wave holographic superconductors with Weyl geometrical corrections using the matching method. The explicit correspondence between the critical temperature $T_c$ and the dual charge density $\rho$ has been calculated as $T_c\propto\rho^{{1}{3}}$ and the dependence of the vacuum expectation value for the dual condensate operator $\cal{O}$ on the temperature has been found analytically in the form $<{\cal O}_{+}>\propto T_c^{{3}{2}}T^{\Delta-{1}{2}}\sqrt{1-({T}{T_c})^3}$. The critical exponent ${1}{2}$ is an universal quantity according to predictions of the mean field theory and independent from the Weyl coupling $\gamma$. Our analytical results confirm the numerical results and also agree on computations using by the variational method.
