Abstract: We study the flavor landscape of particle physics models based on a ten-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory compactified on magnetized tori preserving four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry. Recently, we constructed a semi-realistic model which contains the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) using an Ansatz of magnetic fluxes and orbifolding projections. However, we can consider more various configurations of magnetic fluxes and orbifolding projections preserving four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry. We research systematically such possibilities for leading to MSSM-like models and study their phenomenological aspects.
