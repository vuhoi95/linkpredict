Title: Multiloop Amplitudes of Light-cone Gauge Bosonic String Field Theory in  Noncritical Dimensions
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: We study the multiloop amplitudes of the light-cone gauge closed bosonic string field theory for $d \neq 26$. We show that the amplitudes can be recast into a BRST invariant form by adding a nonstandard worldsheet theory for the longitudinal variables $X^{\pm}$ and the reparametrization ghost system. The results obtained in this paper for bosonic strings provide a first step towards the examination whether the dimensional regularization works for the multiloop amplitudes of the light-cone gauge superstring field theory.
