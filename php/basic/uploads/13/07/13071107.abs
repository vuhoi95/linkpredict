Title: Some Generalizations in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the  Supersymmetric $\varepsilon$-System Revisited
Authors: E. A. Gallegos and A. J. da Silva and D. Spehler
Abstract: We discuss two distinct aspects in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. First, we introduce a new class of operators A and $\bar{A}$ in terms of anticommutators between the momentum operator and N+1 arbitrary superpotentials. We show that these operators reduce to the conventional ones which are the starting point in standard supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In this context, we argue furthermore that supersymmetry does not only connect Schr\"odinger-like operators, but also a more general class of differential operators. Second, we revisit the supersymmetric $\varepsilon$-system recently introduced in the literature by exploiting its intrinsic supersymmetry. Specifically, combining the Hamilton hierarchy method and the $\delta$-expansion method, we determine an energy for the first excited state of the bosonic Hamiltonian close to that calculated in earlier works.
