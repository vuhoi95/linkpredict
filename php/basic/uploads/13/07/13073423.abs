Title: Asymptotic symmetry groups and operator algebras
Authors: Waldemar Schulgin and Jan Troost
Abstract: We associate vertex operators to space-time diffeomorphisms in flat space string theory, and compute their algebra, which is a diffeomorphism algebra with higher derivative corrections. As an application, we realize the asymptotic symmetry group BMS3 of three-dimensional flat space in terms of vertex operators on the string worldsheet. This provides an embedding of the BMS3 algebra in a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Higher derivative corrections vanish asymptotically. An appendix is dedicated to alpha prime corrected algebras in conformal field theory and string theory.
