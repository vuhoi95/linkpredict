Title: Electrons turn into anyons under an elastic membrane
Authors: Siavosh R. Behbahani and Claudio Chamon and Emanuel Katz
Abstract: We show that electrons acquire anyonic statistics if a two-dimensional electron gas is placed in proximity to a charged magnetic membrane. In this two-layered system, electrons become anyons through electromagnetic field mediated interactions with a membrane phonon. The statistical parameter is irrational and depends on the membrane tension and on the electric charge and magnetic dipolar densities on the membrane. We propose a measurement that yields the value of the statistical parameter.
