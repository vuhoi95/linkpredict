Title: Chiral and Gravitational Anomalies on Fermi Surfaces
Authors: Gokce Basar and Dmitri E. Kharzeev and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: A Fermi surface threaded by a Berry phase can be described by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term. After gauging, it produces a five-dimensional Chern-Simons term in the action. We show how this Chern-Simons term captures the essence of the Abelian, non-Abelian, and mixed gravitational anomalies in describing both in- and off-equilibrium phenomena. In particular we derive a novel contribution to the Chiral Vortical Effect that arises when a temperature gradient is present. We also discuss the issue of universality of the anomalous currents.
