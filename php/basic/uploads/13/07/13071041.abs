Title: Brane solitons of (1,0) superconformal theories in six dimensions with  hypermultiplets
Authors: M. Akyol and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We solve the Killing spinor equations of 6-dimensional (1,0) superconformal theories which include hyper-multiplets in all cases. We show that the solutions preserve 1,2,3,4 and 8 supersymmetries. We find models with self-dual string solitons which are smooth and supported by instantons with an arbitrary gauge group, and 3-brane solitons as expected from the M-brane intersection rules.
