Authors: Tiberiu Harko and Francisco S. N. Lobo and M. K. Mak and Sergey V. Sushkov
Abstract: Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity (EiBI) gravity is a recently proposed modified theory of gravity, based on the classic work of Eddington and on Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. In this paper, we consider the possibility that wormhole geometries are sustained in EiBI gravity. We present the gravitational field equations for an anisotropic stress-energy tensor and consider the generic conditions, for the auxiliary metric, at the wormhole throat. In addition to this, we obtain an exact solution for an asymptotically flat wormhole.
