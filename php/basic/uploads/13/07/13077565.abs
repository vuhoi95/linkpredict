Title: Twisted N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory in Omega-background
Authors: Katsushi Ito and Hiroaki Nakajima and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study the twisted N=4 super Yang-Mills theories in the Omega-background with the constant R-symmetry Wilson line gauge field. Based on the classification of topological twists of N=4 supersymmetry (the half, the Vafa-Witten and the Marcus twists), we construct the deformed off-shell supersymmetry associated with the scalar supercharges for these twists. We find that the Omega-deformed action is written in the exact form with respect to the scalar supercharges as in the undeformed case.
