Title: AdS solitons with conformal scalar hair
Authors: Yves Brihaye and Betti Hartmann and Sardor Tojiev
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric soliton solutions in a model with a conformally coupled scalar field as well as in full conformal gravity. We observe that a new type of limiting behaviour appears for particular choices of the self-coupling of the scalar field, i.e. the solitons interpolate smoothly between the Anti-de Sitter vacuum and an uncharged configuration. Furthermore, within conformal gravity the qualitative approach of a limiting solution does not change when varying the charge of the scalar field - contrary to the Einstein-Hilbert case. However, it changes with the scalar self-coupling.
