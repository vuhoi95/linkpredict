Title: Functional renormalization group study of the two-flavor linear sigma  model in the presence of the axial anomaly
Authors: Mara Grahl and Dirk H. Rischke
Abstract: The $SU(2)_A \times U(2)_V$-symmetric chiral linear sigma model in the presence of the axial anomaly is studied in the local-potential approximation of the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG). The renormalization group (RG) flow is investigated in a truncation which reproduces recent results for the $U(2)_A \times U(2)_V$-symmetric model in the limit of vanishing axial anomaly strength. We search for the conjectured O(4) fixed point in the presence of the $U(1)_A$ anomaly and analyze its stability properties.
