Title: Linear Quivers and N=1 SCFTs from M5-branes
Authors: Ibrahima Bah and Nikolay Bobev
Abstract: We study a class of N=1 quiver gauge theories build out of vector multiplets and matter multiplets in the fundamental and bifundamental representations. We argue that these theories flow to interacting SCFTs in the IR and calculate their central charges. We exhibit a type IIA brane construction which at low energies is described by these SCFTs. This also leads to a natural description of the theories in terms of M5-branes on a punctured sphere.
