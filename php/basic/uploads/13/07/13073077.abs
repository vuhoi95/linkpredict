Title: Asymptotically AdS Charged Black Holes in String Theory with  Gauss-Bonnet Correction in Various Dimensions
Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We study charged black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet theory with the dilaton field which is the low-energy effective theory of the heterotic string. The spacetime is $D$-dimensional and assumed to be static and plane symmetric with the $(D-2)$-dimensional constant curvature space and asymptotically anti-de Sitter. By imposing the boundary conditions of the existence of the regular black hole horizon and proper behavior at infinity where the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound should be satisfied, we construct black hole solutions numerically. We give the relations among the physical quantities of the black holes such as the horizon radius, the mass, the temperature, and so on. The properties of the black hole do not depend on the dimensions qualitatively, which is different from the spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat case. There is non-zero lower limit for the radius of the event horizon below which no solution exists. The temperature of the black hole becomes smaller as the horizon radius is smaller but remains non-zero when the lower limit is attained.
