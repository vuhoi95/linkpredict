Title: An Uneventful Horizon in Two Dimensions
Authors: Ahmed Almheiri and James Sully
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of firewalls in the Einstein-dilaton gravity model of CGHS. We use the results of the numerical simulation carried out by Ashtekar et al. to demonstrate that firewalls are absent and the horizon is drama free. We show that the lack of a firewall is consistent because the model does not satisfy one of the postulates of black hole complementarity. In particular, we show that the Hawking radiation is not pure, and is completely entangled with a long-lived remnant beyond the last ray.
