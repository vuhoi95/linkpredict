Title: CMB Power Asymmetry from Primordial Sound Speed Parameter
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Wen Zhao and Yang Zhang
Abstract: The hemispherical power asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background may be explained by the modulation of some primordial cosmological parameter, such as the sound speed of the inflaton. This modulation can be achieved by the perturbation of a light field during inflation. We numerically examine this mechanism and show it can be consistent with current observations. Further, this model predicts that the power asymmetry also exists in the temperature-polarization correlation and polarization autocorrelation with the same shape, and in primordial non-gaussianity of equilateral type with a particular shape. Therefore, our mechanism is observationally detectable in forthcoming experiments.
