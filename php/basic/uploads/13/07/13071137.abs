Title: On the Starobinsky Model of Inflation from Supergravity
Authors: F. Farakos and A. Kehagias and A. Riotto
Abstract: We discuss how the higher-derivative Starobinsky model of inflation originates from N=1 supergravity. It is known that, in the old-minimal supergravity description written by employing a chiral compensator in the superconformal framework, the Starobinsky model is equivalent to a no-scale model with F-term potential. We show that the Starobinsky model can also be originated within the so-called new-minimal supergravity, where a linear compensator superfield is employed. In this formulation, the Starobinsky model is equivalent to standard supergravity coupled to a massive vector multiplet whose lowest scalar component plays the role of the inflaton and the vacuum energy is provided by a D-term potential. We also point out that higher-order corrections to the supergravity Lagrangian represent a threat to the Starobinsky model as they can destroy the flatness of the inflaton potential in its scalar field equivalent description.
