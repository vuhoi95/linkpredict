Title: Axionic superconductivity in three dimensional doped narrow gap  semiconductors
Authors: Pallab Goswami and Bitan Roy
Abstract: We consider the competition between the conventional s-wave and the triplet Balian-Werthamer or the B-phase pairings in the doped three dimensional narrow gap semiconductors, such as $\mathrm{Cu}_x\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$ and $\mathrm{Sn}_{1-x}\mathrm{In}_x\mathrm{Te}$. When the coupling constants of the two contending channels are comparable, we find a simultaneously time-reversal and parity violating $p + is$ state at low temperatures, which provides an example of dynamic axionic state of matter. In contradistinction to the time-reversal invariant, topological B-phase, the $p + is$ state possesses gapped Majorana fermions as the surface Andreev bound states, which give rise to an anomalous surface thermal Hall effect. The anomalous gravitational and electrodynamic responses of the $p+is$ state can be described by the $\theta$ vacuum structure, where $\theta \neq 0$ or $\pi$.
