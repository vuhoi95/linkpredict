Title: Entanglement Entropy for Probe Branes
Authors: Han-Chih Chang and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We give a prescription for calculating the entanglement entropy in holographic probe brane systems by systematically taking the leading order backreaction of the probe brane into account. We find a simple compact double integral formula, which is insensitive to many details of the backreaction, most notably the internal space or the non-metric fields sourced by the probe. We validate our method by comparing to exact results in solvable toy models. We also determine the entanglement entropies for a sphere and a strip in the top-down D3/D7 and D3/D5 system. For the sphere the entanglement entropy has also been obtained by other methods and we find perfect agreement.
