Abstract: We revisit the problem of quantizing a chiral boson on a torus. The conventional approach is to extract the partition function of a chiral boson from the path integral of a non-chiral boson. Instead we compute it directly from the chiral boson Lagrangian of Floreanini and Jackiw modified by topological terms involving auxiliary fields. A careful analysis of the gauge-fixing condition for the extra gauge symmetry reproduces the correct results for the free chiral boson, and has the advantage of being applicable to a wider class of interacting chiral boson theories.
