Title: On reflectionless nature of self-consistent multi-soliton solutions in  Bogoliubov-de Gennes and chiral Gross-Neveu models
Authors: Daisuke A. Takahashi and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Recently the most general static self-consistent multi-soliton solutions in Bogoliubov-de Gennes and chiral Gross-Neveu systems are derived by the present authors [D. A. Takahashi and M. Nitta, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 131601 (2013)]. Here we show a few complementary results, which were absent in the previous our work. We prove directly from the gap equation that the self-consistent solutions need to have reflectionless potentials. We also give the self-consistent condition for the system consisting of only right-movers, which is more used in high-energy physics.
