Title: Applications of Holography to Strongly Coupled Plasmas
Authors: Carlo Ewerz and Konrad Schade
Abstract: We study several observables related to heavy quarks in strongly coupled plasmas using the gauge/gravity correspondence. Besides the AdS_5 space dual to N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory we consider large classes of theories obtained from various deformations of the AdS_5 space. Among them are theories that solve equations of motion of a 5-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert-scalar action. Specifically, we calculate the screening distance of a heavy quark-antiquark pair moving at constant velocity through the plasma, the running coupling defined via the free energy of such a static pair, and the energy radiation from a heavy quark forced into a circular motion in the plasma. We find that these observables show universal behaviour in large classes of theories. The screening distance in these classes of theories, that is the maximal distance for which a heavy quark-antiquark pair is bound, is found to be bounded from below by its value in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
