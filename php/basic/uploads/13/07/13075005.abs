Title: Geodesics at Sudden Singularities
Authors: John D. Barrow and S. Cotsakis
Abstract: We show that a general solution of the Einstein equations that describes approach to an inhomogeneous and anisotropic sudden spacetime singularity does not experience geodesic incompleteness. This generalises the result established for isotropic and homogeneous universes. Further discussion of the weakness of the singularity is also included.
