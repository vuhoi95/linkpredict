Title: Composite-particle hydrodynamics from dyonic black branes
Authors: Kyung Kiu Kim and Nakwoo Kim and Yun-Long Zhang
Abstract: We construct effective hydrodynamics for composite particles in (2+1) dimensions carrying a magnetic flux by employing a holographic approach. The hydrodynamics is obtained by perturbation of the dyonic black brane solutions in the derivative expansion. We introduce a consistent way to avoid mixing of different orders in the expansion. Thanks to this method, it is possible to take the strong external magnetic field limit in the dual field theory. To compare our result with those for a composite particle system, we study several cases that correspond to special solutions of Einstein's equation and Maxwell's equations.
