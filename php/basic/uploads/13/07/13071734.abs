Title: Self-dual Maxwell-Chern-Simons solitons from a Lorentz-violating model
Authors: Rodolfo Casana and Lucas Sourrouille
Abstract: Self-dual abelian Higgs system, involving both the Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms are obtained from Carroll-Field-Jackiw theory by dimensional reduction. Bogomol'nyi-type equations are studied from theoretical and numerical point of view. In particular we show that the solutions of these equations are Nielsen-Olesen vortices with electric charge.
