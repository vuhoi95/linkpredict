Abstract: We use the Hartree approximation to the Einstein equation on de Sitter background to solve for the one loop correction to the graviton mode function. This should give a reasonable approximation to how the ensemble of inflationary gravitons affects a single external graviton. At late times we find that the one loop correction to the plane wave mode function $u(\eta,k)$ goes like $G H^2 \ln(a)/a^2$, where $a$ is the inflationary scale factor. One consequence is that the one loop corrections to the "electric" components of the linearized Weyl tensor grow compared to the tree order result.
