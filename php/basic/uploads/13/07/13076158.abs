Title: Canonical approach to the closed string noncommutativity
Authors: Ljubica Davidovic and Bojan Nikolic and Branislav Sazdovic
Abstract: We consider the closed string moving in the weakly curved background and its totally T-dualized background. Using T-duality transformation laws, we find the structure of the Poisson brackets in the T-dual space corresponding to the fundamental Poisson brackets in the original theory. From this structure we obtain that the commutative original theory is equivalent to the non-commutative T-dual theory, whose Poisson brackets are proportional to the background fluxes times winding and momenta numbers. The non-commutative theory of the present article is more nongeometrical then T-folds and in the case of three space-time dimensions corresponds to the nongeometric space-time with $R$-flux.
