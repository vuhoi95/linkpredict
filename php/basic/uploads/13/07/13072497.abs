Title: Construction of a Holographic Superconductor in F(R) Gravity
Authors: D. Momeni and M. Raza and R. Myrzakulov
Abstract: We construct a toy model for holographic superconductor with non linear Maxwell field in the frame of modified gravity. By probe the bulk background by non linear Maxwell fields we show that superconductivity happens under a specific critical temperature. The effect of the non linear Maxwell field and non linear curvature corrections have been studied by analytical matching methods. We conclude that the non linearity in Maxwell field and curvature coupling make condensation harder.
