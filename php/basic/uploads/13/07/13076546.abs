Title: New higher-derivative invariants in N=2 supergravity and the  Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Daniel Butter and Bernard de Wit and Sergei M. Kuzenko and Ivano Lodato
Abstract: A new class of N=2 locally supersymmetric higher-derivative invariants is constructed based on logarithms of conformal primary chiral superfields. They characteristically involve a coupling to R_{\mu\nu}^2 - 1/3*R^2, which equals the non-conformal part of the Gauss-Bonnet term. Upon combining one such invariant with the known supersymmetric version of the square of the Weyl tensor, one obtains the supersymmetric extension of the Gauss-Bonnet term. The construction is carried out in the context of both conformal superspace and the superconformal multiplet calculus. The new class of supersymmetric invariants resolves two open questions. The first concerns the proper identification of the 4D supersymmetric invariants that arise from dimensional reduction of the 5D mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons term. The second is why the pure Gauss-Bonnet term without supersymmetric completion has reproduced the correct result in calculations of the BPS black hole entropy in certain models.
