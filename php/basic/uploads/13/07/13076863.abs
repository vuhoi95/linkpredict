Title: Conserved current correlators of conformal field theories in 2+1  dimensions
Authors: Yejin Huh and Philipp Strack and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We compute current correlators of the CP^{N-1} field theory in 2+1 dimensions, both at the critical point and in the phase with spontaneously broken SU(N) symmetry. Universal constants are obtained to next-to-leading order in the 1/N expansion. Implications are noted for quantum critical points of antiferromagnets, and their vicinity.
