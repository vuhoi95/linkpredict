Title: Impacts of non-geometric moduli on effective theory of 5D supergravity
Authors: Yutaka Sakamura and Yusuke Yamada
Abstract: 5D supergravity generically has non-geometric moduli other than the radion that belong to 5D vector multiplets. We summarize the impacts of such moduli on 4D effective theory of 5D supergravity on S^1/Z_2. We mainly discuss the structure of the effective Kahler potential including the one-loop quantum corrections. As an illustrative example, we construct a model in which the size of the extra dimension is stabilized at an exponentially large value compared to the Planck length, which is similar to the LARGE volume scenario in string theory.
