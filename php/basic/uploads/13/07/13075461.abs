Title: Quantum hyperbolic geometry in loop quantum gravity with cosmological  constant
Authors: Maite Dupuis and Florian Girelli
Abstract: Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is an attempt to describe the quantum gravity regime. Introducing a non-zero cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in this context has been a withstanding problem. Other approaches, such as Chern-Simons gravity, suggest that quantum groups can be used to introduce $\Lambda$ in the game. Not much is known when defining LQG with a quantum group. Tensor operators can be used to construct observables in any type of discrete quantum gauge theory with a classical/quantum gauge group. We illustrate this by constructing explicitly geometric observables for LQG defined with a quantum group and show for the first time that they encode a quantized hyperbolic geometry. This is a novel argument pointing out the usefulness of quantum groups as encoding a non-zero cosmological constant. We conclude by discussing how tensor operators provide the right formalism to unlock the LQG formulation with a non-zero cosmological constant.
