Title: Sharp global regularity for the 2+1-dimensional equivariant Faddeev  model
Authors: Dan-Andrei Geba and Kenji Nakanishi and Xiang Zhang
Abstract: The aim of this article is to prove that for the 2+1-dimensional equivariant Faddeev model, which is a quasilinear generalization of the corresponding nonlinear sigma model, small initial data in critical Besov spaces evolve into global solutions which scatter.
