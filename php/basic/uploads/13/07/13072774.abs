Abstract: We present a generally-covariant and parity-invariant "zwei-dreibein" action for gravity in three space-time dimensions that propagates two massive spin-2 modes, unitarily, and we use Hamiltonian methods to confirm the absence of unphysical degrees of freedom. We show how zwei-dreibein gravity unifies previous "3D massive gravity" models, and extends them, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, to allow for a positive central charge consistent with bulk unitarity.
