Title: (Non) supersymmetric quantum quenches
Authors: Ling-Yan Hung and Michael Smolkin and Evgeny Sorkin
Abstract: We explore supersymmetric quantum quenches of the mass and coupling constants in the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric vector model using Hartee-Fock approximation. We find that in the case of the free fermionic field, quench of the mass generates singularity localized at the instant of sudden change and we point out the essential role of the parity of spacetime. Focusing on a supersymmetric generalization of the $\phi^6$ model and using stationary phase approximation, we demonstrate that supersymmetry is broken in the asymptotic state that emerges at late times after the quench. Finally, we confirm SUSY breaking in the time-dependent setting by integrating numerically the exact equations of motion from the instant of the quench into asymptotic regime. We argue that the breaking of supersymmetry cannot be attributed to the thermal physics since to leading order in the Hartee-Fock approximation the final state is not thermal.
