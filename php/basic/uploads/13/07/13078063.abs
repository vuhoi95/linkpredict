Title: Magnetic Susceptibility of Strongly Interacting Matter across the  Deconfinement Transition
Authors: Claudio Bonati and Massimo D'Elia and Marco Mariti and Francesco Negro and Francesco Sanfilippo
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the total magnetic susceptibility of strongly interacting matter by lattice QCD simulations, and present first numerical results for the theory with two light flavors, which suggest a weak magnetic activity in the confined phase and the emergence of strong paramagnetism in the deconfined, Quark-Gluon Plasma phase.
