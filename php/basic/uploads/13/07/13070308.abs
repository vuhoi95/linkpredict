Abstract: We study the network of Type-I cosmic strings using the field-theoretic numerical simulations in the Abelian-Higgs model. For Type-I strings, the gauge field plays an important role, and thus we find that the correlation length of the strings is strongly dependent upon the parameter \beta, the ratio between the self-coupling constant of the scalar field and the gauge coupling constant, namely, \beta=\lambda/2e^2. In particular, if we take the cosmic expansion into account, the network becomes densest in the comoving box for a specific value of \beta for \beta<1.
