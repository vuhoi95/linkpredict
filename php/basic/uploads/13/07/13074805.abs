Title: Density dependent magnetic field and the equation of state of hyperonic  matter
Authors: Rudiney Hoffmann Casali and DÃ©bora Peres Menezes
Abstract: We are interested on the effects, caused by strong variable density dependent magnetic fields, on hyperonic matter, its symmetry energy, equations of state and mass-radius relations. The inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moment of the particles involved in a stellar system is performed, and some results are compared with the cases that do not take this correction under consideration. The Lagrangian density used follows the nonlinear Walecka model plus the leptons subjected to an external magnetic field.
