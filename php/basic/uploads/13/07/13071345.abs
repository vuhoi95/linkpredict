Title: Vortex polygons and their stabilities in Bose-Einstein condensates and  field theory
Authors: Michikazu Kobayashi and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We study vortex polygons and their stabilities in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and find that vortex polygons are stable for the total circulation $Q \leq 5$, metastable for $Q = 6$, and unstable for $Q \geq 7$. As a related model in high-energy physics, we also study the vortex polygon of the baby-Skyrme model with an anti-ferromagnetic potential term, and compare both results.
