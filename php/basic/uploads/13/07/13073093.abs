Title: Dynamical F-strings intersecting D2-branes in type IIA supergravity
Authors: Kunihito Uzawa and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We present time-dependent exact solutions composed of F-strings intersecting D2-branes in type IIA supergravity. The F-strings tend to approach each other with time in the six-dimensional space transverse to both F-strings and D2-branes. In general, a singularity appears before collision. An exceptional case is that the charges are the same and five directions in the transverse space are smeared out. Then we argue some applications of the solutions in building cosmological models. The possible models are classified based on compactifications of the internal space. All of them give rise to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with a power-law expansion.
