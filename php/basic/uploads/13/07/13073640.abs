Title: Restoring General Relativity in massive bi-gravity theory
Authors: Eugeny Babichev and Marco Crisostomi
Abstract: We study static spherically symmetric solutions of massive bi-gravity theory, free from the Boulware-Deser ghost. We show the recovery of General Relativity via the Vainshtein mechanism, in the weak limit of the physical metric. We find a single polynomial equation determining the behavior of the solution for distances smaller than the inverse graviton mass. This equation is generically of the seventh order, while for a specific choice of the parameters of the theory it can be reduced to lower orders. The solution is analytic in different regimes: for distances below the Vainshtein radius (where General Relativity is recovered), and in the opposite regime, beyond the Vainshtein radius, where the solution approaches the flat metric.
