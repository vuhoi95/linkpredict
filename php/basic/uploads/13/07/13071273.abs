Title: Narrow Tetraquarks at Large N
Authors: Marc Knecht and Santiago Peris
Abstract: Following a recent suggestion by Weinberg, we use the large-N expansion in QCD to discuss the decay amplitudes of tetraquarks into ordinary mesons as well as their mixing properties. We find that the flavor structure of the tetraquark is a crucial ingredient to determine both this mixing as well as the decays. Although in some cases tetraquarks should be expected to be as narrow as ordinary mesons, they may get to be even narrower, depending on this flavor structure.
