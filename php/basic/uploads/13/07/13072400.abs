Title: Radiative corrections to WL WL scattering in composite Higgs models
Authors: Domenec Espriu and Federico Mescia and Brian Yencho
Abstract: The scattering of longitudinally polarized electroweak bosons is likely to play an important role in the elucidation of the fundamental nature of the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking sector and in determining the Higgs interactions with this sector. In this paper, by making use of the Equivalence Theorem, we determine the renormalization properties of the electroweak effective theory parameters in a model with generic Higgs couplings to the W and Z bosons. When the couplings between the Higgs and the electroweak gauge bosons deviate from their Standard Model values, additional counterterms of O(p^4) in the usual chiral counting are required. We also determine in the same approximation the full radiative corrections to the WL WL->ZL ZL process in this type of models. Assuming custodial invariance, all the related processes can be easily derived from this amplitude.
