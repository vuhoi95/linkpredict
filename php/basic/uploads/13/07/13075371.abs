Title: On the Trispectrum of Galileon Inflation
Authors: Frederico Arroja and Nicola Bartolo and Emanuela Dimastrogiovanni and Matteo Fasiello
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the trispectrum of the curvature perturbation generated within a stable, well defined and predictive theory which comprises an inflationary phase. In this model the usual shift symmetry is enhanced up to the so-called Galileon symmetry. The appeal of this type of theories rests on being unitary and stable under quantum corrections. Furthermore, in the specific model under consideration here, these properties have been shown to approximately hold in realistic scenarios which account for curved spacetime and the coupling with gravity. In the literature, the analysis of the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation for this theory revealed non-Gaussian features which are shared by a number of inflationary models, including stable ones. It is therefore both timely and useful to investigate further and turn to observables such as the trispectrum. We find that, in a number of specific momenta configurations, the trispectrum shape-functions present strikingly different features as compared to, for example, the entire class of the so-called $P(X,\phi)$ inflationary models.
