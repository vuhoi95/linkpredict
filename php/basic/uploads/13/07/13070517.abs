Title: Relativistic Fluids, Superfluids, Solids and Supersolids from a Coset  Construction
Authors: Alberto Nicolis and Riccardo Penco and Rachel A. Rosen
Abstract: We provide a systematic coset construction of the effective field theories governing the low-energy dynamics of relativistic fluids and solids, and of their "super" counterparts. These effective theories agree with those previously derived via different techniques. As an application of our methods, we re-derive the Wess-Zumino term relevant for anomalous charge-carrying fluids in (1+1) dimensions.
