Title: Observing the inhomogeneity in the holographic models of superconductors
Authors: Xiao-Mei Kuang and Bin Wang and Xian-Hui Ge
Abstract: We study the gravity duals of striped holographic superconductors in the AdS black hole and AdS soliton backgrounds. We show the dependences of the condensation and the critical temperature/critical chemical potential on the inhomogeneity in these two different spacetimes. By exploring the dynamics of the normal phase through the scalar field perturbation, we argue that the pair susceptibility and the conductivity can be possible phenomenological indications to disclose the property of inhomogeneity.
