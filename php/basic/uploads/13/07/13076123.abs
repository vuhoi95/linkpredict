Abstract: We study numerically the fractal dimensions and the bulk three-point connectivity for the spin clusters of the Q-state Potts model in two dimensions with $1\leq Q\leq 4$. We check that the usually invoked correspondence between FK clusters and spin clusters works at the level of fractal dimensions. However, the fine structure of the conformal field theories describing critical clusters first manifests at the level of the three-point connectivities. Contrary to what recently found for FK clusters, no obvious relation emerges for generic Q between the spin cluster connectivity and the structure constants obtained from analytic continuation of the minimal model ones. The numerical results strongly suggest then that spin and FK clusters are described by conformal field theories with different realizations of the color symmetry of the Potts model.
