Title: Complete spectrum and scalar products for the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum  chains with non-diagonal boundary terms
Authors: S. Faldella and N. Kitanine and G. Niccoli
Abstract: We use the quantum separation of variable (SOV) method to construct the eigenstates of the open XXZ chain with the most general boundary terms. The eigenstates in the inhomogeneous case are constructed in terms of solutions of a system of quadratic equations. This SOV representation permits us to compute scalar products and can be used to calculate form factors and correlation functions.
