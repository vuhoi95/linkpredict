Title: 3D Supergravity from wrapped D3-branes
Authors: Parinya Karndumri and Eoin O Colgain
Abstract: AdS_3 solutions dual to N = (0,2) SCFTs arise when D3-branes wrap Kahler two-cycles in manifolds with SU(4) holonomy. Here we review known AdS_3 solutions and identify the corresponding three-dimensional gauged supergravities, solutions of which uplift to type IIB supergravity. In particular, we discuss gauged supergravities dual to twisted compactifications on Riemann surfaces of both N=4 SYM and N =1 SCFTs with Sasaki-Einstein duals. We check in each case that c-extremization gives the exact central charge and R symmetry. For completeness, we also study AdS_3 solutions from intersecting D3-branes, generalise recent KK reductions of Detournay & Guica and identify the underlying gauged supergravities. Finally, we discuss examples of null-warped AdS_3 solutions to three-dimensional gauged supergravity, all of which embed in string theory.
