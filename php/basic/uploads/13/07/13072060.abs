Title: Some Comments on Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Mario Herrero-Valea
Abstract: A Weyl invariant extension of Einstein gravity is studied. It simply consists in the group averaging of Einstein's action under Weyl transformations. Contradicting cherished beliefs, a conformal anomaly is found in the trace of the equations of motion if diffeomorphism invariance is to be a symmetry of the quantum theory. This anomaly however vanishes on shell, which signals the existence of another gauge in which the anomaly is absent. It can be made also to vanish off-shell at the price of losing diffeomorphism invariance
