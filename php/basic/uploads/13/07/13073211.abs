Abstract: Rather generically, multicomponent superconductors and superfluids have intercomponent current-current interaction. We show that in superconductors with substantially strong intercomponent drag interaction, the topological defects which form in external field are characterized by a skyrmionic topological charge. We then demonstrate that they can be distinguished from ordinary vortex matter by a very characteristic magnetization process due to the dipolar nature of inter-skyrmion forces. The results provide an experimental signature to confirm or rule out the formation $p$-wave state with reduced spin stiffness in $p$-wave superconductors.
