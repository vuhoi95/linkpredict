Title: Universality of Abrupt Holographic Quenches
Authors: Alex Buchel and Robert C. Myers and Anton van Niekerk
Abstract: We make an analytic investigation of rapid quenches of relevant operators in d-dimensional holographic CFT's, which admit a dual gravity description. We uncover a universal scaling behaviour in the response of the system, which depends only on the conformal dimension of the quenched operator in the vicinity of the ultraviolet fixed point of the theory. Unless the amplitude of the quench is scaled appropriately, the work done on a system during the quench diverges in the limit of abrupt quenches for operators with dimension $\frac{d}{2} \le\Delta < d$.
