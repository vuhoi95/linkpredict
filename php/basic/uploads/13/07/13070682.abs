Title: On non-equilibrium photon distributions in the Casimir effect
Authors: Vanik E. Mkrtchian and Carsten Henkel
Abstract: The electromagnetic field in a typical geometry of the Casimir effect is described in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. The main result is the photon distribution function (Keldysh Green function) in any stationary state of the field. A two-plate geometry with a sliding interface in local equilibrium is studied in detail, and full agreement with the results of Rytov fluctuation electrodynamics is found. As an illustration, plots are shown for a spectrum of the energy density between the plates.
