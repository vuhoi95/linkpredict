Abstract: We analyze the moduli space of spontaneously broken N=8 supergravity theories in 4 dimensions with classical Minkowski vacua. We find that all the known classical vacua, as well as the several new ones we construct here, can be connected by sending some of the moduli to their boundary values. We also show that Cremmer-Scherk-Schwarz models can be viewed as special limits of more general CSO* gaugings, which allow for non-Abelian residual symmetries on the vacuum. Finally, we find that all the classical Minkowski vacua with fully broken supersymmetry found so far are unstable with respect to 1-loop corrections, which drive the effective potential to negative values.
