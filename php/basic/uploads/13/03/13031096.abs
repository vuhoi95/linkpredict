Title: Kalb-Ramond field localization on the Bloch brane
Authors: W. T. Cruz and R. V. Maluf and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: This work deals with new results on the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field localization in braneworld models. We consider a five-dimensional warped spacetime with an embedded 4D thick brane which is generated by two real scalar fields coupled with gravity (the so called Bloch brane). We find a KR field zero mode localized with the inclusion of the dilaton coupling. Analyzing the massive spectrum, we detected a series of resonant modes that arise from the solutions of the Schr\"odinger-like equation for KR field. The effects of the brane thickness and of the dilaton coupling over the resonance structures are determined. Such analysis is extended to the resonance lifetimes of the massive modes, allowing a better understanding on the localization mechanism of the model.
