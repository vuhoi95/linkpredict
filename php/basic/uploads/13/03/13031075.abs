Title: Dual dynamics of three dimensional asymptotically flat Einstein gravity  at null infinity
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Hernan Gonzalez
Abstract: Starting from the Chern-Simons formulation, the two-dimensional dual theory for three-dimensional asymptotically flat Einstein gravity at null infinity is constructed. Solving the constraints together with suitable gauge fixing conditions gives in a first stage a chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten like model based on the Poincar\'e algebra in three dimensions. The next stage involves a Hamiltonian reduction to a BMS3 invariant Liouville theory. These results are connected to those originally derived in the anti-de Sitter case by rephrasing the latter in a suitable gauge before taking their flat-space limit.
