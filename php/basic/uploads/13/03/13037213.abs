Title: Standard Model-like corrections to Dilatonic Dynamics

Abstract: We examine the effects of standard model-like interactions on the near-conformal dynamics of a theory featuring a dilatonic state identified with the standard model-like Higgs. As template for near-conformal dynamics we use a gauge theory with fermionic matter and elementary mesons possessing the same non-abelian global symmetries as a technicolor-like theory with matter in a complex representation of the gauge group. We then embed the electroweak gauge group within the global flavor structure and add also ordinary quark-like states to mimic the effects of the top. We find that the standard model-like induced corrections modify the original phase diagram and the details of the dilatonic spectrum. In particular, we show that the corrected theory exhibits near-conformal behavior for a smaller range of flavors and colors. For this range of values, however, our results suggest that near conformal dynamics could accommodate the observed Higgs-like properties.
