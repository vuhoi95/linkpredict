Title: First Order Actions for New Massive Dual Gravities
Authors: Alexangel Bracho and Adel Khoudeir
Abstract: We present a first order formulation for the fourth order action of the new massive dual gravity in four dimensions. This proposal is easily generalized to arbitrary dimension. Also, we obtain the dual actions for massless and massive Curtright fields in D dimensions.
