Title: Duality phases and halved maximal D=4 supergravity
Authors: Sergio M. Iguri and Victor A. Penas
Abstract: The duality angles deformation developed by de Roo and Wagemans within the context of N=4 gauged supergravity is used in order to study certain classes of gaugings of N=8 supergravity, namely, those that are consistent when halving the maximal D=4 theory. After reviewing the truncation process from N=8 to N=4 supergravity in terms of the embedding tensor formalism, the de Roo-Wagemans phases method is implemented for solving the resulting constraints on the gauging parameters by means of the Schon-Weidner ansatz. In contrast with the twenty semisimple N=4 gaugings admitting more than a single SL(2) angle deforming their decompositions reported in the literature, it is proven that only three of them can be embedded back into the N=8 theory. The scalar potential derived for only two of these gauge groups exhibits an extremum in the origin of the scalar manifold. These extrema are not stable under fluctuations of all the scalar fields.
