Title: Entanglement entropy from the holographic stress tensor
Authors: Arpan Bhattacharyya and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: We consider entanglement entropy in the context of gauge/gravity duality for conformal field theories in even dimensions. The holographic prescription due to Ryu and Takayanagi (RT) leads to an equation describing how the entangling surface extends into the bulk geometry. We show that setting to zero the time-time component of the Brown-York stress tensor evaluated on the co-dimension one entangling surface, leads to the same equation. By considering a spherical entangling surface as an example, we observe that Euclidean action methods in AdS/CFT will lead to the RT area functional arising as a counterterm needed to regularize the stress tensor. We present arguments leading to a justification for the minimal area prescription.
