Title: Possible Emission of Cosmic $X$-- and $Î³$--rays by Unstable  Particles at Late Times
Authors: K. Urbanowski and K. Raczynska
Abstract: Not all astrophysical mechanisms of the emission of electromagnetic radiation including $X$-- and $\gamma$-- rays coming from the space are clear. We find that charged unstable particles as well as neutral unstable particles with non--zero magnetic moment which live sufficiently long may emit electromagnetic radiation. This new mechanism is connected with the properties of unstable particles at the post exponential time region. Analyzing the transition time region between exponential and non-exponential form of the survival amplitude it is found that the instantaneous energy of the unstable particle can take very large values, much larger than the energy of this state for times from the exponential time region. Basing on the results obtained for the model considered, it is shown that this purely quantum mechanical effect may be responsible for causing unstable particles to emit electromagnetic--, $X$-- or $\gamma$--rays at some time intervals from the transition time regions.
