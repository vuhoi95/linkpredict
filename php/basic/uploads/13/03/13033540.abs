Title: Obstruction to E_{7(7)} Deformation in N=8 Supergravity
Authors: Murat Gunaydin and Renata Kallosh
Abstract: Candidate counterterms break Noether-Gaillard-Zumino E_{7(7)} current conservation in N=8 supergravity in four dimensions. Bossard and Nicolai proposed a scheme for deforming the subsector involving vector fields in a Lorentz covariant manner, so as to restore duality. They argued that there must exist an extension of this deformation to the full theory that preserves supersymmetry. We show that it is not possible to deform the maximal supergravity to restore E_{7(7)} duality, while maintaining both general covariance and N=8 supersymmetry, as was proposed. Deformation of N=8 supergravity requires higher spins and multiple gravitons, which presents a concrete obstacle to this proposal.
