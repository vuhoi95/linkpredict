Abstract: The U(1) gauge dynamics on a D4-brane is revisited, with a two form, to construct an effective curvature theory in a second order formalism. We exploit the local degrees in a two form, and modify its dynamics in a gauge invariant way, to incorporate a non-perturbative metric fluctuation in an effective D4-brane. Interestingly, the near horizon D4-brane is shown to describe an asymptotic Anti de Sitter (AdS) in a semi-classical regime. Using Weyl scaling(s), we obtain the emergent rotating geometries leading to primordial de Sitter (dS) and AdS vacua in a quantum regime. Under a discrete transformation, we re-arrange the mixed dS patches to describe a Schwazschild-like dS (SdS) and a topological-like dS (TdS) black holes. We analyze SdS vacuum for Hawking radiations to arrive at Nariai geometry, where a discrete torsion forms a condensate. We perform thermal analysis to identify Nariai vacuum with a TdS. Investigation reveals an AdS patch within a thermal dS brane, which may provide a clue to unfold dS/CFT. In addition, the role of dark energy, sourced by a discrete torsion, in the dS vacua is investigated using Painleve geometries. It is argued that a D-instanton pair is created by a discrete torsion, with a Big Bang/Crunch, at the past horizon in a pure dS. Nucleation, of brane/anti-brane pair(s), is qualitatively analyzed to construct an effective space-time on a D4-brane and its anti brane. Analysis re-assures the significant role played by a non-zero mode, of NS-NS two form, to generalize the notion of branes within a brane.
