Title: Superradiance and statistical entropy of hairy black hole in three  dimensions
Authors: Myungseok Eune and Yongwan Gim and Wontae Kim
Abstract: We calculate the statistical entropy of a rotating hairy black hole by taking into account superradiant modes in the brick wall method. The UV cutoff is independent of the gravitational hair, which gives the well-defined area law of the entropy. It can be shown that the angular momentum and the energy of matter field depend on the gravitational hair. For the vanishing gravitational hair, it turns out that the energy for matter is related to both the black hole mass and the black hole angular momentum whereas the angular momentum for matter field is directly proportional to the angular momentum of the black hole.
