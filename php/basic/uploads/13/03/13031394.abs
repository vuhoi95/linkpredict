Title: Galaxy Rotation Curves in Covariant Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Jean Alexandre and Martyna Kostacinska
Abstract: Using the multiplicity of solutions for the projectable case of the covariant extension of Horava-Lifshitz Gravity, we show that an appropriate choice for the auxiliary field allows for an effective description of galaxy rotation curves. This description is based on static and spherically symmetric solutions of covariant Horava-Lifshitz Gravity and does not require Dark Matter.
