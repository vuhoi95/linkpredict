Title: WZW models as mutual super Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models
Authors: A. Eghbali and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: A WZW model on the Lie supergroup (C3+A) is constructed. It is shown that this model contains super Poisson-Lie symmetry with the dual Lie supergroup C3 + A1,1|.i. Furthermore, we show that the dual model is also equivalent to the WZW model on isomorphic Lie supergroup (C3+A).i. In this manner, because of isomorphism of the (C3+A) with a Manin supertriple, it is shown that the N=(2,2) structure is preserved under the super Poisson-Lie T-duality transformation.
