Title: Monopoles in 2+1-dimensional conformal field theories with global U(1)  symmetry
Authors: Silviu S. Pufu and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: In 2+1-dimensional conformal field theories with a global U(1) symmetry, monopoles can be introduced through a background gauge field that couples to the U(1) conserved current. We use the state-operator correspondence to calculate scaling dimensions of such monopoles. We obtain the next-to-leading term in the 1/N_b expansion of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the theory of N_b complex bosons.
