Title: a New Conformal Window Bound from the a theorem
Authors: Oleg Antipin and Marc Gillioz and Francesco Sannino
Abstract: We propose a novel constraint on the gauge dynamics of strongly interacting gauge theories stemming from the a theorem. The inequality we suggest is used to provide a lower bound on the conformal window of four dimensional gauge theories.
