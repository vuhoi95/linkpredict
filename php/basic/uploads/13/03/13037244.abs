Title: A modified naturalness principle and its experimental tests
Authors: Marco Farina and Duccio Pappadopulo and Alessandro Strumia
Abstract: Motivated by LHC results, we modify the usual criterion for naturalness by ignoring the uncomputable power divergences. The Standard Model satisfies the modified criterion ('finite naturalness') for the measured values of its parameters. Extensions of the SM motivated by observations (Dark Matter, neutrino masses, the strong CP problem, vacuum instability, inflation) satisfy finite naturalness in special ranges of their parameter spaces which often imply new particles below a few TeV. Finite naturalness bounds are weaker than usual naturalness bounds because any new particle with SM gauge interactions gives a finite contribution to the Higgs mass at two loop order.
