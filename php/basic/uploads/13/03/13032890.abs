Title: Î²-function for the Higgs self-interaction in the Standard Model at  three-loop level
Authors: K. G. Chetyrkin and M. F. Zoller
Abstract: We analytically compute the QCD, electroweak, Higgs and third generation Yukawa contributions to the \beta-function for the Higgs self-coupling as well as for the Higgs mass parameter in the unbroken phase of the Standard Model at three-loop level.
