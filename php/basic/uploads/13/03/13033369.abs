Title: Ooguri-Vafa Invariants and Off-shell Superpotentials of Type II/F-theory  compactification
Authors: Feng-Jun Xu and Fu-Zhong Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we make a further step of \cite{Feng} and calculate off-shell superpotential of two Calabi-Yau manifold with three parameters by integrating the period of subsystem. We also obtain the Ooguri-Vafa invariants with open mirror symmetry.
