Title: Black holes in realistic branes: black string-like objects?
Authors: D. Bazeia and J. M. Hoff da SIlva and Roldao da Rocha
Abstract: A realistic model describing a black string-like object in an expanding Universe is analyzed in the context of the McVittie's solution of the Einstein field equations. The bulk metric near the brane is provided analogously to previous solutions for black strings. In particular, we show that at least when the Hubble parameter on the brane is positive, a black string-like object seems to play a fundamental role in the braneworld scenario, generalizing the standard black strings in the context of a dynamical brane.
