Title: Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string with Non-Abelian Moduli and "Spin-Orbit"  Interaction
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: It is generally believed that the spontaneous breaking of the Poincar\'e group by flux tubes (strings) generate only two zero modes localized on the string and associated with the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance (the so-called Low-Manohar argument). Being perfectly true in many instances it is nevertheless nonuniversal, and have to be amended in the case of order parameters carrying spatial indices. We show that under certain circumstances additional zero (or quasizero) modes can appear due to spin symmetry.
