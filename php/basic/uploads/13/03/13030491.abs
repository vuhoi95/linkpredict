Title: Complementary role of the pressure in the black hole thermodynamics
Authors: Edwin J. Son and Wontae Kim
Abstract: In black hole thermodynamics of certain models, the thermodynamic first law may contain the pressure term. The corresponding entropy follows the area law whereas the thermodynamic energy is not the same with the black hole mass. If the pressure can be decomposed into two parts and recombined with the original thermodynamic quantities, then the thermodynamic energy becomes the black hole mass and the entropy satisfying the area law turns out to be the corrected entropy called the Wald entropy, respectively.
