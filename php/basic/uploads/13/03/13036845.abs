Title: D6-Brane Model Building and Discrete Symmetries on T6/Z(2)xZ(6')xOR with  Discrete Torsion
Authors: Gabriele Honecker and Wieland Staessens
Abstract: We review several geometric aspects and properties of the orbifold T6/Z(2)xZ(6')xOR with discrete torsion, that are crucial with respect to global model building and the search for discrete gauge symmetries in the context of intersecting D6-brane models. A global six-stack Pati-Salam model is used for illustration, and various characteristics of its effective field theory are discussed.
