Title: Non-Gaussianity from Excited Initial Inflationary States
Authors: Aditya Aravind and Dustin Lorshbough and Sonia Paban
Abstract: We study squeezed limit $f_{NL}$ generation by excited initial inflationary states in a model independent way. We restrict "excited" to mean a Bogoliubov transformation of the Bunch Davies state. We simultaneously impose the constraints that the observable power spectrum is nearly scale invariant over at least three decades and that the observable modes today be subhorizon at the beginning of inflation while not causing significant backreaction. We show that most excited initial inflationary states for single field inflationary models with negligible superhorizon evolution do not produce an observable squeezed limit $f_{NL}$. The case in which one mode is in the Bunch Davies state while the other two modes are in an excited state with $0.01<|\beta_k|\leq0.1$ may generate a squeezed limit $f_{NL}$ which is detectable with future experiments.
