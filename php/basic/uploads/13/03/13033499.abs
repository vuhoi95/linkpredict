Title: Angular Correlation Functions for Models with Logarithmic Oscillations
Authors: Mark G. Jackson and Ben Wandelt and Fran√ßois Bouchet
Abstract: There exist several theoretical motivations for primordial correlation functions (such as the power spectrum) to contain oscillations as a logarithmic function of comoving momentum k. While these features are commonly searched for in k-space, an alternative is to use angular space; that is, search for correlations between the directional vectors of observation. We develop tools to efficiently compute the angular correlations based on a stationary phase approximation and examine several example oscillations in the primordial power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum. We find that logarithmically-periodic oscillations are essentially featureless and therefore difficult to detect using the standard correlator, though others might be feasible.
