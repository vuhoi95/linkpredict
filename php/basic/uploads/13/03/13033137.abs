Title: Doubly elliptic strings on the (anti-)de Sitter manifold
Authors: Michel Gaudin and Ugo Moschella
Abstract: We present a new class of elliptic-like strings on two-dimensional manifolds of constant curvature. Our solutions are related to a class of identities between Jacobi theta functions and to the geometry of the lightcone in one (spacelike) dimension more.
