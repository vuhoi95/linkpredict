Title: All Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau Four-Folds
Authors: James Gray and Alexander S. Haupt and Andre Lukas
Abstract: We present an exhaustive, constructive, classification of the Calabi-Yau four-folds which can be described as complete intersections in products of projective spaces. A comprehensive list of 921,497 configuration matrices which represent all topologically distinct types of complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds is provided and can be downloaded at http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/projects/CalabiYau/Cicy4folds/index.html . The manifolds have non-negative Euler characteristics in the range 0 - 2610. This data set will be of use in a wide range of physical and mathematical applications. Nearly all of these four-folds are elliptically fibered and are thus of interest for F-theory model building.
