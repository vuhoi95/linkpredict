Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking and optimization of functional  renormalization group
Authors: I. Nandori and I. G. Marian and V. Bacso
Abstract: The requirement for the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the d=1 dimension has been used to optimize the regulator dependence of functional renormalization group equations in the framework of the sine-Gordon scalar field theory. Results obtained by the optimization of this kind were compared to those of the Litim-Pawlowski and the principle of minimal sensitivity optimization scenarios. The optimal parameters of the compactly supported smooth (CSS) regulator, which recovers all major types of regulators in appropriate limits, have been determined beyond the local potential approximation, and the Litim limit of the CSS was found to be the optimal choice.
