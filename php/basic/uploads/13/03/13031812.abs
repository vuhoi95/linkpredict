Title: Higgs At Last
Authors: Adam Falkowski and Francesco Riva and Alfredo Urbano
Abstract: We update the experimental constraints on the parameters of the Higgs effective Lagrangian. We combine the most recent LHC Higgs data in all available search channels with electroweak precision observables from SLC, LEP-1, LEP-2, and the Tevatron. Overall, the data are perfectly consistent with the 126 GeV particle being the Standard Model Higgs boson. The Higgs coupling to W and Z bosons relative to the Standard Model one is constrained in the range [0.98,1.09] at 95% confidence level, independently of the values of other Higgs couplings. Higher-order Higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons are also well constrained by a combination of LHC Higgs data and electroweak precision tests.
