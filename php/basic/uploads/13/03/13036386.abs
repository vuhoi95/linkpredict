Title: Statistical mechanics of Coulomb gases as quantum theory on Riemann  surfaces
Authors: Tobias Gulden and Michael Janas and Peter Koroteev and Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Statistical mechanics of 1D multivalent Coulomb gas may be mapped onto non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. We use this example to develop instanton calculus on Riemann surfaces. Borrowing from the formalism developed in the context of Seiberg-Witten duality, we treat momentum and coordinate as complex variables. Constant energy manifolds are given by Riemann surfaces of genus $g\geq 1$. The actions along principal cycles on these surfaces obey ODE in the moduli space of the Riemann surface known as Picard-Fuchs equation. We derive and solve Picard-Fuchs equations for Coulomb gases of various charge content. Analysis of monodromies of these solutions around their singular points yields semiclassical spectra as well as instanton effects such as Bloch bandwidth. Both are shown to be in perfect agreement with numerical simulations.
