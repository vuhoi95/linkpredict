Title: A note on conical solutions in 3D Vasiliev theory
Authors: Andrea Campoleoni and Tomas Prochazka and Joris Raeymaekers
Abstract: We construct a class of smooth solutions in three-dimensional Vasiliev higher spin theories based on the gauge algebra hs[\lambda]. These solutions naturally generalize the previously constructed conical defect solutions in higher spin theories with sl(N) gauge algebra, to which they reduce when \lambda is taken to be equal to N. We provide evidence for their identification with specific primary states of the W_\infty [\lambda] algebra in a particular classical limit. In terms of the Gaberdiel-Gopakumar-'t Hooft limit of the W_N minimal models, this limit corresponds to a regime where the 't Hooft coupling becomes large.
