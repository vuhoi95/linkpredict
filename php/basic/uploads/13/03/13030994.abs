Title: K-Poincare-Hopf algebra and Hopf algebroid structure of phase space from  twist
Authors: Tajron Juric and Stjepan Meljanac and Rina Strajn
Abstract: We unify k-Poincare algebra and k-Minkowski spacetime by embeding them into quantum phase space. The quantum phase space has Hopf algebroid structure to which we apply the twist in order to get k- deformed Hopf algebroid structure and k-deformed phase space. We explicitly construct k-Poincare-Hopf algebra and k-Minkowski spacetime from twist. It is outlined how this construction can be extended to k-deformed super algebra including exterior derivative and forms. Our results are relevant for constructing physical theories on noncommutative spacetime by twisting Hopf algebroid phase space structure.
