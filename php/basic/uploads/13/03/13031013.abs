Title: Testing the non-linear flux ansatz for maximal supergravity
Authors: Hadi Godazgar and Mahdi Godazgar and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We put to test the recently proposed non-linear flux ansatz for maximal supergravity in eleven dimensions, which gives the seven-dimensional flux in terms of the scalars and pseudoscalars of maximal N=8 supergravity, by considering a number of non-trivial solutions of gauged supergravity for which the higher dimensional solutions are known. These include the G$_2$ and SU(4)$^-$ invariant stationary points. The examples considered constitute a very non-trivial check of the ansatz, which it passes with remarkable success.
