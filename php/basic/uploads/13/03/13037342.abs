Title: The spectral function in a strongly coupled, thermalising CFT
Authors: Alice Bernamonti and Ben Craps and Joris Vanhoof
Abstract: In relation to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we discuss a time-dependent notion of spectral function and effective temperature. Extending recent results from arXiv:1212.6066, we work out these quantities in a two-dimensional thermalising CFT dual to AdS3-Vaidya spacetime which interpolates between a black brane geometry at early times and a higher temperature black brane at late times. The computation is carried out in the gravitational holographic dual in the geodesic approximation and using a non-standard analytic continuation.
