Title: Trigonometric sl(2) Gaudin model with boundary terms
Authors: N. Cirilo António and N. Manojlović and Z. Nagy
Abstract: We review the derivation of the Gaudin model with integrable boundaries. Starting from the non-symmetric R-matrix of the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ chain and generic solutions of the reflection equation and the dual reflection equation, the corresponding Gaudin Hamiltonians with boundary terms are calculated. An alternative derivation based on the so-called classical reflection equation is discussed.
