Title: The Scale of Inflation in the Landscape
Authors: Francisco G. Pedro and Alexander Westphal
Abstract: We determine the frequency of regions of small-field inflation in the Wigner landscape as an approximation to random supergravities/type IIB flux compactifications. We show that small-field inflation occurs exponentially more often than large-field inflation The power of primordial gravitational waves from inflation is generically tied to the scale of inflation. For small-field models this is below observational reach. However, we find small-field inflation to be dominated by the highest inflationary energy scales compatible with a sub-Planckian field range. Hence, we expect a typical tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\sim {\cal O}(10^{-3})$ currently undetectable in upcoming CMB measurements.
