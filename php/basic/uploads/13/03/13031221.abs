Title: Galileon bounce after ekpyrotic contraction
Authors: M. Osipov and V. Rubakov
Abstract: We consider a simple cosmological model that includes a long ekpyrotic contraction stage and smooth bounce after it. Ekpyrotic behavior is due to a scalar field with a negative exponential potential, whereas the Galileon field produces bounce. We give an analytical picture of how the bounce occurs within the weak gravity regime, and then perform numerical analysis to extend our results to a non-perturbative regime.
