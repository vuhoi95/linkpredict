Abstract: In a previous study, the flavor-changing fermion-graviton interactions have been analyzed in the framework of the standard model, where analytical results for the relevant form factors were obtained at the leading order in the external fermion masses. These interactions arise at one-loop level by the charged electroweak corrections to the fermion-graviton vertex, when the off-diagonal flavor transitions in the corresponding charged weak currents are taken into account. Due to the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, the corresponding form factors turn out to be finite and gauge invariant when external fermions are on-shell. Here we extend this previous analysis by including the exact dependence on the external fermion masses. Complete analytical results are provided for all the relevant form factors to the flavor-changing fermion-graviton transitions.
