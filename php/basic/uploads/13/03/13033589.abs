Title: Hypercharge Flux in IIB and F-theory: Anomalies and Gauge Coupling  Unification
Authors: Christoph Mayrhofer and Eran Palti and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We analyse hypercharge flux GUT breaking in F-theory/Type IIB GUT models with regards to its implications for anomaly cancellation and gauge coupling unification. To this aim we exploit the Type IIB limit and consider 7-brane configurations that for the first time are guaranteed to exhibit net hypercharge flux restriction to matter curves. We show that local F-theory models with anomalies of type U(1)_Y-U(1)^2 in the massless spectrum can be consistent only if such additional U(1)s are globally geometrically massive (in the sense that they arise from non-Kahler deformations of the Calabi-Yau four-fold). Further, in such cases of geometrically massive U(1)s hypercharge flux can induce new anomalies of type U(1)_Y^2-U(1) in the massless spectrum, violating constraints in local models forbidding such anomalies. In particular this implies that it is possible to construct models exhibiting a U(1)_{PQ} global symmetry which have hypercharge flux doublet-triplet splitting and no further exotics. We also show that the known hypercharge flux induced splitting of the gauge couplings in IIB models at tree-level can be reduced by a factor of 5 by employing a more F-theoretic twisting of U(1) flux by hypercharge flux bringing it to well within MSSM 2-loop results. In the case of net restriction of hypercharge flux to matter curves this tree-level splitting becomes more involved, is tied to the vacuum expectation values of certain closed-string fields, and therefore gauge coupling unification becomes tied to the question of moduli stabilisation.
