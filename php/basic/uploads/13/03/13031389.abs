Title: A toolkit for defect computations in Landau-Ginzburg models
Authors: Nils Carqueville and Daniel Murfet
Abstract: We review the results of arXiv:1208.1481 on orientation reversal and duality for defects in topological Landau-Ginzburg models, with the intention of providing an easily accessible toolkit for computations. As an example we include a proof of the main result on adjunctions in a special case, using Pauli matrices. We also explain how to compute arbitrary correlators of defect-decorated planar worldsheets, and briefly discuss the relation to generalised orbifolds.
