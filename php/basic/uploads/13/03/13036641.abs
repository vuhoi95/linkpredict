Title: Toward a Higher-Spin Dual of Interacting Field Theories
Authors: Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas and Cheng Peng
Abstract: We show explicitly how the exact renormalization group equation of interacting vector models in the large N limit can be mapped into certain higher-spin equations of motion. The equations of motion are generalized to incorporate a multiparticle extension of the higher-spin algebra, which reflects the "multitrace" nature of the interactions in the dual field theory from the holographic point of view.
