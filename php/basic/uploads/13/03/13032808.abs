Title: A nonlinear prerelativistic approach to mathematical representation of  vacuum electromagnetism
Authors: Stoil Donev and Maria Tashkova
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative prerelativistic approach to the vacuum case of classical electrodynamics represented by vacuum Maxwell equations. Our view is based on the understanding that the corresponding differential equations should be dynamical in nature and the physical relations represented by them should be directly verifiable at least in principle, so they must represent local energy-momentum balance relations.
