Title: Auxiliary superfields in N=1 supersymmetric self-dual electrodynamics
Authors: Evgeny Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld and Boris Zupnik
Abstract: We construct the general formulation of N=1 supersymmetric self-dual abelian gauge theory involving auxiliary chiral spinor superfields. Self-duality in this context is just U(N) invariance of the nonlinear interaction of the auxiliary superfields. Focusing on the U(1) case, we present the most general form of the U(1) invariant auxiliary interaction, consider a few instructive examples and show how to generate self-dual N=1 models with higher derivatives in this approach.
