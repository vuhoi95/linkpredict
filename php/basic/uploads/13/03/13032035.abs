Title: E8 duality and dual gravity
Authors: Hadi Godazgar and Mahdi Godazgar and Malcolm J. Perry
Abstract: We construct the non-linear realisation of the E8 motion group and compare this with the bosonic sector of eleven dimensional supergravity. The construction naturally leads to the introduction of a new potential field. We identify this new field with the dual gravity field by considering the reduction of the eleven-dimensional theory to three dimensions.
