Title: The incompressible fluid revisited: vortex-sound interactions
Authors: Solomon Endlich and Alberto Nicolis
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a nearly incompressible fluid via (classical) effective field theory. In the kinematical regime corresponding to near incompressibility (small fluid velocities and accelerations), compressional modes are, by definition, difficult to excite, and can be dealt with perturbatively. We systematically outline the corresponding perturbative expansion, which can be thought of as an expansion in the ratio of fluid velocity and speed of sound. Our analysis is fully relativistic, but, if desired, the non-relativistic limit can be taken at any stage. We demonstrate the potential of our method by some sample calculations: the relativistic corrections to the emission and to the scattering of sound by vorticose (possibly turbulent) motions, and, more interestingly, the vortex-vortex long range interaction mediated by sound. These results are, to our knowledge, new. For the last one, we find a 1/r^3 potential between localized vortex configurations (e.g., vortex rings), whose strength and detailed structure depend on a certain multipole moment of the vortices under consideration. We also improve on the so-called vortex filament model, by providing a local field theory describing the dynamics of vortex-line systems and their interaction with sound, to all orders in perturbation theory.
