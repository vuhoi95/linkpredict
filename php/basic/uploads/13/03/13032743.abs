Title: Worldsheet one-loop energy correction to IIA Giant Magnon
Authors: Xiaojian Bai and Bum-Hoon Lee and I. Y. Park
Abstract: We compute one-loop corrections to the energy of a IIA giant magnon solution in the $AdS_4 \times CP^3$ background by using the standard quantum field theory (QFT) techniques. The string action is expanded around the solution to the quadratic order in the fluctuation fields. The resulting action has 2D coordinate dependent-coefficients, a feature that complicates the analysis. The solution contains a worldsheet velocity parameter $v$, and is expanded in terms of the parameter. A perturbative analysis is carried out by treating the $v$-dependent parts as vertices. The energy is computed by first putting the system in a box of length $L$ and Fourier-transforming the fields into the discrete momentum modes. We compare our result with the results obtained by the algebraic curve method.
