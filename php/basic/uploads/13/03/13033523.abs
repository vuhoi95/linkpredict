Title: Quantum restoration of broken symmetries
Authors: V. V. Belokurov and E. T. Shavgulidze
Abstract: A certain non-linear non-local substitution is shown to transform the action of the self-interacting quantum field to the free one. The functional integrals in both theories are equal to each other. However, the integrations are performed over different functional spaces. The classical action and the classical limit of the corresponding quantum theory turn out to be different. And the symmetry originally broken in the classical theory is restored in the classical limit of the quantum theory.
