Authors: Anton Galajinsky and Armen Nersessian and Armen Saghatelian
Abstract: We provide a systematic account of integrability of the spherical mechanics associated with the near horizon extremal Myers-Perry black hole in arbitrary dimension for the special case that all rotation parameters are equal. The integrability is established both in the original coordinates and in action-angle variables. It is demonstrated that the spherical mechanics associated with the black hole in d=2n+1 is maximally superintegrable, while its counterpart related to the black hole in d=2n lacks for only one integral of motion to be maximally superintegrable.
