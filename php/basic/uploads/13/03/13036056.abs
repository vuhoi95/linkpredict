Title: Static spacetimes with/without black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons  gravity
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Kentaro Tanabe
Abstract: We show that the static and asymptotically flat black hole spacetime is unique to be Schwarzschild spacetime in the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. In addition, we show that the strictly static spacetimes should be the Minkowski spacetime.
