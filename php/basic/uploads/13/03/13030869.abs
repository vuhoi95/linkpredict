Title: Index theory and dynamical symmetry enhancement of M-horizons
Authors: J. B. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We show that near-horizon geometries of 11-dimensional supergravity preserve an even number of supersymmetries. The proof follows from Lichnerowicz type theorems for two horizon Dirac operators, the field equations and Bianchi identities, and the vanishing of the index of a Dirac operator on the 9-dimensional horizon sections. As a consequence of this, we also prove that all M-horizons with non-vanishing fluxes admit a sl(2,R) subalgebra of symmetries.
