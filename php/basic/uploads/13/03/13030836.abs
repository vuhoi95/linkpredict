Title: New N=1 Dualities
Authors: Abhijit Gadde and Kazunobu Maruyoshi and Yuji Tachikawa and Wenbin Yan
Abstract: We show that the N=1 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with 2N flavors without superpotential has not only the standard Seiberg dual description but also another dual description involving two copies of the so-called T_N theory. This is a natural generalization to N>2 of a dual description of SU(2) gauge theory with 4 flavors found by Csaki, Schmaltz, Skiba and Terning. We also study dualities of other N=1 SCFTs involving copies of T_N theories. Our duality is the basic operation from which a recently-found web of N=1 dualities obtained by compactifying M5-branes on Riemann surfaces can be derived field-theoretically.
