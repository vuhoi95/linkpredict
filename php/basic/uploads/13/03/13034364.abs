Authors: A. V. Bednyakov and A. F. Pikelner and V. N. Velizhanin
Abstract: We present the results for three-loop beta-function for the Higgs self-coupling calculated within the unbroken phase of the Standard Model. We also provide the expression for three-loop beta-function of the Higgs mass parameter, which is obtained as a by-product of our main calculation. Our results coincide with that of recent paper arXiv:1303.2890. In addition, the expression for the Higgs field anomalous dimension is given.
