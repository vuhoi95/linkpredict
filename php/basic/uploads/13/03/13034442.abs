Title: Entanglement Entropy Near Cosmological Singularities
Authors: Netta Engelhardt and Gary T. Horowitz
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a confining gauge theory near cosmological singularities using gauge/gravity duality. As expected, the coefficients of the UV divergent terms are given by simple geometric properties of the entangling surface in the time-dependent background. The finite (universal) part of the entanglement entropy either grows without bound or remains bounded depending on the nature of the singularity and entangling region. We also discuss a confinement/deconfinement phase transition as signaled by the entanglement entropy.
