Title: Riemann zeta zeros and prime number spectra in quantum field theory
Authors: G. Menezes and B. F. Svaiter and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: The Riemann hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeros of the zeta function lie in the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$. Hilbert and P\'olya suggested that one possible way to prove the Riemann hypothesis is to interpret the nontrivial zeros in the light of spectral theory. Following this approach, we discuss a necessary condition that such a sequence of numbers should obey in order to be associated with the spectrum of a linear differential operator of a system with countably infinite number of degrees of freedom described by quantum field theory. The sequence of nontrivial zeros is zeta regularizable. Then, functional integrals associated with hypothetical systems described by self-adjoint operators whose spectra is given by this sequence can be constructed. However, if one considers the same situation with primes numbers, the associated functional integral cannot be constructed, due to the fact that the sequence of prime numbers is not zeta regularizable. Finally, we extend this result to sequences whose asymptotic distributions are not "far away" from the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers.
