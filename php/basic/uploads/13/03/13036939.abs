Title: The 1/2 BPS Wilson loop in ABJM theory at two loops
Authors: Marco S. Bianchi and Gaston Giribet and Matias Leoni and Silvia Penati
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loop in ABJM theory at two loops in perturbation theory. The result shows perfect agreement with the prediction from localization and the proposed framing factor.
