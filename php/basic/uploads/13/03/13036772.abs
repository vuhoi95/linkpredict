Title: Renormalization of an SU(2) Tensorial Group Field Theory in Three  Dimensions
Authors: Sylvain Carrozza and Daniele Oriti and Vincent Rivasseau
Abstract: We address in this paper the issue of renormalizability for SU(2) Tensorial Group Field Theories (TGFT) with geometric Boulatov-type conditions in three dimensions. We prove that tensorial interactions up to degree 6 are just renormalizable without any anomaly. Our new models define the renormalizable TGFT version of the Boulatov model and provide therefore a new approach to quantum gravity in three dimensions. Among the many new technical results established in this paper are a general classification of just renormalizable models with gauge invariance condition, and in particular concerning properties of melonic graphs, the second order expansion of melonic two point subgraphs needed for wave-function renormalization.
