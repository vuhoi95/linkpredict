Title: Black hole discharge in massive electrodynamics and black hole  disappearance in massive gravity
Authors: Mehrdad Mirbabayi and Andrei Gruzinov
Abstract: We define and calculate the "discharge mode" for a Schwarzschild black hole in massive electrodynamics. For small photon mass, the discharge mode describes the decay of the electric field of a charged star collapsing into a black hole. We argue that a similar "discharge of mass" occurs in massive gravity and leads to a strange process of black hole disappearance.
