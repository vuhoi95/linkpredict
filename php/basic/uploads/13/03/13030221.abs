Title: Branes, Weights and Central Charges
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Fabio Riccioni and Luca Romano
Abstract: We study the properties of half-supersymmetric branes in string theory with 32 supercharges from a purely group-theoretical point of view using the U-duality symmetry of maximal supergravity and the R-symmetry of the corresponding supersymmetry algebra. In particular, we show that half-supersymmetric branes are always associated to the longest weights of the U-duality representation of the potentials coupling to them. We compare the features of branes with three or more transverse directions (that we call "standard" branes) to those with two or less transverse directions (that we denominate "non-standard" branes). We show why the BPS condition of the non-standard branes is in general degenerate and for each case we calculate this degeneracy. We furthermore show how the orbits of multi-charge configurations of non-standard branes can be calculated and give the U-duality invariants describing these orbits. We show that different orbits of non-standard branes can have the same BPS condition.
