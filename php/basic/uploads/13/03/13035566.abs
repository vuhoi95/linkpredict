Title: Gravity's Rainbow induces Topology Change
Authors: Remo Garattini and Francisco S. N. Lobo
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility that quantum fluctuations induce a topology change, in the context of Gravity's Rainbow. A semi-classical approach is adopted, where the graviton one-loop contribution to a classical energy in a background spacetime is computed through a variational approach with Gaussian trial wave functionals. The energy density of the graviton one-loop contribution, or equivalently the background spacetime, is then let to evolve, and consequently the classical energy is determined. More specifically, the background metric is fixed to be Minkowskian in the equation governing the quantum fluctuations, which behaves essentially as a backreaction equation, and the quantum fluctuations are let to evolve; the classical energy, which depends on the evolved metric functions, is then evaluated. Analysing this procedure, a natural ultraviolet (UV) cutoff is obtained, which forbids the presence of an interior spacetime region, and may result in a multipy-connected spacetime. Thus, in the context of Gravity's Rainbow, this process may be interpreted as a change in topology, and in principle results in the presence of a Planckian wormhole.
