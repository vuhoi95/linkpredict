Abstract: We argue that a generic instability afflicts vacua that arise in theories whose moduli space has large dimension. Specifically, by studying theories with multiple scalar fields we provide numerical evidence that for a generic local minimum of the potential the usual semiclassical bubble nucleation rate, Gamma = A e^{-B}, increases rapidly as function of the number of fields in the theory. As a consequence, the fraction of vacua with tunneling rates low enough to maintain metastability appears to fall exponentially as a function of the moduli space dimension. We discuss possible implications for the landscape of string theory. Notably, if our results prove applicable to string theory, the landscape of metastable vacua may not contain sufficient diversity to offer a natural explanation of dark energy.
