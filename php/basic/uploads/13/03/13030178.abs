Title: Quantum Stabilization of a Closed Nielsen-Olesen String
Authors: M. Quandt and N. Graham and H. Weigel
Abstract: We revisit the classical instability of closed strings in the Abelian Higgs model. The instability is expressed by a vanishing energy as the torus-like configuration shrinks to zero size. We treat the radius of the torus as a collective coordinate and demonstrate that a quantum mechanical treatment of this coordinate leads to a stabilization of the closed string at small radii.
