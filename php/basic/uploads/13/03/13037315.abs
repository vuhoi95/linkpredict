Title: Polynomial Chaotic Inflation in the Planck Era
Authors: Kazunori Nakayama and Fuminobu Takahashi and Tsutomu T. Yanagida
Abstract: We propose a chaotic inflation model in supergravity based on polynomial interactions of the inflaton. Specifically we study the chaotic inflation model with quadratic, cubic and quartic couplings in the scalar potential and show that the predicted scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within the 1 sigma region allowed by the Planck results.
