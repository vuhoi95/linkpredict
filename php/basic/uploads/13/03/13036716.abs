Title: Symmetry protected entanglement renormalization
Authors: Sukhwinder Singh and Guifre Vidal
Abstract: Entanglement renormalization is a real-space renormalization group (RG) transformation for quantum many-body systems. It generates the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a tensor network capable of efficiently describing a large class of many-body ground states, including those of systems at a quantum critical point or with topological order. The MERA has also been proposed to be a discrete realization of the holographic principle of string theory. In this paper we propose the use of symmetric tensors as a mechanism to build a symmetry protected RG flow, and discuss two important applications of this construction. First, we argue that symmetry protected entanglement renormalization produces the proper structure of RG fixed-points, namely a fixed-point for each symmetry protected phase. Second, in the context of holography, we show that by using symmetric tensors, a global symmetry at the boundary becomes a local symmetry in the bulk, thus explicitly realizing in the MERA a characteristic feature of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
