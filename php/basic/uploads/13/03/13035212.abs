Title: Stabilizing matter and gauge fields localized on walls
Authors: Masato Arai and Filip Blaschke and Minoru Eto and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: Both non-Abelian gauge fields and minimally interacting massless matter fields are localized on a domain wall in the five-dimensional spacetime. Field-dependent gauge coupling naturally gives a position-dependent coupling to localize non-Abelian gauge fields on the domain wall. An economical field content allows us to eliminate a moduli for a instability, and to demonstrate the positivity of the position-dependent coupling in the entire moduli space. Effective Lagrangian similar to the chiral Lagrangian is found with a new feature of different coupling strengths for adjoint and singlet matter that depend on the width of the domain wall.
