Title: Power-law cosmologies in minimal and maximal gauged supergravity
Authors: J. Blåbäck and A. Borghese and S. S. Haque
Abstract: In this paper we search for accelerating power-law solutions and ekpyrotic solutions within minimal and maximal four dimensional supergravity theories. We focus on the STU model for N=1 and on the new CSO(p,q,r) theories, which were recently obtained exploiting electromagnetic duality, for N=8. In the minimal case we find some new ekpyrotic solutions, while in the maximal case we find some new generic power-law solutions. We do not find any new accelerating solutions for these models.
