Title: A signature of quantum spin liquids in superconductors with topological  order
Authors: Debanjan Chowdhury and Brian Swingle and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: This paper has been withdrawn and superseded by a new version entitled "Singularity of the London penetration depth at quantum critical points in superconductors" by Debanjan Chowdhury, Brian Swingle, Erez Berg and Subir Sachdev, posted in arXiv:1305.2918. The more recent paper has a number of new interesting results and includes a comprehensive analysis of 3 different classes of QCPs, including the one that was originally considered.
