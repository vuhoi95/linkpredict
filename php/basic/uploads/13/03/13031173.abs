Abstract: Explicit solutions for extended objects of a Q-ball type were found analytically in a model describing complex scalar field with piecewise parabolic potential in (3+1)- and (1+1)-dimensional space-times. Such a potential provides a variety of solutions which were thoroughly examined. It was shown that, depending on the values of the parameters of the model and according to the known stability criteria, there exist stable and unstable solutions. The classical stability of solutions in (1+1)-dimensional space-time was examined in the linear approximation and it was shown explicitly that the spectrum of linear perturbations around some solutions contains exponentially growing modes while it is not so for other solutions.
