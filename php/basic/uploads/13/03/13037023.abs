Title: Curvaton mechanism after multi-field inflation
Authors: Seishi Enomoto and Tomohiro Matsuda
Abstract: The evolution of the curvature perturbation after multi-field inflation is studied in the light of the curvaton mechanism. Past numerical studies show that many-field inflation causes significant evolution of the curvature perturbation after inflation, which generates significant non-Gaussianity at the same time. We reveal the underlying mechanism of the evolution and show that the evolution is possible in a typical two-field inflation model.
