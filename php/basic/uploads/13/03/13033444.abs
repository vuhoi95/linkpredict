Title: On Homotopy Algebras and Quantum String Field Theory
Authors: Korbinian Muenster and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: We revisit the existence, background independence and uniqueness of closed, open and open-closed bosonic- and topological string field theory, using the machinery of homotopy algebra. In a theory of classical open- and closed strings, the space of inequivalent open string field theories is isomorphic to the space of classical closed string backgrounds. We then discuss obstructions of these moduli spaces at the quantum level. For the quantum theory of closed strings, uniqueness on a given background follows from the decomposition theorem for loop homotopy algebras. We also address the question of background independence of closed string field theory.
