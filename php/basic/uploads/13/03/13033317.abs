Title: On Î±' corrections in N=1 F-theory compactifications
Authors: Thomas W. Grimm and Raffaele Savelli and Matthias Weissenbacher
Abstract: We consider N=1 F-theory and Type IIB orientifold compactifications and derive new \alpha' corrections to the four-dimensional effective action. They originate from higher derivative corrections to eleven-dimensional supergravity and survive the M-theory to F-theory limit. We find a correction to the Kahler moduli depending on a non-trivial intersection curve of seven-branes. We also analyze a four-dimensional higher curvature correction.
