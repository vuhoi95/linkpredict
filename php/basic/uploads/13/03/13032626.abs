Title: 3d & 5d gauge theory partition functions as q-deformed CFT correlators
Authors: Fabrizio Nieri and Sara Pasquetti and Filippo Passerini
Abstract: 3d N=2 partition functions on the squashed three-sphere and on the twisted product S2xS1 have been shown to factorize into sums of squares of solid tori partition functions, the so-called holomorphic blocks. The same set of holomorphic blocks realizes squashed three-sphere and S2xS1 partition functions but the two cases involve different inner products, the S-pairing and the id-pairing respectively. We define a class of q-deformed CFT correlators where conformal blocks are controlled by a deformation of Virasoro symmetry and are paired by S-pairing and id-pairing respectively. Applying the bootstrap approach to a class of degenerate correlators we are able to derive three-point functions. We show that degenerate correlators can be mapped to 3d partition functions while the crossing symmetry of CFT correlators corresponds to the flop symmetry of 3d gauge theories. We explore how non-degenerate q-deformed correlators are related to 5d partition functions. We argue that id-pairing correlators are associated to the superconformal index on S4xS1 while S-pairing three-point function factors capture the one-loop part of S5 partition functions. This is consistent with the interpretation of S2xS1 and squashed three-sphere gauge theories as codimension two defect theories inside S4xS1 and S5 respectively.
