Title: Exploring 6D origins of 5D supergravities with Chern-Simons terms
Authors: Federico Bonetti and Thomas W. Grimm and Stefan Hohenegger
Abstract: We consider five-dimensional supergravity theories with eight or sixteen supercharges with Abelian vector fields and ungauged scalars. We address the question under which conditions these theories can be interpreted as effective low energy descriptions of circle reductions of anomaly free six-dimensional theories with (1,0) or (2,0) supersymmetry. We argue that classical and one-loop gauge- and gravitational Chern-Simons terms are instrumental for this question.
