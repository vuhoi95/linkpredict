Title: The DeWitt Equation in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Parikshit Dutta and Krzysztof A. Meissner and Hermann Nicolai
Abstract: We take a new look at the DeWitt equation, a defining equation for the effective action functional in quantum field theory. We present a formal solution to this equation, and discuss the equation in various contexts, and in particular for models where it can be made completely well defined, such as the Wess-Zumino model in two dimensions.
