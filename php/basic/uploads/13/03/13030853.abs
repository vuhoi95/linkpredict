Title: Index Theory and Supersymmetry of 5D Horizons
Authors: J. Grover and J. B. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We prove that the near-horizon geometries of minimal gauged five-dimensional supergravity preserve at least half of the supersymmetry. If the near-horizon geometries preserve a larger fraction, then they are locally isometric to $AdS_5$. Our proof is based on Lichnerowicz type theorems for two horizon Dirac operators constructed from the supercovariant connection restricted to the horizon sections, and on an application of the index theorem. An application is that all half-supersymmetric five-dimensional horizons admit an $\mathfrak{sl}(2, {\mathbb{R}})$ symmetry subalgebra.
