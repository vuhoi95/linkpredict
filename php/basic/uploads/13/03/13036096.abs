Title: On the Generalized Geometry Origin of Noncommutative Gauge Theory
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Peter Schupp and Jan Vysoky
Abstract: We discuss noncommutative gauge theory from the generalized geometry point of view. We argue that the equivalence between the commutative and semiclassically noncommutative DBI actions is naturally encoded in the generalized geometry of D-branes.
