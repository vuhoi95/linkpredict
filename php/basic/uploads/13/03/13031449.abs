Title: Hybrid r-Vacua in N=2 Supersymmetric QCD: Universal Condensate Formula
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We derive an exact unified formula for all condensates (quark and monopole) in the hybrid r vacua in N=2 supersymmetric QCD slightly deformed by a \mu A^2 term. The gauge group is assumed to be U(N) and the number of the quark flavors N_f subject to the condition N< N_f < 2N. In the r vacua r quarks and N-r-1 monopoles from non-overlapping subgroups of U(N) develop vacuum expectation values (r<N). We then briefly review possible dynamical regimes (confinement, screening, and "instead of confinement") in the hybrid r vacua in \mu-deformed N=2 SQCD (the small-\mu limit).
