Title: Relative Locality in Curved Space-time
Authors: Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman and Giacomo Rosati
Abstract: In this paper we construct the action describing dynamics of the particle moving in curved spacetime, with a non-trivial momentum space geometry. Curved momentum space is the core feature of theories where relative locality effects are presents. So far aspects of nonlinearities in momentum space have been studied only for flat or constantly expanding (De Sitter) spacetimes, relying on the their maximally symmetric nature. The extension of curved momentum space frameworks to arbitrary spacetime geometries could be relevant for the opportunities to test Planck-scale curvature/deformation of particles momentum space. As a first example of this construction we describe the particle with kappa-Poincar\'e momentum space on a circular orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime, where the contributes of momentum space curvature turn out to be negligible. The analysis of this problem relies crucially on the solution of the soccer ball problem.
