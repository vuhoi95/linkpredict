Abstract: We investigate the a theorem for nonsupersymmetric gauge-Yukawa theories beyond the leading order in perturbation theory. The exploration is first performed in a model-independent manner and then applied to a specific relevant example. Here, a rich fixed point structure appears including the presence of a merging phenomenon between non-trivial fixed points for which the a theorem has not been tested so far.
