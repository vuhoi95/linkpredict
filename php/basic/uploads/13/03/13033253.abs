Title: Wall-crossing structures in Donaldson-Thomas invariants, integrable  systems and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Maxim Kontsevich and Yan Soibelman
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Wall-Crossing Structure and discuss it in several examples including complex integrable systems, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and Mirror Symmetry. For a big class of non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds we construct complex integrable systems of Hitchin type with the base given by the moduli space of deformations of those 3-folds. Then Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the Fukaya category of such a Calabi-Yau 3-fold can be (conjecturally) described in two more ways: in terms of the attractor flow on the base of the corresponding complex integrable system and in terms of the skeleton of the mirror dual to the total space of the integrable system. The paper also contains a discussion of some material related to the main subject, e.g. Betti model of Hitchin systems with irregular singularities, WKB asymptotics of connections depending on a small parameter, attractor points in the moduli space of complex structures of a compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold, relation to cluster varieties, etc.
