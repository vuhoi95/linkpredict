Title: D-branes and cosmic structure
Authors: Danielle Wills and Konstantinos Dimopoulos and Ivonne Zavala
Abstract: We outline the embedding of the vector curvaton scenario as a promising mechanism to generate statistical anisotropy within Type IIB string theory, where the vector field on a single D-brane plays the role of the vector curvaton. We first consider a toy model in the context of open string inflation, and then begin to construct a concrete model in the context of closed string inflation.
