Title: Contractions of AdS brane algebra and superGalileon Lagrangians
Authors: Kiyoshi Kamimura and Seiji Onda
Abstract: We examine AdS Galileon Lagrangians using the method of non-linear realization. By contractions 1) flat curvature limit and 2) non-relativistic brane algebra limit and 3) (1)+(2) limits we obtain DBI, Newton-Hoock and Galilean Galileons respectively. We make clear how these Lagrangians appear as invariant 4-forms and/or pseudo-invariant Wess-Zumino terms using Maurer-Cartan equations on the coset $G/SO(3,1)$. We show the equations of motion are written in terms of the MC forms only and explain why the inverse Higgs condition is obtained as the equation of motion for all cases. The supersymmetric extension is also examined using SU(2,2|1)/(SO(3,1)x U(1)) supercoset and five WZ forms are constructed. They are reduced to the corresponding five Galileon WZ forms in the bosonic limit and are candidates of for supersymmetric Galileon.
