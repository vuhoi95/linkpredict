Title: Scale-dependent bias from multiple-field inflation
Authors: Mafalda Dias and Raquel H. Ribeiro and David Seery
Abstract: We provide a formula for the scaling behaviour of the inflationary bispectrum in the 'squeezed' limit where one momentum becomes much smaller than the other two. This determines the scaling of the halo bias at low wavenumber and will be an important observable for the next generation of galaxy surveys. Our formula allows it to be predicted for the first time for a generic inflationary model with multiple light, canonically-normalized scalar fields.
