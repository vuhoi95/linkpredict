Title: Canonoid transformations and master symmetries
Authors: José F. Cariñena and Fernando Falceto and Manuel F. Rañada
Abstract: Different types of transformations of a dynamical system, that are compatible with the Hamiltonian structure, are discussed making use of a geometric formalism. Firstly, the case of canonoid transformations is studied with great detail and then the properties of master symmetries are also analyzed. The relations between the existence of constants of motion and the properties of canonoid symmetries is discussed making use of a family of boundary and coboundary operators.
