Title: Probing phase-space noncommutativity through quantum beating, missing  information and the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Alex E. Bernardini and O. Bertolami
Abstract: In this work we examine the effect of phase-space noncommutativity on some typically quantum properties such as quantum beating, quantum information, and decoherence. To exemplify these issues we consider the two-dimensional noncommutative quantum harmonic oscillator whose components behavior we monitor in time. This procedure allows us to determine how the noncommutative parameters are related to the missing information quantified by the linear quantum entropy and by the mutual information between the relevant Hilbert space coordinates. Particular questions concerning the thermodynamic limit of some relevant properties are also discussed in order to evidence the effects of noncommutativity. Finally, through an analogy with the Zeeman effect, we identify how some aspects of the axial symmetry of the problem suggest the possibility of decoupling the noncommutative quantum perturbations from unperturbed commutative well-known solutions.
