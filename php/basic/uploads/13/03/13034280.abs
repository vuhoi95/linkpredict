Title: Singlet Portal Extensions of the Standard Seesaw Models to a Dark Sector  with Local Dark Symmetry
Authors: Seungwon Baek and P. Ko and Wan-Il Park
Abstract: Assuming ({\it i}) the seesaw mechanism works for neutrino masses and mixings, ({\it ii}) dark matter is absolutely stable due to unbroken $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, and ({\it iii}) the singlet fields ($H^\dagger H$ and $N_R$) are portal to the dark sector, we construct a simple model which is consistent with all the cosmological observations as well as terrestrial experiments available as of now, including leptogenesis, extra dark radiation of $\sim 8 %$ (resulting in $N_{\rm eff} = 3.130$ the effective number of neutrino species), Higgs inflation, small and large scale structure formation, and current relic density of scalar dark matter ($X$). The electroweak vacuum of this model is stable up to Planck scale for $m_H = 125$ GeV without any other new physics. The Higgs signal strength is equal to one as in the standard model for unbroken $U(1)_X$ case with a scalar dark matter, but it could be less than one independent of decay channels if the dark matter is a dark sector fermion or if $U(1)_X$ is spontaneously broken, because of a mixing with a new neutral scalar boson in the models. Detailed study of Higgs properties at the LHC would shed light on the models described in this work.
