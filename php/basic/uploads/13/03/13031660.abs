Abstract: The effects of a Lorentz symmetry violating background vector on the Aharonov-Casher scattering in the nonrelativistic limit is considered. By using the self-adjoint extension method we found that there is an additional scattering for any value of the self-adjoint extension parameter and non-zero energy bound states for negative values of this parameter. Expressions for the energy bound states, phase-shift and the scattering matrix are explicitly determined in terms of the self-adjoint extension parameter. The expression obtained for the scattering amplitude reveals that the helicity is not conserved in this scenario.
