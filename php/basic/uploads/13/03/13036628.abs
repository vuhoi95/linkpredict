Title: Gradient expansion of superhorizon perturbations in G-inflation
Authors: Noemi Frusciante and Shuang-Yong Zhou and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: We develop the gradient expansion formalism for shift-symmetric Galileon-type actions. We focus on backgrounds that undergo inflation, work in the synchronous gauge, and obtain a general solution up to second order without imposing extra conditions at first order. The solution simplifies during the late stages of inflation. We also define a curvature perturbation conserved up to first order.
