Abstract: We construct an action for double field theory using a metric connection that is compatible with both the generalised metric and the O_{D,D} structure. The connection is simultaneously torsionful and flat. Using this connection one may construct a proper covariant derivative for double field theory. We then write the doubled action in terms of the generalised torsion of this connection. This action then exactly reproduces that required for doubled field theory and gauged supergravity.
