Title: Scalar Radiation in the Background of a Naked Singularity
Authors: Anshuman Dey and Pratim Roy and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We study scalar radiation spectra from a particle in circular orbit, in the background of the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) naked singularity. The differences in the nature of the spectra, from what one obtains with a Schwarzschild black hole, is established. We also compute the angular distribution of the spectra.
