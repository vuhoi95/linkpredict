Title: To Tilt or Not To Tilt: Discrete Gauge Symmetries in Global Intersecting  D-Brane Models
Authors: Gabriele Honecker and Wieland Staessens
Abstract: Discrete gauge symmetries in global intersecting D-brane models constrain the exact form of the perturbative as well as non-perturbative superpotential. We derive the complete set of conditions on the existence of discrete Zn gauge symmetries on toroidal orbifolds, T6/Z(N) and T6/Z(2)xZ(2M}, with fractional or rigid D6-branes on tilted tori, for which global models of particle physics are known. Several examples of global left-right symmetric and Pati-Salam models are presented. Some discrete `stringy' Zn symmetries are trivial from the field theory point of view, while others have not been identified before.
