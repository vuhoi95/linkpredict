Abstract: Recently a prescription to compute the four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal index in the presence of certain BPS surface defects has been given. These surface defects are labelled by symmetric representations of SU(N). In the present paper we give a prescription to compute the superconformal index in the presence of surface defects labelled by arbitrary representations of SU(N). Furthermore, we extend the dictionary between the N = 2 superconformal Schur-index and correlators of q-deformed Yang-Mills to incorporate such surface defects.
