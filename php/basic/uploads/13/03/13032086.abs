Abstract: We propose a mechanism displaying gluon confinement, as defined by the behavior of the propagators, in a model of SU(2) gauge fields. The model originates from an explicitly broken SU(3) gauge theory giving rise to a replica model composed of three mixed SU(2) groups. The mechanism consists in the usual SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge, with a soft breaking term in such a way as to change the field propagation and group content at low energies. The relation of this soft mass term with the Gribov problem is presented and the link between soft terms and the scaling and decoupling solutions is discussed.
