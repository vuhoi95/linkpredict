Title: The emergence of Hopf term and the marginality of Dirac model
Authors: Y. X. Zhao and Z. D. Wang
Abstract: The subtle relation of the marginality of Dirac model and the emergence of the Hopf term through a Yukawa-type interaction is revealed in this work. We show that the improvement of the marginality of Dirac mode through an infinitesimal non-relativistic term, which is irrelevant for renormalization group, is necessary to emerge the Hopf term. It is found that the appearance of the Hopf term is always accompanied with chiral boundary modes, and the sign of the coupling constant of the infinitesimal non-relativistic term decides their chirality. A lattice Dirac model is also constructed to realize the Hopf term.
