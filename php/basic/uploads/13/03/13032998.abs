Title: $Z_2$ index for gapless fermionic modes in the vortex core of three  dimensional paired Dirac fermions
Authors: Bitan Roy and Pallab Goswami
Abstract: We consider the gapless modes along the vortex line of the fully gapped, momentum independent paired states of three-dimensional Dirac fermions. For this, we require the solution of fermion zero modes of the corresponding two-dimensional problem in the presence of a point vortex, in the plane perpendicular to the vortex line. Based on the spectral symmetry requirement for the existence of the zero mode, we identify the appropriate generalized Jackiw-Rossi Hamiltonians for different paired states. A four-dimensional generalized Jackiw-Rossi Hamiltonian possesses spectral symmetry with respect to an antiunitary operator, and gives rise to a single zero mode only for the {\em odd vorticity}, which is formally described by a $Z_2$ index. In the presence of generic perturbations such as chemical potential, Dirac mass, and Zeeman couplings, the associated two-dimensional problem for the odd parity topological superconducting state maps onto {\em two} copies of generalized Jackiw-Rossi Hamiltonian, and consequently an odd vortex binds two Majorana fermions. In contrast, there are no zero energy states for the topologically trivial $s$-wave superconductor in the presence of any chiral symmetry breaking perturbation in the particle-hole channel, such as regular Dirac mass. We show that the number of one-dimensional dispersive modes along the vortex line is also determined by the index of the associated two-dimensional problem. For an axial superfluid state in the presence of various perturbations, we discuss the consequences of the $Z_2$ index on the anomaly equations.
