Title: A class of exactly solvable quantum models of scalar gravity
Authors: V. V. Belokurov and E. T. Shavgulidze
Abstract: Exactly solvable quantum theory of a singular at the origin scalar field with the self-interaction of Liouville type is proposed. The mean value of the scale factor in the FLRW metric as a function of conformal time is evaluated explicitly.
