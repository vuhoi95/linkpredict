Title: A Simple Method for One-Loop Renormalization in Curved Space-Time
Authors: Tommi Markkanen and Anders Tranberg
Abstract: We present a simple method for deriving the renormalization counterterms from the components of the energy-momentum tensor in curved space-time. This method allows full control over the finite parts of the counterterms and provides explicit expressions for each term separately. As an example, the method is used for the self-interacting scalar field in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in the adiabatic approximation, where we calculate the renormalized equation of motion for the field and the renormalized components of the energy-momentum tensor to fourth adiabatic order while including interactions to one-loop order. Within this formalism the trace anomaly, including contributions from interactions, is shown to have a simple derivation. We compare our results to those obtained by two standard methods, finding agreement with the Schwinger-DeWitt expansion but disagreement with adiabatic subtractions for interacting theories.
