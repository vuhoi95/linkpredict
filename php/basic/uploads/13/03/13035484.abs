Title: Discriminating different models of luminosity-redshift distribution
Authors: L. Cosmai and G. Fanizza and M. Gasperini and L. Tedesco
Abstract: The beginning of the cosmological phase bearing the direct kinematic imprints of supernovae dimming may significantly vary within different models of late-time cosmology, even if such models are able to fit present SNe data at a comparable level of statistical accuracy. This effect -- useful in principle to discriminate among different physical interpretations of the luminosity-redshift relation -- is illustrated here with a pedagogical example based on the LTB geometry.
