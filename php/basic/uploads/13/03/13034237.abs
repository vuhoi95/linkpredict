Title: On Integrable Structure and Geometric Transition in Supersymmetric Gauge  Theories
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Annamaria Sinkovics
Abstract: We generalize the exact field theoretic correspondence proposed in arXiv:1103.5726 and embed it into the context of refined topological string. The correspondence originally proposed from the common integrable structures in different field theories can be recast as a special limit of the refined geometric transition relating open and closed topological string partition functions. We realize the simplest examples of the correspondence explicitly in terms of open-closed geometric transition.
