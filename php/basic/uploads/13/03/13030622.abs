Title: Elimination of the Landau pole in QCD with the spontaneously generated  anomalous three-gluon interaction
Authors: Boris A. Arbuzov and Ivan V. Zaitsev
Abstract: We apply the Bogoliubov compensation principle to QCD. The non-trivial solution of compensation equations for a spontaneous generation of the anomalous three-gluon interaction leads to the determination of parameters of the theory, including behavior of the gauge coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ without the Landau singularity, the gluon condensate $V_2\,\simeq\,0.01\,GeV^4$, mass of the lightest glueball $M_G\,\simeq\,1500\,MeV$ in satisfactory agreement with the phenomenological knowledge. The results strongly support the applicability of N.N. Bogoliubov compensation approach to gauge theories of the Standard Model.
