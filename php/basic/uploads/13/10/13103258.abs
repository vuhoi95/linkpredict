Title: On General Off-Shell Representations of Worldline (1D) Supersymmetry
Authors: Charles F. Doran and Tristan Hubsch and Kevin M. Iga and Gregory D. Landweber
Abstract: Every finite-dimensional unitary representation of the N-extended worldline supersymmetry without central charges may be obtained by a sequence of differential transformations from a direct sum of minimal Adinkras, simple supermultiplets that are identifiable with representations of the Clifford algebra. The data specifying this procedure is a sequence of subspaces of the direct sum of Adinkras, which then opens an avenue for classification of the continuum of so constructed off-shell supermultiplets.
