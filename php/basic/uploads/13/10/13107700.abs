Title: Epsilon expansion of Appell and Kampé de Fériet functions
Authors: David Greynat and Javier Sesma and Grégory Vulvert
Abstract: The decomposition in partial fractions of the quotient of Pochhammer symbols improves considerably a method, suggested in a precedent paper, which allows one to obtain the $\varepsilon$-expansion of functions of the hypergeometric class. The procedure is applied to several Appell and Kamp\'e de F\'eriet functions considered in the literature. Explicit expressions and interesting properties of the derivatives of the Pochhammer and reciprocal Pochhammer symbols, which are essential elements in the procedure, are given in an appendix.
