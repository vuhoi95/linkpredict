Title: Abelian-Higgs hair on stationary axisymmetric black hole in  Einstein-Maxwell-axion-dilaton gravity
Authors: ≈Åukasz Nakonieczny and Marek Rogatko
Abstract: We studied, both analytically and numerically, an Abelian Higgs vortex in the spacetime of stationary axisymmetric black hole being the solution of the low-energy limit of the heterotic string theory, acted as hair on the black hole background. Taking into account the gravitational backreaction of the vortex we show that its influence is far more subtle than causing only a conical defect. As a consequence of its existence, we found that the ergosphere was shifted as well as event horizon angular velocity was affected by its presence. Numerical simulations reveal the strong dependence of the vortex behaviour on the black hole charge and mass of the Higgs boson. For large masses of the Higgs boson and large value of the charge, black hole is always pierced by an Abelian Higgs vortex, while small values of the charge and Higgs boson mass lead to the expulsion of Higgs field.
