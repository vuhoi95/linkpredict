Title: Non-Lagrangian Theories from Brane Junctions
Authors: Ling Bao and Vladimir Mitev and Elli Pomoni and Masato Taki and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: In this article we use 5-brane junctions to study the 5D T_N SCFTs corresponding to the 5D N=1 uplift of the 4D N=2 strongly coupled gauge theories, which are obtained by compactifying N M5 branes on a sphere with three full punctures. Even though these theories have no Lagrangian description, by using the 5-brane junctions proposed by Benini, Benvenuti and Tachikawa, we are able to derive their Seiberg-Witten curves and Nekrasov partition functions. We cross-check our results with the 5D superconformal index proposed by Kim, Kim and Lee. Through the AGTW correspondence, we discuss the relations between 5D superconformal indices and n-point functions of the q-deformed W_N Toda theories.
