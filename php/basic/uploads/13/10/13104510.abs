Title: Chiral Edge Currents in a Holographic Josephson Junction
Authors: Moshe Rozali and Alexandre Vincart-Emard
Abstract: We discuss the Josephson effect and the appearance of dissipationless edge currents in a holographic Josephson junction configuration involving a chiral, time-reversal breaking, superconductor in 2+1 dimensions. Such a superconductor is expected to be topological, thereby supporting topologically protected gapless Majorana-Weyl edge modes. Such modes manifest themselves in chiral dissipationless edge currents, which we exhibit and investigate in the context of our construction. The physics of the Josephson current itself, though expected to be unconventional in some non-equilibrium settings, is shown to be conventional in our setup which takes place in thermal equilibrium. We comment on various ways in which the expected Majorana nature of the edge excitations, and relatedly the unconventional nature of topological Josephson junctions, can be verified in the holographic context.
