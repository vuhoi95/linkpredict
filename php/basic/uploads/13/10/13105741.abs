Title: Competing p-wave orders

Abstract: We construct electrically charged, asymptotically $AdS_5$ black hole solutions that are dual to $d=4$ CFTs in a superfluid phase with either p-wave or $(p+ip)$-wave order. The two types of black holes have non-vanishing charged two-form in the bulk and appear at the same critical temperature in the unbroken phase. Both the p-wave and the $(p+ip)$-wave phase can be thermodynamically preferred, depending on the mass and charge of the two-form, and there can also be first order transitions between them. The p-wave black holes have a helical structure and some of them exhibit the phenomenon of pitch inversion as the temperature is decreased. Both the p-wave and the $(p+ip)$-wave black holes have zero entropy density ground states at zero temperature and we identify some new ground states which exhibit scaling symmetry, including a novel scenario for the emergence of conformal symmetry in the IR.
