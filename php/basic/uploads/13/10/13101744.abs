Title: The Spectrum of Light States in Large N Minimal Models
Authors: Matthias R. Gaberdiel and Rajesh Gopakumar and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: $W_{N,k}$ minimal models possess an interesting class of `light' primaries which control much of the low energy density of states in the large $N$ 't Hooft limit. In this paper we conduct a detailed exploration of their distribution using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. We also make some observations about the density of states of the full CFT. Our results appear to support the contention that there is no finite temperature analogue of the Hawking-Page transition in these systems.
