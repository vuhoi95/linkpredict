Title: Three-body forces from a classical nonlinear field
Authors: H. Arodz and J. Karkowski and Z. Swierczynski
Abstract: Forces in the systems of two opposite sign and three identical charges coupled to the dynamical scalar field of the signum-Gordon model are investigated. Three-body force is present, and the exact formula for it is found. Flipping the sign of one of the two charges changes not only the sign but also the magnitude of the force. Both effects are due to nonlinearity of the field equation.
