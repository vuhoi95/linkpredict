Title: Non-extremal and non-BPS extremal five-dimensional black strings from  generalized special real geometry
Authors: Paul Dempster and Thomas Mohaupt
Abstract: We construct non-extremal as well as extremal black string solutions in minimal five-dimensional supergravity coupled to vector multiplets using dimensional reduction to three Euclidean dimensions. Our method does not assume that the scalar manifold is a symmetric space, and applies as well to a class of non-supersymmetric theories governed by a generalization of special real geometry. We find that five-dimensional black string solutions correspond to geodesics in a specific totally geodesic para-K\"ahler submanifold of the scalar manifold of the dimensionally reduced theory, and identify the subset of geodesics that corresponds to regular black string solutions in five dimensions. BPS and non-BPS extremal solutions are distinguished by whether the corresponding geodesics are along the eigendirections of the para-complex structure or not, a characterization which carries over to non-supersymmetric theories. For non-extremal black strings the values of the scalars at the outer and inner horizon are not independent integration constants but determined by certain functions of the charges and moduli. By lifting solutions from three to four dimensions we obtain non-extremal versions of small black holes, and find that while the outer horizon takes finite size, the inner horizon is still degenerate.
