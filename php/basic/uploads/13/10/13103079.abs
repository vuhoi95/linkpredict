Title: Polyakov loop, Hadron Resonance Gas Model and Thermodynamics of QCD
Authors: E. Megias and E. Ruiz Arriola and L. L. Salcedo
Abstract: We summarize recent results on the hadron resonance gas description of QCD. In particular, we apply this approach to describe the equation of state and the vacuum expectation value of the Polyakov loop in several representations. Ambiguities related to exactly which states should be included are discussed.
