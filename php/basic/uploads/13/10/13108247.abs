Title: Clustering and decomposition for non BPS solutions of the  $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ models
Authors: S. Bolognesi and W. Zakrzewski
Abstract: We look at solutions (both BPS and non-BPS) of the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model on $\mathbb{R} \times S^1$ (with twisted boundary conditions), in particular by using a conformal mapping technique, and we show how to interpret these solutions by decomposing them into expressions describing constituent solitons. We point out the problems that may arise (for non-BPS solutions) when one naively looks at the clustering properties of these solutions. This could lead to misunderstandings when studying extrapolations between small and large compactification radii.
