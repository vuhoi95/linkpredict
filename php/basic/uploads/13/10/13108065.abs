Title: Deviation from the Standard Uncertainty Principle and the Dark Energy  Problem
Authors: Shahram Jalalzadeh and Mohammad Ali Gorji and Kourosh Nozari
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations of a real massless scalar field are studied in the context of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The dynamical finite vacuum energy is found in spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson- Walker (FRW) spacetime which can be identified as dark energy to explain late time cosmic speed-up. The results show that a tiny deviation from the standard uncertainty principle is necessary on cosmological ground. By using the observational data we have constraint the GUP parameter even more stronger than ever.
