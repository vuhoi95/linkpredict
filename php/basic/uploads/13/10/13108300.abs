Title: Accelerated Universes from type IIA Compactifications
Authors: Johan Blåbäck and Ulf Danielsson and Giuseppe Dibitetto
Abstract: We study slow-roll accelerating cosmologies arising from geometric compactifications of type IIA string theory on $T^{6}/(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\,\times\,\mathbb{Z}_{2})$. With the aid of a genetic algorithm, we are able to find quasi-de Sitter backgrounds with both slow-roll parameters of order $0.1$. Furthermore, we study their evolution by numerically solving the corresponding time-dependent equations of motion, and we show that they actually display a few e-folds of accelerated expansion. Finally, we comment on their perturbative reliability.
