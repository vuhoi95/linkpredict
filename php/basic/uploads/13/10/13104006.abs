Title: N=2 de Sitter Supersymmetry Algebra
Authors: O. Jalili and S. Rouhani
Abstract: It was shown that N=1 super-symmetry algebra can be constructed in de Sitter space, through calculation of charge conjugation in the ambient space notation. Calculation of N=2 super-symmetry algebra constitutes the main frame of this paper. N=2 super-symmetry algebra was presented in. In this paper, we obtain an alternative N=2 super-symmetry algebra.
