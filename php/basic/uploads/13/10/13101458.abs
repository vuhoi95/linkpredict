Title: Freely Falling Observer and Black Hole Radiation
Authors: Wontae Kim and Edwin J. Son
Abstract: We find radiation in an infalling frame and present an explicit analytic evidence of the failure of no drama condition by showing that an infalling observer finds an infinite negative energy density at the event horizon. The negative and positive energy density regions are divided by the newly defined zero-energy curve. The evaporating black hole is surrounded by the negative energy which can also be observed in the infalling frame.
