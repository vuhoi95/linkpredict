Title: DBI inflation with a non-minimally coupled Gauss-Bonnet term
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Narges Rashidi
Abstract: We study the inflation in a model with a Gauss-Bonnet term which is non-minimally coupled to a DBI field. We study the spectrum of the primordial perturbations in detail. The non-Gaussianity of this model is considered and the amplitude of the non-Gaussianity is studied in both the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. By taking various functions of the DBI field, inflaton potential and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling term, we test the model with observational data and find some constraints on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter.
