Title: A quick guide to defect orbifolds
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Nils Carqueville and Daniel Plencner
Abstract: We provide a lightning review of the construction of (generalised) orbifolds [arXiv:0909.5013, arXiv:1210.6363] of two-dimensional quantum field theories in terms of topological defects, along the lines of [arXiv:1307.3141]. This universal perspective has many applications, some of which we sketch in the examples of 2d Yang-Mills theory, Landau-Ginzburg models, and rational CFT.
