Title: Analogues of Mathai-Quillen forms in sheaf cohomology and applications  to topological field theory
Authors: R. Garavuso and E. Sharpe
Abstract: We construct sheaf-cohomological analogues of Mathai-Quillen forms, that is, holomorphic bundle-valued differential forms whose cohomology classes are independent of certain deformations, and which are believed to possess Thom-like properties. Ordinary Mathai-Quillen forms are special cases of these constructions, as we discuss. These sheaf-theoretic variations arise physically in A/2 and B/2 pseudo-topological field theories, and we comment on their origin and role.
