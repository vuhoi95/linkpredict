Title: Dynamical Couplings and Charge Confinement/Deconfinement from Gravity  Coupled to Nonlinear Gauge Fields
Authors: Eduardo Guendelman and Alexander Kaganovich and Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: We briefly outline several main results concerning various new physically relevant features found in gravity -- both ordinary Einstein or $f(R)=R+R^2$ gravity in the first-order formalism, coupled to a special kind of nonlinear electrodynamics containing a square-root of the standard Maxwell Lagrangian and known to produce charge confinement in flat spacetime.
