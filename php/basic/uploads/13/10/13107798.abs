Title: Parastatistical Factors for Cascade Emission of a Pair of Paraparticles
Authors: Charles A. Nelson and Margarita Kraynova and Calvin S. Mera and Alanna M. Shapiro
Abstract: The empirical absence to date of particles obeying parastatistics in high energy collider experiments might be due to their large masses and lack of gauge couplings. If there is a portal to such particles, they might be cascade emitted as a pair of para-Majorana neutrinos or as a pair of scalar paraparticles. In this paper, for an assumed portal Lagrangian, the associated parastatistical factors are obtained for the case of order p=2 parastatistics and the, in general differing factors, for the cases of emission of a non-degenerate or a degenerate pair of particles which obey normal statistics.
