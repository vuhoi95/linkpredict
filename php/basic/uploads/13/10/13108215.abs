Title: Intersecting D6-branes on the Z_{12}-II orientifold
Authors: David Bailin and Alex Love
Abstract: Much work has been done by a number of authors with the aim of constructing the supersymmetric Standard Model in type IIA intersecting-brane theories compactified on an orientifold with various Z_N or Z_M x Z_N point groups. Here we consider the Z_{12} point group which has previously received comparatively little attention. We consider intersecting D6-branes that wrap 3-cycles consisting of a 2-cycle of the 4-dimensional lattice upon which the Z_{12} is realised times a 1-cycle of the remaining 2-torus. Our discussion is restricted to the case when these 2-cycles are "factorisable" in the sense discussed in section 3. Although it is possible to find models with the correct supersymmetric Standard Model quark-doublet content, we have not found it possible to obtain the correct quark-singlet content.
