Abstract: Motivated by recent works [1,2], the influences of self-gravitational interaction on the Hawking radiation are studied both for (3 + 1) and (4 + 1) dimensional black holes in $z = 4$ Ho\u{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It is found that the tunneling entropies $S_{B(3 + 1)}$ and $S_{B(4 + 1)}$ independent on particle's mass are consistent with the thermodynamical entropies $S_{BH(3 + 1)}$ and $S_{BH(4 + 1)}$, respectively. There is a very visible degree of uniformity between thermodynamics and quantum tunneling in $z = 4$ Ho\u{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It suggests that the entropies contained corrected terms could be explained well by the self-gravitational interaction of Hawking radiation. The study of tunneling process may shed light on understanding the Ho\u{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
