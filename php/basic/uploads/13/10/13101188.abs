Title: Superconformal Chern-Simons theories beyond leading order
Authors: I. Jack and C. Luckhurst
Abstract: We discuss higher-order corrections to superconformal invariance for a class of N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories including the ABJM model. We argue that corrections are inevitable for general theories in this class; but that it is probable that any corrections are of a particular "maximally transcendental" form.
