Title: Exact Partition Functions on RP2 and Orientifolds
Authors: Heeyeon Kim and Sungjay Lee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: We consider gauged linear sigma models (GLSM) on $\mathbb{RP}^2$, obtained from a parity projection of $S^2$. The theories admit squashing deformation, much like GLSM on $S^2$, which allows us to interpret the partition function as the overlap amplitude between the vacuum state and crosscap states. From these, we extract the central charge of Orientifold planes, and observe that the Gamma class makes a prominent appearance as in the recent D-brane counterpart. We also repeat the computation for the mirror Landau-Ginzburg theory, which naturally brings out the $\theta$-dependence as a relative sign between two holonomy sectors on $\mathbb{RP}^2$. We also show how our results are consistent with known topological properties of D-brane and Orientifold plane world-volumes, and discuss what part of the wrapped D-brane/Orientifold central charge should be attributed to the quantum volumes.
