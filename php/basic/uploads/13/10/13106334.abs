Title: The Black Hole Interior in AdS/CFT and the Information Paradox
Authors: Kyriakos Papadodimas and Suvrat Raju
Abstract: We show that, within the AdS/CFT correspondence, recent formulations of the information paradox can be reduced to a question about the existence of certain kinds of operators in the CFT. We describe a remarkably simple construction of these operators on a given state of the CFT. Our construction leads to a smooth horizon, addresses the strong subadditivity paradox, while preserving locality within effective field theory, and reconciles the existence of the interior with the growth of states with energy in the CFT. We also extend our construction to non-equilibrium states.
