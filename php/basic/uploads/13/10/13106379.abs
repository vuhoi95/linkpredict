Title: The violation of the No-Hair Conjecture in four-dimensional ungauged  Supergravity
Authors: Pablo Bueno and C. S. Shahbazi
Abstract: By choosing a particular, String Theory inspired, Special K\"ahler manifold, we are able to find a N=2 four-dimensional ungauged Supergravity model that contains supersymmetric black hole solutions that violate the folk uniqueness theorems that are expected to hold in ungauged Supergravity. The black hole solutions are regular in the sense that they have a positive mass and a unique physical singularity hidden by an event horizon. In contradistinction to most examples already known in the literature, we find our solutions in a theory without scalar potential, gaugings or higher order curvature terms.
