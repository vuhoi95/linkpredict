Title: (0,2) Dynamics From Four Dimensions
Authors: David Kutasov and Jennifer Lin
Abstract: We study (0,2) supersymmetric two-dimensional theories obtained by compactifying four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric theories on a two-torus, with a magnetic field for a global U(1) symmetry, and present evidence that Seiberg duality in four dimensions leads to an identification of different models of this type.
