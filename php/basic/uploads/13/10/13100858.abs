Title: Holographic RG flows and nearly-marginal operators
Authors: Jun Bourdier and Elias Kiritsis
Abstract: The holographic renormalization group flows associated with marginally relevant operators are analyzed. The associated perturbative and non-perturbative beta-functions are calculated and the consistent scalar potentials are identified. The presence of a Zamolodchikov metric in the multiscalar case is shown to affect beta-functions starting at two loops.
