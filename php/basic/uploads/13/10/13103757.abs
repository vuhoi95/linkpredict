Title: The superconformal bootstrap for structure constants
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Agnese Bissi
Abstract: We report on non-perturbative bounds for structure constants on N=4 SYM. Such bounds are obtained by applying the conformal bootstrap recently extended to superconformal theories. We compare our results with interpolating functions suitably restricted by the S-duality of the theory. Within numerical errors, these interpolations support the conjecture that the bounds found in this paper are saturated at duality invariant values of the coupling. This extends recent conjectures for the anomalous dimension of leading twist operators.
