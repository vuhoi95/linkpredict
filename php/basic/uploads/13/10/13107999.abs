Title: Event horizons and holography
Authors: Steven G. Avery and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We consider the microcanonical ensemble of black holes in gravitational theories in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with a conformal field theory dual. We argue that typical quantum black hole states show no violations of general covariance on the horizon.
