Title: Thermodynamics of Magnetised Kerr-Newman Black Holes
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and Yi Pang and C. N. Pope
Abstract: The thermodynamics of a magnetised Kerr-Newman black hole is studied to all orders in the appended magnetic field $B$. The asymptotic properties of the metric and other fields are dominated by the magnetic flux that extends to infinity along the axis, leading to subtleties in the calculation of conserved quantities such as the angular momentum and the mass. We present a detailed discussion of the implementation of a Wald-type procedure to calculate the angular momentum, showing how ambiguities that are absent in the usual asymptotically-flat case may be resolved by the requirement of gauge invariance. We also present a formalism from which we are able to obtain an expression for the mass of the magnetised black holes. The expressions for the mass and the angular momentum are shown to be compatible with the first law of thermodynamics and a Smarr type relation. Allowing the appended magnetic field $B$ to vary results in an extra term in the first law of the form $-\mu dB$ where $\mu$ is interpreted as an induced magnetic moment. Minimising the total energy with respect to the total charge $Q$ at fixed values of the angular momentum and energy of the seed metric allows an investigation of Wald's process. The Meissner effect is shown to hold for electrically neutral extreme black holes. We also present a derivation of the angular momentum for black holes in the four-dimensional STU model, which is ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets.
