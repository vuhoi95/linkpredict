Title: Split Supersymmetry Under GUT and Current Dark Matter Constraints
Authors: Fei Wang and Wenyu Wang and Jin Min Yang
Abstract: We recalculate the two-loop beta functions for three gauge couplings taking into account all low energy threshold corrections in split supersymmetry (split-SUSY) which assumes a very high scalar mass scale M_S. We find that, in split-SUSY with gaugino mass unification assumption and a large M_S, the gauge coupling unification requires a lower bound on gaugino mass. Combined with the constraints from the dark matter relic density and direct detection limits, we find that split-SUSY is very restricted and for dark matter mass below 1 TeV the allowed parameter space can be fully covered by XENON-1T(2017).
