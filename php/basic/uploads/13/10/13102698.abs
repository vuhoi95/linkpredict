Title: Einstein-Yang-Mills theory : I. Asymptotic symmetries
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Pierre-Henry Lambert
Abstract: Asymptotic symmetries of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system with or without cosmological constant are explicitly worked out in a unified manner. In agreement with a recent conjecture, one finds a Virasoro-Kac-Moody type algebra not only in three dimensions but also in the four dimensional asymptotically flat case.
