Title: The spectrum of low spin mesons at finite temperature in holographic  noncommutative QCD
Authors: Tadahito Nakajima and Yukiko Ohtake and Kenji Suzuki
Abstract: We have constructed a noncommutative deformation of the holographic QCD (Sakai-Sugimoto) model and evaluated the mass spectrum of low spin vector mesons at finite temperature. The masses of light vector- and pseudovector-meson in the noncommutative holographic QCD model reduces over the whole area in the intermediate-temperature regime compared to the commutative case. However, the space noncommutativity does not change the properties of temperature dependence for the mass spectrum of low spin mesons. The masses of meson also decrease with increasing temperature in noncommutative case.
