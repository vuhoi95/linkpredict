Title: Extending the nonsingular hyperscaling violating spacetimes
Authors: Yang Lei and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating geometries, which provide a holographic description of non-relativistic field theories, generically have a singularity in the infrared region of the geometry, where tidal forces for freely falling observers diverge, but there is a special class of hyperscaling violating geometries where this tidal force divergence does not occur. We explicitly construct a smooth extension of the spacetime in this case, and explore the structure of the spacetime. We find that the spacetime has two disconnected boundaries, as in AdS$_2$. We also consider the behaviour of finite-energy excitations of the spacetime at the horizon, arguing that they will have some divergence there.
