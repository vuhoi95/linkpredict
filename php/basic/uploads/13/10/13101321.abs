Title: Rotating D0-branes and consistent truncations of supergravity
Authors: Andres Anabalon and Thomas Ortiz and Henning Samtleben
Abstract: The fluctuations around the D0-brane near-horizon geometry are described by two-dimensional SO(9) gauged maximal supergravity. We work out the U(1)^4 truncation of this theory whose scalar sector consists of five dilaton and four axion fields. We construct the full non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz for the embedding of the dilaton sector into type IIA supergravity. This yields a consistent truncation around a geometry which is the warped product of a two-dimensional domain wall and the sphere S^8. As an application, we consider the solutions corresponding to rotating D0-branes which in the near-horizon limit approach AdS2xM8 geometries, and discuss their thermodynamical properties. More generally, we study the appearance of such solutions in the presence of non-vanishing axion fields.
