Title: Rotating BTZ Black Holes and One Dimensional Holographic Superconductors
Authors: Pankaj Chaturvedi and Gautam Sengupta
Abstract: We consider charged rotating BTZ black holes in 2+1 dimensions and obtain 1+1 dimensional holographic superconductors on a spatial circle in the context of the $AdS_3/CFT_2$ correspondence. The charged condensate for the boundary superconductor is computed both in the analytic and the numerical framework in a probe limit and a low angular momentum approximation. A critical value of the angular momentum for the onset of superconductivity is established. We also numerically compute the electrical conductivity of the 1+1 dimensional boundary theory on a circle. The conductivity exhibits a dependence on angular momentum of the rotating black hole both for the normal and the superconducting phase of the boundary field theory. The significance of the boundary field theory in the context of a Fermi-Luttinger liquid on a circle is discussed.
