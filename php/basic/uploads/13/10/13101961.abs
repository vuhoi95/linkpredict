Title: Dynamical complexity of the Brans-Dicke cosmology
Authors: Orest Hrycyna and Marek Szydlowski
Abstract: The dynamics of the Brans-Dicke theory with a quadratic scalar field potential function and barotropic matter is investigated. The dynamical system methods are used to reveal complexity of dynamical evolution in homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models. The structure of phase space crucially depends on the parameter of the theory $\omega_{\textrm{BD}}$ as well as barotropic matter index $w_{m}$. In our analysis these parameters are treated as bifurcation parameters. We found sets of values of these parameters which lead to generic evolutional scenarios. We show that in isotropic and homogeneous models in the Brans-Dicke theory with a quadratic potential function the de Sitter state appears naturally. Stability conditions of this state are fully investigated. It is shown that these models can explain accelerated expansion of the Universe without the assumption of the substantial form of dark matter and dark energy. The Poincare construction of compactified phase space with a circle at infinity is used to show that phase space trajectories in a physical region can be equipped with a structure of a vector field on nontrivial topological closed space. For $\omega_{\textrm{BD}}<-3/2$ we show new types of early and late time evolution leading from the anti-de Sitter to the de Sitter state through an asymmetric bounce. In the theory without a ghost we find bouncing solutions and the coexistence of the bounces and the singularity. Following the Peixoto theorem some conclusions about structural stability are drawn.
