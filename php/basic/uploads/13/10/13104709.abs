Title: Super Yang-Mills Plasma
Authors: Alina Czajka and Stanislaw Mrowczynski
Abstract: The N = 4 super Yang-Mills plasma is studied in the regime of weak coupling. Collective excitations and collisional processes are discussed and compared to those of QCD plasma. The two systems are concluded to be very similar to each other with the differences mostly reflecting different numbers of degrees of freedom.
