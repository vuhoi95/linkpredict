Title: Decomposition of one-loop QCD amplitudes into primitive amplitudes based  on shuffle relations
Authors: Christian Reuschle and Stefan Weinzierl
Abstract: We present the decomposition of QCD partial amplitudes into primitive amplitudes at one-loop level and tree level for arbitrary numbers of quarks and gluons. Our method is based on shuffle relations. This method is purely combinatorial and does not require the inversion of a system of linear equations.
