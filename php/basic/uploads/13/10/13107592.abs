Title: Decelerating cosmologies are de-scramblers
Authors: Daniel Carney and Willy Fischler
Abstract: Stationary observers in static spacetimes see falling objects spread exponentially fast, or fast-scramble, near event horizons. We generalize this picture to arbitrary cosmological horizons. We give examples of exponential fast-scrambling and power-law scrambling and "de-scrambling" as charges propagate freely near a horizon. In particular we show that when the universe is decelerating, information hidden behind the apparent horizon is de-scrambled as it re-enters the view of the observer. In contrast to the de Sitter case, the power-law scaling suggests that the microscopic dynamics of the horizon are local.
