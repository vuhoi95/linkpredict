Title: Scheme dependence and universality in the functional renormalization  group
Authors: Alessandro Codello and Maximilian Demmel and Omar Zanusso
Abstract: We prove that the functional renormalization group flow equation admits a perturbative solution and show explicitly the scheme transformation that relates it to the standard schemes of perturbation theory. We then define a universal scheme within the functional renormalization group.
