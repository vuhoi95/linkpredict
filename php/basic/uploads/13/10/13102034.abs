Title: Quantum field theories with boundaries and novel instabilities
Authors: T. R. Govindarajan and V. P. Nair
Abstract: Quantum physics on manifolds with boundary brings novel aspects due to boundary conditions. One important feature is the appearance of localised negative eigenmodes for the Laplacian on the boundary. These can potentially lead to instabilities. We consider quantum field theories on such manifolds and interpret these as leading to the onset of phase transitions.
