Title: Quantum billiards in multidimensional models with branes
Authors: V. D. Ivashchuk and V. N. Melnikov
Abstract: Gravitational D-dimensional model with l scalar fields and several forms is considered. When cosmological type diagonal metric is chosen, an electromagnetic composite brane ansatz is adopted and certain restrictions on the branes are imposed the conformally covariant Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation for the model is studied. Under certain restrictions asymptotic solutions to WDW equation are found in the limit of the formation of the billiard walls which reduce the problem to the so-called quantum billiard on the (D+ l -2)-dimensional Lobachevsky space. Two examples of quantum billiards are considered. The first one deals with 9-dimensional quantum billiard for D = 11 model with 330 four-forms which mimic space-like M2- and M5-branes of D=11 supergravity. The second one deals with the 9-dimensional quantum billiard for D =10 gravitational model with one scalar field, 210 four-forms and 120 three-forms which mimic space-like D2-, D4-, FS1- and NS5-branes in D = 10 II A supergravity. It is shown that in both examples wave functions vanish in the limit of the formation of the billiard walls (i.e. we get a quantum resolution of the singularity for 11D model) but magnetic branes could not be neglected in calculations of quantum asymptotic solutions while they are irrelevant for classical oscillating behaviour when all 120 electric branes are present.
