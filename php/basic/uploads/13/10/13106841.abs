Title: Double collinear splitting amplitudes at next-to-leading order
Authors: German F. R. Sborlini and Daniel de Florian and German Rodrigo
Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the $1 \to 2$ splitting amplitudes in different dimensional regularization (DREG) schemes. Besides recovering previously known results, we explore new DREG schemes and analyze their consistency by comparing the divergent structure with the expected behavior predicted by Catani's formula. Through the introduction of scalar-gluons, we show the relation among splittings matrices computed using different schemes. Also, we extended this analysis to cover the double collinear limit of scattering amplitudes in the context of QCD+QED.
