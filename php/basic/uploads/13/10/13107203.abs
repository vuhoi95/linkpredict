Title: Symmetry Energy from Holographic QCD
Authors: Yunseok Seo and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We review the symmetry energy in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. After constructing $D$ brane configurations corresponding to dense system in boundary theory, we calculate the symmetry energy by solving DBI action of $D$ branes in confining and deconfining phase. We conclude the density dependence of the symmetry energy has scaling law whose power depends only on dimensionality of the branes and space-time.
