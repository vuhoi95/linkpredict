Title: Jalilian-Marian, Iancu, McLerran, Weigert, Leonidov, Kovner evolution at  next to leading order
Authors: Alex Kovner and Michael Lublinsky and Yair Mulian
Abstract: The Jalilian-Marian,Iancu, McLerran, Weigert, Leonidov, Kovner (JIMWLK) Hamiltonian for high energy evolution of QCD amplitudes is presented at the next-to-leading order accuracy in $\alpha_s$. The form of the Hamiltonian is deduced from the symmetries and the structure of the hadronic light cone wavefunction and by comparing the rapidity evolution of the quark dipole and the three-quark singlet states with results available in the literature. The next-to-leading corrections should allow for more robust phenomenological applications of perturbative saturation approach.
