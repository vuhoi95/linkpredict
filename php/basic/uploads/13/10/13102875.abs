Title: Vacuum instability by a chromoelectric field in 2 + 1-dimensions
Authors: M. Loewe and F. Marquez and R. Zamora
Abstract: The problem of vacuum instability and creation of pairs by external fields SU(2) is studied. The effective mass operator has complex eigenvalues implying decay and pair creation. We consider a constant external chromoelectric field and a region in the parameter space where the vaccum becomes unstable and decays in pairs. Although the calculation is done in SU(2) color group it is also valid for SU(3).
