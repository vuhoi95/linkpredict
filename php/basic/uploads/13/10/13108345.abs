Title: Entanglement entropy on the fuzzy sphere
Authors: Joanna L. Karczmarek and Philippe Sabella-Garnier
Abstract: We obtain entanglement entropy on the noncommutative (fuzzy) two-sphere. To define a subregion with a well defined boundary in this geometry, we use the symbol map between elements of the noncommutative algebra and functions on the sphere. We find that entanglement entropy is not proportional to the length of the region's boundary. Rather, in agreement with holographic predictions, it is extensive for regions whose area is a small (but fixed) fraction of the total area of the sphere. This is true even in the limit of small noncommutativity. We also find that entanglement entropy grows linearly with N, where N is the size of the irreducible representation of SU(2) used to define the fuzzy sphere.
