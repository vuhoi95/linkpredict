Title: Defects, Non-abelian T-duality, and the Fourier-Mukai transform of the  Ramond-Ramond fields
Authors: Eva Gevorgyan and Gor Sarkissian
Abstract: We construct topological defects generating non-abelian T-duality for isometry groups acting without isotropy. We find that these defects are given by line bundles on the correspondence space with curvature which can be considered as a non-abelian generalization of the curvature of the Poincar\`{e} bundle. We show that the defect equations of motion encode the non-abelian T-duality transformation. The Fourier-Mukai transform of the Ramond-Ramond fields generated by the gauge invariant flux of these defects is studied. We show that it provides elegant and compact way of computation of the transformation of the Ramond-Ramond fields under the non-abelian T-duality.
