Title: Entanglement Entropy for Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Amin Faraji Astaneh and M. Reza Mohammadi Mozaffar
Abstract: We study holographic entanglement entropy for certain logarithmic conformal field theories by making use of their gravity descriptions. The corresponding gravity descriptions are provided by higher derivative gravity at critical points where the equations of motion degenerate leading to a log gravity. When the central charge of the dual theory is zero, the entanglement entropy has a new divergent term whose coefficient is given by the new anomaly of the logarithmic conformal field theory.
