Title: Mixed braid group actions from deformations of surface singularities
Authors: Will Donovan and Ed Segal
Abstract: We consider a set of toric Calabi-Yau varieties which arise as deformations of the small resolutions of type A surface singularities. By careful analysis of the heuristics of B-brane transport in the associated GLSMs, we predict the existence of a mixed braid group action on the derived category of each variety, and then prove that this action does indeed exist. This generalizes the braid group action found by Seidel and Thomas for the undeformed resolutions. We also show that the actions for different deformations are related, in a way that is predicted by the physical heuristics.
