Title: Vacuum Bubbles in the Presence of a Relativistic Fluid
Authors: John T. Giblin Jr and James B. Mertens
Abstract: First order phase transitions are characterized by the nucleation and evolution of bubbles. The dynamics of cosmological vacuum bubbles, where the order parameter is independent of other degrees of freedom, are well known; more realistic phase transitions in which the order parameter interacts with the other constituents of the Universe is in its infancy. Here we present high-resolution lattice simulations that explore the dynamics of bubble evolution in which the order parameter is coupled to a relativistic fluid. We use a generic, toy potential, that can mimic physics from the GUT scale to the electroweak scale.
