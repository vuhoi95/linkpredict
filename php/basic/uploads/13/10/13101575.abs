Title: Reduction of One Loop Feynman Diagrams in Scalar Field Theory
Authors: A. G. Izergin and V. E. Korepin
Abstract: This is a historical note. In 1979 we wrote a paper in a Russian Journal called Vestnik Leingradskogo Gosudarstvennogo Universiteta. We considered massive scalar quantum filed theory. One loop Feynman diagrams were evaluated. Theorem was proved that one loop diagram with many internal lines [more then dimension of space-time] can be expressed in terms of one loop diagram with number of internal lines equal to the dimension of space-time [multiplied by tree diagrams]. This is translation in English.
