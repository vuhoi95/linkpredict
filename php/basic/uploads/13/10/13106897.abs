Abstract: Correlators of gauge invariant operators provide useful information on the dynamics, phases and spectra of a quantum field theory. In this paper, we consider N=1 supersymmetric theories and focus our attention on the supercurrent multiplet. We give a complete characterization of two-point functions of operators belonging to such multiplet, like the energy-momentum tensor and the supercurrent, and study the relations between them. We discuss instances of weakly coupled and strongly coupled theories, in which different symmetries, like conformal invariance and supersymmetry, may be conserved and/or spontaneously or explicitly broken. For theories at strong coupling, we exploit AdS/CFT techniques. We provide a holographic description of different properties of a strongly coupled theory, including a realization of the Goldstino mode in a simple illustrative model.
