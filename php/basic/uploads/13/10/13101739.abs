Title: Quasilocal Conserved Charges with a Gravitational Chern-Simons Term
Authors: Wontae Kim and Shailesh Kulkarni and Sang-Heon Yi
Abstract: We extend our recent work on the quasilocal formulation of conserved charges to a theory of gravity containing a gravitational Chern-Simons term. As an application of our formulation, we compute the off-shell potential and quasilocal conserved charges of some black holes in three-dimensional topologically massive gravity. Our formulation for conserved charges reproduces very effectively the well-known expressions on conserved charges and the entropy expression of black holes in the topologically massive gravity.
