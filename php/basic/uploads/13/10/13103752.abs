Title: Two-point correlator of twist-2 light-ray operators in N=4 SYM in BFKL  approximation
Authors: Ian Balitsky and Vladimir Kazakov and Evgeny Sobko
Abstract: We generalize local operators of the leading twist-2 of N=4 SYM theory to the case of complex Lorentz spin j using principal series representation of sl(2,R). We give the direct computation of correlation function of two such non-local operators in the BFKL regime when j -> 1. The correlator appears to have the expected conformal coordinate dependence governed by the anomalous dimension of twist-2 operator in NLO BFKL approximation predicted by Kotikov and Lipatov.
