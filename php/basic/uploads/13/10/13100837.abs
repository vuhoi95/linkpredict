Title: Lifshitz black holes in higher spin gravity
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Eliot Hijano and Joshua Samani
Abstract: We study asymptotically Lifshitz solutions to three dimensional higher spin gravity in the SL(3,R)xSL(3,R) Chern-Simons formulation. We begin by specifying the most general connections satisfying Lifshitz boundary conditions, and we verify that their algebra of symmetries contains a Lifshitz sub-algebra. We then exhibit connections that can be viewed as higher spin Lifshitz black holes. We show that when suitable holonomy conditions are imposed, these black holes obey sensible thermodynamics and possess a gauge in which the corresponding metric exhibits a regular horizon.
