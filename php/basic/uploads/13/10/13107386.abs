Title: On 4D, N = 1 Massless Gauge Superfields of Higher Superspin:  Half-Odd-Integer Case
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Konstantinos Koutrolikos
Abstract: We present an alternative method to explore the off-shell component structure of theories that describe half-integer super-helicities Y=s+1/2 (where sis any positive integer). We use it to derive the component action, component SUSY transformation laws, and count the component-level degrees of freedom involved. This counting will give us clues about N=2 representations. The foundation of the process relies on the superfield equations of motion, generated by variation of a superspace action expressed in terms of prepotentials. Using this approach we reproduce the half-integer super-helicity superspace action using unconstrained superfields.
