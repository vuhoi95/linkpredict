Title: A Novel (2+1)-Dimensional Model of Chiral Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Veselin G. Filev and Matthias Ihl and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We propose a new model of flavour chiral symmetry breaking in a (2+1)-dimensional defect gauge theory of strongly coupled fermions by introducing probe D5/anti-D5-flavour branes on the conifold. After working out the flavour brane embeddings at zero temperature, we thoroughly investigate the spectra of small fluctuations on the world volume of the flavour branes (meson spectrum) and conclude that they are free of tachyons. Thus the proposed probe brane embedding is stable. Moreover, we introduce finite temperature and an external magnetic field and study the thermodynamics of the resulting configurations. Namely, we compute the free energies, entropies, heat capacities and magnetisations. The results are used to establish a detailed phase diagram of the model. We find that the effect of magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking is realised in our model and show that the meson-melting phase transition coincides with the chiral symmetry breaking phase transition. Furthermore, we show that the model is in a diamagnetic phase.
