Title: Asymmetric Gepner models in type II
Authors: Dan Israel and Vincent Thiery
Abstract: We describe new four-dimensional type II compactifications with N=2 supersymmetry, based on asymmetric Gepner models for K3 x T^2. In more than half of these models, all the K3 moduli are lifted, giving at low energies N=2 supergravity with the STU vector multiplets and no hypermultiplets.
