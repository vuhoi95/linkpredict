Title: Three-point correlation functions in Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Marcela Pelaez and Matthieu Tissier and Nicolas Wschebor
Abstract: We investigate the three-point correlation functions of Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge, with a particular emphasis on the infrared regime. The effect of the Gribov copies is accounted for by adding a mass term for the gluons in the Faddeev-Popov action in the Landau gauge. We perform a one-loop calculation for the ghost-antighost-gluon and three-gluon correlation functions. These analytic results are compared with the available lattice data and give a very satisfying agreement.
