Title: Influence of a Minimal Length on the Creation of Scalar Particles
Authors: S. Haouat and K. Nouicer
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the problem of scalar particles pair creation by an electric field in the presence of a minimal length. Two sets of exact solutions for the Klein Gordon equation are given in momentum space. Then the canonical method based on Bogoliubov transformation connecting the "in" with the "out" states is applied to calculate the probability to create a pair of particles and the mean number of created particles. The number of created particles per unit of time per unit of length, which is related directly to the experimental measurements, is calculated. It is shown that, with an electric field less than the critical value, the minimal length minimizes the particle creation. It is shown, also, that the limit of zero minimal length reproduces the known results corresponding to the ordinary quantum fields.
