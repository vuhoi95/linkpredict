Title: Fermion Masses Through Condensation in Spacetimes with Torsion
Authors: Oscar Castillo-Felisola and Cristobal Corral and Cristian Villavicencio and Alfonso R. Zerwekh
Abstract: In this paper we argue the possibility that fermion masses, in particular quarks, originate through the condensation of a fourth family that interacts with all of the quarks via a contact four-fermion term coming from the existence of torsion on the spacetime. Extra dimensions are considered to avoid the hierarchy problem.
