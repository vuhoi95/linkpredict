Title: New Class of N-dimensional Braneworlds
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Pavle Midodashvili and Giorgi Tukhashvili
Abstract: The new class of the non-stationary solutions to the system of N-dimensional equations for coupled gravitational and massless scalar field is found. The model represents a single (N-1)-brane in a space-time with one large (infinite) and (N-5) small (compact) space-like extra dimensions. In some particular cases the model corresponds to the gravitational and scalar field standing waves bounded by the brane. These braneworlds can be relevant in string and other higher dimensional models.
