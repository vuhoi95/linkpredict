Title: Lightlike Membranes in Black Hole and Wormhole Physics, and Cosmology
Authors: Eduardo Guendelman and Alexander Kaganovich and Emil Nissimov and Svetlana Pacheva
Abstract: We shortly outline the principal results concerning the reparametrization-invariant world-volume Lagrangian formulation of lightlike brane dynamics and its impact as a source for gravity and (nonlinear) electromagnetism in black hole and wormhole physics.
