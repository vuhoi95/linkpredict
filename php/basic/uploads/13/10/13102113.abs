Title: Parity odd equilibrium partition function in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Juan L. Ma√±es and Manuel Valle
Abstract: We use Schwinger's proper time method to compute the parity odd contributions to the U(1) current and energy-momentum tensor of an ideal gas of fermions in 2+1 dimensions in the presence of static gauge and gravitational backgrounds. From these results the equilibrium partition function at first order in the derivative expansion is explicitly obtained by integration. The form of the computed partition function is consistent with general arguments based on Kaluza-Klein and gauge invariance.
