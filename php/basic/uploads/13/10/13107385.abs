Title: On 4D, N = 1 Massless Gauge Superfields of Higher Superspin: Integer  Case
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Konstantinos Koutrolikos
Abstract: We present an alternative method of exploring the component structure of an integer super-helicity Y=s (for any integers) irreducible representation of the Super-Poincare group. We use it to derive the component action and the SUSY transformation laws. The effectiveness of this approach is based on the equations of motion and their properties, like Bianchi identities. These equations are generated by the superspace action when it is expressed in terms of prepotentials. For that reason we reproduce the superspace action for integer superspin, using unconstrained superfields. The appropriate, to use, superfields are dictated by the representation theory of the group and the requirement that there is a smooth limit between the massive and massless case.
