Title: Superconformal indices and partition functions for supersymmetric field  theories
Authors: Ilmar Gahramanov and Grigory Vartanov
Abstract: Recently there was a substantial progress in understanding of supersymmetric theories (in particular, their BPS spectrum) in space-times of different dimensions due to the exact computation of superconformal indices and partition functions using localization method. Here we discuss a connection of 4d superconformal indices and 3d partition functions using a particular example of supersymmetric theories with matter in antisymmetric representation.
