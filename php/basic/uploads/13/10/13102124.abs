Title: Elliptic genera and real Jacobi forms
Authors: Sujay K. Ashok and Jan Troost
Abstract: We construct real Jacobi forms with matrix index using path integrals. The path integral expressions represent elliptic genera of two-dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric theories. They arise in a family labeled by two integers N and k which determine the central charge of the infrared fixed point through the formula c=3N(1+ 2N/k). We decompose the real Jacobi form into a mock modular form and a term arising from the continuous spectrum of the conformal field theory. We argue that the Jacobi form represents the elliptic genus of a theory defined on a 2N dimensional background with U(N) isometry, containing a complex projective space section, a circle fiber and a linear dilaton direction. We also present formulas for the elliptic genera of orbifolds of these models.
