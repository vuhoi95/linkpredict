Title: Radiative symmetry breaking at the Fermi scale and flat potential at the  Planck scale
Authors: Michio Hashimoto and Satoshi Iso and Yuta Orikasa
Abstract: We investigate a possibility of the "flatland scenario", in which the electroweak gauge symmetry is radiatively broken via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism starting from a completely flat Higgs potential at the Planck scale. We show that the flatland scenario is realizable only when an inequality K<1 among the coefficients of the beta-functions is satisfied. We show several models satisfying the condition.
