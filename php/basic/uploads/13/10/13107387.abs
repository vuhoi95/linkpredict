Title: A Dynamical Theory for Massive Supergravity
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Konstantinos Koutrolikos
Abstract: We present a new massive theory of superspin Y=3/2 which has non-minimal supergravity as it's massless limit. The new result will illuminate the underlying structure of auxiliary fields required for the description of arbitrary massive half-integer superspin systems.
