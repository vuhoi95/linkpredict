Abstract: In this work we derive a matrix formulation of a noise-disturbance uncertainty relation, which is akin to the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle. Our inequality is stronger than Ozawa's uncertainty principle and takes noise-disturbance correlations into account. Moreover, we show that, for certain types of measurement interactions, it is covariant with respect to linear symplectic transformations of the noise and disturbance operators.
