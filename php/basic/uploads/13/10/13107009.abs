Title: The Effect of the Low Energy Constants on the Spectral Properties of the  Wilson Dirac Operator
Authors: Mario Kieburg and Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot and Savvas Zafeiropoulos
Abstract: We summarize recent analytical results obtained for lattice artifacts of the non-Hermitian Wilson Dirac operator. Hereby we discuss the effect of all three low energy constants. In particular we study the limit of small lattice spacing and also consider the regime of large lattice spacing which is closely related to the mean field limit. Thereby we extract simple relations between measurable quantities like the average number of additional real modes and the low energy constants. These relations may improve the fitting for the low energy constants.
