Title: On The Real Part of a Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Doron Gepner and Herve Partouche
Abstract: Every conformal field theory has the symmetry of taking each field to its adjoint. We consider here the quotient (orbifold) conformal field theory obtained by twisting with respect to this symmetry. A general method for computing such quotients is developed using the coulomb gas representation. Examples of parafermions, $SU(2)$ current algebra and the $N=2$ minimal models are described explicitly. The partition functions and the dimensions of the disordered fields are given. This result is a tool for finding new theories.
