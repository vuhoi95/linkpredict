Title: Antisymmetric tensor Z_p gauge symmetries in field theory and string  theory
Authors: Mikel Berasaluce-González and Guillermo Ramírez and Angel M. Uranga
Abstract: We consider discrete gauge symmetries in D dimensions arising as remnants of broken continuous gauge symmetries carried by general antisymmetric tensor fields, rather than by standard 1-forms. The lagrangian for such a general ${\bf Z}_p$ gauge theory can be described in terms of a $r$-form gauge field made massive by a $(r-1)$-form, or other dual realizations, that we also discuss. The theory contains charged topological defects of different dimensionalities, generalizing the familiar charged particles and strings in D=4. We describe realizations in string theory compactifications with torsion cycles, or with background field strength fluxes. We also provide examples of non-abelian discrete groups, for which the group elements are associated with charged objects of different dimensionality.
