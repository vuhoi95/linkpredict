Title: Seed for general rotating non-extremal black holes of N=8 supergravity
Authors: David D. K. Chow and Geoffrey Comp√®re
Abstract: We describe the most general asymptotically flat, stationary, non-extremal, dyonic black hole of the four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity coupled to 3 vector multiplets that describes the low-energy regime of the STU model. Under U-dualities, this can be used as a seed to generate all single-centered stationary black holes of N = 8 supergravity. The independent conserved charges are the mass, angular momentum, four electric charges and four magnetic charges; an independent NUT charge can also be added. Several aspects of the black hole are presented, including thermodynamics, the BPS limit, the near-horizon limit in the extremal fast and slow rotating cases, properties of black hole horizons, the existence of Killing tensors and the separability of probe scalars.
