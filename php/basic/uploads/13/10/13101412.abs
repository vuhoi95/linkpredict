Title: "Exotic" black holes with torsion
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković and M. Vasilić
Abstract: In the context of three-dimensional gravity with torsion, the concepts of standard and "exotic" Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes are generalized by going over to black holes with torsion. This approach provides a unified insight into thermodynamics of black holes, with or without torsion.
