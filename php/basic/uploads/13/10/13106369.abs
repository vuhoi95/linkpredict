Title: Vector-like Fields, Messenger Mixing and the Higgs mass in Gauge  Mediation
Authors: Willy Fischler and Walter Tangarife
Abstract: In order to generate, in the context of gauge mediation, a Higgs mass around 126 GeV that avoids the little hierarchy problem, we explore a set of models where the messengers are directly coupled to new vector-like fields at the TeV scale in addition to the usual low energy degrees of freedom. We find that in this context, stop masses lighter than 2 TeV and large $A$-terms are generated, thereby improving issues of fine tuning.
