Title: Spectrum of Quantum Transfer Matrices via Classical Many-Body Systems
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Zabrodin and A. Zotov
Abstract: In this paper we clarify the relationship between inhomogeneous quantum spin chains and classical integrable many-body systems. It provides an alternative (to the nested Bethe ansatz) method for computation of spectra of the spin chains. Namely, the spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix for the inhomogeneous ${\mathfrak g}{\mathfrak l}_n$-invariant XXX spin chain on $N$ sites with twisted boundary conditions can be found in terms of velocities of particles in the rational $N$-body Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The possible values of the velocities are to be found from intersection points of two Lagrangian submanifolds in the phase space of the classical model. One of them is the Lagrangian hyperplane corresponding to fixed coordinates of all $N$ particles and the other one is an $N$-dimensional Lagrangian submanifold obtained by fixing levels of $N$ classical Hamiltonians in involution. The latter are determined by eigenvalues of the twist matrix. To support this picture, we give a direct proof that the eigenvalues of the Lax matrix for the classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider model, where velocities of particles are substituted by eigenvalues of the spin chain Hamiltonians, calculated through the Bethe equations, coincide with eigenvalues of the twist matrix, with certain multiplicities. We also prove a similar statement for the ${\mathfrak g}{\mathfrak l}_n$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points (on the quantum side) and the Calogero-Moser system with $N$ particles (on the classical side). The realization of the results obtained in terms of branes and supersymmetric gauge theories is also discussed.
