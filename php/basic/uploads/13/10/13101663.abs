Title: Modeling scalar fields consistent with positive mass
Authors: Masato Nozawa and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: This paper explores the conditions under which modified gravitational theories admit the positive mass. Following Witten's spinor argument, it is argued that a single condition should be imposed upon a gauge connection in the super-covariant derivative. Under this condition, we present a simple formula for the divergence of the Nester tensor in Einstein's gravity with general source. Applying this prescription to the Einstein-scalar system, we find that for a certain class of the gauge connection, a special kind of non-canonical scalar-field theory admits the positivity property in addition to the ordinary canonical scalar-field system. In both cases the scalar potential can be written in terms of a superpotential. In the non-canonical case we obtain the most general "BPS" solutions which preserve at least half of the supersymmetry.
