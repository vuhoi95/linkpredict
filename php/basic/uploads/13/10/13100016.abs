Title: Membranes from monopole operators in ABJM theory: large angular momentum  and M-theoretic AdS_4/CFT_3
Authors: Stefano Kovacs and Yuki Sato and Hidehiko Shimada
Abstract: We consider states with large angular momentum to facilitate the study of the M-theory regime of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence. We study the duality between M-theory in AdS_4xS^7/Z_k and the ABJM N=6 Chern-Simons-matter theory with gauge group U(N)xU(N) and level k, taking N large and k of order 1. In this regime the lack of an explicit formulation of M-theory in AdS_4xS^7/Z_k makes the gravity side difficult, while the CFT is strongly coupled and the planar approximation is not applicable. To overcome these difficulties, we focus on states on the gravity side with large angular momentum J>>1 and identify the dual operators in the CFT, thereby establishing the AdS/CFT dictionary in this sector. Natural approximation schemes arise on both sides thanks to the presence of the small parameter 1/J. On the AdS side, we use the matrix model of M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background with matrices of size J/k. A perturbative treatment of this matrix model provides a good approximation to M-theory in AdS_4xS^7/Z_k when N^{1/3}<<J<<N^{1/2}. On the CFT side, we study the theory on S^2xR with magnetic flux J/k. A Born-Oppenheimer type expansion arises naturally for large J in spite of the theory being strongly coupled. The energy spectra on the two sides agree at leading order. This provides a non-trivial test of the AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence including near-BPS observables associated with membrane degrees of freedom, thus verifying the duality beyond the previously studied sectors corresponding to either BPS observables or the type IIA string regime.
