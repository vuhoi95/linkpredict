Title: Gregory-Laflamme instability of BTZ black hole in new massive gravity
Authors: Taeyoon Moon and Yun Soo Myung
Abstract: We find the Gregory-Laflamme $s$-mode instability of the non-rotating BTZ black hole in new massive gravity. This instability shows that the BTZ black hole could not exist as a stable static solution to the new massive gravity. For non-rotating BTZ black string in four dimensions, however, it is demonstrated that the BTZ black string can be stable against the metric perturbation.
