Title: A note on permutation twist defects in topological bilayer phases
Authors: JÃ¼rgen Fuchs and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: We present a mathematical derivation of some of the most important physical quantities arising in topological bilayer systems with permutation twist defects as introduced by Barkeshli et al. in cond-mat/1208.4834. A crucial tool is the theory of permutation equivariant modular functors developed by Barmeier et al. in math.CT/0812.0986 and math.QA/1004.1825.
