Title: Massive Kaluza-Klein Gravity
Authors: D. C. N. Cunha and M. D. Maia
Abstract: The non-Abelian Kaluza-Klein unification of gravitation with gauge fields theory is reformulated, with the inclusion of a massive spin-2 field defined by the extrinsic curvature. The internal space is non-compact, characterized by the group of rotations of vectors orthogonal to the space-time. The non-compactness of the internal space warrants the solution of the fermion chirality problem of the original Kaluza-Klein theory and makes it closer to the more recent Brane World paradigm, in special to the so called DGP model. However, the access of gravitation to the extra dimensions is defined by the mentioned massive spin-2 field obeying the Fierz-Pauli equation. The existence of a short range gravitational component makes possible to apply the modified Kaluza-Klein unification to the Tev scale of energies.
