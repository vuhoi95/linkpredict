Abstract: We construct the Feynman propagator for Dirac fermions on anti-de Sitter space-time and present an analytic expression for the bi-spinor of parallel transport. We then renormalise the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor and end by analysing its renormalised expectation value at finite temperatures.
