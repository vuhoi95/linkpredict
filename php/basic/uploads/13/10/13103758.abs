Title: Hamiltonian analysis for abelian and non-abelian massive theories in  three dimensions
Authors: Alberto Escalante and Jos√© L. Osio
Abstract: A pure Dirac's method for abelian and non-abelian massive theories in three dimensions is performed. Our analysis is developed on the extended phase space reporting the relevant structure of the theories, namely, the extended action, the extended Hamiltonian, the full structure of the constraints and the counting of degrees of freedom. In addition, we compare our results with those found in the literature.
