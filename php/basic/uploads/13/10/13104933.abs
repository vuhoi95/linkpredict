Title: Thermodynamics from field equations for black holes with multiple  horizons
Authors: Yongjoon Kwon and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: The first law of black hole thermodynamics can be read off from the field equations at the horizon. Until now, for black holes with multiple horizons the field equations only at the outer horizon were employed with a particular constraint. In this paper, however, we suggest that for a black hole with multiple horizons the field equations at the inner horizon as well as the outer horizon should be needed in order to obtain the first law of black hole thermodynamics in general.
