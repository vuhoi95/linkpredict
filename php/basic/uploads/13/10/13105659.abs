Title: Minimal Liouville Gravity correlation numbers from Douglas string  equation
Authors: Alexander Belavin and Boris Dubrovin and Baur Mukhametzhanov
Abstract: We continue the study of $(q,p)$ Minimal Liouville Gravity with the help of Douglas string equation. We generalize the results of \cite{Moore:1991ir}, \cite{Belavin:2008kv}, where Lee-Yang series $(2,2s+1)$ was studied, to $(3,3s+p_0)$ Minimal Liouville Gravity, where $p_0=1,2$. We demonstrate that there exist such coordinates $\tau_{m,n}$ on the space of the perturbed Minimal Liouville Gravity theories, in which the partition function of the theory is determined by the Douglas string equation. The coordinates $\tau_{m,n}$ are related in a non-linear fashion to the natural coupling constants $\lambda_{m,n}$ of the perturbations of Minimal Lioville Gravity by the physical operators $O_{m,n}$. We find this relation from the requirement that the correlation numbers in Minimal Liouville Gravity must satisfy the conformal and fusion selection rules. After fixing this relation we compute three- and four-point correlation numbers when they are not zero. The results are in agreement with the direct calculations in Minimal Liouville Gravity available in the literature \cite{Goulian:1990qr}, \cite{Zamolodchikov:2005sj}, \cite{Belavin:2006ex}.
