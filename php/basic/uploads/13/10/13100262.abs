Title: General N = 2 Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanical Model: Supervariable  Approach to its Off-Shell Nilpotent Symmetries
Authors: S. Krishna and A. Shukla and R. P. Malik
Abstract: Using the supersymmetric (SUSY) invariant restrictions on the (anti-)chiral supervariables, we derive the off-shell nilpotent symmetries of the general one (0 + 1)-dimensional N = 2 SUSY quantum mechanical (QM) model which is considered on a (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold (parametrized by a bosonic variable t and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta with \theta^2 = \bar\theta^2 = 0, \theta\bar\theta + \bar\theta\theta = 0). We provide the geometrical meanings to the two SUSY transformations of our present theory which are valid for any arbitrary type of superpotential. We express the conserved charges and Lagrangian of the theory in terms of the supervariables (that are obtained after the application of SUSY invariant restrictions) and provide the geometrical interpretation for the nilpotency property and SUSY invariance of the Lagrangian for the general N = 2 SUSY quantum theory. We also comment on the mathematical interpretation of the above symmetry transformations.
