Title: A selection-quotient process for packed word Hopf algebra
Authors: G. H. E. Duchamp and N. Hoang-Nghia and A. Tanasa
Abstract: In this paper, we define a Hopf algebra structure on the vector space spanned by packed words using a selection-quotient coproduct. We show that this algebra is free on its irreducible packed words. Finally, we give some brief explanations on the Maple codes we have used.
