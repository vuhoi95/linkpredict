Title: Quark gap equation in an external magnetic field
Authors: Peter Watson and Hugo Reinhardt
Abstract: The nonperturbative quark gap equation under the rainbow truncation and with two versions of a phenomenological one-gluon exchange interaction is studied in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field, with emphasis on the small field limit. The chiral quark condensate, magnetic moment and susceptibility are calculated and compared to recent lattice data.
