Title: Poincaré gauge theory in 3D: canonical stability of the scalar sector
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: We outline the results of the canonical analysis of the three-dimensional Poincar\'e gauge theory, defined by the general parity-invariant Lagrangian with eight free parameters [11]. In the scalar sector, containing scalar or pseudoscalar (A)dS modes, the stability of the canonical structure under linearization is used to identify dynamically acceptable values of the parameters.
