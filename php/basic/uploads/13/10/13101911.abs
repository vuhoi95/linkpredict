Title: The 5D Standing Wave Braneworld With Real Scalar Field
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Pavle Midodashvili
Abstract: We introduce the new 5D braneworld with the real scalar field in the bulk. The model represents the brane which bounds collective oscillations of gravitational and scalar field standing waves. These waves are out of phase, i.e. the energy of oscillations passes back and forth between the scalar and gravitational waves. When the amplitude of the standing waves is small the brane width and the size of the horizon in extra space are of a same order of magnitude, and matter fields are localized in extra dimension due to the presence of the horizon. When oscillations are large trapping of matter fields on the brane is provided mainly by the pressure of bulk waves. It is shown that in this case the mass of the lightest KK mode is determined by the smaller energy scale corresponding to the horizon size, i.e. these modes can be created in accelerators at relatively low energies, which gives a chance to check the present model.
