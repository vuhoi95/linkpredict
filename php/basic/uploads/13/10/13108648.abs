Title: QCD on the Light-Front -- A Systematic Approach to Hadron Physics
Authors: Stanley J. Brodsky and Guy F. de Téramond and Hans Günter Dosch
Abstract: Light-Front Hamiltonian theory provides a rigorous frame-independent framework for solving nonperturbative QCD. The valence Fock-state wavefunctions of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion, analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schr\"odinger equation, with an effective confining potential U which systematically incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon Fock states. Remarkably, the potential U has a unique form of a harmonic oscillator potential if one requires that the chiral QCD action remains conformally invariant. A mass gap arises when one extends the formalism of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to light-front Hamiltonian theory. The valence LF meson wavefunctions for zero quark mass satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion in the invariant variable $\zeta^2=b^2_\perp x(1-x)$, which is conjugate to the invariant mass squared. The result is a nonperturbative relativistic light-front quantum mechanical wave equation which incorporates color confinement and other essential spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron physics, including a massless pion for zero quark mass and linear Regge trajectories with the same slope in the radial quantum number n and orbital angular momentum L. The corresponding light-front Dirac equation provides a model of nucleons. The same light-front equations arise from the holographic mapping of the soft-wall model modification of AdS_5 space with a unique dilaton profile to QCD (3+1) at fixed light-front time. Light-front holography thus provides a precise relation between amplitudes in the fifth dimension of AdS space and light-front wavefunctions. We also discuss the implications of the underlying conformal template of QCD for renormalization scale-setting, and the implications of light-front quantization for the value of the cosmological constant.
