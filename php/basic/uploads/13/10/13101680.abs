Title: Color-kinematics duality and dimensional reduction for graviton emission  in Regge limit
Authors: Henrik Johansson and Agustin Sabio Vera and Eduardo Serna Campillo and Miguel A. Vazquez-Mozo
Abstract: In this talk we review the work in [1,2,3] where we have studied the applicability of the color-kinematics duality to the scattering of two distinguishable scalar matter particles with one gluon emission in QCD, or one graviton emission in Einstein gravity. We have shown that the duality works well in the Regge limit under two different extensions of the gauge theory: the introduction of a new scalar contact interaction and the relaxation of the distinguishability of the scalars. Both modifications correspond to theories obtained by dimensional reduction from higher-dimensional pure gauge theories.
