Title: Application of Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Ashaq Hussain Sofi and Mohammad Ashraf Shah
Abstract: In this paper we will analyse some interesting structures that occur in scalar quantum field theory. We will quantize this theory using path integrals. We will analyse the Bogomolny Bound for scalar quantum field theory in two dimensions. We will also analyse the generalization of this result to fractional powers of the differential operator.
