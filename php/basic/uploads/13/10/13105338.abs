Title: Cosmological Evolution of Einstein-Aether Models with Power-law-like  Potential
Authors: Hao Wei and Xiao-Peng Yan and Ya-Nan Zhou
Abstract: The so-called Einstein-Aether theory is General Relativity coupled (at second derivative order) to a dynamical unit time-like vector field (the aether). It is a Lorentz-violating theory, and gained much attention in the recent years. In the present work, we study the cosmological evolution of Einstein-Aether models with power-law-like potential, by using the method of dynamical system. In the case without matter, there are two attractors which correspond to an inflationary universe in the early epoch, or a de Sitter universe in the late time. In the case with matter but there is no interaction between dark energy and matter, there are only two de Sitter attractors, and no scaling attractor exists. So, it is difficult to alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem. Therefore, we then allow the interaction between dark energy and matter. In this case, several scaling attractors can exist under some complicated conditions, and hence the cosmological coincidence problem could be alleviated.
