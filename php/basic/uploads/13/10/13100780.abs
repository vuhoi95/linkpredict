Title: General dissipative coefficient in warm intermediate and logamediate  inflation
Authors: Ramon Herrera and Marco Olivares and Nelson Videla
Abstract: We study a general form for the dissipative coefficient $\Gamma(T,\phi)=C_\phi\,T^{m}/\phi^{m-1}$ in the context of warm intermediate and logamediate inflationary universe models. We analyze these models in the weak and strong dissipative regimes. In the slow-roll approximation, we describe in great detail the characteristics of these models. In both regimes, we use recent data from the WMAP nine-year data and Planck data to constrain the parameters appearing in our models.
