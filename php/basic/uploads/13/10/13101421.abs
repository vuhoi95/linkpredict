Title: Casimir Torque in Inhomogeneous Dielectric Plates
Authors: William Long and Lucas Schuermann
Abstract: In this work, we consider a torque caused by the well known quantum mechanical Casimir effect arising from quantized field fluctuations between plates with inhomogeneous, sharply discontinuous, dielectric properties. While the Casimir effect is a relatively well understood phenomenon, systems resulting in lateral or rotational forces are far less developed; to our knowledge, a theoretical study of discontinuous dielectric variants of such systems has not been attempted. We utilize a Proximity Force Approximation in conjunction with the Lifshitz dielectric formula to perform theoretical analyses of resultant torques in systems with bisected and quadrisected dielectric regions. We also develop a high precision Monte Carlo type numerical integrator to approximate our derived expressions. Our calculations of an energy density linear with the alignment angle result in a constant torque and have implications in NEMS (nano electromechanical systems) and MEMS (micro electromechanical systems), including a postulated nanoscale oscillating drive mechanism powered by quantum field interactions.
