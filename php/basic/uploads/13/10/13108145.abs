Title: Magnetization and pressures at nonzero magnetic fields in QCD
Authors: G. S. Bali and F. Bruckmann and G. Endrodi and A. Schafer
Abstract: Two approaches are pursued to determine the magnetization of the QCD vacuum at zero and nonzero temperatures using lattice simulations. The first method builds on pressure anisotropies which are induced by the magnetic field on the lattice. The second approach is a novel, generalized version of the integral method, which exploits the independence of the theory on B for asymptotically large quark masses. Both approaches give consistent results and confirm that the QCD medium is paramagnetic. Finally, an interesting relation between QCD paramagnetism, magnetic catalysis of the QCD condensate and the QED beta-function is pointed out.
