Title: Non-Relativistic Parity-Violating Hydrodynamics in Two Spatial  Dimensions
Authors: Matthias Kaminski and Sergej Moroz
Abstract: We construct the non-relativistic parity-violating hydrodynamic description of a two-dimensional dissipative, normal fluid in presence of small U(1) background fields and vorticity. This is achieved by taking the non-relativistic limit of the recently developed relativistic hydrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. We identify and interpret the resulting parity-violating contributions to the non-relativistic constitutive relations, which include the Hall current flowing perpendicular to the temperature gradient, the Hall viscosity and the Leduc-Righi energy current. Also a comparison of our findings is made with the non-relativistic parity-violating hydrodynamics obtained from a light-cone dimensional reduction.
