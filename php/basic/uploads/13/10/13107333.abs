Title: Two-point function for the Maxwell field in flat Robertson-Walker  spacetimes
Authors: E. Huguet and J. Renaud
Abstract: We obtain an explicit two-point function for the Maxwell field in flat Roberson-Walker spaces, thanks to a new gauge condition which takes the scale factor into account and assume a simple form. The two-point function is found to have the short distance Hadamard behavior.
