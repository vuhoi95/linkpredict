Authors: Betti Hartmann and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz and Isabell Schaffer
Abstract: We present compact Q-balls in an (Anti-)de Sitter background in D dimensions, obtained with a V-shaped potential of the scalar field. Beyond critical values of the cosmological constant compact Q-shells arise. By including the gravitational back-reaction, we obtain boson stars and boson shells with (Anti-)de Sitter asymptotics. We analyze the physical properties of these solutions and determine their domain of existence. In four dimensions we address some astrophysical aspects.
