Title: Rozansky-Witten-type invariants from symplectic Lie pairs
Authors: Yannick Voglaire and Ping Xu
Abstract: We introduce symplectic structures on "Lie pairs" of (real or complex) algebroids as studied by Chen, Stienon and the second author (From Atiyah classes to homotopy Leibniz algebras, arXiv:1204.1075), encompassing homogeneous symplectic spaces, symplectic manifolds with a $\mathfrak g$-action and holomorphic symplectic manifolds. We show that to each such symplectic Lie pair are associated Rozansky-Witten-type invariants of three-manifolds and knots, given respectively by weight systems on trivalent and chord diagrams.
