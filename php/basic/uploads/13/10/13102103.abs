Title: Gauge Invariant Photon Mass Induced by Vortex Gauge Interactions
Authors: M. Cristina Diamantini and Giuseppe Guarnaccia and Carlo A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We propose a vortex gauge field theory in which the curl of a Dirac fermion current density plays the role of the pseudovector charge density. In this field-theoretic model, vortex interactions are mediated by a single scalar gauge boson in its antisymmetric tensor formulation. We show that these long range vortex interactions induce a gauge invariant photon mass in the one-loop effective action. The fermion loop generates a coupling between photons and the vortex gauge boson, which acquires thus charge. This coupling represents also an induced, gauge invariant, topological mass for the photons, leading to the Meissner effect. The one-loop effective equations of motion for the charged vortex gauge boson are the London equations. We propose thus vortex gauge interactions as an alternative, topological mechanism for superconductivity in which no spontaneous symmetry breaking is involved.
