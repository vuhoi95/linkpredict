Title: Fermions in Randall-Sundrum Models with Two Additional Unwarped Extra  Dimensions
Authors: Erin De Pree and Jeremy Perrin
Abstract: Models with one warped and two unwarped extra dimensions allow for the solution of a number of open questions in particle physics. They can be used to solve the hierarchy problem in the same sense as Randall-Sundrum extra dimensions, they incorporate the Randall-Sundrum approach to flavor, and they generate a dark matter candidate via Kaluza-Klein parity in the flat extra dimensions. In this paper, we examine the models AdS_5 x T_2 and AdS_5 x S_2, deriving the Kaluza-Klein spectrum for fermions propagating in the bulk. While the toroidal model allows for a chiral zero mode, we find that the positive curvature of the spherical model disallows all zero modes without further modifications.
