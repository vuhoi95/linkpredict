Title: Halo/Galaxy Bispectrum with Primordial non-Gaussianity from integrated  Perturbation Theory (iPT)

Abstract: We derive a formula for the halo/galaxy bispectrum on the basis of the integrated Perturbation Theory (iPT). In addition to the gravity-induced non-Gaussianity, we consider the non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations, and investigate in detail the effect of such primordial non-Gaussianity on the large-scale halo/galaxy bispectrum. In iPT, the effects of primordial non-Gaussianity are wholly encapsulated in the linear (primordial) polyspectra, and we systematically calculate the contributions to the large-scale behaviors arising from the three types of primordial bispectrum (local-, equilateral-, and orthogonal-types), and primordial trispectrum of the local-type non-Gaussianity. We find that the equilateral- and orthogonal-type non-Gaussianities show distinct scale-dependent behaviors which can dominate the gravity-induced non-Gaussianity at very large scales. For the local-type non-Gaussianity, higher-order loop corrections are found to give a significantly large contribution to the halo/galaxy bispectrum of the squeezed shape, and eventually dominate over the other contributions on large scales. A diagrammatic approach based on the iPT helps us to systematically investigate an impact of such higher-order contributions to the large-scale halo/galaxy bispectrum.
