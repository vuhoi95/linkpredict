Title: On Extremal Limits and Duality Orbits of Stationary Black Holes
Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Antonio Gallerati and Mario Trigiante
Abstract: With reference to the effective three-dimensional description of stationary, single center solutions to (ungauged) symmetric supergravities, we complete a previous analysis on the definition of a general geometrical mechanism for connecting global symmetry orbits (duality orbits) of non-extremal solutions to those of extremal black holes. We focus our attention on a generic representative of these orbits, providing its explicit description in terms of D=4 fields. As a byproduct, using a new characterization of the angular momentum in terms of quantities intrinsic to the geometry of the D=3 effective model, we are able to prove on general grounds its invariance, as a function of the boundary data, under the D=4 global symmetry. In the extremal under-rotating limit it becomes moduli-independent. We also discuss the issue of the fifth parameter characterizing the four-dimensional seed solution, showing that it can be generated by a transformation in the global symmetry group which is manifest in the D=3 effective description.
