Title: Fermions in gravity with local spin-base invariance
Authors: Holger Gies and Stefan Lippoldt
Abstract: We study a formulation of Dirac fermions in curved spacetime that respects general coordinate invariance as well as invariance under local spin-base transformations. The natural variables for this formulation are spacetime-dependent Dirac matrices subject to the Clifford-algebra constraint. In particular, a coframe, i.e. vierbein field is not required. The corresponding affine spin connection consists of a canonical part that is completely fixed in terms of the Dirac matrices and a free part that can be interpreted as spin torsion. A general variation of the Dirac matrices naturally induces a spinorial Lie derivative which coincides with the known Kosmann-Lie derivative in the absence of torsion. Using this formulation for building a field theory of quantized gravity and matter fields, we show that it suffices to quantize the metric and the matter fields. This observation is of particular relevance for field theory approaches to quantum gravity, as it can serve for a purely metric-based quantization scheme for gravity even in the presence of fermions.
