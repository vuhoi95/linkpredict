Title: A Note on Gauge Invariant Operators in Noncommutative Gauge Theories and  the Matrix Model
Authors: Avinash Dhar and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: In this note we discuss local gauge-invariant operators in noncommutative gauge theories. Inspired by the connection of these theories with the Matrix model, we give a simple construction of a complete set of gauge-invariant operators. We make connection with the recent discussions of candidate operators which are dual to closed strings modes. We also discuss large Wilson loops which in the limit of vanishing noncommutativity, reduce to the closed Wilson loops of the ordinary gauge theory.
