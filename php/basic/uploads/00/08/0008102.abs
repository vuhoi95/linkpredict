Title: Comments on Brane World Cosmology
Authors: Luis Anchordoqui and Kasper Olsen
Abstract: In this paper we consider some constraints on brane-world cosmologies. In the first part we analyze different behaviors for the expansion of our universe by imposing constraints on the speed of sound. In the second part, we study the nature of matter on the brane world by means of the well-known energy conditions. We find that the strong energy condition must be completely violated at late stages of the universe.
