Title: Towards the large N limit of pure N=1 super Yang Mills
Authors: Juan M. Maldacena and Carlos Nunez
Abstract: We find the gravity solution corresponding to a large number of NS or D fivebranes wrapped on a two sphere so that we have pure ${\cal N}=1$ super Yang-Mills in the IR. The supergravity solution is smooth, it shows confinement and it breaks the $U(1)_R$ chiral symmetry in the appropriate way. When the gravity approximation is valid the masses of glueballs are comparable to the masses of Kaluza Klein states on the fivebrane, but if we could quantize strings on this background it looks like we should be able to decouple the KK states.
