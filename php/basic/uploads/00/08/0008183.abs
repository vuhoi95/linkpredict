Title: Towards Field Theory in Spaces with Multivolume Junctions
Authors: P. I. Fomin and Yu. V. Shtanov
Abstract: We consider a spacetime formed by several pieces having common timelike boundary which plays the role of a junction between them. We establish junction conditions for fields of various spin and derive the resulting laws of wave propagation through the junction, which turn out to be quite similar for fields of all spins. As an application, we consider the case of multivolume junctions in four-dimensional spacetime that may arise in the context of the theory of quantum creation of a closed universe on the background of a big mother universe. The theory developed can also be applied to braneworld models and to the superstring theory.
