Title: Universal Amplitude Ratios of The Renormalization Group: Two-Dimensional  Tricritical Ising Model
Authors: D. Fioravanti and G. Mussardo and P. Simon
Abstract: The scaling form of the free-energy near a critical point allows for the definition of various thermodynamical amplitudes and the determination of their dependence on the microscopic non-universal scales. Universal quantities can be obtained by considering special combinations of the amplitudes. Together with the critical exponents they characterize the universality classes and may be useful quantities for their experimental identification. We compute the universal amplitude ratios for the Tricritical Ising Model in two dimensions by using several theoretical methods from Perturbed Conformal Field Theory and Scattering Integrable Quantum Field Theory. The theoretical approaches are further supported and integrated by results coming from a numerical determination of the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the off-critical systems in an infinite cylinder.
