Title: Domain walls in five dimensional supergravity with non-trivial  hypermultiplets
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Carl Herrmann and Jan Louis and Steven Thomas
Abstract: We study BPS domain wall solutions of 5-dimensional N=2 supergravity where isometries of the hypermultiplet geometry have been gauged. We derive the corresponding supersymmetric flow equations and define an appropriate c-function. As an example we discuss a domain wall solution of Freedman, Gubser, Pilch and Warner which is related to a RG-flow in a dual superconformal field theory.
