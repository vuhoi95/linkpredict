Title: Broadening of the QCD3 flux tube from the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: J. Greensite and P. Olesen
Abstract: We use the finite temperature AdS/CFT approach to demonstrate logarithmic broadening of the confining QCD3 flux tube as a function of quark separation. This behavior indicates that, unlike lattice QCD, there is no roughening transition in the AdS/CFT formulation, which raises the interesting possibility of extrapolating strong coupling results to weak couplings by the use of resummation techniques. In the zero-temperature non-confining limit, we find that this logarithmic broadening of the field strength distribution is absent. Our results are obtained numerically at strong couplings, in the supergravity approximation.
