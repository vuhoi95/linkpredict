Title: Non-Abelian Stokes Theorems in Yang-Mills and Gravity Theories
Authors: Dmitri Diakonov and Victor Petrov
Abstract: We recall the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop in the Yang-Mills theory and discuss its meaning. Then we move to `gravitational Wilson loops', i.e. to holonomies in curved d=2,3,4 spaces and derive non-Abelian Stokes theorems for these quantities as well, which are similar to our formula in the Yang-Mills theory. In particular we derive an elegant formula for the holonomy in the case of a constant-curvature background in three dimensions and a formula for small-area loops in any number of dimensions.
