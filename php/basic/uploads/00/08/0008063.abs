Title: Instability of a membrane intersecting a black hole
Authors: Susumu Higaki and Akihiro Ishibashi and Daisuke Ida
Abstract: The stability of a Nambu-Goto membrane at the equatorial plane of the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m-de Sitter spacetime is studied. The covariant perturbation formalism is applied to study the behavior of the perturbation of the membrane. The perturbation equation is solved numerically. It is shown that a membrane intersecting a charged black hole, including extremely charged one, is unstable and that the positive cosmological constant strengthens the instability.
