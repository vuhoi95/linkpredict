Title: Dirac Spectrum in Adjoint QCD
Authors: D. Toublan and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: In this lecture we discuss some exact results for the low-lying spectrum of the Dirac operator in adjoint QCD. In particular, we find an analytical expression for the slope of the average spectral density. These results are obtained by means of a generating function which is an extension of the QCD partition function with fermionic and bosonic ghost quarks. The low-energy limit of this generating function is completely determined by chiral (super-)symmetries. Our results for the slope of the average spectral density are consistent with the results for the scalar susceptibility which can be obtained from the usual chiral Lagrangian.
