Title: On the Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem
Authors: Dmitri Diakonov and Victor Petrov
Abstract: We present the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop in various forms and discuss its meaning. Its validity has been recently questioned by Faber, Ivanov, Troitskaya and Zach. We demonstrate that all points of their criticism are based on mistakes in mathematics. Finally, we derive a variant of our formula for the Wilson loop in lattice regularization.
