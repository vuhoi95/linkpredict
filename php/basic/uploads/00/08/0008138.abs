Title: (2+1)-Dimensional Black Hole with Coulomb-like Field
Authors: M. Cataldo and N. Cruz and S. del Campo and A. Garcia
Abstract: A (2+1)-static black hole solution with a nonlinear electric field is derived. The source to the Einstein equations is a nonlinear electrodynamics, satisfying the weak energy conditions, and it is such that the energy momentum tensor is traceless. The obtained solution is singular at the origin of coordinates. The derived electric field E(r) is given by $E(r)=q/r^2$, thus it has the Coulomb form of a point charge in the Minkowski spacetime. This solution describes charged (anti)--de Sitter spaces. An interesting asymptotically flat solution arises for $\Lambda=0$.
