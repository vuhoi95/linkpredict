Title: Nonperturbative Renormalization Flow and Essential Scaling for the  Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition
Authors: G. v. Gersdorff and C. Wetterich
Abstract: The Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition is described by the nonperturbative renormalization flow of the two dimensional $\phi^4$-model. The observation of essential scaling demonstrates that the flow equation incorporates nonperturbative effects which have previously found an alternative description in terms of vortices. The duality between the linear and nonlinear $\sigma$-model gives a unified description of the long distance behaviour for O(N)-models in arbitrary dimension $d$. We compute critical exponents in first order in the derivative expansion.
