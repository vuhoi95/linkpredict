Title: Global phase time and path integral for string cosmological models
Authors: Gaston Giribet and Claudio Simeone
Abstract: A global phase time is identified for homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models yielding from the low energy effective action of closed bosonic string theory. When the Hamiltonian constraint allows for the existence of an intrinsic time, the quantum transition amplitude is obtained by means of the usual path integral procedure for gauge systems.
