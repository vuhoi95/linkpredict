Title: Fermion zero-modes on brane-worlds
Authors: Seif Randjbar-Daemi and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: We study localization of bulk fermions on a brane with inclusion of Yang-Mills and scalar backgrounds in higher dimensions and give the conditions under which localized chiral fermions can be obtained.
