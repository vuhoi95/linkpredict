Title: Nonperturbative study of the two-frequency sine-Gordon model
Authors: Z. Bajnok and L. Palla and G. Takacs and F. Wagner
Abstract: The two-frequency sine-Gordon model is examined. The focus is mainly on the case when the ratio of the frequencies is 1/2, given the recent interest in the literature. We discuss the model both in a perturbative (form factor perturbation theory) and a nonperturbative (truncated conformal space approach) framework, and give particular attention to a phase transition conjectured earlier by Delfino and Mussardo. We give substantial evidence that the transition is of second order and that it is in the Ising universality class. Furthermore, we check the UV-IR operator correspondence and conjecture the phase diagram of the theory.
