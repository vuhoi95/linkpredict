Title: Lumps in level truncated open string field theory
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Joao P. Rodrigues
Abstract: The ratios of the masses of D(p-d) branes to the masses of Dp in open bosonic string field theory are computed within the modified level truncation approximation of Moeller, Sen and Zweibach. At the lowest non-trivial truncation requiring the addition of new primary states, we find evidence of rapid convergence to the expected result for 1<d<7 providing additional evidence for the consistency of this approximation.
