Abstract: We study charged brane-world black holes in the model of Randall and Sundrum in which our universe is viewed as a domain wall in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. Such black holes can carry two types of ``charge'', one arising from the bulk Weyl tensor and one from a gauge field trapped on the wall. We use a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to study how these black holes behave in the bulk. It has been shown that a Reissner-Nordstrom geometry is induced on the wall when only Weyl charge is present. However, we show that such solutions exhibit pathological features in the bulk. For more general charged black holes, our results suggest that the extent of the horizon in the fifth dimension is usually less than for an uncharged black hole that has the same mass or the same horizon radius on the wall.
