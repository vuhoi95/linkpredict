Title: Observables of Non-Commutative Gauge Theories
Authors: David J. Gross and Akikazu Hashimoto and N. Itzhaki
Abstract: We construct gauge invariant operators in non-commutative gauge theories which in the IR reduce to the usual operators of ordinary field theories (e.g. F^2). We show that in the deep UV the two-point functions of these operators admit a universal exponential behavior which fits neatly with the dual supergravity results. We also consider the ratio between n-point functions and two-point functions to find exponential suppression in the UV which we compare to the high energy fixed angle scattering of string theory.
