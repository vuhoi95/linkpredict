Title: Spectral functions in a magnetic field as a probe of spin-charge  separation in a Luttinger liquid
Authors: Silvio Rabello and Qimiao Si
Abstract: We show that the single-particle spectral functions in a magnetic field can be used to probe spin-charge separation of a Luttinger liquid. Away from the Fermi momentum, the magnetic field splits both the spinon peak and holon peak; here the spin-charge separation nature is reflected in the different magnitude of the two splittings. At the Fermi momentum, the magnetic field splits the zero-field peak into {\it four} peaks. The feasibility of experimentally studying this effect is discussed.
