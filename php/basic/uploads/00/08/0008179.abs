Title: Conformal Field Theory Correlators From sine-Gordon Model on AdS  Spacetime
Authors: Sze-Shiang Feng and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: Using the proposed AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the correlators of operators of conformal field theory at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$ corresponding to the sine-Gordon model in the bulk.
