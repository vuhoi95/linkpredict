Title: Wess-Zumino-Witten and fermion models in noncommutative space
Authors: E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We analyze the connection between Wess-Zumino-Witten and free fermion models in two-dimensional noncommutative space. Starting from the computation of the determinant of the Dirac operator in a gauge field background, we derive the corresponding bosonization recipe studying, as an example, bosonization of the U(N) Thirring model. Concerning the properties of the noncommutative Wess-Zumino-Witten model, we construct an orbit-preserving transformation that maps the standard commutative WZW action into the noncommutative one.
