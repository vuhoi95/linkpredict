Title: 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory as a local theory of evolution of  metrics on 3 manifolds
Authors: Pushan Majumdar and H. S. Sharatchandra
Abstract: An explicit canonical transformation is constructed to relate the physical subspace of Yang-Mills theory to the phase space of the ADM variables of general relativity. This maps 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory to local evolution of metrics on 3 manifolds.
