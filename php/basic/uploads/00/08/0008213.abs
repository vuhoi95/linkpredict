Title: Anomalous U(1)_A and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking
Authors: Ilia Gogoladze and Mirian Tsulaia
Abstract: We suggest a new mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking in the supersymmetric Standard Model. Our suggestion is based on the presence of an anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry, which naturally arises in the four dimensional superstring theory, and heavily relies on the value of the corresponding Fayet-Illiopoulos \xi-term.
