Title: Conservation laws in the teleparallel theory of gravity
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: We study the conservation laws associated with the asymptotic Poincare symmetry of spacetime in the general teleparallel theory of gravity. Demanding that the canonical Poincare generators have well defined functional derivatives in a properly defined phase space, we obtain the improved form of the generators, containing certain surface terms. These terms are shown to represent the values of the related conserved charges: energy-momentum and angular momentum.
