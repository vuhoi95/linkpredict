Title: Gravity on a Brane in Infinite-Volume Extra Space
Authors: Gia Dvali and Gregory Gabadadze
Abstract: We generalize the mechanism proposed in [hep-th/0005016] and show that a four-dimensional relativistic tensor theory of gravitation can be obtained on a delta-function brane in flat infinite-volume extra space. In particular, we demonstrate that the induced Ricci scalar gives rise to Einstein's gravity on a delta-function type brane if the number of space-time dimensions is bigger than five. The bulk space exhibits the phenomenon of infrared transparency. That is to say, the bulk can be probed by gravitons with vanishing four-dimensional momentum square, while it is unaccessible to higher modes. This provides an attractive framework for solving the cosmological constant problem.
