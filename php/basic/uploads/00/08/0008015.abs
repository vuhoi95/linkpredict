Abstract: We investigate the `giant gravitons' of McGreevy, Susskind and Toumbas [hep-th/0003075]. We demonstrate that these are BPS configurations which preserve precisely the same supersymmetries as a `point-like' graviton. We also show that there exist `dual' giant gravitons consisting of spherical branes expanding into the AdS component of the spacetime. Finally, we discuss the realization of the stringy exclusion principle within this expanded framework.
