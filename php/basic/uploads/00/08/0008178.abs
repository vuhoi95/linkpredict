Abstract: We show that it is possible to construct a consistent model describing a current-carrying cosmic string endowed with torsion. The torsion contribution to the gravitational force and geodesics of a test-particle moving around the SCCS are analyzed. In particular, we point out two interesting astrophysical phenomena in which the higher magnitude force we derived may play a critical role: the dynamics of compact objects orbiting the torsioned SCCS and accretion of matter onto it. The deficit angle associated to the SCCS can be obtained and compared with data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. We also derived a value for the torsion contribution to matter density fluctuations in the early Universe.
