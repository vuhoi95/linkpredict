Title: Supersymmetric integrable systems from geodesic flows on superconformal  groups
Authors: Chandrashekar Devchand and Jeremy Schiff
Abstract: We discuss the possible relationship between geodesic flow, integrability and supersymmetry, using fermionic extensions of the KdV equation, as well as the recently introduced supersymmetrisation of the Camassa-Holm equation, as illustrative examples.
