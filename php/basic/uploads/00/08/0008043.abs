Title: Wess--Zumino terms and Duality
Authors: A. Smailagic and E. Spallucci
Abstract: We show the equivalence between Stuckelberg and Wess-Zumino methods of restoration of gauge symmetries of the anomalous, Abelian, effective action, in arbitrary even dimensions D=2k. We present dual version of Wess-Zumino terms with the compensating field described by a Kalb-Ramond like p=2k-2 form.
