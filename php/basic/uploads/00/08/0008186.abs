Abstract: We study the destruction of the antiferromagnetic order in the high-Tc superconductors La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4) and YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) in the framework of the CP1-nonlinear sigma model formulation of the 2D quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The dopants are introduced as independent fermions with appropriate dispersion relations determined by the shape of the Fermi surface. The energy of skyrmion topological defects, which are shown to be introduced by doping, is used as an order parameter for antiferromagnetic order. We obtain analytic expressions for this as a function of doping which allow us to plot the curves T_N(x_c)\times x_c and M(x)\times x, for both YBCO and LSCO, in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data.
