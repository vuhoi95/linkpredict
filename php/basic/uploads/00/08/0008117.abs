Title: Explicit derivation of a Central extended Hyper-Kahler Metric
Authors: M. Hssaini and M. Kessabi and B. Maroufi and M. B. Sedra
Abstract: This work consists in applying the analysis of integrable models to study the problem of Hyper-Kahler metrics building. In this context, we use the harmonic superspace language applied to D=2 N=4 SU(2) Liouville self interacting model and derive an explicit central extended Hyper-Kahler metric as well as the induced scalar potential.
