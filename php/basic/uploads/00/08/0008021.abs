Title: Pulse interaction in nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics
Authors: A. M. Ignatov and V. P. Poponin
Abstract: The energy-momentum conservation law is used to investigate the interaction of pulses in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics with Lorentz-invariant constitutive relations. It is shown that for the pulses of the arbitrary shape the interaction results in phase shift only.
