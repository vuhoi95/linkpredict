Title: The extremal limit of D-dimensional black holes
Authors: M. Caldarelli and L. Vanzo and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The extreme limit of a class of D-dimensional black holes is revisited. In the static limit, it is shown that well defined extremal limiting procedure exists and it leads to new solutions of the type AdS2 times constant curvature symmetric spaces.
