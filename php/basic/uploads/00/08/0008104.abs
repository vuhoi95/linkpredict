Title: Superfield Covariant Quantization with BRST Symmetry
Authors: P. M. Lavrov and P. Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We generalize the method of superfield Lagrangian BRST quantization in the part of the gauge-fixing procedure and obtain a quantization method that can be considered as an alternative to the Batalin - Vilkovisky formalism.
