Title: Thermal forward scattering amplitudes in temporal gauges
Authors: F. T. Brandt and J. Frenkel and F. R. Machado
Abstract: We employ the thermal forward scattering amplitudes technique in order to compute the gluon self-energy in a class of temporal gauges. The leading T^2 and the sub-leading ln(T) contributions are obtained for temperatures high compared with the external momentum. The logarithmic contributions have the same structure as the ultraviolet pole terms which occur at zero temperature (we have recently extended this result to the Coulomb gauge). We also show that the prescription poles, characteristic of temporal gauges, do not modify the leading and sub-leading high-temperature behavior. The one-loop calculation shows that the thermal self-energy is transverse. This result has also been extended to higher orders, using the BRS identities.
