Title: Field theory models for tachyon and gauge field string dynamics
Authors: Joseph A. Minahan and Barton Zwiebach
Abstract: In hep-th/0008227, the unstable lump solution of \phi^3 theory was shown to have a spectrum governed by the solvable Schroedinger equation with the \ell=3 reflectionless potential and was used as a model for tachyon condensation in string theory. In this paper we study in detail an \ell\to \infty scalar field theory model whose lump solution mimics remarkably the string theory setup: the original field theory tachyon and the lump tachyon have the same mass, the spectrum of the lump consists of equally spaced infinite levels, there is no continuous spectrum, and nothing survives after tachyon condensation. We also find exact solutions for lumps with codimension \ge 2, and show that that their tensions satisfy (1/(2\pi)) (T_p/ T_{p+1})=e/(\sqrt{2\pi}) \approx 1.08. We incorporate gauge fixed couplings to a U(1) gauge field which preserve solvability and result in massless gauge fields on the lump.
