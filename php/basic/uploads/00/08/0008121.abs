Title: Extended Weyl-Heisenberg algebra and Rubakov-Spiridonov superalgebra:  Anyonic realizations
Authors: J. Douari and M. Daoud
Abstract: We give the realizations of the extended Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) algebra and the Rubakov-Spiridonov (RS) superalgebra in terms of anyons, characterized by the statistical parameter $\nu\in[0,1]$, on two-dimensional lattice. The construction uses anyons defined from usual fermionic oscillators (Lerda-Sciuto construction). The anyonic realization of the superalgebra $sl(1/1)$ is also presented.
