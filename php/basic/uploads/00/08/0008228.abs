Title: Global geometric properties of AdS space and the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Qi-Keng Lu and Zhe Chang and Han-Ying Guo
Abstract: The Poisson kernels and relations between them for a massive scalar field in a unit ball $B^n$ with Hua's metric and conformal flat metric are obtained by describing the $B^n$ as a submanifold of an $(n+1)$-dimensional embedding space. Global geometric properties of the AdS space are discussed. We show that the $(n+1)$-dimensional AdS space AdS$_{n+1}$ is isomorphic to $RP^1\times B^n$ and boundary of the AdS is isomorphic to $RP^1\times S^{n-1}$. Bulk-boundary propagator and the AdS/CFT like correspondence are demonstrated based on these global geometric properties of the $RP^1\times B^n$.
