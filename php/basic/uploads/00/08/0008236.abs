Title: Light-Front Aspects of Chiral Symmetry
Authors: L. Martinovic and J. P. Vary
Abstract: Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and axial anomaly are studied in the light-front formulation. The existence of multiple vacua and a Nambu-Goldstone boson, both related to dynamical fermion zero modes, are demonstrated within a simple sigma model with fermions. The Weyl gauge formulation and a consistent gauge invariant point-splitting regularization, which includes the light front time, are crucial for obtaining the anomaly in the massive Schwinger model and QED(3+1).
