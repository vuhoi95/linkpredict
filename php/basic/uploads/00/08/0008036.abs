Title: Conserved charges of non-yangian type for the Frahm-Polychronakos spin  chain
Authors: P. Mathieu and Y. Xudous
Abstract: Through an $\hbar$-expansion of the confined Calogero model with spin exchange interactions, we extract a generating function for the involutive conserved charges of the Frahm-Polychronakos spin chain. The resulting conservation laws possess the spin chain yangian symmetry, although they are not expressible in terms of these yangians.
