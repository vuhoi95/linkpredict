Title: Warped Compactification with an Abelian Gauge Theory
Authors: S. Hayakawa and K. -I. Izawa
Abstract: We investigate warped compactification with an abelian gauge theory in six dimensions. The vanishing cosmological constant in four dimensions can generically be realized with a regular metric even in a 3-brane background without fine tuning of couplings.
