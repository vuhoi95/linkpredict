Title: The Casimir Problem of Spherical Dielectrics: Quantum Statistical and  Field Theoretical Approaches
Authors: J. S. HÃ¸ye and I. Brevik and J. B. Aarseth
Abstract: The Casimir free energy for a system of two dielectric concentric nonmagnetic spherical bodies is calculated with use of a quantum statistical mechanical method, at arbitrary temperature. By means of this rather novel method, which turns out to be quite powerful (we have shown this to be true in other situations also), we consider first an explicit evaluation of the free energy for the static case, corresponding to zero Matsubara frequency ($n=0$). Thereafter, the time-dependent case is examined. For comparison we consider the calculation of the free energy with use of the more commonly known field theoretical method, assuming for simplicity metallic boundary surfaces.
