Title: Renormalization group flow with unstable particles
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and A. Fring
Abstract: The renormalization group flow of an integrable two dimensional quantum field theory which contains unstable particles is investigated. The analysis is carried out for the Virasoro central charge and the conformal dimensions as a function of the renormalization group flow parameter. This allows to identify the corresponding conformal field theories together with their operator content when the unstable particles vanish from the particle spectrum. The specific model considered is the $SU(3)_{2}$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model.
