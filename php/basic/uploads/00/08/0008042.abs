Title: Open Wilson Lines in Noncommutative Gauge Theory and Tomography of  Holographic Dual Supergravity
Authors: Sumit Das and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: We study the issue of gauge-invariant observables in d=4, N=4 noncommutative gauge theory and UV-IR relation therein. We show that open Wilson lines form a complete set of gauge invariant operators, which are local in momentum space and, depending on their size, exhibit two distinct behaviors of the UV-IR relation. We next study these properties in a proposed dual description in terms of supergravity and find agreement.
