Title: Quantum gravity as a theory of quantized area bits fitting together
Authors: H. S. Sharatchandra and H. Gopalkrishna Gadiyar
Abstract: Non-Abelian Gauss law is interpreted in terms of area bits described in a local frame which fit together into closed surfaces and the Non-Abelian Stokes law in terms of length bits described in a local frame which fit together into closed loops. A new equation relating the area variables and the phase space variables (or equivalently, angular momentum variables of the lattice Yang-Mills theory and phase space variables of the continuum theory) is obtained. Canonical quantization applied to these variables implies area quantization. A complete orthonormal basis of states satisfying the Gauss constraint is obtained.It has the interpretation of quantized area bits with undefined orientations and edges but fitting together into closed surfaces.
