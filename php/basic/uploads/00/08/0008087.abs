Title: On some new warped brane world solutions in higher dimensions
Authors: Seif Randjbar-Daemi and Mikhail Shaposhnikov
Abstract: We present new solutions of higher dimensional Einstein's equations with a cosmological constant that localize gravity on branes which are transverse to Ricci-flat manifolds or to homogeneous spaces with topologically non-trivial solutions of gauge field equations. These solutions are relevant for the localization of chiral fermions on a brane.
