Title: Effective actions on squashed lens spaces
Authors: Marcelo De Francia and Klaus Kirsten and J. S. Dowker
Abstract: As a technical exercise with possible relevance to the holographic principle and string theory, the effective actions (functional determinants) for scalars and spinors on the squashed three-sphere identified under the action of a cyclic group, Z_m, are determined. Especially in the extreme oblate squashing limit, which has a thermodynamic interpretation, the high temperature behaviour is found as a function of m. Although the intermediate details for odd and even m are different, the final answers are the same. A thermodynamic interpretation for spinors is possible only for twisted periodicity conditions and m even.
