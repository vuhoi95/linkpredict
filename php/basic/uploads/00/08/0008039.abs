Title: Differential equations for general SU(n) Bethe ansatz systems
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Clare Dunning and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: We show that SU(n) Bethe Ansatz equations with arbitrary `twist' parameters are hidden inside certain nth order ordinary differential equations, and discuss various consequences of this fact.
