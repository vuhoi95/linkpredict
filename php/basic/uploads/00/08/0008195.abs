Title: On the Finiteness of the N=4 SUSY Nonlinear Sigma Model in Three  Dimensions
Authors: Takeo Inami and Yorinori Saito and Masayoshi Yamamoto
Abstract: We construct the {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model in three dimensions which can be expanded in 1/N. We evaluate the effective action at leading order in the 1/N expansion and show the finiteness of the model to this order.
