Title: Supersymmetric Noether Currents and Seiberg-Witten Theory
Authors: A. Iorio and L. O'Raifeartaigh and S. Wolf
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first purpose is to review a systematic construction of Noether currents for supersymmetric theories, especially effective supersymmetric theories. The second purpose is to use these currents to derive the mass-formula for the quantized Seiberg-Witten model from the supersymmetric algebra. We check that the mass-formula of the low-energy theory agrees with that of the full theory (in the broken phase).
