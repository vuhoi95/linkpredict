Title: A no-go theorem for string warped compactifications
Authors: S. Ivanov and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We give necessary conditions for the existence of perturbative heterotic and common sector type II string warped compactifications preserving four and eight supersymmetries to four spacetime dimensions, respectively. In particular, we find that the only compactifications of heterotic string with the spin connection embedded in the gauge connection and type II strings are those on Calabi-Yau manifolds with constant dilaton. We obtain similar results for compactifications to six and to two dimensions.
