Title: Inflationary preheating and primordial black holes
Authors: Bruce A. Bassett and Shinji Tsujikawa
Abstract: Preheating after inflation may over-produce primordial black holes (PBH's) in many regions of parameter space. As an example we study two-field models with a massless self-interacting inflaton, taking into account second order field and metric backreaction effects as spatial averages. We find that a complex quilt of parameter regions above the Gaussian PBH over-production threshold emerges due to the enhancement of curvature perturbations on all scales. It should be possible to constrain realistic models of inflation through PBH over-production although many issues, such as rescattering and non-Gaussianity, remain unsolved or unexplored.
