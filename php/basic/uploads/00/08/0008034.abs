Title: Non-Abelian Black Holes with Magnetic Dipole Hair
Authors: B. Kleihaus and J. Kunz
Abstract: We construct static axially symmetric black holes in SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. Located in between a monopole-antimonopole pair, these black holes possess magnetic dipole hair. The difference of their mass and their horizon mass equals the mass of the regular monopole-antimonopole solution, as expected from the isolated horizon framework.
