Title: Identifying the Operator Content, the Homogeneous Sine-Gordon models
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and A. Fring
Abstract: We address the general question of how to reconstruct the field content of a quantum field theory from a given scattering theory in the context of the form factor program. For the $SU(3)_2$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model we construct systematically all $n$-particle form factors for a huge class of operators in terms of general determinant formulae. We investigate how different operators are interrelated by the momentum space cluster property. Finally we compute several two-point correlation functions and carry out the ultraviolet limit in order to identify each operator with its corresponding partner in the underlying conformal field theory.
