Title: Harmonic-Superspace Transform For N=3 SYM-Equations
Authors: J. Niederle and B. Zupnik
Abstract: The SU(3)/U(1) x U(1) harmonic variables are used in the harmonic-superspace representation of the D=4, N=3 SYM-equations. The harmonic superfield equations of motion in the simple non-covariant gauge contain the nilpotent harmonic analytic connections. It is shown that these harmonic SYM-equations are equivalent to the finite set of solvable linear iterative equations.
