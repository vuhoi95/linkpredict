Title: Boundary spectrum in the sine-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary  conditions
Authors: Peter Mattsson and Patrick Dorey
Abstract: We find the spectrum of boundary bound states for the sine-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary conditions, closing the bootstrap and providing a complete description of all the poles in the boundary reflection factors. The boundary Coleman-Thun mechanism plays an important role in the analysis. Two basic lemmas are introduced which should hold for any 1+1-dimensional boundary field theory, allowing the general method to be applied to other models.
