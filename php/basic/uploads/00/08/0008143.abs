Title: Loop integrals in three outstanding gauges: Feynman, Light-cone and  Coulomb
Authors: Alfredo T. Suzuki and Alexandre G. M. Schmidt
Abstract: We apply negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) to three outstanding gauges: Feynman, light-cone and Coulomb gauges. Our aim is to show that NDIM is a very suitable technique to deal with loop integrals, being them originated from any gauge choice. In Feynman gauge we perform scalar two-loop four-point massless integrals; in the light-cone gauge we calculate scalar two-loop integrals contributing for two-point functions without any kind of prescriptions, since NDIM can abandon such devices -- this calculation is the first test of our prescriptionless method beyond one-loop order; finally, for the Coulomb gauge we consider a four propagator massless loop integral, in the split dimensional regularization context.
