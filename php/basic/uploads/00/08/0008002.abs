Title: Off-Shell Bethe Ansatz Equation for $osp(2|1)$ Gaudin Magnets
Authors: A. Lima-Santos and W. Utiel
Abstract: The semi-classical limit of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz method is used to solve the theory of Gaudin models. Via the off-shell method we find the spectra and eigenvectors of the N-1 independent Gaudin Hamiltonians with symmetry osp(2|1). We also show how the off-shell Gaudin equation solves the trigonometric Knizhnik- Zamolodchikov equation.
