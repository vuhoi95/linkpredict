Title: Analytical construction of a nonperturbative vacuum for the open bosonic  string
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Robertus Potting
Abstract: Using analytical methods, a nonpertubative vacuum is constructed recursively in the field theory for the open bosonic string. Evidence suggests it corresponds to the Lorentz-invariant endpoint of tachyon condensation on a D25-brane. The corresponding string field is a twisted squeezed state.
