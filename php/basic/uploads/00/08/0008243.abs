Title: The Electroweak Interactions as a Confinement Phenomenon
Authors: Xavier Calmet and Harald Fritzsch
Abstract: We consider a model for the electroweak interactions based on the assumption that physical particles are singlets under the gauge group SU(2). The concept of complementarity explains why the standard model works with such an extraordinary precision although the fermions and bosons of the model can be viewed as composite objects of some more fundamental fermions and bosons. We study the incorporation of QED in the model. Furthermore we consider possible deviations from the standard model at very high energies, e.g. excited states of the weak bosons.
