Title: AdS/CFT correspondence in cosmology
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The attempt to understand if AdS/CFT correspondence may be realized as the one between some AdS-like cosmological space and CFT living on the boundary is made. In order to obtain such cosmology we exchange the time and radial coordinates in d5 Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter (S-AdS) BH (with corresponding signature change). The test on proportionality of free energies from such d5 cosmological space (after AdS/CFT identification of parameters) and from ${\cal N}=4$ SU(N) super Yang-Mills quantum theory is successfully passed.
