Abstract: We employ the ADHM method to derive the moduli space of two instantons in U(1) gauge theory on a noncommutative space. We show by an explicit hyperK\"ahler quotient construction that the relative metric of the moduli space of two instantons on $R^4$ is the Eguchi-Hanson metric and find a unique threshold bound state. For two instantons on $R^3\times S^1$, otherwise known as calorons, we give the asymptotic metric and conjecture a completion. We further discuss the relationship of caloron moduli spaces of A, D and E groups to the Coulomb branches of three dimensional gauge theory. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch of SU(2) gauge group with a single massive adjoint hypermultiplet coincides with the above two caloron moduli space.
