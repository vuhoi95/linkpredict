Title: Polyakov's spin factor and new algorithms for efficient perturbative  computations in QCD
Authors: A. I. Karanikas and C. N. Ktorides
Abstract: Polyakov's spin factor enters as a weight in the path-integral description of particle-like modes propagating in Euclidean space-times, accounting for particle spin. The Fock-Feynman-Schwinger path integral applied to QCD accomodates Polyakov's spin factor in a natural manner while, at the same time, it identifies Wilson line (loop) operators as sole agents of interaction dynamics among matter and gauge field quanta. A direct application of such a separation between spin content and dynamics is the emergence of master expressions for the perturbative series involving either open or closed fermionic lines which provide new, comprehensive approaches to perturbative QCD.
