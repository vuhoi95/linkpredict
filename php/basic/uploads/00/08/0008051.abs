Title: An Exact Black Hole Entropy Bound
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: We show that a Rademacher expansion can be used to establish an exact bound for the entropy of black holes within a conformal field theory framework. This convergent expansion includes all subleading corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking term.
