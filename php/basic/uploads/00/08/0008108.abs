Title: Non-commutative Soliton Scattering
Authors: Ulf Lindstrom and Martin Rocek and Rikard von Unge
Abstract: We study solitons in three dimensional non-commutative scalar field theory at infinite non-commutativity parameter. We find the metric on the relative moduli space of all solitons of the form |n><n| and show that it is Kahler. We then find the geodesics of this metric and study the scattering of these solitons. In particular we find that the scattering is generally right angle for small values of the impact parameter. We can understand this behaviour in terms of a conical singularity at the origin of moduli space.
