Title: D-Branes and Scheme Theory
Authors: Tomas Gomez and Eric R. Sharpe
Abstract: In this highly speculative note we conjecture that it may be possible to understand features of coincident D-branes, such as the appearance of enhanced non-abelian gauge symmetry, in a purely geometric fashion, using a form of geometry known as scheme theory. We give a very brief introduction to some relevant ideas from scheme theory, and point out how these ideas work in special cases.
