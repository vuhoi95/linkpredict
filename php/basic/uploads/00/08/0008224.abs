Title: Functional Relation of interquark potential with interquark distance
Authors: D. K. Park and H. J. W. MÃ¼ller-Kirsten and A. V. Shurgaia
Abstract: The functional relation between interquark potential and interquark distance is explicitly derived by considering the Nambu--Goto action in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background. It is also shown that a similar relation holds in a general background. The implications of this relation for confinement are briefly discussed.
