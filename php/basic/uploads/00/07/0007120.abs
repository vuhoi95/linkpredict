Title: A supersymmetric Type IIB Randall-Sundrum realization
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu and K. S. Stelle
Abstract: We show that an earlier domain wall solution of type IIB supergravity provides a supersymmetric realization of the Randall-Sundrum brane-world, and give its ten-dimensional interpretation in terms of IIB 3-branes. We also explain how previous no-go theorems are circumvented. In particular, whereas D=5 supergravity scalars have AdS_5 energy E_0 <= 4 and are unable to support a D=5 positive tension brane, our scalar has E_0=8, and is the breathing mode of the S^5 compactification. Another essential element of the construction is the implementation of a Z_2 symmetry by patching together compactifications with opposite signs for their 5-form field strengths. This is thus a IIB analogue of a previous D=5 3-brane realization of the Horava-Witten orbifold. A mode-locking phenomenon avoids the appearance of negative energy zero-modes in spite of the necessity of a D=10 negative tension brane-source.
