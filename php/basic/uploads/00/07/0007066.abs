Title: Extended Self-Dual Configurations as Stable Exact Solutions in  Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: J. Bellorin and A. Restuccia
Abstract: A class of exact solutions to the Born-Infeld field equations, over manifolds of any even dimension, is constructed. They are an extension of the self-dual configurations. They are local minima of the action for riemannian base manifolds and local minima of the Hamiltonian for pseudo-riemannian ones. A general explicit expression for the Born-Infeld determinant is obtained, for any dimension of space-time.
