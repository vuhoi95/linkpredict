Title: Backreaction and the Parametric Resonance of Cosmological Fluctuations
Authors: J. P. Zibin and R. Brandenberger and Douglas Scott
Abstract: We study the class of two-field inflationary Universe models \lambda\phi^4/4 + g^2\chi^2\phi^2/2, in which parametric resonance during the initial stages of reheating can lead to an exponential amplification of the amplitude of cosmological fluctuations. Employing both analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we determine the time at which backreaction of fluctuations on the background fields shuts off the exponential growth, making use of the Hartree approximation, and including scalar metric perturbations. For the case g^2/\lambda=2, we find that the amplitude of fluctuations after preheating will exceed the observational upper bound independent of the value of \lambda, unless the duration of inflation is very long. Cosmological fluctuations are acceptably small for g^2/\lambda>=8. We also find that the addition of \chi-field self-interaction can limit the growth of fluctuations, and in the negative-coupling case the system can become effectively single-field, removing the resonance.
