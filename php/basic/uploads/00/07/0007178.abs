Abstract: Recently, a scenario has been proposed in which the gravitational scale could be as low as the TeV scale, and extra dimensions could be large and detectable at the electroweak scale. Although supersymmetry is not a requirement of this scenario, it is nevertheless true that its best-motivated realizations arise in supersymmetric theories (like M theory). We argue here that supersymmetry can have robust, and in some instances fatal, implications for the expected experimental signature for TeV-scale gravity. The signature of the supersymmetric version of the scenario differs most dramatically from what has been considered in the literature because mass splittings within the gravity supermultiplet in these models are extremely small, implying in particular the existence of a very light spin-one superpartner for the graviton. We compute the implications of this graviphoton, and show that it can acquire dimension-four couplings to ordinary matter which can strongly conflict with supernova bounds.
