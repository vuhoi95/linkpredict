Title: Logarithmic operators in the SL(2,R) WZNW model
Authors: A. Nichols and Sanjay
Abstract: We find some exact solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for the four point correlation functions that occur in the SL(2,R) WZNW model. They exhibit logarithmic behaviour in both the Kac-Moody and Virasoro parts. We discuss their implication for the operator product expansion. We also observe the appearance of several symmetries of the correlation functions.
