Title: Heat asymptotics with spectral boundary conditions II
Authors: P. B. Gilkey and K. Kirsten
Abstract: Let $P$ be an operator of Dirac type on a compact Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary. We impose spectral boundary conditions and study the asymptotics of the heat trace of the associated operator of Laplace type.
