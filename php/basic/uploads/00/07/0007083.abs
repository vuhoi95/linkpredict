Title: Brane Potentials and Moduli Spaces
Authors: George Papadopoulos and David Tong
Abstract: It is shown that the supergravity moduli spaces of D1-D5 and D2-D6 brane systems coincide with those of the Coulomb branches of the associated non-abelian gauge theories. We further discuss situations in which worldvolume brane actions include a potential term generated by probing certain supergravity backgrounds. We find that in many cases, the appearance of the potential is due to the application of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We give some examples and discuss the existence of novel supersymmetric brane configurations.
