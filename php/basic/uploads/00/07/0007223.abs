Title: Field correlators in QCD. Theory and applications
Authors: A. Di Giacomo and H. G. Dosch and V. I. Shevchenko and Yu. A. Simonov
Abstract: This review is aimed to demonstrate the basics and use of formalism of gauge-invariant nonlocal correlators in nonabelian gauge theories. Many phenomenologically interesting nonperturbative aspects of gluodynamics and QCD can be described in terms of correlators of the nonabelian field strength tensors. It is explained how the properties of correlator ensemble encode the structure of QCD vacuum and determine different nonperturbative observables. It is argued that in gluodynamics and QCD the dominant role is played by the lowest nontrivial two-point correlator (Gaussian dominance). Lattice measurements of field correlators are discussed. Important for the formalism theoretical tools, such as nonabelian Stokes theorem, background perturbation theory, cluster expansion, as well as phenomenological applications to the heavy quarkonium dynamics and QCD phase transition are reviewed.
