Title: Magnetic monopoles, alive
Authors: M. N. Chernodub and F. V. Gubarev and M. I. Polikarpov and V. I. Zakharov
Abstract: We review recent developments in understanding the physics of the magnetic monopoles in unbroken non-Abelian gauge theories. Since numerical data on the monopoles are accumulated in lattice simulations, the continuum theory is understood as the limiting case of the lattice formulation. In this review, written for a memorial volume dedicated to the memory of Academician A.B. Migdal, we emphasize physical effects related to the monopoles. In particular, we discuss the monopole-antimonopole potential at short and larger distances as well as a dual formulation of the gluodynamics, relevant to the physics of the confinement.
