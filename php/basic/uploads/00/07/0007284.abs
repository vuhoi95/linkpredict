Title: The 2+1 Dimensional NJL Model at Finite Temperature
Authors: Thomas Appelquist and Myck Schwetz
Abstract: We decribe properties of 2+1-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models at finite-temperature, beginning with the model with a discrete chiral symmetry. We then consider the model with a continuous $U(1) \times U(1)$ chiral symmetry, describing the restoration of the symmetry at finite temperature. In each case, we compute the free energy and comment on a recently proposed constraint based upon it. We conclude with a brief discussion of NJL models with larger chiral symmetries.
