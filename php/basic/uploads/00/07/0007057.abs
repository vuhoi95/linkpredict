Title: Testing Lorentz invariance violations in the tritium beta-decay anomaly
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes
Abstract: We consider a Lorentz non-invariant dispersion relation for the neutrino, which would produce unexpected effects with neutrinos of few eV, exactly where the tritium beta-decay anomaly is found. We use this anomaly to put bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance. We discuss other consequences of this non-invariant dispersion relation in neutrino experiments and high-energy cosmic-ray physics.
