Title: Fractional Supersymmetry through Generalized Anyonic algebra
Authors: J. Douari and Y. Hassouni
Abstract: The construction of anyonic operators and algebra is generalized by using quons operators. Therefore, the particular versionof fractional supersymmetry is constructed on the two-dimensional lattice by associating two generalized anyons of different kinds. The fractional supersymmetry Hamiltonian operator is obtained on the two-dimensional lattice and the quantum algebra $U_{q}(sl_{2})$ is realized.
