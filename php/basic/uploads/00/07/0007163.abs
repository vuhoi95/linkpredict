Title: The dynamics of zeros of the finite-gap solutions to the Schrodinger  equation
Authors: A. Akhmetshin and Y. Volvovsky
Abstract: Following the recent paper by J. F. van Diejen and H. Puschmann we investigate the behavior of zeros of the finite-gap solutions to the Schrodinger equation. As a result, a new system of particles on a punctured Riemann surface is constructed. It is shown to be Hamiltonian and integrable.
