Title: Absence of Bose-Einstein condensation with a uniform field and contact  interaction
Authors: Roberto Soldati and Alberto Zannoni
Abstract: The behavior of a Bose-Einstein ideal gas of particles in a three dimensional space in the presence of a uniform field, such as gravity, and of contact interaction, describing the presence of one impurity, is investigated. It is shown that Bose-Einstein condensation can not occur.
