Title: Conformal Sigma Models for a Class of $T^{p,q}$ Spaces
Authors: L. A. Pando Zayas and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider a 2-d conformal theory based on (G x G')/ H coset sigma model introduced by Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev. It is shown that in the case of {SU(2) x SU(2)}/ U(1) the metric of the corresponding background is of T^{p,q} coset space form (but is not an Einstein one). Similar interpretation is possible for the Lorentzian coset space W_{4,2}= {SL(2,R) x SL(2,R)}/U(1). The resulting 10-d homogeneous space metric on W_{4,2} x T^{p,q} supplemented with 2-form field gives a critical NS-NS superstring background with conformal sigma model interpretation.
