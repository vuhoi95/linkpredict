Title: Comment on Ambiguities in the Holographic Weyl Anomaly
Authors: M. Fukuma and T. Sakai
Abstract: We consider possible ambiguities in the holographic Weyl anomaly that are caused by local terms in the flow equation. We point out that such ambiguities actually do not give physically meaningful contributions to the Weyl anomaly.
