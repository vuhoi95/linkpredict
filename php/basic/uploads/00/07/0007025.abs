Title: Higgs mechanism in the Randall-Sundrum model
Authors: A. Flachi and D. J. Toms
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction of a bulk scalar field in the Randall-Sundrum model. By allowing the scalar field to be non-minimally coupled to the spacetime curvature we show that it is possible to generate spontaneous symmetry breaking on the brane.
