Title: Can We Live on the Brane in Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter Black Hole?
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: The model of d5 higher derivative (HD) gravity admitting Schwarzschild--anti de Sitter Black Hole (S-AdS BH) as exact solution is considered. The surface counterterms are added to the complete action, they are fixed by the condition of finiteness of bulk AdS spacetime when brane goes to infinity. As a result the brane (observable Universe) is defined dynamically in terms of d5 theory parameters (brane tension is fixed). Brane radius is always bigger than horizon radius and the 4d Universe itself could be static or inflationary. Natural ganeralization of this model gives warped compactification (with dynamically generated brane) in the next-to-leading order of AdS/CFT correspondence.
