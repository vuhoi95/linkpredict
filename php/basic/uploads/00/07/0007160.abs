Title: Moyal Deformation, Seiberg-Witten-Map, and Integrable Models
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: A covariant formalism for Moyal deformations of gauge theory and differential equations which determine Seiberg-Witten maps is presented. Replacing the ordinary product of functions by the noncommutative Moyal product, noncommutative versions of integrable models can be constructed. We explore how a Seiberg-Witten map acts in such a framework. As a specific example, we consider a noncommutative extension of the principal chiral model.
