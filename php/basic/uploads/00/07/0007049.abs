Title: Hidden Symmetries of the Open N=2 String
Authors: Tatiana A. Ivanova and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: It is known for ten years that self-dual Yang-Mills theory is the effective field theory of the open N=2 string in 2+2 dimensional spacetime. We uncover an infinite set of abelian rigid string symmetries, corresponding to the symmetries and integrable hierarchy of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The twistor description of the latter naturally connects with the BRST approach to string quantization, providing an interpretation of the picture phenomenon in terms of the moduli space of string backgrounds.
