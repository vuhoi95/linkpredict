Abstract: We study backreaction effects in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The backreaction comes from an $R^2$ term which is a part of the one-loop effective action arising from massive scalar field quantization in a certain approximation. The peculiarity of this term is that it does not contribute to the Hawking radiation of the classical black hole solution of the field equations. In the static case we examine the horizon and the physical singularity of the new black hole solutions. Studying the possibility of time dependence we see the generation of a new singularity. The particular solution found still has the structure of a black hole, indicating that non-thermal effects cannot lead, at least in this approximation, to black hole evaporation.
