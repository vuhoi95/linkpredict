Title: Yang-Baxter Equation on Two-Dimensional Lattice and Some Infinite  Dimensional Algebras
Authors: M. Daoud and J. Douari and Y. Hassouni
Abstract: We show that the Yang-Baxter equation is equivalent to the associativity of the algebra generated by non-commuting link operators. Starting from these link operators we build out the (FFZ) algebras, the $s\ell_q (2)$ is derived by considering a special combination of the generators of (FFZ) algebra.
