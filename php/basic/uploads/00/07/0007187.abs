Abstract: Dynamical R-matrix relations are derived for the group-valued chiral vertex operators in the SU(n) WZNW model from the KZ equation for a general four-point function including two step operators. They fit the exchange relations for the U_q(sl_n) covariant quantum matrix derived previously by solving the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation. As a byproduct, we extend the regular basis introduced earlier for SU(2) chiral fields to SU(n) step operators and display the corresponding triangular matrix representation of the braid group.
