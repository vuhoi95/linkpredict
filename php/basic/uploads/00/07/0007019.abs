Title: Analyzing the 't Hooft Model on an x+ - p+ Lattice
Authors: Joel S. Rozowsky and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: We study the 't Hooft model (large N_c QCD in 2 space-time dimensions) using an improved approach to digitizing the sum of gauge theory Feynman diagrams based on light-cone gauge A+=0 and discretized p+ and ix+. Our purpose is to test the new formalism in a solvable case, with the hope to gain some insight into how it might be usefully applied to the physically interesting case of 4 dimensional QCD.
