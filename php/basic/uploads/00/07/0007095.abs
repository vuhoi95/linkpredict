Title: On Discrete Symmetries in su(2) and su(3) Affine Theories and Related  Graphs
Authors: S. Lienart and P. Ruelle and O. Verhoeven
Abstract: We classify the possible finite symmetries of conformal field theories with an affine Lie algebra su(2) and su(3), and discuss the results from the perspective of the graphs associated with the modular invariants. The highlights of the analysis are first, that the symmetries we found in either case are matched by the graph data in a perfect way in the case of su(2), but in a looser way for su(3), and second, that some of the graphs lead naturally to projective representations, both in su(2) and in su(3).
