Title: Supergravity and Light-Like Non-commutativity
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Yaron Oz and Jorge G. Russo
Abstract: We construct dual supergravity descriptions of field theories and little string theories with light-like non-commutativity. The field theories are realized on the world-volume of Dp branes with light-like NS $B$ field and M5 branes with light-like $C$ field. The little string theories are realized on the world-volume of NS5 branes with light-like RR $A$ fields. The supergravity backgrounds are closely related to the $A=0,B=0,C=0$ backgrounds. We discuss the implications of these results. We also construct dual supergravity descriptions of ODp theories realized on the worldvolume of NS5 branes with RR backgrounds.
