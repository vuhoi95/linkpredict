Title: Center vortex model for the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theory
Authors: M. Engelhardt and M. Faber and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: A model for the infrared sector of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, based on magnetic vortices represented by (closed) random surfaces, is presented. The random surfaces, governed by an action penalizing curvature, are investigated using Monte Carlo methods on a hypercubic lattice. A low-temperature confining phase and a high-temperature deconfined phase are generated by this simple dynamics. After fixing the parameters of the model such as to reproduce the relation between deconfinement temperature and zero-temperature string tension found in lattice Yang-Mills theory, a surprisingly accurate prediction of the spatial string tension in the deconfined phase results. Furthermore, the Pontryagin index associated with the lattice random surfaces of the model is constructed. This allows to also predict the topological susceptibility; the result is compatible with measurements in lattice Yang-Mills theory. Thus, for the first time an effective model description of the infrared sector emerges which simultaneously and consistently reproduces both confinement and the topological aspects of Yang-Mills theory within a unified framework. Further details can be found in hep-lat/9912003 and hep-lat/0004013, both to appear in Nucl. Phys. B.
