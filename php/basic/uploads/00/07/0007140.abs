Title: The CP(n) Model on Noncommutative Plane
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Kimyeong Lee and Hyun Seok Yang
Abstract: We construct the consistent CP(n) model on noncommutative plane. The Bogomolny bound on the energy is saturated by (anti-)self-dual solitons with integer topological charge, which is independent of their scaling and orientation. This integer quantization is satisfied for our general solutions, which turns out regular everywhere. We discuss the possible implication of our result to the instanton physics in Yang-Mills theories on noncommutative R^4.
