Abstract: The scattering and bound states of the many-body systems, related to the short-range Dyson model, are studied. First, we show that the scattering states can be realized as coherent states and the scattering Hamiltonian can be connected to a free system. Unlike the closely related Calogero-Moser model, only a part of the partial waves acquire energy independent phase shifts, after scattering. The cause of the same is traced to the reduction in the degeneracies. The bound state Hamiltonian for the full-line problem is also studied and the relationship of its Hilbert space with that of the decoupled oscillators elucidated. Finally, we analyze the related models on circle and construct a part of the excitation spectrum through symmetry arguments.
