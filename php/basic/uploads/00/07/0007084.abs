Title: Quasi-normal modes of AdS black holes : A superpotential approach
Authors: T. R. Govindarajan and V. Suneeta
Abstract: A novel method, based on superpotentials is proposed for obtaining the quasi-normal modes of anti-de Sitter black holes. This is inspired by the case of the three-dimensional BTZ black hole, where the quasi-normal modes can be obtained exactly and are proportional to the surface gravity. Using this approach, the quasi-normal modes of the five dimensional Schwarzschild anti-deSitter black hole are computed numerically. The modes again seem to be proportional to the surface gravity for very small and very large black holes. They reflect the well-known instability of small black holes in anti-deSitter space.
