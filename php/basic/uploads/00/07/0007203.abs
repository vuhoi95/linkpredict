Title: Black holes in the brane world:Time symmetric initial data
Authors: Tetsuya Shiromizu and Masaru Shibata
Abstract: We numerically construct time-symmetric initial data sets of a black hole in the Randall-Sundrum brane world model, assuming that the black hole is spherical on the brane. We find that the apparent horizon is cigar-shaped in the 5D spacetime.
