Title: On the Fairlie's Moyal formulation of M(atrix)- theory
Authors: M. Hssaini and M. B. Sedra and M. Bennai and B. Maroufi
Abstract: Starting from the Moyal formulation of M-theory in the large N-limit, we propose to reexamine the associated membrane equations of motion in 10 dimensions formulated in terms of Poisson bracket. Among the results obtained, we rewrite the coupled first order Nahm's equations into a simple form leading in turn to their systematic relation with $SU(\infty)$ Yang Mills equations of motion. The former are interpreted as the vanishing condition of some conserved currents which we propose. We develop also an algebraic analysis in which an ansatz is considered and find an explicit form for the membrane solution of our problem. Typical solutions known in literature can also emerge as special cases of the proposed solution
