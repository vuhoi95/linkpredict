Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence identifies the coordinates of the conformal boundary of anti-de Sitter space with the coordinates of the conformal field theory. We generalize this identification to theories formulated in superspace. As an application of our results, we study a class of Wilson loops in N=4 SYM theory. A gauge theory computation shows that the expectation values of these loops are invariant under a local kappa-symmetry, except at intersections. We identify this with the kappa-invariance of the associated string worldsheets in the corresponding bulk superspace.
