Title: PU(2) monopoles and links of top-level Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces
Authors: Paul M. N. Feehan and Thomas G. Leness
Abstract: This is the first of two articles in which we give a proof - for a broad class of four-manifolds - of Witten's conjecture that the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten series coincide, at least through terms of degree less than or equal to c-2, where c is a linear combination of the Euler characteristic and signature of the four-manifold. This article is a revision of sections 1-3 of an earlier version of the article dg-ga/9712005, now split into two parts, while a revision of sections 4-7 of that earlier version appears in a recently updated dg-ga/9712005. In the present article, we construct virtual normal bundles for the Seiberg-Witten strata of the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles and compute their Chern classes.
