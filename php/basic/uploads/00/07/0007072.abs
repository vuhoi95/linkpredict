Title: Orbifolds and Finite Group Representations
Authors: Li Chiang and Shi-shyr Roan
Abstract: We present our recent understanding on resolutions of Gorenstein orbifolds, which involves the finite group representation theory. We shall concern only the quotient singularity of hypersurface type. The abelian group $A_r(n)$ for $A$-type hypersurface quotient singularity of dimension $n$ is introduced. For $n=4$, the structure of Hilbert scheme of group orbits and crepant resolutions of $A_r(4)$-singularity are obtained. The flop procedure of 4-folds is explicitly constructed through the process.
