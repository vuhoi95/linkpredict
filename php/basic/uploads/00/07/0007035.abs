Title: Manifestly supersymmetric M-theory
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Ulf Gran and Mikkel Nielsen and Bengt EW Nilsson
Abstract: In this paper, the low-energy effective dynamics of M-theory, eleven-dimensional supergravity, is taken off-shell in a manifestly supersymmetric formulation. We show that a previously proposed relaxation of the superspace torsion constraints does indeed accommodate a current supermultiplet which lifts the equations of motion corresponding to the ordinary second order derivative supergravity lagrangian. Whether the auxiliary fields obtained this way can be used to construct an off-shell lagrangian is not yet known. We comment on the relation and application of this completely general formalism to higher-derivative (R^4) corrections. Some details of the calculation are saved for a later publication.
