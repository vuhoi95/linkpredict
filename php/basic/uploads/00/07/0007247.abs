Title: On noncommutative vacua and noncommutative solitons
Authors: A. S. Gorsky and Y. M. Makeenko and K. G. Selivanov
Abstract: We consider noncommutative theory of a compact scalar field. The recently discovered projector solitons are interpreted as classical vacua in the model considered. Localized solutions to the projector equation are pointed out and their brane interpretation is discussed. An example of the noncommutative soliton interpolating between such vacua is given. No strong noncommutativity limit is assumed.
