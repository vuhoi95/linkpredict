Title: Fuzzy Actions and their Continuum Limits
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and X. Martin and Denjoe O'Connor
Abstract: Previously matrix model actions for ``fuzzy'' fields have been proposed using non-commutative geometry. They retained ``topological'' properties extremely well, being capable of describing instantons, $\theta$--states, the chiral anomaly, and even chiral fermions with no ``doubling''. Here, we demonstrate that the standard scalar and spinor actions on a $d$--dimensional manifold are recovered from such actions in the limit of large matrices if their normalizations are correctly scaled as the limit is taken.
