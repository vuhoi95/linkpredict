Title: On the perturbative expansion of boundary reflection factors of the  supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model
Authors: M. Ablikim and E. Corrigan
Abstract: The supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model on a half-line with integrable boundary conditions is considered perturbatively to verify conjectured exact reflection factors to one loop order. Propagators for the boson and fermion fields restricted to a half-line contain several novel features and are developed as prerequisites for the calculations.
