Title: The Akulov-Volkov Lagrangian, Symmetry Currents and Spontaneously Broken  Extended Supersymmetry
Authors: T. E. Clark and S. T. Love
Abstract: A generalization of the Akulov-Volkov effective Lagrangian governing the self interactions of the Nambu-Goldstone fermions associated with spontaneously broken extended supersymmetry as well as their coupling to matter is presented and scrutinized. The resulting currents associated with R-symmetry, supersymmetry and space-time translations are constructed and seen to form a supermultiplet structure.
