Title: QCD Instantons and the Soft Pomeron
Authors: Dmitri E. Kharzeev and Yuri V. Kovchegov and Eugene Levin
Abstract: We study the role of semi-classical QCD vacuum solutions in high energy scattering by considering the instanton contribution to hadronic cross sections. We propose a new type of instanton-induced interactions (``instanton ladder'') that leads to the rising with energy hadronic cross section of Regge type (the Pomeron). We argue that this interaction may be responsible for the structure of the soft Pomeron. The intercept is calculated. It has a non-analytic dependence on the strong coupling constant, allowing a non-singular continuation into the non-perturbative region. We derive the Pomeron trajectory, which appears to be approximately linear in some range of (negative) momentum transfer t, but exhibits a curvature at small t. Possible role of instantons in multiparticle production is also discussed.
