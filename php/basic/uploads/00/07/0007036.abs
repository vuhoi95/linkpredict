Title: Superstring action in AdS_5 x S^5: kappa symmetry light cone gauge
Authors: R. R. Metsaev and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: As part of program to quantize superstrings in AdS_5 x S^5 background in light cone approach we find the explicit form of the corresponding Green-Schwarz action in fermionic light-cone kappa-symmetry gauge. The resulting action is quadratic and quartic in fermions. In the flat space limit it reduces to the standard light-cone Green-Schwarz action, and also has the correct superparticle limit. We discuss fixing the bosonic light-cone gauge and a reformulation of the action in terms of 2-d Dirac spinors.
