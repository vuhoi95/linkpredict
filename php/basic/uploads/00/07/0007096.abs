Title: RR charges of D2-branes in the WZW model
Authors: Anton Alekseev and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We consider the contribution of the B-field into the RR charge of a spherical D2-brane. Extending a recent analysis of Taylor, we show that the boundary and bulk contributions do not cancel in general. Instead, they add up to an integer as observed by Stanciu. The general formula is applied to compute the RR charges of spherical D-branes of the SU(2) WZW model at level k and it shows that these RR charges are only defined modulo k+2. We support this claim by studying bound state formation of D0-branes using boundary conformal field theory.
