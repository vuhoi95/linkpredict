Title: Noncommutative Korteweg-de-Vries Equation
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: We construct a deformation quantized version (ncKdV) of the KdV equation which possesses an infinite set of conserved densities. Solutions of the ncKdV are obtained from solutions of the KdV equation via a kind of Seiberg-Witten map. The ncKdV is related to a modified ncKdV equation by a noncommutative Miura transformation.
