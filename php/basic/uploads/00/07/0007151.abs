Title: Transition Temperature for Weakly Interacting Homogeneous Bose Gases
Authors: Frederico F. de Souza Cruz and Marcus B. Pinto and Rudnei O. Ramos
Abstract: We apply the non-perturbative optimized linear $\delta$ expansion method to the O(N) scalar field model in three-dimensions to determine the transition temperature of a dilute homogeneous Bose gas. Our results show that the shift of the transition temperature, $\Delta T_c/T_c$, of the interacting model, compared with the ideal gas transition temperature, really behaves as $\gamma a n^{1/3}$ where $a$ is the s-wave scattering length and $n$ is the number density. For $N= 2$ our calculations yield the value $\gamma= 3.059$.
