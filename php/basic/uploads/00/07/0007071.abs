Title: Neutrino Zero Modes on Electroweak Strings
Authors: Glenn D. Starkman and Dejan Stojkovic and Tanmay Vachaspati
Abstract: Zero modes of massive standard model fermions have been found on electroweak Z-strings. A zero mode solution for a massless left-handed neutrino is also known, but was thought to be non-normalizable. Here we show that although this mode is not discretely normalizable, it is delta-function normalizable and the correct interpretation of this solution is within the framework of the continuum spectrum. We also analyze an extension of the standard model including right-handed neutrinos in which neutrinos have Dirac masses, arising from a Yukawa coupling to the usual SU(2) Higgs doublet, and right-handed Majorana masses. The Majorana mass terms are taken to be spatially homogeneous and are presumed to arise from the vacuum expectation value of some field acquired in a phase transition well above the electroweak phase transition. The resulting zero energy equations have a discrete zero mode.
