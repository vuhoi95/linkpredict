Title: The critical behavior of frustrated spin models with noncollinear order
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto and Paolo Rossi and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of frustrated spin models with noncollinear order, including stacked triangular antiferromagnets and helimagnets. For this purpose we compute the field-theoretic expansions at fixed dimension to six loops and determine their large-order behavior. For the physically relevant cases of two and three components, we show the existence of a new stable fixed point that corresponds to the conjectured chiral universality class. This contradicts previous three-loop field-theoretical results but is in agreement with experiments.
