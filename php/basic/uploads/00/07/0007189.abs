Title: Fractional and Integer Charges from Levinson's Theorem
Authors: E. Farhi and N. Graham and R. L. Jaffe and H. Weigel
Abstract: We compute fractional and integer fermion quantum numbers of static background field configurations using phase shifts and Levinson's theorem. By extending fermionic scattering theory to arbitrary dimensions, we implement dimensional regularization in a 1+1 dimensional gauge theory. We demonstrate that this regularization procedure automatically eliminates the anomaly in the vector current that a naive regulator would produce. We also apply these techniques to bag models in one and three dimensions.
