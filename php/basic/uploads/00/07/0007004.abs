Title: On gauge invariant regularization of fermion currents
Authors: R. E. Gamboa Saravi and M. A. Muschietti and J. E. Solomin
Abstract: We compare Schwinger and complex powers methods to construct regularized fermion currents. We show that although both of them are gauge invariant they not always yield the same result.
