Title: Quantum corrections for (anti)-evaporating black hole
Authors: Maja Buric and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the quantum correction for Schwarzschild black hole in the Unruh state in the framework of spherically symmetric gravity (SSG) model. SSG is a two-dimensional dilaton model which is obtained by spherically symmetric reduction from the four-dimensional theory. We find the one-loop geometry of the (anti)-evaporating black hole and corrections for mass, entropy and apparent horizon.
