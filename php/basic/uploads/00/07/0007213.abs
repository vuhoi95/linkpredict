Title: Flux, Supersymmetry and M theory on 7-manifolds
Authors: B. S. Acharya and B. Spence
Abstract: Various aspects of low energy M theory compactified to four dimensions are considered. If the supersymmetry parameter is parallel in the unwarped metric, then supersymmetry requires that the warp factor is trivial, the background four-form field strength is zero and that the internal 7-manifold has $G_2$ holonomy (we assume the absence of boundaries and other impurities). A proposal of Gukov - extended here to include M2-brane domain walls - for the superpotential of the compactified theory is shown to yield the same result. Finally, we make some speculative remarks concerning higher derivative corrections and supersymmetry breaking.
