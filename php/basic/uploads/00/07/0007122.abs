Title: Deformed fields and Moyal construction of deformed super Virasoro  algebra
Authors: R. Kemmoku and H. T. Sato
Abstract: Studied is the deformation of super Virasoro algebra proposed by Belov and Chaltikhian. Starting from abstract realizations in terms of the FFZ type generators, various connections of them to other realizations are shown, especially to deformed field representations, whose bosonic part generator is recently reported as a deformed string theory on a noncommutative world-sheet. The deformed Virasoro generators can also be expressed in terms of ordinary free fields in a highly nontrivial way.
