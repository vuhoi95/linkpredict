Title: D=4, N=1 orientifolds with vector structure
Authors: Matthias Klein and Raul Rabadan
Abstract: We construct compact type IIB orientifolds with discrete groups Z_4, Z_6, Z_6', Z_8, Z_12 and Z_12'. These models are N=1 supersymmetric in D=4 and have vector structure. The possibility of having vector structure in Z_N orientifolds with even N arises due to an alternative Omega-projection in the twisted sectors. Some of the models without vector structure are known to be inconsistent because of uncancelled tadpoles. We show that vector structure leads to a sign flip in the twisted Klein bottle contribution. As a consequence, all the tadpoles can be cancelled by introducing D9-branes and D5-branes.
