Title: On Sub-Millimeter Forces From Extra Dimensions
Authors: Gia Dvali and Gregory Gabadadze and Massimo Porrati
Abstract: We show that in theories with large extra dimensions forces mediated by a bulk dilaton and bulk gauge fields may be parametrically (exponentially) weaker than gravity due to the suppression of their wave-functions on a brane. This is the case when dilaton gets stabilized by certain strongly coupled dynamics on the brane, or the bulk gauge symmetries are spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism on the worldvolume. At distances smaller than the size of a largest extra dimension these particles produce the force-law which decreases with distance faster than high-dimensional gravity. For a millimeter size extra dimensions predicted deviations are in the range which may be detected in sub-millimeter gravity measurements.
