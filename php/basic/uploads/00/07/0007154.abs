Title: Ramond-Ramond Flux Stabilization of D-Branes
Authors: Jacek Pawelczyk and Soo-Jong Rey
Abstract: In AdS_n x S^m threaded by N-units of Ramond-Ramond flux, the dynamics of a Dm-brane wrapped on S^{m-1} embedded in S^m is investigated. Under the condition that flux of the dual gauge field on the D-brane worldvolume is quantized integrally, It is found that the wrapped D-brane is stable both locally and globally and, on AdS_n, behaves effectively as a fundamental string. It is also claimed that the semi-infinite partially wrapped D-brane `lasso' around the S^m.
