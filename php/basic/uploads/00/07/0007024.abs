Title: Noncommutative Compactifications of Type I Strings on Tori with Magnetic  Background Flux
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Lars Goerlich and Boris Kors and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We construct six- and four-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the Type I string with magnetic flux on the D-branes. The open strings in this background probe a noncommutative internal geometry. Phenomenologically appealing features such as chiral fermions and supersymmetry breaking in the gauge sector are naturally realized by these vacua. We investigate the spectra of such noncommutative string compactifications and in a bottom-up approach discuss the possibility to obtain the standard or some GUT like model.
