Title: Fusion in coset CFT from admissible singular-vector decoupling
Authors: P. Mathieu and J. Rasmussen and M. A. Walton
Abstract: Fusion rules for Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models at fractional level can be defined in two ways, with distinct results. The Verlinde formula yields fusion coefficients that can be negative. These signs cancel in coset fusion rules, however. On the other hand, the fusion coefficients calculated from decoupling of singular vectors are non-negative. They produce incorrect coset fusion rules, however, when factorisation is assumed. Here we give two prescriptions that yield the correct coset fusion rules from those found for the WZW models by the decoupling method. We restrict to the Virasoro minimal models for simplicity, and because decoupling results are only complete in the $\su(2)$ case.
