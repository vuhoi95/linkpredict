Title: Polarization-free generators for the Belavin model
Authors: T. -D. Albert and K. Ruhlig
Abstract: Employing a change of basis, the so-called factorizing Drinfel'd twist, we construct polarization-free and completely symmetric creation operators for a face type model equivalent to the Belavin model. A resolution of the nested structure of the Bethevectors is achieved.
