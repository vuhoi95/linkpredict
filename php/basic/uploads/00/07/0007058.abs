Title: Conformal superfields and BPS states in AdS_4/7 geometries
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We carry out a general analysis of the representations of the superconformal algebras OSp(8/4,R) and OSp(8*/2N) in terms of harmonic superspace. We present a construction of their highest-weight UIR's by multiplication of the different types of massless conformal superfields ("supersingletons"). Particular attention is paid to the so-called "short multiplets". Representations undergoing shortening have "protected dimension" and may correspond to BPS states in the dual supergravity theory in anti-de Sitter space. These results are relevant for the classification of multitrace operators in boundary conformally invariant theories as well as for the classification of AdS black holes preserving different fractions of supersymmetry.
