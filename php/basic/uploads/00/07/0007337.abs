Title: Supersymmetric Quantum Corrections and Poisson-Lie T-Duality
Authors: F. Assaoui and T. Lhallabi
Abstract: The quantum actions of the (4,4) supersymmetric non-linear sigma model and its dual in the Abelian case are constructed by using the background superfield method. The propagators of the quantum superfield and its dual and the gauge fixing actions of the original and dual (4,4) supersymmetric sigma models are determined. On the other hand, the BRST transformations are used to obtain the quantum dual action of the (4,4) supersymmetric non-linear sigma model in the sense of Poisson-Lie T-duality
