Abstract: Two new families of T-Dual integrable models of dyonic type are constructed. They represent specific $A_n^{(1)}$ singular Non-Abelian Affine Toda models having U(1) global symmetry. Their 1-soliton spectrum contains both neutral and U(1) charged topological solitons sharing the main properties of 4-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs monopoles and dyons. The semiclassical quantization of these solutions as well as the exact counterterms and the coupling constant renormalization are studied.
