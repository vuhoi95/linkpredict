Title: BPS Domain Walls in Models with Flat Directions
Authors: Masashi Naganuma and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We consider BPS domain walls in the four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric models with continuous global symmetry. Since the BPS equation is covariant under the global transformation, the solutions of the BPS walls also have the global symmetry. The moduli space of the supersymmetric vacua in such models have non-compact flat directions, and the complex BPS walls interpolating between two disjoint flat directions can exist. We examine this possibility in two models with global O(2) symmetry, and construct the solution of such BPS walls.
