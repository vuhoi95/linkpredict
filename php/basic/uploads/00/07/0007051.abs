Title: Black Hole Thermodynamics from Calculations in Strongly-Coupled Gauge  Theory
Authors: Daniel Kabat and Gilad Lifschytz and David A. Lowe
Abstract: We develop an approximation scheme for the quantum mechanics of N D0-branes at finite temperature in the 't Hooft large-N limit. The entropy of the quantum mechanics calculated using this approximation agrees well with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a ten-dimensional non-extremal black hole with 0-brane charge. This result is in accord with the duality conjectured by Itzhaki, Maldacena, Sonnenschein and Yankielowicz. Our approximation scheme provides a model for the density matrix which describes a black hole in the strongly-coupled quantum mechanics.
