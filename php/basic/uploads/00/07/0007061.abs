Title: Cubic couplings in D=6 N=4b supergravity on AdS_3\times S^3
Authors: G. Arutyunov and A. Pankiewicz and S. Theisen
Abstract: We determine the AdS exchange diagrams needed for the computation of 4--point functions of chiral primary operators in the SCFT_2 dual to the D=6 N=4b supergravity on the AdS_3\times S^3 background and compute the corresponding cubic couplings. We also address the issue of consistent truncation.
