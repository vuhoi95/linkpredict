Title: Supersymmetric Intersecting Domain Walls in Massive Hyper-Kahler Sigma  Models
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and David Tong and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The general scalar potential of D-dimensional massive sigma-models with eight supersymmetries is found for $D=3,4$. These sigma models typically admit 1/2 supersymmetric domain wall solutions and we find, for a particular hyper-K\"ahler target, exact 1/4 supersymmetric static solutions representing a non-trivial intersection of two domain walls. We also show that the intersecting domain walls can carry Noether charge while preserving 1/4 supersymmetry. We briefly discuss an application to the D1-D5 brane system.
