Title: Duality Between String Junctions and D-Branes on Del Pezzo Surfaces
Authors: Kenji Mohri and Yukiko Ohtake and Sung-Kil Yang
Abstract: We revisit local mirror symmetry associated with del Pezzo surfaces in Calabi-Yau threefolds in view of five-dimensional N=1 E_N theories compactified on a circle. The mirror partner of singular Calabi-Yau with a shrinking del Pezzo four-cycle is described as the affine 7-brane backgrounds probed by a D3-brane. Evaluating the mirror map and the BPS central charge we relate junction charges to RR charges of D-branes wrapped on del Pezzo surfaces. This enables us to determine how the string junctions are mapped to D-branes on del Pezzo surfaces.
