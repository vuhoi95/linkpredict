Title: Integral representations for the eigenfunctions of quantum open and  periodic Toda chains from QISM formalism
Authors: S. Kharchev and D. Lebedev
Abstract: The integral representations for the eigenfunctions of $N$ particle quantum open and periodic Toda chains are constructed in the framework of Quantum Inverse Scattering Method (QISM). Both periodic and open $N$-particle solutions have essentially the same structure being written as a generalized Fourier transform over the eigenfunctions of the $N-1$ particle open Toda chain with the kernels satisfying to the Baxter equations of the second and first order respectively. In the latter case this leads to recurrent relations which result to representation of the Mellin-Barnes type for solutions of an open chain. As byproduct, we obtain the Gindikin-Karpelevich formula for the Harish-Chandra function in the case of $GL(N,\RR)$ group.
