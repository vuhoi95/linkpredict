Title: On a class of bounded quantum fields
Authors: M. Grott and K. -H. Rehren
Abstract: Local quantum fields in 1+1 dimensions can have bounded field operators. The class of such fields which in addition obey Huygens' principle (time-like commutativity) and conformal covariance, is completely determined.
