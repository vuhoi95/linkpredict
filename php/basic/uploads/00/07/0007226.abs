Title: Form Factors for Quasi-particles in c=1 Conformal Field Theory
Authors: R. A. J. van Elburg and K. Schoutens
Abstract: The non-Fermi liquid physics at the edge of fractional quantum Hall systems is described by specific chiral Conformal Field Theories with central charge c=1. The charged quasi-particles in these theories have fractional charge and obey a form of fractional statistics. In this paper we study form factors, which are matrix elements of physical (conformal) operators, evaluated in a quasi-particle basis that is organized according to the rules of fractional exclusion statistics. Using the systematics of Jack polynomials, we derive selection rules for a special class of form factors. We argue that finite temperature Green's functions can be evaluated via systematic form factor expansions, using form factors such as those computed in this paper and thermodynamic distribution functions for fractional exclusion statistics. We present a specific case study where we demonstrate that the form factor expansion shows a rapid convergence.
