Authors: Won Tae Kim and John J. Oh and Marie K. Oh and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We study brane-world black holes from Randall-Sundrum(RS) models in ($D+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The solutions are directly obtained by using a slightly modified RS metric ansatz in $D+1$ dimensions. The metric of the brane world can be described by the Schwarzschild solution promoted to the black cigar solution in $D+1$ dimensions, which is compatible with the recently suggested black cigar solution for D=4. Furthermore, we show that the Ricci flat condition for the brane can be easily derived from the effective gravity defined on the brane by using the RS dimensional reduction. Especially, it is shown that in two dimensions the effective gravity on the brane is described by the Polyakov action.
