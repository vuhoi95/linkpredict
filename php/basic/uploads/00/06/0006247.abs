Title: D-Branes on ALE Spaces and the ADE Classification of Conformal Field  Theories
Authors: W. Lerche and A. Lutken and C. Schweigert
Abstract: The spectrum of D2-branes wrapped on an ALE space of general ADE type is determined, by representing them as boundary states of N=2 superconformal minimal models. The stable quantum states have RR charges which precisely represent the gauge fields of the corresponding Lie algebra. This provides a simple and direct physical link between the ADE classification of N=2 superconformal field theories, and the corresponding root systems. An affine extension of this structure is also considered, whose boundary states represent the D2-branes plus additional D0-branes.
