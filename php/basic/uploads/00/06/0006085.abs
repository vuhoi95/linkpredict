Title: 1+1 Dimensional NCOS and its U(N) Gauge Theory Dual
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Juan Maldacena
Abstract: We study some aspects of open string theories on D-branes with critical electric fields. We show that the massless open string modes that move in the direction of the electric field decouple. In the 1+1 dimensional case the dual theory is U(N) SYM with electric flux, and the decoupling of massless open strings is dual to the decoupling of the U(1) degrees of freedom. We also show that, if the direction along the electric field is compact, then there are finite energy winding closed string modes. They are dual to Higgs branch excitations of the SYM theory, and their energetics works accordingly. These properties provide new non-trivial evidence for the duality.
