Title: Gravity in a Box
Authors: Joseph Lykken and Robert C. Myers and Jing Wang
Abstract: We consider a brane-world construction which incorporates a finite region of flat space, ``the box,'' surrounded by a region of anti-de Sitter space. This hybrid construction provides a framework which interpolates between the scenario proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, and that proposed by Randall and Sundrum. Within this composite framework, we investigate the effects of resonant modes on four-dimensional gravity. We also show that, on a probe brane in the anti-de Sitter region, there is enhanced production of on-shell nonresonant modes. We compare our model to some recent attempts to incorporate the Randall-Sundrum scenario into superstring theory.
