Title: Non-Abelian Magnetic Monopoles in a Background of Gravitation with  Fermions
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and Cintia G. Pinheiro and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study static solution configuration which describes the magnetic monopoles in a scenary where the gravitation is coupled with Higgs, Yang-Mills and fermions. We are looking for analysis of the energy functional and Bogomol'nyi equations. The Einstein equations now take into consideration the fermions' contribution for energy-momentum tensor. The interesting aspect here is to verify that the fermion field gives a contribution for non abelian magnetic field and for potential which minimise the energy functional.
