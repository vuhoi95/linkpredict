Title: Chiral Charged Fermions, One Dimensional Quantum Field Theory and Vertex  Algebra
Authors: Florin Constantinescu and Guenter Scharf
Abstract: We give an explicit $L^2$-representation of chiral charged fermions using the Hardy-Lebesgue octant decomposition. In the " pure" case such a representation was already used by M. Sato in holonomic field theory. We study both "pure" and " mixed" cases. In the compact case we rigorously define unsmeared chiral charged fermion operators inside the unit circle. Using chiral fermions we orient our findings towards a functional analytic study of vertex algebras as one dimensional quantum field theory.
