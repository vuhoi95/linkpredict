Abstract: We discuss the implications of multi-brane constructions involving combinations of positive and negative tension brane and show how anomalously light KK states emerge when negative tension ''-'' branes are sandwiched between ''+'' branes. We present a detailed study of a ''+--+'' brane assignment which interpolates between two models that have been previously proposed in which gravity is modified at large scales due to the anomalously light states. We show that it has the peculiar characteristic that gravity changes from four dimensional (4D) to 5D at large distances and returns to 4D at even larger scales. We also consider a crystalline universe which leads to a similar structure for gravity. The problems associated with intermediate negative tension branes are discussed and a possible resolution suggested.
