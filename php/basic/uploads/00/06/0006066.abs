Title: The dissipative quantum model of brain: how do memory localize in  correlated neuronal domains
Authors: E. Alfinito and G. Vitiello
Abstract: The mechanism of memory localization in extended domains is described in the framework of the parametric dissipative quantum model of brain. The size of the domains and the capability in memorizing depend on the number of links the system is able to establish with the external world.
