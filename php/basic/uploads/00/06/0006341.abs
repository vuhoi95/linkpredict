Title: Phase Transitions Driven by Vortices in 2D Superfluids and  Superconductors: From Kosterlitz-Thouless to 1st Order
Authors: G. Alvarez and H. Fort
Abstract: The Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson hamiltonian is studied for different values of the parameter $\lambda$ which multiplies the quartic term (it turns out that this is equivalent to consider different values of the coherence length $\xi$ in units of the lattice spacing $a$). It is observed that amplitude fluctuations can change dramatically the nature of the phase transition: for small values of $\lambda$ ($\xi/a > 0.7$), instead of the smooth Kosterlitz-Thouless transition there is a {\em first order} transition with a discontinuous jump in the vortex density $v$ and a larger non-universal drop in the helicity modulus. In particular, for $\lambda$ sufficiently small ($\xi/a \cong 1$), the density of bound pairs of vortex-antivortex below $T_c$ is so low that, $v$ drops to zero almost for all temperature $T<Tc$.
