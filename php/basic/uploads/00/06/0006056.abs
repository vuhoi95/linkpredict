Title: Clebsch (String) Parameterization of 3-Vectors and Their Actions
Authors: S. Deser and R. Jackiw and A. P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We discuss some properties of the intrinsically nonlinear Clebsch decomposition of a vector field into three scalars in d=3. In particular, we note and account for the incompleteness of this parameterization when attempting to use it in variational principles involving Maxwell and Chern-Simons actions. Similarities with string decomposition of metrics and their actions are also pointed out.
