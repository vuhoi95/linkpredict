Title: Infrared singularities in the renormalization group flow of Yang-Mills  theories in the axial gauge
Authors: Annamaria Panza and Roberto Soldati
Abstract: It is shown, by explicit calculation in the axial gauge, that the renormalization group flow for the Wilson loop in perturbation theory does exhibit singularities and consequently it can not eventually reproduce the gauge invariant result, when the infrared cut off is removed
