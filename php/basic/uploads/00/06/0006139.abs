Title: The Cosmological Constant Problem from a Brane-World Perspective
Authors: Stefan Forste and Zygmunt Lalak and St√©phane Lavignac and Hans Peter Nilles
Abstract: We point out several subtleties arising in brane-world scenarios of cosmological constant cancellation. We show that solutions with curvature singularities are inconsistent, unless the contribution to the effective four-dimentional cosmological constant of the physics that resolves the singularities is fine-tuned. This holds for both flat and curved branes. Irrespective of this problem, we then study an isolated class of flat solutions in models where a bulk scalar field with a vanishing potential couples to a 3-brane. We give an example where the introduction of a bulk scalar potential results in a nonzero cosmological constant. Finally we comment on the stability of classical solutions of the brane system with respect to quantum corrections.
