Title: Effective field theory of slowly-moving "extreme black holes"
Authors: Yoshitaka Degura and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We consider the non-relativistic effective field theory of ``extreme black holes'' in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with an arbitrary dilaton coupling. We investigate finite-temperature behavior of gas of ``extreme black holes'' using the effective theory. The total energy of the classical many-body system is also derived.
