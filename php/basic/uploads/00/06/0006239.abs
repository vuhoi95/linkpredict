Title: Noncommutative spheres and the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Mihail Mihailescu and Sanjaye Ramgoolam
Abstract: We present direct arguments for non-commutativity of spheres in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The discussion is based on results for the $S_N$ orbifold SCFT. Concentrating on three point correlations (at finite $N$) we exhibit a comparison with correlations on a non-commutative sphere. In this manner an essential signature of non-commutativity is identified giving further support for the original proposal of hep-th/9902059.
