Title: A new holographic entropy bound from quantum geometry
Authors: Saurya Das and Romesh K Kaul and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: A new entropy bound, tighter than the standard holographic bound due to Bekenstein, is derived for spacetimes with non-rotating isolated horizons, from the quantum geometry approach in which the horizon is described by the boundary degrees of freedom of a three dimensional Chern Simons theory.
