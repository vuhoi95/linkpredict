Title: Low-scale supergravity inflation with R-symmetry
Authors: G. German and A. de la Macorra and M. Mondragon
Abstract: We study a supergravity model of inflation with R-symmetry and a single scalar field, the inflaton, slowly rolling away from the origin. The scales of inflation can be as low as the supersymmetry breaking scale of 10^10 GeV or even the electroweak scale of 10^3 GeV which could be relevant in the context of theories with submillimiter dimensions. Exact analytical solutions are presented and a comparison with related models is given.
