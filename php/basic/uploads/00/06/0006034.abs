Title: An exceptional geometry for d=11 supergravity?
Authors: K. Koepsell and H. Nicolai and H. Samtleben
Abstract: We analyze the algebraic constraints of the generalized vielbein in SO(1,2) x SO(16) invariant d=11 supergravity, and show that the bosonic degrees of freedom of d=11 supergravity, which become the physical ones upon reduction to d=3, can be assembled into an E_8-valued vielbein already in eleven dimensions. A crucial role in the construction is played by the maximal nilpotent commuting subalgebra of E_8, of dimension 36, suggesting a partial unification of general coordinate and tensor gauge transformations.
