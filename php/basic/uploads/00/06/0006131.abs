Title: Black Hole Entropy in 1+1 Dimensions from a Quasi-Chern Simons term in a  Gravitational Background
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: We introduce a 'quasi-topological` term [1] in D=1+1 dimensions and the entropy for black holes is calculated [2]. The source of entropy in this case is justified by a non-null stress-energy tensor.
