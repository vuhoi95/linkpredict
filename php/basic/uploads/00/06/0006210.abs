Title: Excitations in Hot Non-Commutative Theories
Authors: Karl Landsteiner and Esperanza Lopez and Michel H. G. Tytgat
Abstract: We study the dispersion relation for scalar excitations in supersymmetric, non-commutative theories at finite temperature. In N=4 Yang-Mills the low momenta modes have superluminous group velocity. In the massless Wess-Zumino model the minimum of the dispersion relation is at non zero momentum for temperatures above T_0 ~ (g \theta)^(-1\2). We briefly comment on N=2 Yang-Mills at finite density.
