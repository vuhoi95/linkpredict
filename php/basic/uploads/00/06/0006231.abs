Title: Supergravity Tensor Calculus in 5D from 6D
Authors: T. Kugo and K. Ohashi
Abstract: Supergravity tensor calculus in five spacetime dimensions is derived by dimensional reduction from the d=6 superconformal tensor calculus. In particular, we obtain an off-shell hypermultiplet in 5D from the on-shell hypermultiplet in 6D. Our tensor calculus still retains the dilatation gauge symmetry so that it becomes a trivial gauge fixing to make the Einstein term canonical in a general matter-Yang-Mills-supergravity coupled system.
