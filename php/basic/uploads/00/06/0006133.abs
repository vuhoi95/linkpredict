Title: Analysis of Maxwell Equations in a Gravitational Field
Authors: Sortelano Araujo Diniz and Carlos Pinheiro and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: In a gravitational field, we analyze the Maxwell equations, the correponding electromagnetic wave and continuity equations. A particular solution for parellel electric and magnetic fields in a gravitational background is presented. These solutions also satisfy the free-wave equations and the phenomenology suggested by plasma physics.
