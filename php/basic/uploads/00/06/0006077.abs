Title: BPS Saturated Domain Walls along a Compact Dimension
Authors: R. Hofmann and T. ter Veldhuis
Abstract: Generalized Wess-Zumino models which admit topologically non-trivial BPS saturated configurations along one compact, spatial dimension are investigated in various dimensions of space-time. We show that, in a representative model and for sufficiently large circumference, there are BPS configurations along the compact dimension containing an arbitrary number of equidistant, well-separated domain walls. We analyze the spectrum of the bosonic and fermionic light and massless modes that are localized on these walls. The masses of the light modes are exponentially suppressed by the ratio of the distance between the walls and their width. States that are initially localized on one wall oscillate in time between all the walls. In (2+1) dimensions the ``chirality'' of localized, massless fermions is determined. In the (1+1)-dimensional case we show how the mass of certain classically BPS saturated solitons is lifted above the BPS bound by instanton tunneling.
