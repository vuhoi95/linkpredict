Title: Nonsingular deformations of singular compactifications, the cosmological  constant, and the hierarchy problem
Authors: Alan Chodos and Erich Poppitz and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We consider deformations of the singular "global cosmic string" compactifications, known to naturally generate exponentially large scales. The deformations are obtained by allowing a constant curvature metric on the brane and correspond to a choice of integration constant. We show that there exists a unique value of the integration constant that gives rise to a nonsingular solution. The metric on the brane is dS_4 with an exponentially small value of expansion parameter. We derive an upper bound on the brane cosmological constant. We find and investigate more general singular solutions---``dilatonic global string" compactifications---and show that they can have nonsingular deformations. We give an embedding of these solutions in type IIB supergravity. There is only one class of supersymmetry-preserving singular dilatonic solutions. We show that they do not have nonsingular deformations of the type considered here.
