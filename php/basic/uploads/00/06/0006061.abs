Title: A model for time-dependent cosmological constant
Authors: M. Novello and J. Barcelos-Neto and J. M. Salim
Abstract: We present a model for a spacetime dependent cosmological {\it constant}. We make a realization of this model based on a possible quantum aspects of the initial stage of the universe and relate the cosmological constant with the chiral anomaly.
