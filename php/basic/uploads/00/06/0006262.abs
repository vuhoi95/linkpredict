Title: Strongly-interacting fermions from a higher-dimensional unified gauge  theory
Authors: George Triantaphyllou and George Zoupanos
Abstract: The method of coset-space dimensional reduction is employed in order to proceed from a gauged E_8 * E_8' unified theory defined in 10 dimensions to 4 dimensions. The resulting theory comprises the Standard Model along with a strongly-interacting fermion sector which breaks the electroweak symmetry dynamically at the right scale.
