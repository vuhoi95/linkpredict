Title: Topological invariant variables in QCD
Authors: D. Blaschke and V. Pervushin and G. Roepke
Abstract: We show that the class of functions of topologically nontrivial gauge transformations in QCD includes a zero-mode of the Gauss law constraint. The equivalent unconstrained system compatible with Feynman's integral is derived in terms of topological invariant variables, where the zero-mode is identified with the winding number collective variable and leads to the dominance of the Wu-Yang monopole. Physical consequences of Feynman's path integral in terms of the topological invariant variables are studied.
