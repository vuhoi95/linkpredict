Title: Global calculus in BRST cohomology
Authors: G. Giachetta and L. Mangiarotti and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: The iterated BRST cohomology is studied by computing cohomology of the variational complex on the infinite order jet space of a smooth fibre bundle. This computation also provides a solution of the global inverse problem of the calculus of variations in Lagrangian field theory.
