Title: Fine-tuning and the Wilson renormalization group
Authors: M. Bonini and E. Tricarico
Abstract: We use the Wilson renormalization group (RG) formulation to solve the fine-tuning procedure needed in renormalization schemes breaking the gauge symmetry. To illustrate this method we systematically compute the non-invariant couplings of the ultraviolet action of the SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory at one-loop order.
