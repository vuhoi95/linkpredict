Title: Linearized Gravity about a Brane
Authors: H. Collins and B. Holdom
Abstract: We use the Israel condition to treat carefully the weak-field perturbations due to the presence of matter on a 3-brane embedded between two regions of anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with different curvature lengths. A four dimensional Newton's Law only emerges at distances that are large compared to the AdS lengths. When a scalar curvature is included in the brane action, however, it is possible to generate a four dimensional theory of gravity even when one or both of the AdS lengths is large compared to distances along the brane. In particular, we provide an example in which the AdS lengths can be larger than the millimeter experimental bound.
