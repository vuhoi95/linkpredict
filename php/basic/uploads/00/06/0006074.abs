Title: Baxter T-Q Equation for Shape Invariant Potentials. The Finite-Gap  Potentials Case
Authors: Ovidiu Lipan and Constantin Rasinariu
Abstract: The Darboux transformation applied recurrently on a Schroedinger operator generates what is called a {\em dressing chain}, or from a different point of view, a set of supersymmetric shape invariant potentials. The finite-gap potential theory is a special case of the chain. For the finite-gap case, the equations of the chain can be expressed as a time evolution of a Hamiltonian system. We apply Sklyanin's method of separation of variables to the chain. We show that the classical equation of the separation of variables is the Baxter T-Q relation after quantization.
