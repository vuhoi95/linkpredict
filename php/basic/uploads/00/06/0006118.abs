Title: Monopole supersymmetries and the Biedenharn operator
Authors: P. A. Horv√°thy and A. J. Macfarlane and J. -W. van Holten
Abstract: The hidden supersymmetry of the monopole found by De Jonghe et al. is generalized to a spin $\2$ particle in the combined field of a Dirac monopole plus a $\lambda^2/r^2$ potential [considered before by D'Hoker and Vinet], and related to the operator introduced by Biedenharn a long time ago in solving the Dirac-Coulomb problem. Explicit solutions are obtained by diagonalizing the Biedenharn operator
