Title: Compilation of relations for the antisymmetric tensors defined by the  Lie algebra cocycles of $su(n)$
Authors: J. A. de Azc√°rraga and A. J. Macfarlane
Abstract: This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive compilation of results, many new here, involving the invariant totally antisymmetric tensors (Omega tensors) which define the Lie algebra cohomology cocycles of $su(n)$, and that play an essential role in the optimal definition of Racah-Casimir operators of $su(n)$. Since the Omega tensors occur naturally within the algebra of totally antisymmetrised products of $\lambda$-matrices of $su(n)$, relations within this algebra are studied in detail, and then employed to provide a powerful means of deriving important Omega tensor/cocycle identities. The results include formulas for the squares of all the Omega tensors of $su(n)$. Various key derivations are given to illustrate the methods employed.
