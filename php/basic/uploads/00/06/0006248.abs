Title: Non local parity transformations and anomalies
Authors: M. L. Ciccolini and C. D. Fosco and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We present an alternative derivation of the parity anomaly for a massless Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions coupled to a gauge field. The anomaly functional, a Chern-Simons action for the gauge field, is obtained from the non-trivial Jacobian corresponding to a non local symmetry of the Pauli-Villars regularized action. That Jacobian is well-defined, finite, and yields the standard Chern-Simons term when the cutoff tends to infinity.
