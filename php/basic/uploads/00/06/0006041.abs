Title: Experimental Probes of Localized Gravity: On and Off the Wall
Authors: H. Davoudiasl and J. L. Hewett and T. G. Rizzo
Abstract: The phenomenology of the Randall-Sundrum model of localized gravity is analyzed in detail for the two scenarios where the Standard Model (SM) gauge and matter fields are either confined to a TeV scale 3-brane or may propagate in a slice of five dimensional anti-deSitter space. In the latter instance, we derive the interactions of the graviton, gauge, and fermion Kaluza-Klein (KK) states. The resulting phenomenological signatures are shown to be highly dependent on the value of the 5-dimensional fermion mass and differ substantially from the case where the SM fields lie on the TeV-brane. In both scenarios, we examine the collider signatures for direct production of the graviton and gauge KK towers as well as their induced contributions to precision electroweak observables. These direct and indirect signatures are found to play a complementary role in the exploration of the model parameter space. In the case where the SM field content resides on the TeV-brane, we show that the LHC can probe the full parameter space and hence will either discover or exclude this model if the scale of electroweak physics on the 3-brane is less than 10 TeV. We also show that spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking of the SM must take place on the TeV-brane.
