Title: Wave packets and initial conditions in quantum cosmology
Authors: S. S. Gousheh and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We discuss the construction of wave packets resulting from the solutions of a class of Wheeler-DeWitt equations in Robertson-Walker type cosmologies. We present an ansatz for the initial conditions which leads to a unique determination of the expansion coefficients in the construction of the wave packets with probability distributions which, in an interesting contrast to some of the earlier works, agree well with all possible classical paths. The possible relationship between these initial conditions and signature transition in the context of classical cosmology is also discussed.
