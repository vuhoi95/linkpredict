Title: Distribution of the k-th smallest Dirac operator eigenvalue
Authors: P. H. Damgaard and S. M. Nishigaki
Abstract: Based on the exact relationship to Random Matrix Theory, we derive the probability distribution of the k-th smallest Dirac operator eigenvalue in the microscopic finite-volume scaling regime of QCD and related gauge theories.
