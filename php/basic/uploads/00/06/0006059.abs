Title: Anomaly Matching in Gauge Theories at Finite Matter Density
Authors: S. D. Hsu and F. Sannino and M. Schwetz
Abstract: We investigate the application of 't Hooft's anomaly matching conditions to gauge theories at finite matter density. We show that the matching conditions constrain the low-energy quasiparticle spectrum associated with possible realizations of global symmetries.
