Title: Casimir effect for a dilute dielectric ball at finite temperature
Authors: V. V. Nesterenko and G. Lambiase and G. Scarpetta
Abstract: The Casimir effect at finite temperature is investigated for a dilute dielectric ball; i.e., the relevant internal and free energies are calculated. The starting point in this study is a rigorous general expression for the internal energy of a system of noninteracting oscillators in terms of the sum over the Matsubara frequencies. Summation over the angular momentum values is accomplished in a closed form by making use of the addition theorem for the relevant Bessel functions. For removing the divergences the renormalization procedure is applied that has been developed in the calculation of the corresponding Casimir energy at zero temperature. The behavior of the thermodynamic characteristics in the low and high temperature limits is investigated.
