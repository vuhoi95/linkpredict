Title: Bicomplexes and Integrable Models
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: We associate bicomplexes with several integrable models in such a way that conserved currents are obtained by a simple iterative construction. Gauge transformations and dressings are discussed in this framework and several examples are presented, including the nonlinear Schrodinger and sine-Gordon equations, and some discrete models.
