Title: Lattice Bosons
Authors: Jayprokas Chakrabarti and Asis Basu and Bijon Bagchi
Abstract: Fermions on the lattice have bosonic excitations generated from the underlying periodic background. These, the lattice bosons, arise near the empty band or when the bands are nearly full. They do not depend on the nature of the interactions and exist for any fermion-fermion coupling. We discuss these lattice boson solutions for the Dirac Hamiltonian.
