Title: Gauge symmetries of the teleparallel theory of gravity
Authors: M. Blagojevic and M. Vasilic
Abstract: We study gauge properties of the general teleparallel theory of gravity, defined in the framework of Poincare gauge theory. It is found that the general theory is characterized by two kinds of gauge symmetries: a specific gauge symmetry that acts on Lagrange multipliers, and the standard Poincare gauge symmetry. The canonical generators of these symmetries are explicitly constructed and investigated.
