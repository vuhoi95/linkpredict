Title: Effective action for QED_4 through zeta function regularization
Authors: C. G. Beneventano and E. M. Santangelo
Abstract: We obtain, through zeta function methods, the one-loop effective action for massive Dirac fields in the presence of a uniform, but otherwise general, electromagnetic background. After discussing renormalization, we compare our zeta function result with Schwinger's proper time approach.
