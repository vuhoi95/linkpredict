Abstract: The quantum discrete Liouville model in the strongly coupled regime, 1<c<25, is formulated as a well defined quantum mechanical problem with unitary evolution operator. The theory is self-dual: there are two exponential fields related by Hermitean conjugation, satisfying two discrete quantum Liouville equations, and living in mutually commuting subalgebras of the quantum algebra of observables.
