Title: Non-Abelian Born-Infeld Action and Solitons for Critical Non-BPS Branes
Authors: N. D. Lambert and I. Sachs
Abstract: The non-abelian flat directions in the tachyon potential of stable non-BPS branes recently found are shown to persist to all orders in alpha' at tree level in the string coupling. We also obtain the non-abelian Born-Infeld action including the tachyon potential for a stack of stable non-BPS branes on a critical orbifold. Finally we discuss stable soliton states on the non-BPS brane.
