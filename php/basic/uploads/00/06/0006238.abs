Title: Self-Breaking of the Standard Model Gauge Symmetry

Abstract: If the gauge fields of the Standard Model propagate in TeV-size extra dimensions, they rapidly become strongly coupled and can form scalar bound states of quarks and leptons. If the quarks and leptons of the third generation propagate in 6 or 8 dimensions, we argue that the most tightly bound scalar is a composite of top quarks, having the quantum numbers of the Higgs doublet and a large coupling to the top quark. In the case where the gauge bosons propagate in a bulk of a certain volume, this composite Higgs doublet can successfully trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. The mass of the top quark is correctly predicted to within 20%, without the need to add a fundamental Yukawa interaction, and the Higgs boson mass is predicted to lie in the range 165 - 230 GeV. In addition to the Higgs boson, there may be a few other scalar composites sufficiently light to be observed at upcoming collider experiments.
