Title: Particle creation via relaxing hypermagnetic knots
Authors: C. Adam and B. Muratori and C. Nash
Abstract: We demonstrate that particle production for fermions coupled chirally to an Abelian gauge field like the hypercharge field is provided by the microscopic mechanism of level crossing. For this purpose we use recent results on zero modes of Dirac operators for a class of localized hypermagnetic knots.
