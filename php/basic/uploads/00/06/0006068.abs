Title: A Brane World Solution to the Cosmological Constant Problem
Authors: S. -H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman
Abstract: We consider a model with two parallel (positive tension) 3-branes separated by a distance $L$ in 5-dimensional spacetime. If the interbrane space is anti-deSitter, or is not precisely anti-deSitter but contains no event horizons, the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant seen by observers on one of the branes (chosen to be the visible brane) becomes exponentially small as $L$ grows large.
