Abstract: Methods are reviewed for computing the instanton expansion of the prepotential for N=2 Seiberg-Witten theory with non-hyperelliptic curves. These results, when compared with the instanton expansion obtained from the microscopic Lagrangian, provide detailed tests of M-theory. Group theoretic regularities of F_ 1-inst allow one to "reverse engineer" a Seiberg-Witten curve for SU(N) with two antisymmetric representations and N_f \leq 3 fundamental hypermultiplet representations, a result not yet available by other methods. Consistency with M-theory requires a curve of infinite order.
