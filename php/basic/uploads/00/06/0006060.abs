Title: Warped AdS near-horizon geometry of completely localized intersections  of M5-branes
Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin and Douglas J. Smith
Abstract: We study a Hanany-Witten set-up relevant to N = 2 superconformal field theories. We find the exact near-horizon solution for this 11-dimensional system which involves intersecting M5-branes. The metric describes a warped product of AdS_5 with a manifold with SU(2) x U(1) isometry.
