Title: Quantum Gravity in D=5 Dimensions
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: We propose a topological Chern-Simons term in D=5 dimensions coupled to Einstein Hilbert theory. Hartree approximation for topological Lagrangian and the Chern-Simons term in D=3 is considered. An effective model of Quantum Gravity in D=5 dimensions is presented here. The analysis of residues is considered and the unitarity is guaranteed at tree level. The propagator is ghost and tachyon free.
