Title: Virasoro algebra and wreath product convolution
Authors: Igor Frenkel and Weiqiang Wang
Abstract: We present a group theoretic construction of the Virasoro algebra in the framework of wreath products. This can be regarded as a counterpart of a geometric construction of Lehn in the theory of Hilbert schemes of points on a surface.
