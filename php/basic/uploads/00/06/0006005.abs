Title: Bicomplexes, Integrable Models, and Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen
Abstract: We discuss a relation between bicomplexes and integrable models, and consider corresponding noncommutative (Moyal) deformations. As an example, a noncommutative version of a Toda field theory is presented.
