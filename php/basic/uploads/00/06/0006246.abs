Title: Enveloping algebra valued gauge transformations for non-abelian gauge  groups on non-commutative spaces
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Stefan Schraml and Peter Schupp and Julius Wess
Abstract: An enveloping algebra valued gauge field is constructed, its components are functions of the Lie algebra valued gauge field and can be constructed with the Seiberg-Witten map. This allows the formulation of a dynamics for a finite number of gauge field components on non-commutative spaces.
