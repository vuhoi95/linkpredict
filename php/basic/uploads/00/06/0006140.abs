Title: Elliptic Models, Type IIB Orientifolds and the Ads/CFT Correspondence
Authors: I. Ennes and C. Lozano and S. Naculich and H. Schnitzer
Abstract: We analyze the large N supergravity descriptions of the class of type IIB models T-dual to elliptic type IIA brane configurations containing two orientifold 6-planes and up to two NS 5-branes. The T-dual IIB configurations contain N D3-branes in the background of an orientifold 7-plane and, in some models, a Z_2 orbifold and/or D7-branes, which give rise to four-dimensional N=2 (or N=4) gauge theories with at most two factors. We identify the chiral primary states of the supergravity theories, and match them to gauge invariant operators of the corresponding superconformal theories using Maldacena's duality.
