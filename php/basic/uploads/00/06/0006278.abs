Title: Three flavour neutrino oscillations in models with large extra  dimensions
Authors: R. N. Mohapatra and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana
Abstract: The key challenges for models with large extra dimensions, posed by neutrino physics are: first to understand why neutrino masses are small and second, whether one can have a simultaneous explanation of all observed oscillation phenomena. There exist models that answer the first challenge by using singlet bulk neutrinos coupled to the standard model in the brane. Our goal in this paper is to see to what extent the simplest versions of these models can answer the second challenge. Our conclusion is that the minimal framework that has no new physics beyond the above simple picture cannot simultaneously explain solar, atmospheric and LSND data, whereas there are several ways that it can accommodate the first two. This would suggest that confirmation of LSND data would indicate the existence of new physics either in the brane or in extra dimensions or both, if indeed it turns out that there are large extra dimensions.
