Title: Big Bang in $AdS_{5}$ with external field and flat 4d Universe
Authors: A. Gorsky and K. Selivanov
Abstract: We describe spontaneous creation of the Brane World in $AdS_{5}$ with external field. The resulting Brane World consists of a flat 4d spatially finite expanding Universe and curved expanding "regulator" branes. No negative tension branes are involved.
