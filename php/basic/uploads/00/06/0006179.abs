Title: Realization of the Three-dimensional Quantum Euclidean Space by  Differential Operators
Authors: Stefan Schraml and Julius Wess
Abstract: The three-dimensional quantum Euclidean space is an example of a non-commutative space that is obtained from Euclidean space by $q$-deformation. Simultaneously, angular momentum is deformed to $so_q(3)$, it acts on the $q$-Euclidean space that becomes a $so_q(3)$-module algebra this way. In this paper it is shown, that this algebra can be realized by differential operators acting on $C^{\infty}$ functions on $\mathbb{R}^3$. On a factorspace of $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ a scalar product can be defined that leads to a Hilbert space, such that the action of the differential operators is defined on a dense set in this Hilbert space and algebraically self-adjoint becomes self-adjoint for the linear operator in the Hilbert space. The self-adjoint coordinates have discrete eigenvalues, the spectrum can be considered as a $q$-lattice.
