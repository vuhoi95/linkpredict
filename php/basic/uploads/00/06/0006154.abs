Title: CPT anomaly in two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge theories
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and J. Nishimura
Abstract: The CPT anomaly, which was first seen in perturbation theory for certain four-dimensional chiral gauge theories, is also present in the exact result for a class of two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge theories on the torus. Specifically, the chiral determinant for periodic fermion fields changes sign under a CPT transformation of the background gauge field. There is, in fact, an anomaly of Lorentz invariance, which allows for the CPT theorem to be circumvented.
