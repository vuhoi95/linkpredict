Title: Actions and symmetries of NSR superstrings and D-strings
Authors: Friedemann Brandt and Alexander Kling and Maximilian Kreuzer
Abstract: We present all NSR superstring and super-D-string actions invariant under a set of prescribed gauge transformations, and characterize completely their global symmetries. In particular we obtain locally supersymmetric Born-Infeld actions on general backgrounds in a formulation with extra target space dimensions. The nontrivial global symmetries of the superstring actions correspond to isometries of the background, whereas super-D-string actions can have additional symmetries acting nontrivially also on the coordinates of the extra dimensions.
