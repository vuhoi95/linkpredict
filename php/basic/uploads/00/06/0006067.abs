Title: A Gaussian Weave for Kinematical Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: A. Corichi and J. M. Reyes
Abstract: Remarkable efforts in the study of the semi-classical regime of kinematical loop quantum gravity are currently underway. In this note, we construct a ``quasi-coherent'' weave state using Gaussian factors. In a similar fashion to some other proposals, this state is peaked in both the connection and the spin network basis. However, the state constructed here has the novel feature that, in the spin network basis, the main contribution for this state is given by the fundamental representation, independently of the value of the parameter that regulates the Gaussian width.
