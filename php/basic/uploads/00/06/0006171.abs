Title: Oscillatory Behaviour in Homogeneous String Cosmology Models
Authors: Thibault Damour and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: Some spatially homogeneous Bianchi type I cosmological models filled with homogeneous ``electric'' $p$-form fields are shown to mimic the never-ending oscillatory behaviour of generic string cosmologies established recently. The validity of the ``Kasner-free-flights plus collisions-on-potential-walls'' picture is also illustrated in the case of known, non-chaotic, superstring solutions.
