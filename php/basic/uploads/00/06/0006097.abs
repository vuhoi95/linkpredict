Abstract: A spacetime with torsion produced by a Kalb-Ramond field coupled gravitationally to the Maxwell field, in accordance with a recent proposal by two of us (PM and SS), is argued to lead to an optical activity in synchrotron radiation from cosmologically distant radio sources. We suggest that this could qualitatively explain observational data from a large number of radio sources displaying such polarization asymmetry (after eliminating effects of Faraday rotation due to magnetized galactic plasma). Possible implications for heterotic string theory are also outlined.
