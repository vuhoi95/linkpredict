Title: Effective String Theory of Vortices and Regge Trajectories
Authors: M. Baker and R. Steinke
Abstract: Starting from a field theory containing classical vortex solutions, we obtain an effective string theory of these vortices as a path integral over the two transverse degrees of freedom of the string. We carry out a semiclassical expansion of this effective theory, and use it to obtain corrections to Regge trajectories due to string fluctuations.
