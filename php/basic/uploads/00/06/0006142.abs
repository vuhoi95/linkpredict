Title: Some Comments on Wheeler De Witt Equation for Gravitational Collapse and  the Problem of Time
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: We write the Hamiltonian for a gravitational spherically symmetric scalar field collapse with massive scalar field source, and we discuss the application of Wheeler De Witt equation as well as the appearence of time in this context. Using an Ansatz for Wheeler De Witt equation, solutions are discussed including the appearence of time evolution.
