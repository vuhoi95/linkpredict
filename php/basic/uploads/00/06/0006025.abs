Title: Supersymmetric Nonlinear Sigma Models
Authors: Kiyoshi Higashijima and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models are formulated as gauge theories. Auxiliary chiral superfields are introduced to impose supersymmetric constraints of F-type. Target manifolds defined by F-type constraints are always non-compact. In order to obtain nonlinear sigma models on compact manifolds, we have to introduce gauge symmetry to eliminate the degrees of freedom in non-compact directions. All supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models defined on the hermitian symmetric spaces are successfully formulated as gauge theories.
