Title: GÃ¶del Type solution with rotation, expansion and closed time-like  curves
Authors: Carlos Pinheiro and F. C. Khanna and Robert Riche
Abstract: We propose a time-varying parameter $\underline{\alpha}$ for G\"{o}del metric and an energy momentum tensor corresponding to this geometry is found. To satisfy covariance arguments time-varying gravitational and cosmological term are introduced. The ``Einstein's equation'' for this special evolution for the Universe are written down where expansion, rotation and closed time-like curves appear as a combination between standard model, G\"{o}del and steady state properties are obtained.
