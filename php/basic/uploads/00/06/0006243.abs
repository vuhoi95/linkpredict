Abstract: The generalization of the Yang-Baxter equations (YBE) in the presence of Z_2 grading along both chain and time directions is presented and an integrable model of t-J type with staggered disposition along a chain of shifts of the spectral parameter is constructed. The Hamiltonian of the model is computed in fermionic formulation. It involves three neighbour site interactions and therefore can be considered as a zig-zag ladder model. The Algebraic Bethe Ansatz technique is applied and the eigenstates, along with eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the model are found. In the thermodynamic limit, the lowest energy of the model is formed by the quarter filling of the states by fermions instead of usual half filling.
