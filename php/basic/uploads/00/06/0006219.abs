Title: Gauge Theory on a Quantum Phase Space
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: In this note we present a operator formulation of gauge theories in a quantum phase space which is specified by a operator algebra. For simplicity we work with the Heisenberg algebra. We introduce the notion of the derivative (transport) and Wilson line (parallel transport) which enables us to construct a gauge theory in a simple way. We illustrate the formulation by a discussion of the Higgs mechanism and comment on the large N masterfield.
