Title: Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem and Computation of Wilson Loop
Authors: Ying Chen and Bing He and Ji-Min Wu
Abstract: It is shown that the application of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem to the computation of the operators constructed with Wilson loop will lead to ambiguity, if the gauge field under consideration is a non-trivial one. This point is illustrated by the specific examples of the computation of a non-local operator.
