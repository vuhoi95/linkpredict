Title: Brane-worlds and their Deformations
Authors: M. D. Maia and E. M. Monte
Abstract: A geometric theory of brane-worlds with large or non-compact extra dimensions is presented. It is shown that coordinate gauge independent perturbations of the brane-world correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert dynamics derived from the embeddings of the brane-world. The quantum states of a perturbation are described by Schr\"odinger's equation with respect to the extra dimensions and the deformation Hamiltonian. A gauge potential with confined components is derived from the differentiable structure of the brane-world
