Abstract: We present an explicit study of the holographic renormalization group (RG) in six dimensions using minimal gauged supergravity. By perturbing the theory with the addition of a relevant operator of dimension four one flows to a non-supersymmetric conformal fixed point. There are also solutions describing non-conformal vacua of the same theory obtained by giving an expectation value to the operator. One such vacuum is supersymmetric and is obtained by using the true superpotential of the theory. We discuss the physical acceptability of these vacua by applying the criteria recently given by Gubser for the four dimensional case and find that those criteria give a clear physical picture in the six dimensional case as well. We use this example to comment on the role of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations in implementing the RG. We conclude with some remarks on AdS_4 and the status of three dimensional superconformal theories from squashed solutions of M-theory.
