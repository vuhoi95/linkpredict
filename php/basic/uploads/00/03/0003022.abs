Title: Stable non-BPS D-branes of type I
Authors: M. Frau and L. Gallot and A. Lerda and P. Strigazzi
Abstract: We review the boundary state description of the non-BPS D-branes in the type I string theory and show that the only stable configurations are the D-particle and the D-instanton. We also compute the gauge and gravitational interactions of the non-BPS D-particles and compare them with the interactions of the dual non-BPS particles of the heterotic string finding complete agreement. In this way we provide further dynamical evidence of the heterotic/type I duality.
