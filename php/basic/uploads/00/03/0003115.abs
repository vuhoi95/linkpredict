Title: Threshold expansion of Feynman diagrams within a configuration space  technique
Authors: S. Groote and A. A. Pivovarov
Abstract: The near threshold expansion of generalized sunset-type (water melon) diagrams with arbitrary masses is constructed by using a configuration space technique. We present analytical expressions for the expansion of the spectral density near threshold and compare it with the exact expression obtained earlier using the method of the Hankel transform. We formulate a generalized threshold expansion with partial resummation of the small mass corrections for the strongly asymmetric case where one particle in the intermediate state is much lighter than the others.
