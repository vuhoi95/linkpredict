Abstract: The family of brane-world solutions of d+1-dimensional dilatonic gravity is presented. It includes flat brane with small cosmological constant and (anti) de Sitter brane, dilatonic brane-world black holes (Schwarzschild-(anti-) de Sitter, Kerr, etc). Gravitational and dilatonic perturbations around such branes are found. It is shown that near dilatonic brane-world black hole the gravity may be localized in a standard form. The brane corrections to Newton law are estimated. The proposal to take into account the dilaton coupled brane matter quantum effects is made. The corresponding effective action changes the structure of 4d de Sitter wall. RG flow of four-dimensional Newton constant in IR and UV is briefly discussed.
