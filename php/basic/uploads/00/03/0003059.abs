Title: Minimal surfaces and Reggeization in the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: R. A. Janik and R. Peschanski
Abstract: We address the problem of computing scattering amplitudes related to the correlation function of two Wilson lines and/or loops elongated along light-cone directions in strongly coupled gauge theories. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence in the classical approximation, the amplitudes are shown to be related to minimal surfaces generalizing the {\em helicoid} in various $AdS_5$ backgrounds. Infra-red divergences appearing for Wilson lines can be factorized out or can be cured by considering the IR finite case of correlation functions of two Wilson loops. In non-conformal cases related to confining theories, reggeized amplitudes with linear trajectories and unit intercept are obtained and shown to come from the approximately flat metrics near the horizon, which sets the scale for the Regge slope. In the conformal case the absence of confinement leads to a different solution. A transition between both regimes appears, in a confining theory, when varying impact parameter.
