Abstract: We consider the Maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry of a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation and present numerical results of a test of the conjecture against the boundary field theory calculation using DLCQ. We previously calculated the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor on the supergravity side; the methods of Gubser, Klebanov, Polyakov, and Witten were used. On the field theory side, we derived an explicit expression for the two-point function in terms of data that may be extracted from the supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization (SDLCQ) calculation at a given harmonic resolution. This yielded a well defined numerical algorithm for computing the two-point function. For the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with 16 supercharges that arises in the Maldacena conjecture, the algorithm is perfectly well defined; however, the size of the numerical computation prevented us from obtaining a numerical check of the conjecture. We now present numerical results with approximately 1000 times as many states as we previously considered. These results support the Maldacena conjecture and are within $10-15%$ of the predicted numerical results in some regions. Our results are still not sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be considered to a numerical proof of the conjecture. We present a method for using a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the basis and discuss a numerical method that we use which is particularly well suited for this type of matrix element calculation.
