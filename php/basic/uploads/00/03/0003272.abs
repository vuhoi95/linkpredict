Abstract: The results obtained by Seiberg and Witten for the low-energy Wilsonian effective actions of N=2 supersymmetric theories with gauge group SU(2) are in agreement with instanton computations carried out for winding numbers one and two. This suggests that the instanton saddle point saturates the non-perturbative contribution to the functional integral. A natural framework in which corrections to this approximation are absent is given by the topological field theory built out of the N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory. After extending the standard construction of the Topological Yang-Mills theory to encompass the case of a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for the scalar field, a BRST transformation is defined (as a supersymmetry plus a gauge variation), which on the instanton moduli space is the exterior derivative. The topological field theory approach makes the so-called "constrained instanton" configurations and the instanton measure arise in a natural way. As a consequence, instanton-dominated Green's functions in N=2 Super Yang-Mills can be equivalently computed either using the constrained instanton method or making reference to the topological twisted version of the theory. We explicitly compute the instanton measure and the contribution to $u=<\Tr \phi^2>$ for winding numbers one and two. We then show that each non-perturbative contribution to the N=2 low-energy effective action can be written as the integral of a total derivative of a function of the instanton moduli. Only instanton configurations of zero conformal size contribute to this result. Finally, the 8k-dimensional instanton moduli space is built using the hyperkahler quotient procedure, which clarifies the geometrical meaning of our approach.
