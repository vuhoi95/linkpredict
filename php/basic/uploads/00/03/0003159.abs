Title: Chiral Random Matrix Model for Critical Statistics
Authors: A. M. Garcia-Garcia and J. J. M. Verbaarschot
Abstract: We propose a random matrix model that interpolates between the chiral random matrix ensembles and the chiral Poisson ensemble. By mapping this model on a non-interacting Fermi-gas we show that for energy differences less than a critical energy $E_c$ the spectral correlations are given by chiral Random Matrix Theory whereas for energy differences larger than $E_c$ the number variance shows a linear dependence on the energy difference with a slope that depends on the parameters of the model. If the parameters are scaled such that the slope remains fixed in the thermodynamic limit, this model provides a description of QCD Dirac spectra in the universality class of critical statistics. In this way a good description of QCD Dirac spectra for gauge field configurations given by a liquid of instantons is obtained.
