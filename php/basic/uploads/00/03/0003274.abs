Title: Confined Maxwell Field and Temperature Inversion Symmetry
Authors: A. C. Tort and F. C. Santos
Abstract: We evaluate the Casimir vacuum energy at finite temperature associated with the Maxwell field confined by a perfectly conducting rectangular cavity and show that an extended version of the temperature inversion symmetry is present in this system.
