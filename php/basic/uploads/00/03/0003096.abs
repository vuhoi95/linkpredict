Title: Three-Loop Four-Point Correlator in N=4 SYM
Authors: B. Eden and C. Schubert and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We explicitly compute the complete three-loop (O(g^4)) contribution to the four-point function of chiral primary current-like operators <(q)^2 q^2 (q)^2 q^2> in any finite N=2 SYM theory. The computation uses N=2 harmonic supergraphs in coordinate space. Dramatic simplifications are achieved by a double insertion of the N=2 SYM linearized action, and application of superconformal covariance arguments to the resulting nilpotent six-point amplitude. The result involves polylogarithms up to fourth order of the conformal cross ratios. It becomes particularly simple in the N=4 special case.
