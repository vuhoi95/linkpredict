Title: Vector field mediated models of dynamical light velocity
Authors: M. A. Clayton and J. W. Moffat
Abstract: A vector-tensor theory of gravity that was introduced in an earlier publication is analyzed in detail and its consequences for early universe cosmology are examined. The multiple light cone structure of the theory generates different speeds of gravitational and matter wave fronts, and the contraction of these light cones produces acausal, superluminary inflation that can resolve the initial value problems of cosmology.
