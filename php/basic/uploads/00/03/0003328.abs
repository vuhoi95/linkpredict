Title: Cosmology of Brane-Bulk Models in Five Dimensions
Authors: R. N. Mohapatra and A. PÃ©rez-Lorenzana and C. A. de S. Pires
Abstract: We study the cosmology of models with four space and one time dimension where our universe is a 3-brane and report a few results which extend existing work in several directions. Assuming a stable fifth dimension, we obtain a solution for the metric, which does not depend on any arbitrary parameters. We discuss some implications of this result.
