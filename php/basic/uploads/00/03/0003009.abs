Title: Massive chiral random matrix ensembles at beta = 1 & 4 : QCD Dirac  operator spectra
Authors: T. Nagao and S. M. Nishigaki
Abstract: The zero momentum sectors in effective theories of QCD coupled to pseudoreal (two colors) and real (adjoint) quarks have alternative descriptions in terms of chiral orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using this correspondence, we compute correlation functions of Dirac operator eigenvalues within a sector with an arbitrary topological charge in a presence of finite quark masses of the order of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue. These novel correlation functions, expressed in terms of Pfaffians, interpolate between known results for the chiral and quenched limits as quark masses vary.
