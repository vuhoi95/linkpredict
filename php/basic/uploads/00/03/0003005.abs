Title: New Algebraic Quantum Many-body Problems
Authors: D. Gomez-Ullate and A. Gonzalez-Lopez and M. A. Rodriguez
Abstract: We develop a systematic procedure for constructing quantum many-body problems whose spectrum can be partially or totally computed by purely algebraic means. The exactly-solvable models include rational and hyperbolic potentials related to root systems, in some cases with an additional external field. The quasi-exactly solvable models can be considered as deformations of the previous ones which share their algebraic character.
