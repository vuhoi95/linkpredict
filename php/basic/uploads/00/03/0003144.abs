Title: Axial vector current in an electromagnetic field and low-energy  neutrino-photon interactions
Authors: Holger Gies and Rashid Shaisultanov
Abstract: An expression for the axial vector current in a strong, slowly varying electromagnetic field is obtained. We apply this expression to the construction of the effective action for low-energy neutrino-photon interactions.
