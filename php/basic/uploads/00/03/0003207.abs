Title: Higher Cumulants in the Cluster Expansion in QCD
Authors: W. Kornelis and H. G. Dosch
Abstract: In this work an extension of the Gaussian model of the stochastic vacuum is presented. It consists of including higher cumulants than just the second one in the cluster expansion in QCD. The influence of nonabelian fourth cumulants on the potential of a static quark-antiquarkpair is examined and the formation of flux tubes between a static $q\bar{q}$-pair is investigated. It is found that the fourth cumulants can contribute to chromomagnetic flux tubes. Furthermore the contribution of fourth cumulants to the total cross section of soft high energy hadron-hadron scattering is examined and it is found that the fourth cumulants do not change the general picture obtained in the Gaussian model.
