Title: Canonical transformations and soldering
Authors: R. Banerjee and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: We show that the recently developed soldering formalism in the Lagrangian approach and canonical transformations in the Hamiltonian approach are complementary. The examples of gauged chiral bosons in two dimensions and self-dual models in three dimensions are discussed in details.
