Title: Spherical Scalar Field Halo in Galaxies
Authors: T. Matos and F. S. Guzman and D. Nunez
Abstract: We study a spherically symmetric fluctuation of scalar dark matter in the cosmos and show that it could be the dark matter in galaxies, provided that the scalar field has an exponential potential whose overall sign is negative and whose exponent is constrained observationally by the rotation velocities of galaxies. The local space-time of the fluctuation contains a three dimensional space-like hypersurface with surplus of angle.
