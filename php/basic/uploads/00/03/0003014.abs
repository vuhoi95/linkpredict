Title: Renormalization of the Inverse Square Potential
Authors: Horacio E. Camblong and Luis N. Epele and Huner Fanchiotti and Carlos A. Garcia Canal
Abstract: The quantum-mechanical D-dimensional inverse square potential is analyzed using field-theoretic renormalization techniques. A solution is presented for both the bound-state and scattering sectors of the theory using cutoff and dimensional regularization. In the renormalized version of the theory, there is a strong-coupling regime where quantum-mechanical breaking of scale symmetry takes place through dimensional transmutation, with the creation of a single bound state and of an energy-dependent s-wave scattering matrix element.
