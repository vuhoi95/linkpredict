Title: Heisenberg spin chains based on sl(2|1) symmetry
Authors: S. Derkachov and D. Karakhanyan and R. Kirschner
Abstract: We find solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation acting on tensor product of arbitrary representations of the superalgebra sl(2|1). Based on these solutions we construct the local Hamiltonians for integrable homogeneous periodic chains and open chains.
