Title: The Rest-Frame Instant Form of Relativistic Perfect Fluids and of  Non-Dissipative Elastic Materials
Authors: Luca Lusanna and D. Nowak-Szczepaniak
Abstract: For perfect fluids with equation of state $\rho = \rho (n,s)$, Brown gave an action principle depending only on their Lagrange coordinates $\alpha^i(x)$ without Clebsch potentials. After a reformulation on arbitrary spacelike hypersurfaces in Minkowski spacetime, the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form of these perfect fluids is given. Their Hamiltonian invariant mass can be given in closed form for the dust and the photon gas. The action for the coupling to tetrad gravity is given. Dixon's multipoles for the perfect fluids are studied on the rest-frame Wigner hyperplane. It is also shown that the same formalism can be applied to non-dissipative relativistic elastic materials described in terms of Lagrangian coordinates.
