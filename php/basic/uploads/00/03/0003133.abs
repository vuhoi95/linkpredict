Title: Black hole formation in bidimensional dilaton gravity coupled to scalar  matter systems
Authors: M. Alves and D. Bazeia and V. B. Bezerra
Abstract: This work deals with the formation of black hole in bidimensional dilaton gravity coupled to scalar matter fields. We investigate two scalar matter systems, one described by a sixth power potential and the other defined with two scalar fields containing up to the fourth power in the fields. The topological solutions that appear in these cases allow the formation of black holes in the corresponding dilaton gravity models.
