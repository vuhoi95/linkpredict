Title: A Note on Warped String Compactification
Authors: Chang S. Chan and Percy L. Paul and Herman Verlinde
Abstract: We give a short review of a large class of warped string geometries, obtained via F-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds, that upon reduction to 5 dimensions give consistent supersymmetric realizations of the RS compactification scenario.
