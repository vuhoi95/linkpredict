Title: Q-ball Dynamics
Authors: Richard Battye and Paul Sutcliffe
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Q-balls in one, two and three space dimensions, using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations of motion. We find that the dynamics of Q-balls is extremely complex, involving processes such as charge transfer and Q-ball fission. We present results of simulations which illustrate the salient features of 2-Q-ball interactions and give qualitative arguments to explain them in terms of the evolution of the time-dependent phases.
