Title: Axial current in QED and semi-naive dimensional renormalization
Authors: M. Pernici and M. Raciti
Abstract: We renormalize at two loops the axial current and $F \tilde{F}$ in massless QED, using the recently proposed semi-naive dimensional renormalization scheme. We show that the results are in agreement with those in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme, previously obtained indirectly by making a three-loop computation.
