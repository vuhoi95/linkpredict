Title: Action with Manifest Duality for Maximally Supersymmetric  Six-dimensional Supergravity
Authors: GianCarlo De Pol and Harvendra Singh and Mario Tonin
Abstract: We perform explicitly the toroidal compactification of eleven dimensional supergravity to six dimensions and present its action in a manifestly $SO(5,5)\over SO(5)\times SO(5)$ invariant form using the recently proposed covariant formulation of theories involving chiral fields.
