Title: Commuting charges and symmetric spaces
Authors: J. M. Evans and A. J. Mountain
Abstract: Every classical sigma-model with target space a compact symmetric space $G/H$ (with $G$ classical) is shown to possess infinitely many local, commuting, conserved charges which can be written in closed form. The spins of these charges run over a characteristic set of values, playing the role of exponents of $G/H$, and repeating modulo an integer $h$ which plays the role of a Coxeter number.
