Title: Magnetic and Dyonic Black Holes in D=4 Gauged Supergravity
Authors: A. H. Chamseddine and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: Magnetic and Dyonic solutions are constructed for the theory of abelian gauged N=2 gauged four dimensional supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. The solutions found preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry.
