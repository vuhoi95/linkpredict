Title: Fields on the Poincare group: arbitrary spin description and  relativistic wave equations
Authors: D. M. Gitman and A. L. Shelepin
Abstract: In this paper, starting from pure group-theoretical point of view, we develop a regular approach to describing particles with different spins in the framework of a theory of scalar fields on the Poincare group. Such fields can be considered as generating functions for conventional spin-tensor fields. The cases of 2, 3, and 4 dimensions are elaborated in detail. Discrete transformations $C,P,T$ are defined for the scalar fields as automorphisms of the Poincare group. Doing a classification of the scalar functions, we obtain relativistic wave equations for particles with definite spin and mass. There exist two different types of scalar functions (which describe the same mass and spin), one related to a finite-dimensional nonunitary representation and another one related to an infinite-dimensional unitary representation of the Lorentz subgroup. This allows us to derive both usual finite-component wave equations for spin-tensor fields and positive energy infinite-component wave equations.
