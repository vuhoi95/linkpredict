Title: On the String Description of Confinement
Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Cesar Gomez
Abstract: A non supersymmetric string background, directly derived from the string soft dilaton theorem, is used to compute, in the semiclassical approximation, the expectation value of Wilson loops in static gauge. The resulting potential shares common features with the one obtained through Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter spacetime metrics. In particular a linear confining potential appears naturally.
