Title: Vortex Pair Creation on Brane-Antibrane Pair via Marginal Deformation
Authors: Jaydeep Majumder and Ashoke Sen
Abstract: It has been conjectured that the vortex solution on a D-brane - anti-D-brane system represents a D-brane of two lower dimension. We establish this result by first identifying a series of marginal deformations which create the vortex - antivortex pair on the brane - antibrane system, and then showing that under this series of marginal deformations the original D-brane - anti-D-brane system becomes a D-brane - anti-D-brane system with two lower dimensions. Generalization of this construction to the case of solitons of higher codimension is also discussed.
