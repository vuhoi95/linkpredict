Title: Dynamical Casimir Effect and Quantum Cosmology
Authors: I. Brevik and K. A. Milton and S. D. Odintsov and K. E. Osetrin
Abstract: We apply the background field method and the effective action formalism to describe the four-dimensional dynamical Casimir effect. Our picture corresponds to the consideration of quantum cosmology for an expanding FRW universe (the boundary conditions act as a moving mirror) filled by a quantum massless GUT which is conformally invariant. We consider cases in which the static Casimir energy is repulsive and attractive. Inserting the simplest possible inertial term, we find, in the adiabatic (and semiclassical) approximation, the dynamical evolution of the scale factor and the dynamical Casimir stress analytically and numerically (for SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory). Alternative kinetic energy terms are explored in the Appendix.
