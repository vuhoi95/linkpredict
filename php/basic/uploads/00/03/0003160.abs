Title: Noncommutative Solitons
Authors: Rajesh Gopakumar and Shiraz Minwalla and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: We find classically stable solitons (instantons) in odd (even) dimensional scalar noncommutative field theories whose scalar potential, $V(\ph)$, has at least two minima. These solutions are bubbles of the false vacuum whose size is set by the scale of noncommutativity. Our construction uses the correspondence between non-commutative fields and operators on a single particle Hilbert space. In the case of noncommutative gauge theories we note that expanding around a simple solution shifts away the kinetic term and results in a purely quartic action with linearly realised gauge symmetries.
