Title: Superworldvolume dynamics of superbranes from nonlinear realizations
Authors: S. Bellucci and E. Ivanov and S. Krivonos
Abstract: Based on the concept of the partial breaking of global supersymmetry (PBGS), we derive the worldvolume superfield equations of motion for $N=1, D=4$ supermembrane, as well as for the space-time filling D2- and D3-branes, from nonlinear realizations of the corresponding supersymmetries. We argue that it is of no need to take care of the relevant automorphism groups when being interested in the dynamical equations. This essentially facilitates computations. As a by-product, we obtain a new polynomial representation for the $d=3,4$ Born-Infeld equations, with merely a cubic nonlinearity.
