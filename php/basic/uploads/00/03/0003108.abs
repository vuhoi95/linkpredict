Title: Topological Symmetries
Authors: A. Mostafazadeh and K. Aghababaei Samani
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a topological symmetry as a quantum mechanical symmetry involving a certain topological invariant. We obtain the underlying algebraic structure of the Z_2-graded uniform topological symmetries of type (1,1) and (2,1). This leads to a novel derivation of the algebras of supersymmetry and $p=2$ parasupersummetry.
