Title: Complementarity of the Maldacena and Randall-Sundrum Pictures
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu
Abstract: We revive an old result, that one-loop corrections to the graviton propagator induce 1/r^3 corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential, and compute the coefficient due to closed loops of the U(N) {\cal N}=4 super-Yang-Mills theory that arises in Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence. We find exact agreement with the coefficient appearing in the Randall-Sundrum brane-world proposal. This provides more evidence for the complementarity of the two pictures.
