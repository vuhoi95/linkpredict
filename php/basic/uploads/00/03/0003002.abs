Title: Brane World with Bulk Horizons
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Bert Janssen and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: A brane world in the presence of a bulk black hole is constructed. The brane tension is fine tuned in terms of the black hole mass and cosmological constant. Gravitational perturbations localized on the brane world are discussed.
