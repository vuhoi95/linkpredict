Title: On the Landau-Ginzburg description of Boundary CFTs and special  Lagrangian submanifolds
Authors: Suresh Govindarajan and T. Jayaraman
Abstract: We consider Landau-Ginzburg (LG) models with boundary conditions preserving A-type N=2 supersymmetry. We show the equivalence of a linear class of boundary conditions in the LG model to a particular class of boundary states in the corresponding CFT by an explicit computation of the open-string Witten index in the LG model. We extend the linear class of boundary conditions to general non-linear boundary conditions and determine their consistency with A-type N=2 supersymmetry. This enables us to provide a microscopic description of special Lagrangian submanifolds in C^n due to Harvey and Lawson. We generalise this construction to the case of hypersurfaces in P^n. We find that the boundary conditions must necessarily have vanishing Poisson bracket with the combination (W(\phi)-\bar{W}(\bar{\phi})), where W(\phi) is the appropriate superpotential for the hypersurface. An interesting application considered is the T^3 supersymmetric cycle of the quintic in the large complex structure limit.
