Title: T-duality and Actions for Non-BPS D-branes
Authors: E. A. Bergshoeff and M. de Roo and T. C. de Wit and E. Eyras and S. Panda
Abstract: We employ T-duality to restrict the tachyon dependence of effective actions for non-BPS D-branes. For the Born-Infeld part the criteria of T-duality and supersymmetry are satisfied by a simple extension of the D-brane Born-Infeld action.
