Title: Unifying the Strengths of Forces in Higher Dimensions
Authors: A. Dedes and P. Kanti
Abstract: We consider the embedding of the Standard Model fields in a $(4+d)$-dimensional theory while gravitons may propagate in $d'$ extra, compact dimensions. We study the modification of strengths of the gravitational and gauge interactions and, for various values of $d$ and $d'$, we determine the energy scale at which these strengths are unified. Special cases where the unification of strengths is characterized by the absence of any hierarchy problem are also presented.
