Title: Chaos in Superstring Cosmology
Authors: Thibault Damour and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: It is shown that the general solution near a spacelike singularity of the Einstein-dilaton-p-form field equations relevant to superstring theories and M-theory exhibits an oscillatory behaviour of the Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz type. String dualities play a significant role in the analysis.
