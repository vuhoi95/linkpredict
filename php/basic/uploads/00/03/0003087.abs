Abstract: The particle Fock space of the matter fields in QED can be constructed using the free creation and annihilation operators. However, these particle operators are not, even at asymptotically large times, the modes of the matter fields that enter the QED Lagrangian. In this letter we construct the fields which do recover such particle modes at large times. We are thus able to demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to statements found in the literature, a relativistic description of charged particles in QED exists.
