Title: Boundary Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and John F. Wheater
Abstract: We discuss the effect of boundaries in boundary logarithmic conformal field theory and show, with reference to both $c=-2$ and $c=0$ models, how they produce new features even in bulk correlation functions which are not present in the corresponding models without boundaries. We discuss the modification of Cardy's relation between boundary states and bulk quantities.
