Title: Brane Universe and Multigravity: Modification of gravity at large and  small distances
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Graham G. Ross
Abstract: We consider a modification of gravity at large distances in a Brane Universe which was discussed recently. In these models the modification of gravity at large distances is ultimately connected to existence of negative tension brane(s) and exponentially small tunneling factor. We discuss a general model which interpolates between Bi-gravity model and GRS model. We also discuss the possible mechanism of stabilization for negative tension branes in AdS background. Finally we show that extra degrees of freedom of massive gravitons do not lead to disastrous contradiction with General Relativity if the stabilization condition $\int dy \sqrt{-G^{(5)}} (T^\mu_\mu-2T^5_5)=0$ is implemented.
