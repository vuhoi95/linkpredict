Title: Dynamics of Multiparticle Systems with non - Abelian Symmetry
Authors: Ludwik Turko and Jan Rafelski
Abstract: We consider the dynamics governing the evolution of a many body system constrained by an nonabelian local symmetry. We obtain explicit forms of the global macroscopic condition assuring that at the microscopic level the evolution respects the overall symmetry constraint. We demonstrate the constraint mechanisms for the case of SU(2) system comprising particles in fundamental, and adjoint representations (`nucleons' and `pions').
