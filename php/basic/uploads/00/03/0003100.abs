Title: Gravitational Energy-Momentum Density in Teleparallel Gravity
Authors: V. C. de Andrade and L. C. T. Guillen and J. G. Pereira
Abstract: In the context of a gauge theory for the translation group, a conserved energy-momentum gauge current for the gravitational field is obtained. It is a true spacetime and gauge tensor, and transforms covariantly under global Lorentz transformations. By rewriting the gauge gravitational field equation in a purely spacetime form, it becomes the teleparallel equivalent of Einstein's equation, and the gauge current reduces to the M{\o}ller's canonical energy-momentum density of the gravitational field.
