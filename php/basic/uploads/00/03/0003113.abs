Title: Diagrams of Noncommutative Phi-Three Theory from String Theory
Authors: Oleg Andreev and Harald Dorn
Abstract: Starting from tree and one-loop tachyon amplitudes of open string theory in the presence of a constant B-field, we explore two problems. First we show that in the noncommutative field theory limit the amplitudes reduce to tree and one-loop diagrams of the noncommutative phi-three theory. Next, we check factorization of the one-loop amplitudes in the long cylinder limit.
