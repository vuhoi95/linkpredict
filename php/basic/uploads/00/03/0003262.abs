Title: D-Brane Recoil and Supersymmetry Obstruction
Authors: A. Campbell-Smith and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We discuss a model in which our universe is pictured as a recoiling Dirichlet brane: we find that a proper treatment of the recoil leads naturally to supersymmetry obstruction on the four-dimensional world. An essential feature of our approach is the fact that the underlying worldsheet sigma model is non-critical, and the Liouville mode plays the role of the target time. Also, the extra bulk dimensions are viewed as sigma model couplings, and as such have to be averaged by appropriate summation over worldsheet genera. The recoiling brane is in an excited state rather than its ground state, to which it relaxes asymptotically in time, restoring supersymmetry. We also find that the excitation energy, which is considered as the observable effective cosmological `constant' on the brane, is naturally small and can accommodate upper bounds from observations.
