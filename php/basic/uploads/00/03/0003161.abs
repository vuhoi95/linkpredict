Title: On the Supersymmetry and Gauge Structure of Matrix Theory
Authors: Y. Kazama and T. Muramatsu
Abstract: Supersymmetric Ward identity for the low energy effective action in the standard background gauge is derived for {\it arbitrary} trajectories of supergravitons in Matrix Theory. In our formalism, the quantum-corrected supersymmetry transformation laws of the supergravitons are directly identified in closed form, which exhibit an intricate interplay between supersymmetry and gauge (BRST) symmetry. As an application, we explicitly compute the transformation laws for the source-probe configuration at 1-loop and confirm that supersymmetry fixes the form of the action completely, including the normalization, to the lowest order in the derivative expansion.
