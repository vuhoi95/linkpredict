Title: Graviton Propagators, Brane Bending and Bending of Light in Theories  with Quasi-Localized Gravity
Authors: Csaba Csaki and Joshua Erlich and Timothy J. Hollowood
Abstract: We derive the graviton propagator on the brane for theories with quasi-localized gravity. In these models the ordinary 4D graviton is replaced by a resonance in the spectrum of massive Kaluza-Klein modes, which can decay into the extra dimension. We find that the effects of the extra polarization in the massive graviton propagator is exactly cancelled by the bending of the brane due to the matter sources, up to small corrections proportional to the width of the resonance. Thus at intermediate scales the classic predictions of Einstein's gravity are reproduced in these models to arbitrary precision.
