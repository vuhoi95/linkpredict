Abstract: We show how string theory can be used to reproduce the one-loop two-point photon amplitude in noncommutative U(1) gauge theory. Using a simple realization of the gauge theory in bosonic string theory, we extract from a string cylinder computation in the decoupling limit the exact one loop field theory result. The result is obtained entirely from the region of moduli space where massless open strings dominate. Our computation indicates that the unusual IR/UV singularities of noncommutative field theory do not come from closed string modes in any simple way.
