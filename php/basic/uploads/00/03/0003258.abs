Title: Two-loop beta functions of the Sine-Gordon model
Authors: Janos Balog and Arpad Hegedus
Abstract: We recalculate the two-loop beta functions in the two-dimensional Sine-Gordon model in a two-parameter expansion around the asymptotically free point. Our results agree with those of Amit et al., J. Phys. A13 (1980) 585.
