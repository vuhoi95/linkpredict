Title: Naked Singularity Explosion
Authors: Tomohiro Harada and Hideo Iguchi and Ken-ichi Nakao
Abstract: It is known that the gravitational collapse of a dust ball results in naked singularity formation from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable. In this paper, we show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the naked singularity.
