Title: Kaehler forms and cosmological solutions in type II supergravities
Authors: N. Alonso-Alberca and P. Meessen
Abstract: We consider cosmological solutions to type II supergravity theories where the spacetime is split into a FRW universe and a K\"ahler space, which may be taken to be Calabi-Yau. The various 2-forms present in the theories are taken to be proportional to the K\"ahler form associated to the K\"ahler space.
