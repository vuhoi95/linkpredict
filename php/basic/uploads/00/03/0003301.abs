Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking at Infinite Momentum without P+ Zero-Modes
Authors: Joel S. Rozowsky and Charles B. Thorn
Abstract: The nonrelativistic interpretation of quantum field theory achieved by quantization in an infinite momentum frame is spoiled by the inclusion of a mode of the field carrying p+=0. We therefore explore the viability of doing without such a mode in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), where its presence would seem to be most needed. We show that the physics of SSB in scalar quantum field theory in 1+1 space-time dimensions is accurately described without a zero-mode.
