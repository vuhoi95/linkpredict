Title: Measurability of the non-minimal coupling
Authors: A. Flachi and D. J. Toms
Abstract: The "measurability" of the non-minimal coupling is discussed in the context of the effective field theory of gravity. Although there is no obvious motive for excluding a non-minimal scalar coupling from the theory, we conclude that for reasonable values of the coupling constant it makes only a very small correction.
