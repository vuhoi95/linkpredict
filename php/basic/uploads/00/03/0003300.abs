Title: Gravity of higher-dimensional global defects
Authors: Itsaso Olasagasti and Alexander Vilenkin
Abstract: Solutions of Einstein's equations are found for global defects in a higher-dimensional spacetime with a nonzero cosmological constant Lambda. The defect has a (p-1)-dimensional core (brane) and a `hedgehog' scalar field configuration in the n extra dimensions. For Lambda = 0 and n > 2, the solutions are characterized by a flat brane worldsheet and a solid angle deficit in the extra dimensions. For Lambda > 0, one class of solutions describes spherical branes in an inflating higher-dimensional universe. Instantons obtained by a Euclidean continuation of such solutions describe quantum nucleation of the entire inflating brane-world, or of a spherical brane in an inflating higher-dimensional universe. For Lambda < 0, one class of solutions exhibits an exponential warp factor. It is similar to spacetimes previously discussed by Randall and Sundrum for n = 1 and by Gregory for n = 2.
