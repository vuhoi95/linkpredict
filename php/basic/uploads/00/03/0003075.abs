Title: Quasi-Spin-Charge Separation and the Spin Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: D. Bernard and A. LeClair
Abstract: We use quantum field theory methods to study the network model for the spin quantum hall transition. When the couplings are fine tuned in a certain way, the spin and charge degrees of freedom, corresponding to the supercurrent algebras su(2) and osp(2|2) respectively, decouple in the renormalization group flow. The infrared fixed point of this simpler theory is the coset osp(4|4)/su(2) which is closely related to the current algebra osp(2|2) but not identical. Some critical exponents are computed and shown to agree with the recent predictions based on percolation.
