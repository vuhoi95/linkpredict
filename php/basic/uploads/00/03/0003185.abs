Title: Effective Action of Matter Fields in Four-Dimensional String  Orientifolds
Authors: P. Bain and M. Berg
Abstract: We study various aspects of the Kahler metric for matter fields in N=1,2 orientifold compactifications of type IIB string theory. The result has an infrared-divergent part which reproduces the field- theoretical anomalous dimensions, and a moduli-dependent part which comes from N=2 sectors of the orientifold. For the N=2 orientifolds, we also compute the disk amplitude for two matter fields on the boundary and a twisted closed string modulus in the bulk. Our results are in agreement with supersymmetry: the singlet under the SU(2)_R R-symmetry has vanishing coupling, while the coupling of the SU(2)_R triplet does not vanish.
