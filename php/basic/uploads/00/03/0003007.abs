Abstract: We construct a realistic SU(7) model which provides answers to many questions presently facing the prototype SU(5) SUSY GUT. Among them are a solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem, string scale unification, proton decay, the hierarchy of baryon vs lepton number violation and neutrino masses.
