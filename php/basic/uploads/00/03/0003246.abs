Title: Integration of the SL(2,R)/U(1) Gauged WZNW Theory by Reduction and  Quantum Parafermions
Authors: C. Ford and G. Jorjadze and G. Weigt
Abstract: Using a gauge invariant reduction we directly integrate the SL(2,R)/U(1) WZNW theory. We prove that the conserved parafermions of this theory are coset currents. Quantum mechanically, the parafermion algebra, the energy-momentum tensor, and `auxiliary' parafermions are deformed in a self-consistent manner.
