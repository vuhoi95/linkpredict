Title: Planar Dirac Electron in Coulomb and Magnetic Fields
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho and V. R. Khalilov
Abstract: The Dirac equation for an electron in two spatial dimensions in the Coulomb and homogeneous magnetic fields is discussed. For weak magnetic fields, the approximate energy values are obtained by semiclassical method. In the case with strong magnetic fields, we present the exact recursion relations that determine the coefficients of the series expansion of wave functions, the possible energies and the magnetic fields. It is found that analytic solutions are possible for a denumerably infinite set of magnetic field strengths. This system thus furnishes an example of the so-called quasi-exactly solvable models. A distinctive feature in the Dirac case is that, depending on the strength of the Coulomb field, not all total angular momentum quantum number allow exact solutions with wavefunctions in reasonable polynomial forms. Solutions in the nonrelativistic limit with both attractive and repulsive Coulomb fields are briefly discussed by means of the method of factorization.
