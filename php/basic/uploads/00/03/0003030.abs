Title: Sublattice Magnetization and NÃ©el Transition in the 2D Quantum  Heisenberg Antiferromagnet
Authors: Eduardo C. Marino and Marcello B. Silva Neto
Abstract: We present an analytic expression for the finite temperature sublattice magnetization, at the Josephson scale, in two dimensional quantum antiferromagnets with short range N\'eel order. Our expression is able to reproduce both the qualitative behaviour of the phase diagram $M(T)/M_{0}$ and the experimental values of the N\'eel temperature $T_{N}$ for either doped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.15}$ and stoichiometric La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$.
