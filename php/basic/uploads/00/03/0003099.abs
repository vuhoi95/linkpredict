Title: Some Properties of Non-linear $Ïƒ$-Models in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Thomas Krajewski and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: We introduce non-linear $\sigma$-models in the framework of noncommutative geometry with special emphasis on models defined on the noncommutative torus. We choose as target spaces the two point space and the circle and illustrate some characteristic features of the corresponding $\sigma$-models. In particular we construct a $\sigma$-model instanton with topological charge equal to 1. We also define and investigate some properties of a noncommutative analogue of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model.
