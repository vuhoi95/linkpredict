Title: On Seven-Brane and Instanton Solutions of Type IIB
Authors: Martin B. Einhorn and Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas
Abstract: It is shown that magnetic seven-branes previously considered as different objects are members of a one-parametric family of supersymmetric seven branes. We enlarge the class of seven-branes by constructing new magnetically and also electrically charged seven branes. The solutions display a kink-like behavior. We also construct a solution that naturally generalizes the D-instanton.
