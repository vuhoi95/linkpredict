Title: Solitons and Domain Walls in Odd Dimensions
Authors: N. D. Lambert and G. W. Gibbons
Abstract: We discuss the existance of smooth soliton solutions which interpolate between supersymmetric vacua in odd-dimensional theories. In particular we apply this analysis to a wide class of supergravities to argue against the existence of smooth domain walls interpolating between supersymmetric vacua. We find that if the superpotential changes sign then any Goldstino modes will diverge.
