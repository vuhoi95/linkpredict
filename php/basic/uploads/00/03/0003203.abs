Title: Anomalous dimensions in N=4 SYM theory at order g^4
Authors: M. Bianchi and S. Kovacs and G. C. Rossi and Ya. S. Stanev
Abstract: We compute four-point correlation functions of scalar composite operators in the N=4 supercurrent multiplet at order g^4 using the N=1 superfield formalism. We confirm the interpretation of short-distance logarithmic behaviours in terms of anomalous dimensions of unprotected operators exchanged in the intermediate channels and we determine the two-loop contribution to the anomalous dimension of the N=4 Konishi supermultiplet.
