Title: Lectures on Strings, D-branes and Gauge Theories
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Oscar Loaiza-Brito
Abstract: In these lectures we review the basic ideas of perturbative and non-perturbative string theory. On the non-perturbative side we give an introduction to D-branes and string duality. The elementary concepts of non-BPS branes and noncommutative gauge theories are also discussed.
