Title: Loop observables for BF theories in any dimension and the cohomology of  knots
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Paolo Cotta-Ramusino and Carlo A. Rossi
Abstract: A generalization of Wilson loop observables for BF theories in any dimension is introduced in the Batalin-Vilkovisky framework. The expectation values of these observables are cohomology classes of the space of imbeddings of a circle. One of the resulting theories discussed in the paper has only trivalent interactions and, irrespective of the actual dimension, looks like a 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory.
