Title: Algebraic characterization of constraints and generation of mass in  gauge theories
Authors: M. Calixto and V. Aldaya
Abstract: The possibility of non-trivial representations of the gauge group on wavefunctionals of a gauge invariant quantum field theory leads to a generation of mass for intermediate vector and tensor bosons. The mass parameters "m" show up as central charges in the algebra of constraints, which then become of second-class nature. The gauge group coordinates acquire dynamics outside the null-mass shell and provide the longitudinal field degrees of freedom that massless bosons need to form massive bosons.
