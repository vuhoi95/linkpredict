Title: On decay of large amplitude bubble of disoriented chiral condensate
Authors: T. I. Belova and V. A. Gani and A. E. Kudryavtsev
Abstract: The time evolution of initially formed large amplitude bubble of disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) is studied. It is found that the evolution of this object may have a relatively long pre-decay stage. Simple explanation of such delay of the DCC bubble decay is given. This delay is related to the existence of the approximate solutions of multi-soliton type of the corresponding radial sine-Gordon equation in (3+1) dimensions at large bubble radius.
