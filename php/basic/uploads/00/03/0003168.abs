Title: M-Theory N=1 Effective Supergravity in Four Dimensions
Authors: J. -P. Derendinger and R. Sauser
Abstract: We present a general `off-shell' description of the effective N=1 supergravity describing the low-energy limit of M-theory compactified on (Calabi-Yau) x S1/Z2. In our formulation, the M-theory Bianchi identities are imposed by the equations of motion of four-dimensional supermultiplets. Modifications of these identities (resulting for instance from contributions localized at orbifold singularities or non-perturbative sources like five-branes) can then easily be implemented.
