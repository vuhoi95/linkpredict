Title: Supersymmetric black hole solutions with $R^2$-interactions
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and B. de Wit and J. KÃ¤ppeli and T. Mohaupt
Abstract: We present a class of static supersymmetric multi-center black hole solutions arising in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories with terms quadratic in the Weyl tensor. We also comment on possible corrections to the metric on the moduli space of these black holes solutions.
