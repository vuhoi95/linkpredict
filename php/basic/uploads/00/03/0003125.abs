Title: On non-$L^2$ solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations
Authors: C. Adam and B. Muratori and C. Nash
Abstract: We show that a previous paper of Freund describing a solution to the Seiberg-Witten equations has a sign error rendering it a solution to a related but different set of equations. The non-$L^2$ nature of Freund's solution is discussed and clarified and we also construct a whole class of solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations.
