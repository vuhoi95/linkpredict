Title: High-precision estimate of g4 in the 2D Ising model
Authors: Michele Caselle and Martin Hasenbusch and Andrea Pelissetto and Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We compute the renormalized four-point coupling in the 2d Ising model using transfer-matrix techniques. We greatly reduce the systematic uncertainties which usually affect this type of calculations by using the exact knowledge of several terms in the scaling function of the free energy. Our final result is g4=14.69735(3).
