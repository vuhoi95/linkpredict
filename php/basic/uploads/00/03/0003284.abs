Title: Temperature of D3-branes off extremality
Authors: Suphot Musiri and George Siopsis
Abstract: We discuss non-extremal rotating D3-branes. We solve the wave equation for scalars in the supergravity background of certain distributions of branes and compute the absorption coefficients. The form of these coefficients is similar to the gray-body factors associated with black-hole scattering. They are given in terms of two different temperature parameters, indicating that fields (open string modes) do not remain in thermal equilibrium as we move off extremality. This should shed some light on the origin of the disagreement between the supergravity and conformal field theory results on the free energy of a system of non-coincident D-branes.
