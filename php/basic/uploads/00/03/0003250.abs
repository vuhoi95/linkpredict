Title: The Image of Self Intersecting QCD Strings in Four Dimensions
Authors: Bob Bacus and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: We numerically examine the self-dual solutions of self-intersecting strings immersed in four dimensions. We find that open torus knots have topologies that can support monopole/anti-monopole as well as q-qbar production and annihilation. We give an estimate of the string tension from quark production rates, show that the intersection number for torus-knots is 4(p-q), and discuss a chiral symmetry breaking mechanism due to self-intersections. We supply a MAPLE program that can annimate the torus-knot solutions. These annimations can be found at http://www-hep.physics.uiowa.edu/~bacus/research.html under the ``Animation Control Panel''.
