Title: FFZ realization of the deformed super Virasoro algebra -  Chaichian-Presnajder type
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Haru-Tada Sato
Abstract: The q-deformed super Virasoro algebra proposed by Chaichian and Presnajder is examined. Presented is the realizations by the FFZ algebra (the magnetic translation algebra) defined on a two-dimensional lattice with a supersymmetric Hamiltonian.
