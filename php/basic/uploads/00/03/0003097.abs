Title: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking and Static Limits of Extended  Super-Yang-Mills Theories: A non-Seiberg-Wittian Approach
Authors: L. Bergamin and P. Minkowski
Abstract: From a supersymmetry covariant source extension of N=2 SYM we study non-trivial thermodynamical limits thereof. Using an argument by one of us about the solution of the strong CP problem and the uniqueness of the QCD ground state we find that the dependence of the effective potential on the defining field operators is severely restricted. In contrast to the solution by Seiberg and Witten an acceptable infrared behavior only exists for broken supersymmetry while the gauge symmetry remains unbroken.
