Title: Softly-Broken {\cal N} = 4 Supersymmetry in the Large-N Limit
Authors: Nick Dorey and S. Prem Kumar
Abstract: We calculate the exact values of the holomorphic observables of {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory deformed by mass terms which preserve {\cal N}=1 SUSY. These include the chiral condensates in each massive vacuum of the theory as well as the central charge which determines the tension of BPS saturated domain walls interpolating between these vacua. Several unexpected features emerge in the large-N limit, including anomalous modular properties under an SL(2,Z) duality group which acts on a complexification of the 't Hooft coupling \lambda=g^{2}N/4\pi. We discuss our results in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
