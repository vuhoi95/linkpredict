Title: Hyperk√§hler Quotients, Mirror Symmetry, and F-theory
Authors: I. Y. Park and R. von Unge
Abstract: Using the graphical method developed in hep-th/9908082, we obtain the full curve corresponding to the hyperk\"ahler quotient from the extended E_7 Dynkin diagram. As in the E_6 case discussed in the same paper above, the resulting curve is the same as the one obtained by Minahan and Nemeschansky. Our results seem to indicate that it is possible to define a generalized Coulomb branch such that four dimensional mirror symmetry would act by interchanging the generalized Coulomb branch with the Higgs branch of the dual theory. To understand these phenomena, we discuss mirror symmetry and F-theory compactifications probed by D3 branes.
