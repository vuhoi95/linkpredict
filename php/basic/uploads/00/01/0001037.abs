Title: Boundary states in Gepner models
Authors: Michihiro Naka and Masatoshi Nozaki
Abstract: We extend the construction of the boundary states in Gepner models to the non-diagonal modular invariant theories, and derive the same supersymmetric conditions as the diagonal theories. We also investigate the relation between the microscopic charges of the boundary states and Ramond charges of the B-type D-branes on the Calabi-Yau threefolds with one K\"ahler modulus in the large volume limit.
