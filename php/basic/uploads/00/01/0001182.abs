Title: Production of fermions in models of string cosmology
Authors: Ram Brustein and Merav Hadad
Abstract: Production of spin 1/2 fermions and gravitinos by the standard mechanism of amplification of quantum fluctuations during the dilaton-driven inflation phase in models of string cosmology is highly suppressed. Constraints on string cosmology models from gravitational production of gravitinos, contrary to expectations, are similar to constraints on other models.
