Title: Domain Walls and Superpotentials from M Theory on Calabi-Yau Three-Folds
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Sergei Gukov
Abstract: Compactification of M theory in the presence of G-fluxes yields N=2 five-dimensional gauged supergravity with a potential that lifts all supersymmetric vacua. We derive the effective superpotential directly from the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the eleven-dimensional action on a Calabi-Yau three-fold and compare it with the superpotential obtained by means of calibrations. We discuss an explicit domain wall solution, which represents five-branes wrapped over holomorphic cycles. This solution has a ``running volume'' and we comment on the possibility that quantum corrections provide a lower bound allowing for an AdS_5 vacuum of the 5-dimensional supergravity.
