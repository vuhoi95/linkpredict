Title: Star-Product and Massless Free Field Dynamics in $AdS_4$
Authors: K. I. Bolotin and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: Generic solution of free equations for massless fields of an arbitrary spin in $AdS_4$ is built in terms of the star-product algebra with spinor generating elements. A class of "plane wave" solutions is described explicitly.
