Title: Generalized Affine Coherent States: A Natural Framework for Quantization  of Metric-like Variables
Authors: Glenn Watson and John R. Klauder
Abstract: Affine variables, which have the virtue of preserving the positive-definite character of matrix-like objects, have been suggested as replacements for the canonical variables of standard quantization schemes, especially in the context of quantum gravity. We develop the kinematics of such variables, discussing suitable coherent states, their associated resolution of unity, polarizations, and finally the realization of the coherent-state overlap function in terms of suitable path-integral formulations.
