Title: Representations of (1,0) and (2,0) superconformal algebras in six  dimensions: massless and short superfields
Authors: Sergio Ferrara and Emery Sokatchev
Abstract: We construct unitary representations of (1,0) and (2,0) superconformal algebras in six dimensions by using superfields defined on harmonic superspaces with coset manifolds USp(2n)/[U(1)]^n, n=1,2. In the spirit of the AdS_7/CFT_6 correspondence massless conformal fields correspond to "supersingletons" in AdS_7. By tensoring them we produce all short representations corresponding to 1/2 and 1/4 BPS anti-de Sitter bulk states of which "massless bulk" representations are particular cases.
