Title: Non-abelian discrete gauge symmetries and inflation
Authors: J. D. Cohn and E. D. Stewart
Abstract: Obtaining a potential flat enough to provide slow roll inflation is often difficult when gravitational effects are included. Non-abelian discrete gauge symmetries can guarantee the flatness of the inflaton potential in this case, and also provide special field values where inflation can end.
