Title: Monopoles and Dyons in the Pure Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Yutaka Hosotani and Jefferson Bjoraker
Abstract: In the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions there exist monopole and dyon solutions. The spectrum of the solutions is discrete in asymptotically flat or de Sitter space, whereas it is continuous in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. The solutions are regular everywhere and specified with their mass, and non-Abelian electric and magnetic charges. In asymptotically anti-de Sitter space a class of monopole solutions have no node in non-Abelian magnetic fields, and are stable against spherically symmetric perturbations.
