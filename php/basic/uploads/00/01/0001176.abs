Title: Pre-Big Bang Cosmology and Quantum Fluctuations
Authors: A. Ghosh and G. Pollifrone and G. Veneziano
Abstract: The quantum fluctuations of a homogeneous, isotropic, open pre-big bang model are discussed. By solving exactly the equations for tensor and scalar perturbations we find that particle production is negligible during the perturbative Pre-Big Bang phase.
