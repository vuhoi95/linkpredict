Title: BRST Formalism and Zero Locus Reduction
Authors: M. A. Grigoriev and A. M. Semikhatov and I. Yu. Tipunin
Abstract: In the BRST quantization of gauge theories, the zero locus $Z_Q$ of the BRST differential $Q$ carries an (anti)bracket whose parity is opposite to that of the fundamental bracket. We show that the on-shell BFV/BV gauge symmetries are in a 1:1 correspondence with Hamiltonian vector fields on $Z_Q$, and observables of the BRST theory are in a 1:1 correspondence with characteristic functions of the bracket on $Z_Q$. By reduction to the zero locus, we obtain relations between bracket operations and differentials arising in different complexes (the Gerstenhaber, Schouten, Berezin-Kirillov, and Sklyanin brackets); the equation ensuring the existence of a nilpotent vector field on the reduced manifold can be the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We also generalize our constructions to the bi-QP-manifolds which from the BRST theory viewpoint corresponds to the BRST-anti-BRST-symmetric quantization.
