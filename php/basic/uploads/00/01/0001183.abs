Title: Type 0 Brane Inflation from Mirage Cosmology
Authors: E. Papantonopoulos and I. Pappa
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional brane-universe moving in a Type 0 String background. The motion induces on the brane a cosmological evolution which, for some range of the parameters, exhibits an inflationary phase.
