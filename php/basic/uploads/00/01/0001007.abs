Title: Integrable Structure of Interface Dynamics
Authors: Mark Mineev-Weinstein and Paul B. Wiegmann and Anton Zabrodin
Abstract: We establish the equivalence of a 2D contour dynamics to the dispersionless limit of the integrable Toda hierarchy constrained by a string equation. Remarkably, the same hierarchy underlies 2D quantum gravity.
