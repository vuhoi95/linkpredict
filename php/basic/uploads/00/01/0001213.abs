Title: Superconducting cosmic strings as gamma ray burst engines
Authors: V. Berezinsky and B. Hnatyk and A. Vilenkin
Abstract: Cusps of superconducting strings can serve as GRB engines. A powerful beamed pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a cusp produces a jet of accelerated particles, whose propagation is terminated by the shock responsible for GRB. A single free parameter, the string scale of symmetry breaking $\eta \sim 10^{14} GeV$, together with reasonable assumptions about the magnitude of cosmic magnetic fields and the fraction of volume that they occupy, explains the GRB rate, duration and fluence, as well as the observed ranges of these quantities. The wiggles on the string can drive the short-time structures of GRB. This model predicts that GRBs are accompanied by strong bursts of gravitational radiation which should be detectable by LIGO, VIRGO and LISA detectors.
