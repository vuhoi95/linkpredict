Title: Invariance Theorems for Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Savdeep Sethi and Mark Stern
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanical Yang-Mills theories with eight supercharges and a $Spin(5) \times SU(2)_R$ flavor symmetry. We show that all normalizable ground states in these gauge theories are invariant under this flavor symmetry. This includes, as a special case, all bound states of D0-branes and D4-branes. As a consequence, all bound states of D0-branes are invariant under the $Spin(9)$ flavor symmetry. When combined with index results, this implies that the bound state of two D0-branes is unique.
