Title: On electrodynamics of rapidly moving sources
Authors: R. Pettorino and G. A. Vilkovisky
Abstract: Rapidly moving sources create pairs in the vacuum and lose energy. In consequence of this, the velocity of a charged body cannot approach the speed of light closer than a certain limit which depends only on the coupling constant. The vacuum back-reaction secures the observance of the conservation laws. A source can lose up to 50% of energy and charge because of the vacuum instability.
