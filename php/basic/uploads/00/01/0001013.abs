Title: Gravity and the Newtonian limit in the Randall-Sundrum model
Authors: Rainer Dick and Dzo Mikulovic
Abstract: We point out that the gravitational evolution equations in the Randall-Sundrum model appear in a different form than hitherto assumed. As a consequence, the model yields a correct Newtonian limit in a novel manner.
