Authors: V. Fateev and A. Zamolodchikov and Al. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory is considered with conformal boundary. There is a family of conformal boundary conditions parameterized by the boundary cosmological constant, so that observables depend on the dimensional ratios of boundary and bulk cosmological constants. The disk geometry is considered. We present an explicit expression for the expectation value of a bulk operator inside the disk and for the two-point function of boundary operators. We comment also on the properties of the degenrate boundary operators. Possible applications and further developments are discussed. In particular, we present exact expectation values of the boundary operators in the boundary sin-Gordon model.
