Title: Bundles of chiral blocks and boundary conditions in CFT
Authors: J. Fuchs and C. Schweigert
Abstract: Various aspects of spaces of chiral blocks are discussed. In particular, conjectures about the dimensions of irreducible sub-bundles are reviewed and their relation to symmetry breaking conformal boundary conditions is outlined.
