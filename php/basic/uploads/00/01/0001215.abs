Title: A Note on UV/IR for Noncommutative Complex Scalar Field
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and D. M. Belov and A. S. Koshelev
Abstract: Noncommutative quantum field theory of a complex scalar field is considered. There is a two-coupling noncommutative analogue of U(1)-invariant quartic interaction $(\phi^*\phi)^2$, namely $A\phi^*\star\phi\star\phi^*\star\phi+ B\phi^*\star\phi^*\star\phi\star\phi$. For arbitrary values of $A$ and $B$ the model is nonrenormalizable. However, it is one-loop renormalizable in two special cases: B=0 and $A=B$. Furthermore, in the case B=0 the model does not suffer from IR divergencies at least at one-loop insertions level.
