Title: TeV Strings and Collider Probes of Large Extra Dimensions
Authors: Schuyler Cullen and Maxim Perelstein and Michael E. Peskin
Abstract: Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali have proposed that the fundamental gravitational scale is close to 1 TeV, and that the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is explained by the presence of large extra compact dimensions. If this scenario is realized in a string theory of quantum gravity, the string excited states of Standard Model particles will also have TeV masses. These states will be visible to experiment and in fact provide the first signatures of the presence of a low quantum gravity scale. Their presence also affects the more familiar signatures due to real and virtual graviton emission. We study the effects of these states in a simple string model.
