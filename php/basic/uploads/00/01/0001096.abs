Title: Scalar Tensor Theories and Hadamard State Condition
Authors: H. Salehi and Y. Bisabr and H. Ghafarnejad
Abstract: The Hadamard state condition is used to analyze the local constraints on the two-point function of a quantum field conformally coupled to a background geometry. Using these constraints we develop a scalar tensor theory which controls the coupling of the stress-tensor induced by the two-point function of the quantum field to the conformal class of the background metric. It is then argued that the determination of the state-dependent part of the two-point function is connected with the determination of a conformal frame. We comment on a particular way to relate the theory to a specific conformal frame (different from the background frame) in which the large scale properties are brought into focus.
