Title: Discrete Torsion, AdS/CFT and duality
Authors: David Berenstein and Robert G. Leigh
Abstract: We analyse D-branes on orbifolds with discrete torsion, extending earlier results. We analyze certain Abelian orbifolds of the type C^3/ \Gamma, where \Gamma is given by Z_m x Z_n, for the most general choice of discrete torsion parameter. By comparing with the AdS/CFT correspondence, we can consider different geometries which give rise to the same physics. This identifies new mirror pairs and suggests new dualities at large N. As a by-product we also get a more geometric picture of discrete torsion.
