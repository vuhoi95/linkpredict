Title: Double Elliptic Systems: Problems and Perspectives
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: This talk presents a list of problems related to the double-elliptic (Dell) integrable systems with elliptic dependence on both momenta and coordinates. As expected, in the framework of Seiberg-Witten theory the recently discovered explicit self-dual family of 2-particle Dell Hamiltonians provides a perturbative period matrix which is a logarithm of the ratio of the (momentum-space) theta-functions.
