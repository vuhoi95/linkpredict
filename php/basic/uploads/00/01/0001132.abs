Title: D-branes at Singular Curves of Calabi-Yau Compactifications
Authors: Ilka Brunner and Volker Schomerus
Abstract: We study the Gepner model description of D-branes in Calabi-Yau manifolds with singular curves. From a geometrical point of view, the resolution of singularities leads to additional homology cycles around which branes can wrap. Using techniques from conformal field theory we address the construction of boundary states for branes wrapping additional 3-cycles on the resolved Calabi-Yau manifold. Explicit formulas are provided for Z_2 singular curves.
