Title: Actions for Biconformal Matter
Authors: Andre Wehner and James T. Wheeler
Abstract: We extend 2n-dim biconformal gauge theory by including Lorentz-scalar matter fields of arbitrary conformal weight. For a massless scalar field of conformal weight zero in a torsion-free biconformal geometry, the solution is determined by the Einstein equation on an n-dim submanifold, with the stress-energy tensor of the scalar field as source. The matter field satisfies the n-dim Klein-Gordon equation.
