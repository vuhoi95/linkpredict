Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Gary W. Gibbons and Christopher M. Hull and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We find the combinations of momentum and domain-wall charges corresponding to BPS states preserving 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 of D=4 N=1 supersymmetry, and we show how the supersymmetry algebra implies their stability. These states form the boundary of the convex cone associated with the Jordan algebra of $4\times 4$ real symmetric matrices, and we explore some implications of the associated geometry. For the Wess-Zumino model we derive the conditions for preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry when one of two parallel domain-walls is rotated and in addition show that this model does not admit any classical configurations with 3/4 supersymmetry. Our analysis also provides information about BPS states of N=1 D=4 anti-de Sitter supersymmetry.
