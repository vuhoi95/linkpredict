Title: Fermion in the Nonabelian Gauge Field Theory in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: V. Ch. Zhukovsky and N. A. Peskov
Abstract: The massive SU(2) gauge field theory coupled with fermions is considered in 2+1 dimensions. Quark energy spectrum and radiative shift in constant external nonabelian field, being exact solution of the gauge field equations with the Chern-Simons term, are calculated. Under the condition $m = \theta/4$ the quark state is shown to be supersymmetric.
