Title: Algebraic Linearization of Dynamics of Calogero Type for any Coxeter  Group
Authors: R. Caseiro and J. -P. Francoise and R. Sasaki
Abstract: Calogero-Moser systems can be generalized for any root system (including the non-crystallographic cases). The algebraic linearization of the generalized Calogero-Moser systems and of their quadratic (resp. quartic) perturbations are discussed.
