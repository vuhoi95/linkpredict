Title: Open strings, Born--Infeld action and the heat kernel
Authors: W. Kummer and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: In the derivation of the Born-Infeld action for the case with a nontrivial boundary of the string world sheet the appearance of a new term changes the conformal anomaly. This may have many consequences, especially also in the study of generalized interacting brane systems.
