Title: Dynamics of a string coupled to gravitational waves - Gravitational wave  scattering by a Nambu-Goto straight string
Authors: Kouji Nakamura and Akihiro Ishibashi and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: We study the perturbative dynamics of an infinite gravitating Nambu-Goto string within the general-relativistic perturbation framework. We develop the gauge invariant metric perturbation on a spacetime containing a self-gravitating straight string with a finite thickness and solve the linearized Einstein equation. In the thin string case, we show that the string does not emit gravitational waves by its free oscillation in the first order with respect to its oscillation amplitude, nevertheless the string actually bends when the incidental gravitational waves go through it.
