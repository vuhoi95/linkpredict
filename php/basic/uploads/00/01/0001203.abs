Title: Gauge Theory on Noncommutative Spaces
Authors: John Madore and Stefan Schraml and Peter Schupp and Julius Wess
Abstract: We introduce a formulation of gauge theory on noncommutative spaces based on the concept of covariant coordinates. Some important examples are discussed in detail. A Seiberg-Witten map is established in all cases.
