Title: The Discrete and Continuous Painleve VI Hierarchy and the Garnier  Systems
Authors: F. W. Nijhoff and A. J. Walker
Abstract: We present a general scheme to derive higher-order members of the Painleve VI (PVI) hierarchy of ODE's as well as their difference analogues. The derivation is based on a discrete structure that sits on the background of the PVI equation and that consists of a system of partial difference equations on a multidimensional lattice. The connection with the isomonodromic Garnier systems is discussed.
