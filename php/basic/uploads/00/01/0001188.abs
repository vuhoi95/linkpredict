Title: Spectra of massive and massless QCD Dirac operators: A novel link
Authors: G. Akemann and E. Kanzieper
Abstract: We show that integrable structure of chiral random matrix models incorporating global symmetries of QCD Dirac operators (labeled by the Dyson index beta=1,2, and 4) leads to emergence of a connection relation between the spectral statistics of massive and massless Dirac operators. This novel link established for beta-fold degenerate massive fermions is used to explicitly derive (and prove the random matrix universality of) statistics of low--lying eigenvalues of QCD Dirac operators in the presence of SU(2) massive fermions in the fundamental representation (beta=1) and SU(N_c >= 2) massive adjoint fermions (beta=4). Comparison with available lattice data for SU(2) dynamical staggered fermions reveals a good agreement.
