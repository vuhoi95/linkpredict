Title: Partial supersymmetry breaking in Multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM
Authors: E. E. Donets and A. Pashnev and J. J. Rosales and M. Tsulaia
Abstract: The multidimensional N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) is constructed and the various possibilities for partial supersymmetry breaking are discussed. It is shown that quantum mechanical models with one quarter, one half and three quarters of unbroken(broken) supersymmetries can exist in the framework of the multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM.
