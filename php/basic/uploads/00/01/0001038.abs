Title: Difference equations for the higher rank XXZ model with a boundary
Authors: T. Kojima and Y. -H. Quano
Abstract: The higher rank analogue of the XXZ model with a boundary is considered on the basis of the vertex operator approach. We derive difference equations of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type for 2N-point correlations of the model. We present infinite product formulae of two point functions with free boundary condition by solving those difference equations with N=1.
