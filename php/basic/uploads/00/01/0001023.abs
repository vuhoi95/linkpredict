Title: A mixed mean-field/BCS phase with an energy gap at high $T_c$
Authors: N. Ilieva and W. Thirring
Abstract: We construct a pair potential which in a scaling limit leads to a Hamiltonian that generates co-existing mean-field and superconducting phases. Depending on the relative values of the coupling constants, the superconducting phase may exist at arbitrarily high temperatures.
