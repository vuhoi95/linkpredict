Title: Critical properties of the double-frequency sine-Gordon model with  applications
Authors: M. Fabrizio and A. O. Gogolin and A. A. Nersesyan
Abstract: We study the properties of the double-frequency sine--Gordon model in the vicinity of the Ising quantum phase transition displayed by this model. Using a mapping onto a generalised lattice quantum Ashkin-Teller model, we obtain critical and nearly-off-critical correlation functions of various operators. We discuss applications of the double-sine-Gordon model to one-dimensional physical systems, like spin chains in a staggered external field and interacting electrons in a staggered potential.
