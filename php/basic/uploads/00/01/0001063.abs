Title: Multiparticle SUSY quantum mechanics and the representations of  permutation group
Authors: M. V. Ioffe and A. I. Neelov
Abstract: The method of multidimensional SUSY Quantum Mechanics is applied to the investigation of supersymmetrical N-particle systems on a line for the case of separable center-of-mass motion. New decompositions of the superhamiltonian into block-diagonal form with elementary matrix components are constructed. Matrices of coefficients of these minimal blocks are shown to coincide with matrices of irreducible representations of permutations group S_N, which correspond to the Young tableaux (N-M,1^M). The connections with known generalizations of N-particle Calogero and Sutherland models are established.
