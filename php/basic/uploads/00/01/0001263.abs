Title: Localization-delocalization transition in disordered systems with a  direction
Authors: A. V. Kolesnikov and K. B. Efetov
Abstract: Using the supersymmetry technique, we study the localization-delocalization transition in quasi-one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with a direction. In contrast to chains, our model captures the diffusive character of carriers' motion at short distances. We calculate the joint probability of complex eigenvalues and some other correlation functions. We find that the transition is abrupt and occurs as a result of an interplay between two saddle-points in the free energy functional.
