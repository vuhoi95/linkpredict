Title: Dual generalizations of sine-Gordon field theory and integrability  submanifolds in parameter space
Authors: P. Baseilhac and D. Reynaud
Abstract: The dual relationship between two n-1 parameter families of quantum field theories based on extended complex numbers is investigated in two dimensions. The non-local conserved charges approach is used. The lowest rank affine Toda field theories are generated and identified as integrability submanifolds in parameter space. A truncation of the model leads to a conformal field theory in extended complex space. Depending on the projection over usual complex space chosen, a parametrized central charge is calculated.
