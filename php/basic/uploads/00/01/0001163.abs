Title: Hopf instantons and the Liouville equation in target space
Authors: C. Adam and B. Muratori and C. Nash
Abstract: We generalise recent results on Hopf instantons in a Chern--Simons and Fermion theory in a fixed background magnetic field. We find that these instanton solutions have to obey the Liouville equation in target space. As a consequence, these solutions are given by a class of Hopf maps that consist of the composition of the standard Hopf map with an arbitrary rational map.
