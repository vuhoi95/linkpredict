Title: D-branes in AdS_3xS^3xS^3xS^1
Authors: JM Figueroa-O'Farrill and S Stanciu
Abstract: We analyse the possible D-brane configurations in an AdS_3xS^3xS^3xS^1 background with a NS-NS B field, by using the boundary state formalism. We study their geometry and we determine the fraction of spacetime supersymmetry preserved by these solutions.
