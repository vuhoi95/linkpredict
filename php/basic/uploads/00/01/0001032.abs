Title: Noncommutative Yang-Mills from equivalence of star products
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Peter Schupp
Abstract: It is shown that the transformation between ordinary and noncommutative Yang-Mills theory as formulated by Seiberg and Witten is due to the equivalence of certain star products on the D-brane world-volume.
