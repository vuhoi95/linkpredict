Abstract: We consider the model of a massless charged scalar field, in (2+1) dimensions, with a self interaction of the form $lambda (\phi^* \phi)^3$ and interacting with a Chern Simons field. We calculate the renormalization group $\beta$ functions of the coupling constants and the anomalous dimensions $\gamma$ of the basic fields. We show that the interaction with the Chern Simons field implies in a $\beta_{\lambda}$ which suggests that a dynamical symmetry breakdown occurs. We also study the effect of the Chern Simons field on the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators $(\phi^* \phi)^n$, getting the result that their operator dimensions are lowered.
