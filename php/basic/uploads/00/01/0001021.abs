Title: A Two-loop Test of Buscher's T-duality I
Authors: Zalan Horvath and Robert L. Karp and Laszlo Palla
Abstract: We study the two loop quantum equivalence of sigma models related by Buscher's T-duality transformation. The computation of the two loop perturbative free energy density is performed in the case of a certain deformation of the SU(2) principal sigma model, and its T-dual, using dimensional regularization and the geometric sigma model perturbation theory. We obtain agreement between the free energy density expressions of the two models.
