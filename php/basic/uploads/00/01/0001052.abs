Title: On the Schrodinger Equation for the Minisuperspace Models
Authors: V. I. Tkach and A. Pashnev and J. J. Rosales
Abstract: We obtain a time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the Friedmann - Robertson - Walker (FRW) model interacting with a homogeneous scalar matter field. We show that for this purpose it is necesary to include an additional action invariant under the reparametrization of time. The last one does not change the equations of motion of the system, but changes only the constraint which at the quantum level becomes time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The same procedure is applied to the supersymmetric case and the supersymmetric quantum constraints are obtained, one of them is a square root of the Schrodinger operator.
