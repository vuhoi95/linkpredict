Title: Massive chiral random matrix ensembles at beta = 1 & 4 : Finite-volume  QCD partition functions
Authors: T. Nagao and S. M. Nishigaki
Abstract: In a deep-infrared (ergodic) regime, QCD coupled to massive pseudoreal and real quarks are described by chiral orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using this correspondence, general expressions for the QCD partition functions are derived in terms of microscopically rescaled mass variables. In limited cases, correlation functions of Dirac eigenvalues and distributions of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue are given as ratios of these partition functions. When all masses are degenerate, our results reproduce the known expressions for the partition functions of zero-dimensional sigma models.
