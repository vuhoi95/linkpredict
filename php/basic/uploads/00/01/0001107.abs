Title: Randall-Sundrum Gauge in the Brane World
Authors: Y. S. Myung and Gungwon Kang and H. W. Lee
Abstract: We discuss the Randall-Sundrum (RS) choice for $h_{MN}$ in the brane-world. We begin with the de Donder gauge (transverse-tracefree) including scalar($h_{55}$), vector($h_{5\mu}$) and tensor($h_{\mu\nu}$) in five dimensions for comparison. One finds that $h_{55}=0$ and $h_{5\mu}=0$. This leads to the RS choice. It appears that the RS choice is so restrictive for the five massless states, whereas it is unique for describing the massive states. Furthermore, one can establish the stability of the RS solution with the RS choice only.
