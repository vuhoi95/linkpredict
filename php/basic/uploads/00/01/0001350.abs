Title: Heisenberg frustrated magnets: a nonperturbative approach
Authors: M. Tissier and B. Delamotte and D. Mouhanna
Abstract: Frustrated magnets are a notorious example where the usual perturbative methods are in conflict. Using a nonperturbative Wilson-like approach, we get a coherent picture of the physics of Heisenberg frustrated magnets everywhere between $d=2$ and $d=4$. We recover all known perturbative results in a single framework and find the transition to be weakly first order in $d=3$. We compute effective exponents in good agreement with numerical and experimental data.
