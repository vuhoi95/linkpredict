Title: Quantum-Induced Soft Supersymmetry Breaking In Supergravity
Authors: Mary K. Gaillard and Brent Nelson
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop quantum contributions to soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the scalar potential in supergravity theories regulated \`a la Pauli-Villars. We find ``universal'' contributions, independent of the regulator masses and tree level soft supersymmetry breaking, that contribute gaugino masses and A-terms equal to the ``anomaly mediated'' contributions found in analyses using spurion techniques, as well as a scalar mass term not identified in those analyses. The universal terms are in general modified -- and in some cases canceled -- by model-dependent terms. Under certain restrictions on the couplings we recover the one-loop results of previous ``anomaly mediated'' supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We emphasize the model dependence of loop-induced soft terms in the potential, which are much more sensitive to the details of Planck scale physics then are the one-loop contributions to gaugino masses. We discuss the relation of our results to previous analyses.
