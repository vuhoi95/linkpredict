Title: Confinement in a Model with Condensate of the Scalar Field
Authors: V. E. Kuzmichev and V. V. Kuzmichev
Abstract: The idea of ``soft'' confinement when the lifetime of hadron with respect to quark-gluon channel of decay is greater or at least of the order of some characteristic time for our Universe is considered. Within the framework of a model of three nonlinearly interacting fields the explicit form of an effective potential is found. It provides the confinement of a massive particle within the limited region of space by means of constant component of the potential which arises as a result of reorganization of vacuum of one of the scalar fields. It is shown that the lifetime of hadron being equal to the age of the Universe leads to the Higgs boson with the mass m > 63.7 GeV and realistic self-constant.
