Title: Cosmology in the Randall-Sundrum Brane World Scenario
Authors: Horace Stoica and S. -H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman
Abstract: The cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a positive tension brane in a 5-D Universe with localized gravity has been studied extensively recently. Here we extend it to more general situations. We consider the time-dependent situation where the two sides of the brane are different AdS/Schwarzschild spaces. We show that the expansion rate in these models during inflation could be larger than in brane worlds with compactified extra dimensions of fixed size. The enhanced expansion rate could lead to the production of density perturbations of substantially larger amplitude.
