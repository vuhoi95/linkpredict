Title: Evaporation of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
Authors: Alessandro Fabbri and Diego J. Navarro and Jose Navarro-Salas
Abstract: The formation of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in the S-wave approximation can be described, near the event horizon, by an effective solvable model. The corresponding one-loop quantum theory remains solvable and allows to follow analytically the evaporation process which is shown to require an infinite amount of time.
