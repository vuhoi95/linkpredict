Title: Classical Geometry from a Physical State in Canonical Quantum Gravity
Authors: Yongge Ma and Yi Ling
Abstract: We construct a weave state which approximates a degenerate 3-metric of rank 2 at large scales. It turns out that a non-degenerate metric region can be evolved from this degenerate metric by the classical Ashtekar equations, hence the degeneracy of 3-metrics is not preserved by the evolution of Ashtekar's equations. As the s-knot state corresponding to this weave is shown to solve all the quantum constraints in loop quantum gravity, a physical state in canonical quantum gravity is related to the familiar classical geometry.
