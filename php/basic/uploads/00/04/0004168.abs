Title: Non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm Scattering of Spin 1/2 Particles
Authors: M. Gomes and L. C. Malacarne and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We study the low energy regime of the scattering of two fermionic particles carrying isospin 1/2 and interacting through a non-Abelian Chern-Simons field. We calculate the one-loop scattering amplitude for both the nonrelativistic and also for the relativistic theory. In the relativistic case we introduce an intermediate cutoff, separating the regions with low and high loop momenta integration. In this procedure purely relativistic field theory effects as the vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic moment corrections are automatically incorporated.
