Title: Dyons with axial symmetry
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We construct axially symmetric dyons in SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. In the Prasad-Sommerfield limit, they are obtained via scaling relations from axially symmetric multimonopole solutions. For finite Higgs self-coupling they are constructed numerically.
