Title: Chiral forms and their deformations
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Marc Henneaux and Alexander Sevrin
Abstract: We systematically study deformations of chiral forms with applications to string theory in mind. To first order in the coupling constant, this problem can be translated into the calculation of the local BRST cohomological group at ghost number zero. We completely solve this cohomology and present detailed proofs of results announced in a previous letter. In particular, we show that there is no room for non-abelian, local, deformations of a pure system of chiral p-forms.
