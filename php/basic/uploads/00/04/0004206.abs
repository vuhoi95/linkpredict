Title: Self-tuning in an Outgoing Brane Wave Model
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Ian Low and A. Zee
Abstract: We introduce a new brane-world model in which the bulk solution consists of outgoing plane waves. This is an exact solution to string theory with no naked singularities. The recently discussed self-tuning mechanism to cancel the cosmological constant on a brane is naturally incorporated. We show that even if the vacuum energy on the brane changes, e.g. due to a phase transition, the brane geometry remains insensitive to the local vacuum energy. We also consider the static self-tuning branes introduced earlier, and find a solution in which the brane geometry starts to contract when the vacuum energy on the brane changes.
