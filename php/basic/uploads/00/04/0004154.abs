Title: Two dimensional fractional supersymmetric conformal field theories and  the two point functions
Authors: Fardin Kheirandish and Mohammad Khorrami
Abstract: A general two dimensional fractional supersymmetric conformal field theory is investigated. The structure of the symmetries of the theory is studied. Then, applying the generators of the closed subalgebra generated by $(L_{-1}, L_{0}, G_{-1/3})$ and $(\bar{L}_{-1}, \bar{L}_{0}, \bar{G}_{-1/3})$, the two point functions of the component fields of supermultiplets are calculated.
