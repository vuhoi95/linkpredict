Title: String Scale in Noncommutative Yang-Mills
Authors: N. Ishibashi and S. Iso and H. Kawai and Y. Kitazawa
Abstract: We identify the effective string scale of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory (NCYM) with the noncommutativity scale through its dual supergravity description. We argue that Newton's force law may be obtained with 4 dimensional NCYM with maximal SUSY. It provides a nonperturbative compactification mechanism of IIB matrix model. We can associate NCYM with the von Neumann lattice by the bi-local representation. We argue that it is superstring theory on the von Neumann lattice. We show that our identification of its effective string scale is consistent with exact T-duality (Morita equivalence) of NCYM.
