Title: Many Body Problems with "Spin"-Related Contact Interactions
Authors: S. Albeverio and S. M. Fei and P. Kurasov
Abstract: We study quantum mechanical systems with "spin"-related contact interactions in one dimension. The boundary conditions describing the contact interactions are dependent on the spin states of the particles. In particular we investigate the integrability of $N$-body systems with $\delta$-interactions and point spin couplings. Bethe ansatz solutions, bound states and scattering matrices are explicitly given. The cases of generalized separated boundary condition and some Hamiltonian operators corresponding to special spin related boundary conditions are also discussed.
