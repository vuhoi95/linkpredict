Title: Form Factors of the Homogeneous Sine-Gordon models
Authors: O. A. Castro-Alvaredo and A. Fring and C. Korff
Abstract: We provide general determinant formulae for all n-particle form factors related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor and the analogue of the order and disorder operator in the $SU(3)_2$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model. We employ the form factors related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor in the application of the c-theorem and find perfect agreement with the physical picture recently obtained by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. For finite resonance parameter we recover the expected WZNW-coset central charge and for infinite resonance parameter the theory decouples into two free fermions.
