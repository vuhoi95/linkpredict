Title: General matter coupled N=2, D=5 gauged supergravity
Authors: A. Ceresole and G. Dall'Agata
Abstract: We give the full lagrangean and supersymmetry transformation rules for D=5, N=2 supergravity interacting with an arbitrary number of vector, tensor and hyper-multiplets, with gauging of the R-symmetry group SU(2)_R as well as a subgroup K of the isometries of the scalar manifold. Among the many possible applications, this theory provides the setting where a supersymmetric brane-world scenario could occur. We comment on the presence of AdS vacua and BPS solutions that would be relevant towards a supersymmetric smooth realization of the Randall-Sundrum "alternative to compactification". We also add some remarks on the connection between this most general 5D fully coupled supergravity model and type IIB theory on the T^{11} manifold.
