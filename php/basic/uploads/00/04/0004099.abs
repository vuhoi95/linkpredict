Title: Properties of the massive Thirring model from the XYZ spin chain
Authors: Marko Kolanovic and Silvio Pallua and Predrag Prester
Abstract: We consider here the massive Thirring model regularized with the XYZ spin chain. We numerically calculate the mass ratios of particles which lie in the discrete part of the spectrum and obtain results in accordance with the DHN formula and in disagreement with recent calculations in the literature based on the numerical Bethe ansatz and infinite momentum frame methods. We also analyze the short distance behavior of these states and evaluate the conformal dimensions. This paper, taken together with the previous one for the sine-Gordon model, confirms the duality relation between two models formulated by Klassen and Melzer [Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 8, 4131 (1993)].
