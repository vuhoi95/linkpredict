Title: Various Modified Solutions of the Randall-Sundrum Model with the  Gauss-Bonnet Interaction
Authors: Jihn E. Kim and Bumseok Kyae and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: The Gauss-Bonnet interaction is the only consistent quadratic interaction below the Planck scale in the Randall-Sundrum compactification. We study various static and inflationary solutions including this Gauss-Bonnet interaction.
