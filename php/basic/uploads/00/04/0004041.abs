Title: Comment on Casimir energy for spherical boundaries
Authors: I. Brevik and B. Jensen and K. A. Milton
Abstract: It is shown that recent criticism by C. R. Hagen (hep-th/9902057) questioning the validity of stress tensor treatments of the Casimir energy for space divided into two parts by a spherical boundary is without foundation.
