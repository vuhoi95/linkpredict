Title: Dynamical Mass and Parity Condensate in Varying Topological Mass
Authors: Toyoki Matsuyama and Hideko Nagahiro
Abstract: We investigate how a dynamical mass of a fermion is affected by a topological mass of a gauge field in a Maxwell-Chern-Simons $QED_3$ coupled with a two-component fermion. The dynamical mass and also a parity condensate are estimated by using a non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson method. In particular, we study a limit of vanishing the topological mass in detail and clarify a linking between theories with and without a Chern-Simons term in a non-perturbative level.
