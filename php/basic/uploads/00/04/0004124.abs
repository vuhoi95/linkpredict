Title: Naked Singularity and Gauss-Bonnet Term in Brane World Scenarios
Authors: Ian Low and A. Zee
Abstract: We add a Gauss-Bonnet term to the Einstein-Hilbert action and study the recent proposal to solve the cosmological constant problem. We also consider the possibility of adding a dilaton potential to the action. In the absence of supersymmetry, we obtain first order Bogomol'nyi equation as a solution-generating method in our scenario. When the coefficient of the Gauss-Bonnet term is positive, the dilaton potential is bounded below. Assuming a simple double-well potential, the dilaton field is found to be a kink in the fifth dimension.
