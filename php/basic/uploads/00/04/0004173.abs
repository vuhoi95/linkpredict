Title: Berry Connections and Induced Gauge Fields in Quantum Mechanics on  Sphere
Authors: H. Ikemori and S. Kitakado and H. Otsu and T. Sato
Abstract: Quantum mechanics on sphere $S^{n}$ is studied from the viewpoint that the Berry's connection has to appear as a topological term in the effective action. Furthermore we show that this term is the Chern-Simons term of gauge variables that correspond to the extra degrees of freedom of the enlarged space.
