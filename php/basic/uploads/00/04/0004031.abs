Title: ADM Worldvolume Geometry
Authors: Riccardo Capovilla and Jemal Guven and Efrain Rojas
Abstract: We describe the dynamics of a relativistic extended object in terms of the geometry of a configuration of constant time. This involves an adaptation of the ADM formulation of canonical general relativity. We apply the formalism to the hamiltonian formulation of a Dirac-Nambu-Goto relativistic extended object in an arbitrary background spacetime.
