Title: Gravitating BIon and BIon black hole with dilaton
Authors: Takashi Tamaki and Takashi Torii
Abstract: We construct static and spherically symmetric particle-like and black hole solutions with magnetic or electric charge in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton system, which is a generalization of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) system and of the Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) system. They have remarkable properties which are not seen for the corresponding solutions in the EBI and the EMD system.
