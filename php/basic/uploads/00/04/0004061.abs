Title: Entropies of Rotating Charged Black Holes from Conformal Field Theory at  Killing Horizons
Authors: Jiliang Jing and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: The covariant phase technique is used to compute the constraint algebra of the stationary axisymmetric charged black hole. A standard Virasoro subalgebra with corresponding central charge is constructed at a Killing horizon with Carlip's boundary conditions. For the Kerr-Newman black hole and the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole, the density of states determined by conformal fields theory methods yields the statistical entropy which agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
