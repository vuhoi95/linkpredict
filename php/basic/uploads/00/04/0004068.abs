Title: Black Holes with Zero Mass
Authors: Ulises Nucamendi and Daniel Sudarsky
Abstract: We consider the spacetimes corresponding to static Global Monopoles with interior boundaries corresponding to a Black Hole Horizon and analyze the behavior of the appropriate ADM mass as a function of the horizon radius r_H. We find that for small enough r_H, this mass is negative as in the case of the regular global monopoles, but that for large enough r_H the mass becomes positive encountering an intermediate value for which we have a Black Hole with zero ADM mass.
