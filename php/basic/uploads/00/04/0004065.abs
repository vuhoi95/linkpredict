Abstract: We consider the elastic scattering and bound states of charged quantum particles moving in the Aharonov-Bohm and an attractive $\rho^{-2}$ potential in a partial wave approach. Radial solutions of the stationary Schr\"{o}dinger equation are specified in such a way that the Hamiltonian of the problem is self-adjoint. It is shown that they are not uniquely fixed but depend on open parameters. The related physical consequences are discussed. The scattering cross section is calculated and the energy spectrum of bound states is obtained.
