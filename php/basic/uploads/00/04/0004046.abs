Title: Irreducible Hamiltonian BRST symmetry for reducible first-class systems
Authors: C. Bizdadea and E. M. Cioroianu and S. O. Saliu
Abstract: An irreducible Hamiltonian BRST quantization method for reducible first-class systems is proposed. The general theory is illustrated on a two-stage reducible model, the link with the standard reducible BRST treatment being also emphasized.
