Title: Low Energy Theory for 2 flavors at High Density QCD
Authors: R. Casalbuoni and Z. Duan and F. Sannino
Abstract: We construct the effective Lagrangian describing the low energy excitations for Quantum Chromodynamics with two flavors at high density. The non-linear realization framework is employed to properly construct the low energy effective theory. The light degrees of freedom, as required by 't Hooft anomaly conditions, contain massless fermions which we properly include in the effective Lagrangian. We also provide a discussion of the linearly realized Lagrangian.
