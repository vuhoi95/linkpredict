Title: A Semi-Infinite Construction of Unitary N=2 Modules
Authors: BL Feigin and AM Semikhatov and IYu Tipunin
Abstract: We show that each unitary representation of the N=2 superVirasoro algebra can be realized in terms of ``collective excitations'' over a filled Dirac sea of fermionic operators satisfying a generalized exclusion principle. These are semi-infinite forms in the modes of one of the fermionic currents. The constraints imposed on the fermionic operators have a counterpart in the form of a model one-dimensional lattice system, studying which allows us to prove the existence of a remarkable monomial basis in the semi-infinite space. This leads to a Rogers--Ramanujan-like character formula. We construct the N=2 action on the semi-infinite space using a filtration by finite-dimensional subspaces (the structure of which is related to the supernomial coefficients); the main technical tool is provided by the dual functional realization. As an application, we identify the coinvariants with the dual to a space of meromorphic functions on products of punctured Riemann surfaces with a prescribed behaviour on multiple diagonals. For products of punctured $CP^1$, such spaces are related to the unitary N=2 fusion algebra, for which we also give an independent derivation.
