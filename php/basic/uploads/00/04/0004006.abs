Title: Thermal correlators of anyons in two dimensions
Authors: N. Ilieva and H. Narnhofer and W. Thirring
Abstract: The anyon fields have trivial $\alpha$-commutator for $\alpha$ not integer. For integer $\alpha$ the commutators become temperature-dependent operator valued distributions. The $n$-point functions do not factorize as for quasifree states.
