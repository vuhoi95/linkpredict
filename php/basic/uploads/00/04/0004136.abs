Title: Intersecting domain walls in MQCD
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Gary W. Gibbons and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: We argue that MQCD admits intersecting domain walls that are realized as Cayley calibrations of the MQCD M5-brane. We discuss various dual realizations and comment on how branes can realise domain walls in N=1 supersymmetric theories in D=3.
