Title: CP violation including universal one-loop corrections and heterotic  M-theory
Authors: D. Bailin and G. V. Kraniotis and A. Love
Abstract: CP violation by soft supersymmetry-breaking terms in orbifold compactifications is investigated. We include the universal part of the moduli-dependent threshold corrections in the construction of the non-perturbative effective potential due to gaugino-condensation. This allows interpolation of the magnitude of CP violating phases between the weakly and strongly coupled regimes. We find that the universal threshold corrections have a large effect on the CP violating phases in the weakly coupled regime.
