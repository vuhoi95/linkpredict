Title: Chamseddine, Fr√∂hlich, Grandjean Metric and Localized Higgs Coupling  on Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: R. Kuriki and A. Sugamoto
Abstract: We propose a geometrized Higgs mechanism based on the gravitational sector in the Connes-Lott formulation of the standard model, which has been constructed by Chamseddine, Fr$\ddot{o}$hlic and Grandjean. The point of our idea is that Higgs-like couplings depend on the local coordinates of the four-dimensional continuum,$M_4$. The localized couplings can be calculated by the Wilson loops of the $U(1)_{EM}$ gauge field and the connection, which is defined on $Z_2\times{M_4}$.
