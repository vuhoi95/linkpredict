Title: Logarithms of alpha in QED bound states from the renormalization group
Authors: Aneesh V. Manohar and Iain W. Stewart
Abstract: The velocity renormalization group is used to determine ln(alpha) contributions to QED bound state energies. The leading order anomalous dimension for the potential gives the alpha^5 ln(alpha) Bethe logarithm in the Lamb shift. The next-to-leading order anomalous dimension determines the alpha^6 ln(alpha), alpha^7 ln^2(alpha), and alpha^8 ln^3 (alpha) corrections to the energy. These are used to obtain the alpha^8 ln^3(alpha) Lamb shift and alpha^7 ln^2(alpha) hyperfine splitting for Hydrogen, muonium and positronium, as well as the alpha^2 ln(alpha) and alpha^3 ln^2(alpha) corrections to the ortho- and para-positronium lifetimes.
