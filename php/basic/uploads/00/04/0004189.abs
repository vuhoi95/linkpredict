Title: Logarithmic Behaviours in the Feigin-Fuchs Construction of the c=-2  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Hiroki Hata and Shun-ichi Yamaguchi
Abstract: We obtain logarithmic behaviours of a four-point correlation function in the c=-2 conformal field theory by using the Feigin-Fuchs construction. It becomes an indeterminate form by a naive evaluation, but is obtained by introducing an appropriate regularization procedure.
