Title: Mirror symmetry by O3-planes
Authors: Bo Feng and Amihay Hanany
Abstract: We construct the three dimensional mirror theory of SO(2k) and SO(2k+1) gauge groups by using O3-planes. An essential ingredient in constructing the mirror is the splitting of a physical brane (NS-brane or D5-brane) on O3-planes. In particular, matching the dimensions of moduli spaces of mirror pair (for example, the SO(2k+1) and its mirror) there is a D3-brane creation or annihilation accompanying the splitting. This novel dynamical process gives a nontrivial prediction for strongly coupled field theories, which will be very interesting to check by Seiberg-Witten curves. Furthermore, applying the same idea, we revisit the mirror theory of Sp(k) gauge group and find new mirrors which differ from previously known results. Our new result for Sp(k) gives another example to a previously observed fact, which shows that different theories can be mirror to the same theory. We also discussed the phenomena such as "hidden FI-parameters" when the number of flavors and the rank of the gauge group satisfy certain relations, ``incomplete Higgsing'' for the mirror of SO(2k+1) and the ``hidden global symmetry''. After discussing the mirror for a single Sp or SO gauge group, we extend the study to a product of two gauge groups in two different models, namely the elliptic and the non-elliptic models.
