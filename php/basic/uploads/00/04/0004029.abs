Title: The dynamics of zeros of the elliptic solutions to the Schrodinger  equation
Authors: A. Akhmetshin and Y. Volvovsky
Abstract: J. F. van Diejen and H. Puschmann have recently shown that the dynamics of zeros of the n-solitonic solutions to the Schrodinger equation with the reflectionless potential is governed by a rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. We use the algebraic-geometrical construction of solutions to the Schrodinger equation to generalize this result to the elliptic case.
