Title: Chiral Schwinger models without gauge anomalies
Authors: Harald Grosse and Edwin Langmann
Abstract: We find a large class of quantum gauge models with massless fermions where the coupling to the gauge fields is not chirally symmetric and which nevertheless do not suffer from gauge anomalies. To be specific we study two dimensional Abelian models in the Hamiltonian framework which can be constructed and solved by standard techniques. The general model describes $\Np$ photon fields and $\Nf$ flavors of Dirac fermions with $2\Nf\Np$ different coupling constants i.e. the chiral component of each fermion can be coupled to the gauge fields differently. We construct these models and find conditions so that no gauge anomaly appears. If these conditions hold it is possible to construct and solve the model explicitly, so that gauge- and Lorentz invariance are manifest.
