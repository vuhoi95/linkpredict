Title: Nonnormalizable Zero Modes on BPS Junctions
Authors: Kenji Ito and Masashi Naganuma and Hodaka Oda and Norisuke Sakai
Abstract: Using an exact solution as a concrete example, Nambu-Goldstone modes on the BPS domain wall junction are worked out for N=1 supersymmetric theories in four dimensions. Their wave functions extend along the wall to infinity (not localized) and are not normalizable. It is argued that this feature is a generic phenomenon of Nambu-Goldstone modes on domain wall junctions in the bulk flat space in any dimensions. We formulate mode equations and show that fermion and boson with the same mass come in pairs except massless modes which can appear singly, in accordance with unitary representations of (1, 0) supersymmetry.
