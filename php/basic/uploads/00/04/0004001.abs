Title: Monopoles and the Emergence of Black Hole Entropy
Authors: Arthur Lue and Erick J. Weinberg
Abstract: One of the remarkable features of black holes is that they possess a thermodynamic description, even though they do not appear to be statistical systems. We use self-gravitating magnetic monopole solutions as tools for understanding the emergence of this description as one goes from an ordinary spacetime to one containing a black hole. We describe how causally distinct regions emerge as a monopole solution develops a horizon. We define an entropy that is naturally associated with these regions and that has a clear connection with the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy in the critical black hole limit.
