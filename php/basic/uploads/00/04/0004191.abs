Title: Soldering and Mass Generation in Four Dimensions
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We propose bosonised expressions for the chiral Schwinger models in four dimensions. Then, in complete analogy with the two dimensional case, we show the soldering of two bosonised chiral Schwinger models with opposite chiralities to yield the bosonised Schwinger model in four dimensions. The implications of the Schwinger model or its chiral version, as known for two dimensions, thereby get extended to four dimensions.
