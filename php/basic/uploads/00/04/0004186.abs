Title: Yang-Mills- and D-instantons
Authors: A. V. Belitsky and S. Vandoren and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: In these lectures, which are written at an elementary and pedagogical level, we discuss general aspects of (single) instantons in SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory, and then specialize to the case of N = 4 supersymmetry and the large N_c limit. We show how to determine the measure of collective coordinates and compute instanton corrections to certain correlation functions. We then relate this to D-instantons in type IIB supergravity. By taking the D-instantons to live in an $AdS_5\times S^5$ background, we perform explicit checks of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
