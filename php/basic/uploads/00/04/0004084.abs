Title: Non-abelian quantum Hall states - exclusion statistics, K-matrices and  duality
Authors: E. Ardonne and P. Bouwknegt and K. Schoutens
Abstract: We study excitations in edge theories for non-abelian quantum Hall states, focussing on the spin polarized states proposed by Read and Rezayi and on the spin singlet states proposed by two of the authors. By studying the exclusion statistics properties of edge-electrons and edge-quasiholes, we arrive at a novel K-matrix structure. Interestingly, the duality between the electron and quasihole sectors links the pseudoparticles that are characteristic for non-abelian statistics with composite particles that are associated to the `pairing physics' of the non-abelian quantum Hall states.
