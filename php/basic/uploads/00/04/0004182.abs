Title: Topological Mass Generation as an Interference Phenomenon
Authors: Anderson Ilha and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: It is proposed a new mechanism for the phenomenon of topological mass generation in three spacetime dimensions as the result of the interference of two opposite massless chiral modes. This mechanism, already used to produce the massive vectorial mode of the 2D Schwinger model, is here exploited to produce the gauge invariant massive mode of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Moreover the procedure is clearly dimensionally independent: a new chiral boson action is proposed for odd and even dimensional space-times to be used as the basic building blocks of the interference schemes. This is a new result that extends the two-dimensional Floreanini-Jackiw action to higher dimensional spaces and is in clear contrast with the twice odd dimensional chiral form extensions.
