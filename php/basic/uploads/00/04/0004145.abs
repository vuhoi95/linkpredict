Title: Quantum mechanics of baryogenesis
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Stefan Fredenhagen
Abstract: The cosmological baryon asymmetry can be explained as remnant of heavy Majorana neutrino decays in the early universe. We study this out-of-equilibrium process by means of Kadanoff-Baym equations which are solved in a perturbative expansion. To leading order the problem is reduced to solving a set of Boltzmann equations for distribution functions.
