Title: A Realization of the infinite dimensional Symmetries of Conformal  Mechanics
Authors: M. Cadoni and P. Carta and S. Mignemi
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of realizing the infinite dimensional symmetries of conformal mechanics as time reparametrizations, generalizing the realization of the SL(2,R) symmetry of the de Alfaro, Fubini, Furlan model in terms of quasi--primary fields. We find that this is possible using an appropriate generalization of the transformation law for the quasi-primary fields.
