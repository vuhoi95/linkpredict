Abstract: It has recently been conjectured that the AdS_5/SYM_4 correspondence can be generalized away from the conformal limit, to a duality between supergravity on the full asymptotically flat three-brane background and a theory characterized as N=4 SYM deformed in the IR by a specific dimension-eight operator. Assuming that this relation is valid, we derive a prescription for computing n-point correlation functions in the holographic theory, which reduces to the standard AdS/CFT recipe at low energies. One- and two-point functions are discussed in detail. The prescription follows from very simple considerations and appears to be applicable to any asymptotically flat background. We also compute the quark-antiquark potential and comment on the description of the baryon in the supergravity picture. We conclude with some comments on the possible relation between our work and recent results in non-commutative field theories.
