Title: Regular (2+1)-dimensional black holes within non-linear Electrodynamics
Authors: Mauricio Cataldo and Alberto Garcia
Abstract: (2+1)-regular static black hole solutions with a nonlinear electric field are derived. The source to the Einstein equations is an energy momentum tensor of nonlinear electrodynamics, which satisfies the weak energy conditions and in the weak field limit becomes the (2+1)-Maxwell field tensor. The derived class of solutions is regular; the metric, curvature invariants and electric field are regular everywhere. The metric becomes, for a vanishing parameter, the (2+1)-static charged BTZ solution. A general procedure to derive solutions for the static BTZ (2+1)-spacetime, for any nonlinear Lagrangian depending on the electric field is formulated; for relevant electric fields one requires the fulfillment of the weak energy conditions.
