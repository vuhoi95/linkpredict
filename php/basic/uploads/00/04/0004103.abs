Title: Warped Compactifications in M and F Theory
Authors: Brian R. Greene and Koenraad Schalm and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We study M and F theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau four-folds in the presence of non-trivial background flux. The geometry is warped and belongs to the class of p-brane metrics. We solve for the explicit warp factor in the orbifold limit of these compactifications, compare our results to some of the more familiar recently studied warped scenarios, and discuss the effects on the low-energy theory. As the warp factor is generated solely by backreaction, we may use topological arguments to determine the massless spectrum. We perform the computation for the case where the four-fold equals K3 \times K3.
