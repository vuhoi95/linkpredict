Title: No CPT Violation from Tilted Brane in Neutral Meson--Antimeson Systems
Authors: G. Cvetic and S. K. Kang and C. S. Kim and K. Lee
Abstract: Tilted brane in theories with large compact extra dimensions leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Lorentz and rotational invariance in four dimensions, as shown by Dvali and Shifman. In this brief report, we point out that the mentioned Lorentz symmetry breaking, although leading to the CPT--violating interaction terms, cannot lead to the CPT violation in the experimentally interesting $K$--${\bar K}$ and analogous systems.
