Title: Brane Worlds, the Cosmological Constant and String Theory
Authors: S. P. de Alwis and A. T. Flournoy and N. Irges
Abstract: We argue that traditional methods of compactification of string theory make it very difficult to understand how the cosmological constant becomes zero. String inspired models can give zero cosmological constant after fine tuning but since string theory has no free parameters it is not clear that this is allowed. Brane world scenarios on the other hand while they do not answer the question as to why the cosmological constant is zero do actually allow a choice of integration constants that permit flat four space solutions. In this paper we discuss gauged supergravity realizations of such a world. To the extent that this starting point can be considered a low energy effective action of string theory (and there is some recent evidence supporting this) our model may be considered a string theory realization of this scenario.
