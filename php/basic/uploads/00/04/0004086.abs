Title: Cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum model after dilaton stabilization
Authors: Julien Lesgourgues and Sergio Pastor and Marco Peloso and Lorenzo Sorbo
Abstract: We provide the first complete analysis of cosmological evolution in the Randall-Sundrum model with stabilized dilaton. We give the exact expansion law for matter densities on the two branes with arbitrary equations of state. The effective four-dimensional theory leads to standard cosmology at low energy. The limit of validity of the low energy theory and possible deviations from the ordinary expansion law in the high energy regime are finally discussed.
