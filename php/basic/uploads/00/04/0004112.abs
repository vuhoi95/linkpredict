Title: The Tachyon Potential in Witten's Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Pieter-Jan De Smet and Joris Raeymaekers
Abstract: We study the tachyon potential in the NS sector of Witten's cubic superstring field theory. In this theory, the pure tachyon contribution to the potential has no minimum. We find that this remains the case when higher modes up to level two are included.
