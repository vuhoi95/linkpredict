Title: Crosscaps, Boundaries and T-Duality
Authors: L. R. Huiszoon and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: Open descendants with boundaries and crosscaps of non-trivial automorphism type are studied. We focus on the case where the bulk symmetry is broken to a Z_2 orbifold subalgebra. By requiring positivity and integrality for the open sector, we derive a unique crosscap of automorphism type g \in Z_2 and a corresponding g-twisted Klein bottle for a charge conjugation invariant. As a specific example, we use T-duality to construct the descendants of the true diagonal invariant with symmetry preserving crosscaps and boundaries.
