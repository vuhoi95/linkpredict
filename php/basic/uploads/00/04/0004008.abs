Title: NLO corrections to the BFKL equation in QCD and in supersymmetric gauge  theories
Authors: A. V. Kotikov and L. N. Lipatov
Abstract: We study next-to-leading corrections to the integral kernel of the BFKL equation for high energy cross-sections in QCD and in supersymmetric gauge theories. The eigenvalue of the BFKL kernel is calculated in an analytic form as a function of the anomalous dimension \gamma of the local gauge-invariant operators and their conformal spin n. For the case of an extended N=4 SUSY the kernel is significantly simplified. In particular, the terms non-analytic in n are canceled. We discuss the relation between the DGLAP and BFKL equations in the N=4 model.
