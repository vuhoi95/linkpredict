Title: The Fate of the Radion in Models with Metastable Graviton
Authors: L. Pilo and R. Rattazzi and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: We clarify some general issues in models where gravity is localized at intermediate distances. We introduce the radion mode, which is usually neglected, and we point out that its role in the model is crucial. We show that the brane bending effects discussed in the literature can be obtained in a formalism where the physical origin is manifest. The model violates positivity of energy due to a negative tension brane, which induces a negative kinetic term for the radion. The very same effect that violates positivity is responsible for the recovery of conventional Einstein gravity at intermediate distances.
