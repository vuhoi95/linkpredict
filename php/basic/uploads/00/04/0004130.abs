Title: Non-Abelian Einstein-Born-Infeld Black Holes
Authors: Marion Wirschins and Abha Sood and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We construct regular and black hole solutions in SU(2) Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. These solutions have many features in common with the corresponding SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions. In particular, sequences of neutral non-abelian solutions tend to magnetically charged limiting solutions, related to embedded abelian solutions. Thermodynamic properties of the black hole solutions are addressed.
