Title: Large-distance behaviour of the graviton two-point function in de Sitter  spacetime
Authors: A. Higuchi and S. S. Kouris
Abstract: It is known that the graviton two-point function for the de Sitter invariant "Euclidean" vacuum in a physical gauge grows logarithmically with distance in spatially-flat de Sitter spacetime. We show that this logarithmic behaviour is a gauge artifact by explicitly demonstrating that the same behaviour can be reproduced by a pure-gauge two-point function.
