Title: Irreducible Decomposition of Products of 10D Chiral Sigma Matrices
Authors: S. James Gates and B. Radak and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: We review the enveloping algebra of the 10 dimensional chiral sigma matrices. To facilitate the computation of the product of several chiral sigma matrices we have developed a symbolic program. Using this program one can reduce the multiplication of the sigma matrices down to linear combinations of irreducilbe elements. We are able to quickly derive several identities that are not restricted to traces. A copy of the program written in the Mathematica language is provided for the community.
