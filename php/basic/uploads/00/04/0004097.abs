Title: Brane World Inflation Induced by Quantum Effects
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov
Abstract: We consider brane-world universe where an arbitrary large $N$ quantum CFT is living on the domain wall. This corresponds to implementing of Randall-Sundrum compactification within the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. Using anomaly induced effective action for domain wall CFT the possibility of self-consistent quantum creation of 4d de Sitter wall Universe (inflation) is demonstrated. In case of maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory the exact correspondence with radius and effective tension found by Hawking-Hertog-Reall is obtained. The hyperbolic wall Universe may be induced by quantum effects only for exotic matter (higher derivatives conformal scalar) which has unusual sign of central charge.
