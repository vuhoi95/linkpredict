Title: Ising-model description of the SU(2)_1 quantum critical point in a  dimerized two-leg spin-1/2 ladder
Authors: Y. -J. Wang and A. A. Nersesyan
Abstract: A nonperturbative analytical description of the SU(2)_1 quantum critical point in an explicitly dimerized two-leg spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder is presented. It is shown that this criticality essentially coincides with that emerging in a weakly dimerized spin-1 chain with a small Haldane gap. The approach is based on the mapping onto an SO(3)-symmetric model of three strongly coupled quantum Ising chains. This mapping is used to establish the correspondence between all physical fields of the spin ladder and those characterizing the SU(2)_1 criticality at the infrared fixed point.
