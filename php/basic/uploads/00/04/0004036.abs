Title: On area and entropy of a black hole
Authors: A. Alekseev and A. P. Polychronakos and M. Smedb√§ck
Abstract: We consider a model of a black hole consisting of a number of elementary components. Examples of such models occur in the Ashtekar's approach to canonical Quantum Gravity and in M-theory. We show that treating the elementary components as completely distinguishable leads to the area law for the black hole entropy. Contrary to previous results, we show that no Bose condensation occurs, the area has big local fluctuations and that in the framework of canonical Quantum Gravity the area of the black hole horizon is equidistantly quantized.
