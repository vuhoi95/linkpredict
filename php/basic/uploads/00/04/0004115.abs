Title: Non-Relativistic Non-Commutative Field Theory and UV/IR Mixing
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Karl Landsteiner and Esperanza Lopez
Abstract: We study a non-commutative non-relativistic scalar field theory in 2+1 dimensions. The theory shows the UV/IR mixing typical of QFT on non-commutative spaces. The one-loop correction to the two-point function turns out to be given by a delta-function in momentum space. The one-loop correction to the four-point function is of logarithmic type. We also evaluate the thermodynamic potential at two-loop order. To avoid an IR-singularity we have to introduce a chemical potential. The suppression of the non-planar contribution with respect to the planar one turns out to depend crucially on the value of the chemical potential.
