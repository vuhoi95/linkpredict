Title: Supersymmetrizing Branes with Bulk in Five-Dimensional Supergravity
Authors: Adam Falkowski and Zygmunt Lalak and Stefan Pokorski
Abstract: We supersymmetrize a class of moduli dependent potentials living on branes with the help of additional bulk terms in 5d N=2 supergravity. The space of Poincare invariant vacuum solutions includes the Randall-Sundrum solution and the $M$-theoretical solution. After adding gauge sectors to the branes we discuss breakdown of low energy supersymmetry in this setup and hierarchy of physical scales. In the limit of large warp factors we find decoupling between effects stemming from different branes in the compactified theory.
