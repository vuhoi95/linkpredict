Title: Nonperturbative Gauge Fixing and Perturbation Theory
Authors: Wolfgang Bock and Maarten Golterman and Michael Ogilvie and Yigal Shamir
Abstract: We compare the gauge-fixing approach proposed by Jona-Lasinio and Parrinello, and by Zwanziger (JPLZ) with the standard Fadeev-Popov procedure, and demonstrate perturbative equality of gauge-invariant quantities, up to irrelevant terms induced by the cutoff. We also show how a set of local, renormalizable Feynman rules can be constructed for the JPLZ procedure.
