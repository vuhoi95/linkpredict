Title: BFT embedding of noncommutative D-brane system
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong and Won Tae Kim and Young-Jai Park and Myung Seok Yoon
Abstract: We study noncommutative geometry in the framework of the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin(BFT) scheme, which converts second class constraint system into first class one. In an open string theory noncommutative geometry appears due to the mixed boundary conditions having second class constraints, which arise in string theory with $D$-branes under a constant Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Introduction of a new coordinate $y$ on $D$-brane through BFT analysis allows us to obtain the commutative geometry with the help of the first class constraints, and the resulting action corresponding to the first class Hamiltonian in the BFT Hamiltonian formalism has a new local symmetry.
