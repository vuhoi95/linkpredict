Title: A Note on Brane Inflation
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and Jing Wang
Abstract: We demonstrate that there exists an inflationary solution on the positive tension brane in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. Inflation is driven by a slow-rolling scalar field on the brane and is achieved within the perturbative limit of the radion field. We find that inflation on the positive tension brane results in a slight increase in the separation between the two branes. However, we show that the slow-roll inflation is not possible on the negative tension brane.
