Title: Why we live in 3 Dimensions
Authors: Carlos Castro and Alex Granik and M. S. El Naschie
Abstract: A Cantorian fractal spacetime, a family member of von Neumann's noncommutative geometry is introduced as a geometry underlying a new relativity theory which is similar to the relation between general relativity and Riemannian geometry. Based on this model and the new relativity theory an ensemble distribution of all the dimensions of quantum spacetime is derived with the help of Fermat grand theorem. The calculated average dimension is very close to the value of $4+\phi^3 $ (where $\phi$ is the golden mean) obtained by El Naschie on the basis of a different approach. It is shown that within the framework of the new relativity the cosmological constant problem is nonexistent, since the Universe self-organizes and self-tunes according to the renormalization group (RG) flow with respect to a local scaling microscopic arrow of time. This implies that the world emerged as a result of a non-equilibrium process of self-organized critical phenomena launched by vacuum fluctuations in Cantorian fractal spacetime $\cal E^{\infty}$. It is shown that we are living in a metastable vacuum and are moving towards a fixed point ($ D$ = 4+$\phi^3$) of the RG. After reaching this point, a new phase transition will drive the universe to a quasi-crystal phase of the lower average dimension of $\phi^3$.
