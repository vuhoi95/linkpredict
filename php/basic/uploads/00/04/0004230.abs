Title: Pattern Formation in the Early Universe
Authors: A. Sornborger and M. Parry
Abstract: Systems that exhibit pattern formation are typically driven and dissipative. In the early universe, parametric resonance can drive explosive particle production called preheating. The fields that are populated then decay quantum mechanically if their particles are unstable. Thus, during preheating, a driven-dissipative system exists. We have shown previously that pattern formation can occur in two dimensions in a self-coupled inflaton system undergoing parametric resonance. In this paper, we provide evidence of pattern formation for more realistic initial conditions in both two and three dimensions. In the one-field case, we have the novel interpretation that these patterns can be thought of as a network of domain walls. We also show that the patterns are spatio-temporal, leading to a distinctive, but probably low-amplitude peak in the gravitational wave spectrum. In the context of a two-field model, we discuss putting power from resonance into patterns on cosmological scales, in particular to explain the observed excess power at 100 h^{-1}Mpc, but why this seems unlikely in the absence of a period of post-preheating inflation. Finally we note our model is similar to that of the decay of DCCs and therefore pattern formation may also occur at RHIC and LHC.
