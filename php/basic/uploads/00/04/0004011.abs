Title: Structure of the Three-dimensional Quantum Euclidean Space
Authors: B. L. Cerchiai and J. Madore and S. Schraml and J. Wess
Abstract: As an example of a noncommutative space we discuss the quantum 3-dimensional Euclidean space $R^3_q$ together with its symmetry structure in great detail. The algebraic structure and the representation theory are clarified and discrete spectra for the coordinates are found. The q-deformed Legendre functions play a special role. A completeness relation is derived for these functions.
