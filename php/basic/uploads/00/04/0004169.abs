Title: Turbulence as a constrained system
Authors: A. C. R. Mendes and W. Oliveira and F. I. Takakura
Abstract: Hydrodynamic turbulence is studied as a constrained system from the point of view of metafluid dynamics. We present a Lagrangian description for this new theory of turbulence inspired from the analogy with electromagnetism. Consequently it is a gauge theory. This new approach to the study of turbulence tends to renew the optimism to solve the difficult problem of turbulence. As a constrained system, turbulence is studied in the Dirac and Faddeev-Jackiw formalisms giving the Dirac brackets. An important result is that we show these brackets are the same in and out of the inertial range, giving the way to quantize turbulence.
