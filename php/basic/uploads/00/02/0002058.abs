Title: Conformal invariance and particle aspects in general relativity
Authors: H. Salehi and H. R. Sepangi and F. Darabi
Abstract: We study the breakdown of conformal symmetry in a conformally invariant gravitational model. The symmetry breaking is introduced by defining a preferred conformal frame in terms of the large scale characteristics of the universe. In this context we show that a local change of the preferred conformal frame results in a Hamilton-Jacobi equation describing a particle with adjustable mass. In this equation the dynamical characteristics of the particle substantially depends on the applied conformal factor and local geometry. Relevant interpretations of the results are also discussed.
