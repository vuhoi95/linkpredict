Title: Moduli Spaces for Four- and Five- Dimensional Black Holes
Authors: J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We propose a universal expression for the moduli metric of a class of four- and five-dimensional black holes which preserve at least four supersymmetries. These include the black holes that are associated with various intersecting branes in ten and eleven dimensions, the electrically charged black holes of N=2 D=5 and N=2 D=4 supergravities with any number of vector multiplets, and dyonic black holes of N=2 D=4 supergravity. The moduli metric of electrically charged N=2 D=4 black holes coupled to any number of vector multiplets is explicitly computed. We also investigate the superconformal symmetries of the black hole moduli spaces for small black hole separations.
