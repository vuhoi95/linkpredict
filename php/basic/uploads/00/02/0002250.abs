Title: The QCD Potential at $O(1/m)$
Authors: N. Brambilla and A. Pineda and J. Soto and A. Vairo
Abstract: Within an effective field theory framework, we obtain an expression for the next-to-leading term in the $1/m$ expansion of the singlet $Q{\bar Q}$ QCD potential in terms of Wilson loops, which holds beyond perturbation theory. The ambiguities in the definition of the QCD potential beyond leading order in $1/m$ are discussed and a specific expression for the $1/m$ potential is given. We explicitly evaluate this expression at one loop and compare the outcome with the existing perturbative results. On general grounds we show that for quenched QED and fully Abelian-like models this expression exactly vanishes.
