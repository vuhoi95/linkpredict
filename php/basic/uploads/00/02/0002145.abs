Title: DeSitter entropy, quantum entanglement and ADS/CFT
Authors: Stephen Hawking and Juan Maldacena and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: A deSitter brane-world bounding regions of anti-deSitter space has a macroscopic entropy given by one-quarter the area of the observer horizon. A proposed variant of the AdS/CFT correspondence gives a dual description of this cosmology as conformal field theory coupled to gravity in deSitter space. In the case of two-dimensional deSitter space this provides a microscopic derivation of the entropy, including the one-quarter, as quantum entanglement of the conformal field theory across the horizon.
