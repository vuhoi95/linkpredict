Title: Chiral Compactifications of 6D Conformal Theories
Authors: Chang S. Chan and Ori J. Ganor and Morten Krogh
Abstract: We construct chiral N=1 gauge theories in 4D by compactifying the 6D Blum-Intriligator (1,0) theories of 5-branes at $A_k$ singularities on $T^2$ with a nontrivial bundle of the global U(1) symmetry of these theories.
