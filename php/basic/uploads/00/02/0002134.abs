Title: Manifestly N=3 supersymmetric Euler-Heisenberg action in light-cone  superspace
Authors: Thomas Boettner and Sergei V. Ketov and Thomas Lau
Abstract: We find a manifestly N=3 supersymmetric generalization of the four-dimensional Euler-Heisenberg (four-derivative, or F^4) part of the Born-Infeld action in light-cone gauge, by using N=3 light-cone superspace.
