Title: Stabilization of internal spaces in multidimensional cosmology
Authors: U. Guenther and A. Zhuk
Abstract: Effective 4-dimensional theories are investigated which were obtained under dimensional reduction of multidimensional cosmological models with a minimal coupled scalar field as matter source. Conditions for the internal space stabilization are considered and the possibility for inflation in the external space is discussed. The electroweak as well as the Planck fundamental scale approaches are investigated and compared with each other. It is shown that there exists a rescaling for the effective cosmological constant as well as for gravitational exciton masses in the different approaches.
