Title: Resolution of the Nested Hierarchy for Rational sl(n) Models
Authors: T. -D. Albert and H. Boos and R. Flume and K. Ruhlig
Abstract: We construct Drinfel'd twists for the rational sl(n) XXX-model giving rise to a completely symmetric representation of the monodromy matrix. We obtain a polarization free representation of the pseudoparticle creation operators figuring in the construction of the Bethe vectors within the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method. This representation enables us to resolve the hierarchy of the nested Bethe ansatz for the sl(n) invariant rational Heisenberg model. Our results generalize the findings of Maillet and Sanchez de Santos for sl(2) models.
