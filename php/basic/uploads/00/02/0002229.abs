Title: Dual Instantons
Authors: A. Pinzul and A. Stern
Abstract: We show how to map the Belavin-Polyakov instantons of the O(3)-nonlinear $\sigma-$model to a dual theory where they then appear as nontopological solitons. They are stationary points of the Euclidean action in the dual theory, and moreover, the dual action and the O(3)-nonlinear $\sigma-$model action agree on shell.
