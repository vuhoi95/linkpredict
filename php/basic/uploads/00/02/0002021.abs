Title: Passivity and microlocal spectrum condition
Authors: Hanno Sahlmann and Rainer Verch
Abstract: In the setting of vector-valued quantum fields obeying a linear wave-equation in a globally hyperbolic, stationary spacetime, it is shown that the two-point functions of passive quantum states (mixtures of ground- or KMS-states) fulfill the microlocal spectrum condition (which in the case of the canonically quantized scalar field is equivalent to saying that the two-point function is of Hadamard form). The fields can be of bosonic or fermionic character. We also give an abstract version of this result by showing that passive states of a topological *-dynamical system have an asymptotic pair correlation spectrum of a specific type.
