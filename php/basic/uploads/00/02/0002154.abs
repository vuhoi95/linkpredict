Title: Aspects of the conformal operator product expansion in AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: L. Hoffmann and A. C. Petkou and W. Ruehl
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a scalar conformal four-point function obtained from AdS/CFT correspondence. We study the scalar exchange graphs in AdS and discuss their analytic properties. Using methods of conformal partial wave analysis, we present a general procedure to study conformal four-point functions in terms of exchanges of scalar and tensor fields. The logarithmic terms in the four-point functions are connected to the anomalous dimensions of the exchanged fields. Comparison of the results from AdS graphs with the conformal partial wave analysis, suggests a possible general form for the operator product expansion of scalar fields in the boundary CFT.
