Title: Mirror Symmetry
Authors: Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We prove mirror symmetry for supersymmetric sigma models on Kahler manifolds in 1+1 dimensions. The proof involves establishing the equivalence of the gauged linear sigma model, embedded in a theory with an enlarged gauge symmetry, with a Landau-Ginzburg theory of Toda type. Standard R -> 1/R duality and dynamical generation of superpotential by vortices are crucial in the derivation. This provides not only a proof of mirror symmetry in the case of (local and global) Calabi-Yau manifolds, but also for sigma models on manifolds with positive first Chern class, including deformations of the action by holomorphic isometries.
