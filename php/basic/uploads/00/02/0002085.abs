Title: Supersymmetric Wilson Lines and Loops, and Super Non-Abelian Stokes  Theorem
Authors: Robert L. Karp and Freydoon Mansouri
Abstract: We generalize the standard product integral formalism to incorporate Grassmann valued matrices and show that the resulting supersymmetric product integrals provide a natural framework for describing supersymmetric Wilson Lines and Wilson Loops. We use this formalism to establish the supersymmetric version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem.
