Title: Constructing the light-front QCD Hamiltonian
Authors: S. A. Paston and V. A. Franke and E. V. Prokhvatilov
Abstract: We propose the light-front Lagrangian and the corresponding Hamiltonian that produce a theory perturbatively equivalent to the conventional QCD in the Lorentz coordinates after the regularization is removed. The regularization used is nonstandard and breaks the gauge invariance. But after the regularization is removed, this invariance is restored by the introduction of a finite number of counterterms with coefficients dependent on the regularization parameters.
