Authors: S. L. Lyakhovich and A. A. Sharapov and K. M. Shekhter
Abstract: The general model of an arbitrary spin massive particle in any dimensional space-time is derived on the basis of Kirillov - Kostant - Souriau approach. It is shown that the model allows consistent coupling to an arbitrary background of electromagnetic and gravitational fields.
