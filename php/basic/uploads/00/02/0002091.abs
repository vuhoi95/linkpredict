Title: Linearized Gravity in Brane Backgrounds
Authors: S. B. Giddings and E. Katz and L. Randall
Abstract: A treatment of linearized gravity is given in the Randall-Sundrum background. The graviton propagator is found in terms of the scalar propagator, for which an explicit integral expression is provided. This reduces to the four-dimensional propagator at long distances along the brane, and provides estimates of subleading corrections. Asymptotics of the propagator off the brane yields exponential falloff of gravitational fields due to matter on the brane. This implies that black holes bound to the brane have a "pancake"-like shape in the extra dimension, and indicates validity of a perturbative treatment off the brane. Some connections with the AdS/CFT correspondence are described.
