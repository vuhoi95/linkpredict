Title: A Note on the Holographic Beta and C Functions
Authors: D. Anselmi and L. Girardello and M. Porrati and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: The holographic RG flow in AdS/CFT correspondence naturally defines a holographic scheme in which the central charge c and the beta function are related by a universal formula. We perform some checks of that formula and we compare it with quantum field theory expectations. We discuss alternative definitions of the c-function. In particular, we compare, for a particular supersymmetric flow, the holographic c-function with the central charge computed directly from the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor.
