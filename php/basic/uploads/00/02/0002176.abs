Title: Domain Wall Junctions in Supersymmetric Field Theories in D=4
Authors: Soonkeon Nam and Kasper Olsen
Abstract: We study the possible BPS domain wall junction configurations for general polynomial superpotentials of N=1 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models in D=4. We scan the parameter space of the superpotential and find different possible BPS states for different values of the deformation parameters and present our results graphically. We comment on the domain walls in F/M/IIA theories obtained from the Calabi-Yau fourfolds with isolated singularities and a background flux.
