Title: Gauge fields - strings duality and the loop equation
Authors: A. Polyakov and V. Rychkov
Abstract: We explore gauge fields - strings duality by means of the loop equations and the zigzag symmetry. The results are striking and incomplete. Striking - because we find that the string ansatz proposed in [A.M. Polyakov, hep-th/9711002] satisfies gauge theory Schwinger-Dyson equations precisely at the critical dimension D=4. Incomplete - since we get these results only in the WKB approximation and only for a special class of contours. The ways to go beyond these limitations and in particular the OPE for operators defined on the loop are also discussed.
