Abstract: Physically relevant gauge and gravitational theories can be seen as special members of hierarchies of more elaborate systems. The Yang-Mills (YM) system is the first member of a hierarchy of Lagrangians which we will index by $p_1$, and the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) system of general relativity is the first member of another hierarchy which we index by $p_2$. In this paper, we study the classical equations of the $p_1 = 1,2$ YM hierarchy considered in the background of special geometries (Schwarzschild, deSitter,anti-deSitter) of the $p_2=1,2,3$ EH hierarchy. Solutions are obtained in various dimensions and lead to several examples of non-self-dual YM fields. When $p_1=p_2$ self-dual solutions exist in addition. Their action is equal to the Chern-Pontryagin charge and can be compared with that of the non-self-dual solutions.
