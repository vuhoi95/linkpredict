Title: Boundary states for a free boson defined on finite geometries
Authors: Marc-Andre Lewis and Yvan Saint-Aubin
Abstract: Langlands recently constructed a map that factorizes the partition function of a free boson on a cylinder with boundary condition given by two arbitrary functions in the form of a scalar product of boundary states. We rewrite these boundary states in a compact form, getting rid of technical assumptions necessary in his construction. This simpler form allows us to show explicitly that the map between boundary conditions and states commutes with conformal transformations preserving the boundary and the reality condition on the scalar field.
