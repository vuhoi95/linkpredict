Title: Four-point Functions of Lowest Weight CPOs in N=4 SYM_4 in Supergravity  Approximation
Authors: G. Arutyunov and S. Frolov
Abstract: We show that the recently found quartic action for the scalars from the massless graviton multiplet of type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS_5\times S^5 background coincides with the relevant part of the action of the gauged N=8 5d supergravity on AdS_5. We then use this action to compute the 4-point function of the lowest weight chiral primary operators $\tr(\phi^{(i}\phi^{j)})$ in N=4 SYM_4 at large $N$ and at strong `t Hooft coupling.
