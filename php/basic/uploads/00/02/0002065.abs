Title: First order quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of  the sinh-Gordon model
Authors: A. Chenaghlou and E. Corrigan
Abstract: The sinh-Gordon model is restricted to a half-line by boundary conditions maintaining integrability. A perturbative calculation of the reflection factor is given to one loop order in the bulk coupling and to first order in the difference of the two parameters introduced at the boundary, providing a further verification of Ghoshal's formula. The calculation is consistent with a conjecture for the general dependence of the reflection factor on the boundary parameters and the bulk coupling.
