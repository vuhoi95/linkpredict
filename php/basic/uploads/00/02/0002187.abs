Title: A Note on Interactions of (Non-Commutative) Instantons Via AdS/CFT
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and A. Pasquinucci
Abstract: We consider the interaction between instantons and anti-instantons in four-dimensional N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory at large N and large 't Hooft coupling as described by D-instantons via AdS/CFT duality. We give an estimate of the strength of the interaction in various regimes. We discuss also the case of Non-Commutative super Yang-Mills theory where the interaction between instantons and anti-instantons can be used as a way to probe the locality properties of the theory in the supergravity picture, without explicit reference to the definition of local operators.
