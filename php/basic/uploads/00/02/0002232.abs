Abstract: Multicomplex numbers of order n have an associated trigonometry (multisine functions with (n-1) parameters) leading to a natural extension of the sine-Gordon model. The parameters are constrained from the requirement of local current conservation. In two dimensions for n < 6 known integrable models (deformed Toda and non-linear sigma, pure affine Toda...) with dual counterparts are obtained in this way from the multicomplex space MC itself and from the natural embedding $\MC_n \subset \MMC_m, n < m$. For $ n \ge 6$ a generic constraint on the space of parametersis obtained from current conservation at first order in the interaction Lagragien.
