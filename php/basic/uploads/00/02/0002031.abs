Title: On the Splitting Type of an Equivariant Vector Bundle over a Toric  Manifold
Authors: Chien-Hao Liu and Shing-Tung Yau
Abstract: From the work of Lian, Liu, and Yau on "Mirror Principle", in the explicit computation of the Euler data $Q=\{Q_0, Q_1, ... \}$ for an equivariant concavex bundle ${\cal E}$ over a toric manifold, there are two places the structure of the bundle comes into play: (1) the multiplicative characteric class $Q_0$ of $V$ one starts with, and (2) the splitting type of ${\cal E}$. Equivariant bundles over a toric manifold has been classified by Kaneyama, using data related to the linearization of the toric action on the base toric manifold. In this article, we relate the splitting type of ${\cal E}$ to the classifying data of Kaneyama. From these relations, we compute the splitting type of a couple of nonsplittable equivariant vector bundles over toric manifolds that may be of interest to string theory and mirror symmetry. A code in Mathematica that carries out the computation of some of these examples is attached.
