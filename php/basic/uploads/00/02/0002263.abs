Title: Implications of Anomalous U(1) Symmetry in Unified Models: the Flipped  SU(5) x U(1) Paradigm
Authors: John Ellis and G. K. Leontaris and J. Rizos
Abstract: A generic feature of string-derived models is the appearance of an anomalous Abelian U(1)_A symmetry which, among other properties, constrains the Yukawa couplings and distinguishes the three families from each other. In this paper, we discuss in a model-independent way the general constraints imposed by such a U(1)_A symmetry on fermion masses, R-violating couplings and proton-decay operators in a generic flipped SU(5) x U(1)' model. We construct all possible viable fermion mass textures and give various examples of effective low-energy models which are distinguished from each other by their different predictions for B-, L- and R-violating effects. We pay particular attention to predictions for neutrino masses, in the light of the recent Super-Kamiokande data.
