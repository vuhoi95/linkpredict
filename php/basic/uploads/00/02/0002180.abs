Title: Non-Abelian Born-Infeld versus String Theory
Authors: Frederik Denef and Alexander Sevrin and Jan Troost
Abstract: Motivated by the results of Hashimoto and Taylor, we perform a detailed study of the mass spectrum of the non-abelian Born-Infeld theory, defined by the symmetrized trace prescription, on tori with constant magnetic fields turned on. Subsequently, we compare this for several cases to the mass spectrum of intersecting D-branes. Exact agreement is found in only two cases: BPS configurations on the four-torus and coinciding tilted branes. Finally we investigate the fluctuation dynamics of an arbitrarily wrapped Dp-brane with flux.
