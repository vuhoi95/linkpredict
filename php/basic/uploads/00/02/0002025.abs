Title: A note on the analyticity of AdS scalar exchange graphs in the crossed  channel
Authors: L. Hoffmann and A. C. Petkou and W. Ruehl
Abstract: We discuss the analytic properties of AdS scalar exchange graphs in the crossed channel. We show that the possible non-analytic terms drop out by virtue of non-trivial properties of generalized hypergeometric functions. The absence of non-analytic terms is a necessary condition for the existence of an operator product expansion for CFT amplitudes obtained from AdS/CFT correspondence.
