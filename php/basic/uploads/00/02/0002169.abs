Title: String Partition Functions and Infinite Products
Authors: Toshiya Kawai and Kota Yoshioka
Abstract: We continue to explore the conjectural expressions of the Gromov-Witten potentials for a class of elliptically and K3 fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds in the limit where the base P^1 of the K3 fibration becomes infinitely large. At least in this limit we argue that the string partition function (=the exponential generating function of the Gromov-Witten potentials) can be expressed as an infinite product in which the Kahler moduli and the string coupling are treated somewhat on an equal footing. Technically speaking, we use the exponential lifting of a weight zero Jacobi form to reach the infinite product as in the celebrated work of Borcherds. However, the relevant Jacobi form is associated with a lattice of Lorentzian signature. A major part of this work is devoted to an attempt to interpret the infinite product or more precisely the Jacobi form in terms of the bound states of D2- and D0-branes using a vortex description and its suitable generalization.
