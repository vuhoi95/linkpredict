Title: On the Spatial Structure of Monopoles
Authors: Barak Kol and Michael Kroyter
Abstract: We study the spatial structure of 1/4 BPS solitons in 4 dimensional N=4 gauge theory. A weak binding approximation is used where the soliton is made of several "ingredient" particles. Some spatial moduli are described which are not accounted for in the (p,q) web picture. These moduli are counted and their effect on the solutions is demonstrated. The potential for off BPS configurations is estimated by a simple expression and is found to agree with previous expressions. We discuss the fermionic zero modes of the solitons, and find agreement with web predictions.
