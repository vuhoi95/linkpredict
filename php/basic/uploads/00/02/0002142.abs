Title: Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories Near a Boundary
Authors: S. Moghimi-Araghi and S. Rouhani
Abstract: We consider logarithmic conformal field theories near a boundary and derive the general form of one and two point functions. We obtain results for arbitrary and two dimensions. Application to two dimensional magnetohydrodynamics is discussed.
