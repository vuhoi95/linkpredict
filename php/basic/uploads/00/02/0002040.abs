Title: Logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
Authors: Romesh K. Kaul and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: The exact formula derived by us earlier for the entropy of a four dimensional non-rotating black hole within the quantum geometry formulation of the event horizon in terms of boundary states of a three dimensional Chern-Simons theory, is reexamined for large horizon areas. In addition to the {\it semiclassical} Bekenstein-Hawking contribution to the area obtained earlier, we find a contribution proportional to the logarithm of the area together with subleading corrections that constitute a series in inverse powers of the area.
