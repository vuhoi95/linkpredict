Title: Dressing Symmetries of Holomorphic BF Theories
Authors: T. A. Ivanova and A. D. Popov
Abstract: We consider holomorphic BF theories, their solutions and symmetries. The equivalence of Cech and Dolbeault descriptions of holomorphic bundles is used to develop a method for calculating hidden (nonlocal) symmetries of holomorphic BF theories. A special cohomological symmetry group and its action on the solution space are described.
