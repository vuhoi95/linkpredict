Title: A note on the appearance of self-dual Yang-Mills fields in integrable  hierarchies
Authors: László Fehér and András Gábor
Abstract: A family of mappings from the solution spaces of certain generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies to the self-dual Yang-Mills system on R^{2,2} is described. This provides an extension of the well-known relationship between self-dual connections and integrable hierarchies of AKNS and Drinfeld-Sokolov type.
