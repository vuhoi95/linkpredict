Title: A Comment on Self-Tuning and Vanishing Cosmological Constant in the  Brane World
Authors: Stefan Forste and Zygmunt Lalak and Stephane Lavignac and Hans Peter Nilles
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on various five dimensional contributions to the effective 4D cosmological constant in brane systems. In solutions with vanishing 5D cosmological constant we describe a non-local mechanism of cancellation of vacuum energy between the brane and the singularities. We comment on a hidden fine tuning which is implied by this observation.
