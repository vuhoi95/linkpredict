Title: Scalar Quartic Effective Action on $AdS_5$
Authors: G. Arutyunov and S. Frolov
Abstract: We review the recent results concerning the computation of cubic and quartic couplings of scalar fields in type IIB supergravity on AdS_5\times S^5 background that are dual to (extended) chiral primary operators in N=4 SYM_4. We discuss the vanishing of certain cubic and quartic couplings and non-renormalization property of corresponding correlators in the conformal field theory
