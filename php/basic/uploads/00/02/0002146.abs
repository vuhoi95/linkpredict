Title: A New Class of Supersymmetric Orientifolds with D-Branes at Angles
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Lars Goerlich and Boris Kors
Abstract: We describe a new class of supersymmetric orientifolds which combine the world-sheet parity transformation with a complex conjugation in the compact directions. As an example, we investigate in detail the orientifold of the Z_3 toroidal orbifold in six and four dimensions. We demonstrate how the solution to the tadpole cancellation conditions, the resulting gauge groups and the massless spectra depend on the choice of the complex structures on the tori, giving rise to a variety of inequivalent models. We also summarize the results for the orientifolds of the Z_4, Z_6 and Z_6' orbifolds in four and six dimensions.
