Title: The Structure of the QCD Potential in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: E. Bagan and M. Lavelle and D. McMullan
Abstract: We calculate the screening and anti-screening contributions to the inter-quark potential in 2+1 dimensions, which is relevant to the high temperature limit of QCD. We demonstrate that the relative strength of screening to anti-screening agrees with the 3+1 dimensional theory to better than one percent accuracy.
