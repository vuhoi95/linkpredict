Title: Thermal Quantum Fields in Static Electromagnetic Backgrounds
Authors: A. A. Actor and K. D. Rothe
Abstract: We present and discuss, at a general level, new mathematical results on the spatial nonuniformity of thermal quantum fields coupled minimally to static background electromagnetic potentials. Two distinct examples are worked through in some detail: uniform (parallel and perpendicular) background electric and magnetic fields coupled to a thermal quantum scalar field.
