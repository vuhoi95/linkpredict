Title: A generalized p-form model in D=3
Authors: T. Pisar and J. Rant and H. Zerrouki
Abstract: A topological model in three dimensions is proposed. It combines the Chern-Simons action with a BFK-model which was investigated recently by the authors of hep-th/9906146. The finiteness of the model to all orders of perturbation theory is shown in the framework of algebraic renormalization procedure.
