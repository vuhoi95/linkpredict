Title: Duality between coordinates and Dirac field
Authors: M. C. B. Abdalla and A. L. Gadelha and I. V. Vancea
Abstract: The duality between the Cartesian coordinates on the Minkowski space-time and the Dirac field is investigated. Two distinct possibilities to define this duality are shown to exist. In both cases, the equations satisfied by prepotentials are of second order.
