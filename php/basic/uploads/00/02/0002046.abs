Title: Supersymmetric Pair Correlation Function of Wilson Loops
Authors: Shyamoli Chaudhuri and Eric G. Novak
Abstract: We give a path integral derivation of the annulus diagram in a supersymmetric theory of open and closed strings with Dbranes. We compute the pair correlation function of Wilson loops in the generic weakly coupled supersymmetric flat spacetime background with Dbranes. We obtain a -u^4/r^9 potential between heavy nonrelativistic sources in a supersymmetric gauge theory at short distances.
