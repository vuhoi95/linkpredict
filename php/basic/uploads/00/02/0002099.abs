Abstract: Several recent papers have made considerable progress in proving the existence of remarkable consistent Kaluza-Klein sphere reductions of D=10 and D=11 supergravities, to give gauged supergravities in lower dimensions. A proof of the consistency of the full gauged SO(8) reduction on S^7 from D=11 was given many years ago, but from a practical viewpoint a reduction to a smaller subset of the fields can be more manageable, for the purposes of lifting lower-dimensional solutions back to the higher dimension. The major complexity of the spherical reduction Ansatze comes from the spin-0 fields, and of these, it is the pseudoscalars that are the most difficult to handle. In this paper we address this problem in two cases. One arises in a truncation of SO(8) gauged supergravity in four dimensions to U(1)^4, where there are three pairs of dilatons and axions in the scalar sector. The other example involves the truncation of SO(6) gauged supergravity in D=5 to a subsector containing a scalar and a pseudoscalar field, with a potential that admits a second supersymmetric vacuum aside from the maximally-supersymmetric one. We briefly discuss the use of these emdedding Ansatze for the lifting of solutions back to the higher dimension.
