Title: Casimir Energy and Thermodynamic Properties of the Relativistic  Piecewise Uniform String
Authors: I. Brevik and A. A. Bytsenko
Abstract: The Casimir energy for the transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniform closed string is calculated. The great adaptibility of this string model with respect to various regularization methods is pointed out. We survey several regularization methods: the cutoff method, the complex contour integration method, and the zeta-function method. The most powerful method in the present case is the contour integration method. The Casimir energy turns out to be negative, and more so the larger is the number of pieces in the string. The thermodynamic free energy F is calculated for a two-piece string in the limit when the tension ratio x=T_{I}/T_{II} approaches zero.
