Title: Self-Dual Model Coupled to Bosons
Authors: M. A. Anacleto and J. R. S. Nascimento and R. F. Ribeiro
Abstract: In this paper we investigated the dynamics, at the quantum level, of the self-dual field minimally coupled to bosons. In this investigation we use the Dirac bracket quantization procedure to quantize the model. Also, the relativistic invariance is tested in connection with the elastic boson-boson scattering amplitudes.
