Title: Supergravity Predictions on Conformal Field Theories
Authors: A. Ceresole and G. Dall'Agata and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We give an update on recent results about the matching between CFT operators and KK states in the AdS/CFT correspondence, and add some new comments on the realization of the baryonic symmetries from the supergravity point of view.
