Title: Skyrmions from SU(3) harmonic maps and their quantization
Authors: V. B. Kopeliovich and B. E. Stern and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: Static properties of SU(3) multiskyrmions with baryon number up to 6 (classical masses and momenta of inertia) are estimated. The calculations are based on the recently suggested generalization of the SU(2) rational map ansaetze applied to the SU(3) model. Both SU(2) embedded skyrmions and genuine SU(3) solutions are considered, and it is shown that although, at the classical level, the energy of embeddings is lower, the quantum corrections can alter this conclusion. This correction to the energy of lowest state, bilinear in the Wess-Zumino (WZ) term, is presented for the most general case as a convolution of the inverse tensor of inertia and the components of the WZ-term.
