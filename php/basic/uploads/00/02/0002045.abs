Title: Holomorphy, Minimal Homotopy and the 4D, N = 1 Supersymmetric  Bardeen-Gross-Jackiw Anomaly
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Marcus T. Grisaru and Silvia Penati
Abstract: By use of a special homotopy operator, we present an explicit, closed-form and simple expression for the left-right Bardeen-Gross-Jackiw anomalies described as the proper superspace integral of a superfunction.
