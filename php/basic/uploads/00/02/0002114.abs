Title: Class of self-dual models in three dimensions
Authors: Alvaro de Souza Dutra and Cesar P. Natividade
Abstract: In the present paper we introduce a hierarquical class of self-dual models in three dimensions, inspired in the original self-dual theory of Towsend-Pilch-Nieuwenhuizen. The basic strategy is to explore the powerful property of the duality transformations in order to generate a new field. The generalized propagator can be written in terms of the primitive one (first order), and also the respective order and disorder correlation functions. Some conclusions about the ``charge screening'' and magnetic flux were established.
