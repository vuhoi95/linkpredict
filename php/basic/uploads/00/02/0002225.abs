Title: Universal Ratios in the 2-D Tricritical Ising Model
Authors: D. Fioravanti and G. Mussardo and P. Simon
Abstract: We consider the universality class of the two-dimensional Tricritical Ising Model. The scaling form of the free-energy naturally leads to the definition of universal ratios of critical amplitudes which may have experimental relevance. We compute these universal ratios by a combined use of results coming from Perturbed Conformal Field Theory, Integrable Quantum Field Theory and numerical methods.
