Title: Absorption by Extremal D3-branes
Authors: M. Cvetic and H. Lu and J. F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: The absorption in the extremal D3-brane background is studied for a class of massless fields whose linear perturbations leave the ten-dimensional background metric unperturbed, as well as the minimally-coupled massive scalar. We find that various fields have the same absorption probability as that of the dilaton-axion system, which is given exactly via the Mathieu equation. We analyze the features of the absorption cross-sections in terms of effective Schr\"odinger potentials, conjecture a general form of the dual effective potentials, and provide explicit numerical results for the whole energy range. As expected, all partial-wave absorption probabilities tend to zero (one) at low (large) energies, and exhibit an oscillatory pattern as a function of energy. The equivalence of absorption probabilities for various modes has implications for the correlation functions on the field, including subleading contributions on the field-theory side. In particular, certain half-integer and integer spin fields have identical absorption probabilities, thus providing evidence that the corresponding operator pairs on the field theory side belong to the same supermultiplets.
