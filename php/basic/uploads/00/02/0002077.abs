Title: Fundamental Extended Objects for Chern-Simons Supergravity
Authors: Pablo Mora and Hitoshi Nishino
Abstract: We propose a class of models in which extended objects are introduced in Chern-Simons supergravity in such a way that those objects appear on the same footing as the target space. This is motivated by the idea that branes are already first quantized object, so that it is desirable to have a formalism that treats branes and their target space in a similar fashion. Accordingly, our models describe interacting branes, as gauge systems for supergroups. We also consider the case in which those objects have boundaries, and discuss possible links to superstring theory and/or M-theory, by studying the fermionic kappa-symmetry of the action.
