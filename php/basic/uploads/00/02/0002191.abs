Title: Geometrical Issues for the 3-dim Quantum Euclidean Space
Authors: Gaetano Fiore and John Madore
Abstract: We briefly describe our application of a version of noncommutative differential geometry to the 3-dim quantum space covariant under the quantum group of rotations $SO_q(3)$ and sketch how this might be used to determine the correct physical interpretation of the geometrical observables.
