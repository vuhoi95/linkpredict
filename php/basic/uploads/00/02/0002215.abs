Title: Cosmological perturbation spectra from SL(4,R)-invariant effective  actions
Authors: Helen A. Bridgman and David Wands
Abstract: We investigate four-dimensional cosmological vacuum solutions derived from an effective action invariant under global SL(n,R) transformations. We find the general solutions for linear axion field perturbations about homogeneous dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions for an SL(4,R)-invariant action and find the spectrum of super-horizon perturbations resulting from vacuum fluctuations in a pre big bang scenario. We show that for SL(n,R)-invariant actions with n>3 there exists a regime of parameter space of non-zero measure where all the axion field spectra have positive spectral tilt, as required if light axion fields are to provide a seed for anisotropies in the microwave background and large-scale structure in the universe.
