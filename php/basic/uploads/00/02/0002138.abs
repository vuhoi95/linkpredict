Title: Noncommutative Gauge Theories from Deformation Quantization
Authors: Tsuguhiko Asakawa and Isao Kishimoto
Abstract: We construct noncommutative gauge theories based on the notion of the Weyl bundle, which appears in Fedosov's construction of deformation quantization on an arbitrary symplectic manifold. These correspond to D-brane worldvolume theories in non-constant B-field and curved backgrounds in string theory. All such theories are embedded into a "universal" gauge theory of the Weyl bundle. This shows that the combination of a background field and a noncommutative field strength has universal meaning as a field strength of the Weyl bundle. We also show that the gauge equivalence relation is a part of such a "universal" gauge symmetry.
