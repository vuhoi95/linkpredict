Title: Infra-red fixed points at the boundary
Authors: Klaus Behrndt and Mirjam Cvetic
Abstract: Gauged supergravities (in four and five dimensions) with eight supercharges and with vector supermultiplets have a unique ultra-violet (UV) fixed point on a given physical domain \cal M of the space of the scalar fields. We show that in these models the infra-red (IR) fixed points are located on the boundary of \cal M, where the space-time metric becomes singular.
