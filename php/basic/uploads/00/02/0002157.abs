Title: Ramond-Ramond Field Radiation from Rotating Ellipsoidal Membranes
Authors: Troels Harmark and Konstantin G. Savvidy
Abstract: We find a new stable rotator solution in D0-brane matrix mechanics. The solution is interpreted as a D2/D0 brane bound state, constructed as a transversely rotating ellipsoidal membrane with N D0-branes pinned over it. From the membrane point of view the attractive force of tension is exactly cancelled by the repulsive centrifugal force. Dynamical properties of the system are investigated, in particular the emission of spherical waves in the different massless sectors of supergravity. We compute the RR 1-form quadrupole, the RR 3-form dipole and the gravitational quadrupole radiation. Also, we show that our non-singular classical solution is stable against small perturbations in the initial conditions. Furthermore, we comment on a possible fundamental particle interpretation of our system.
