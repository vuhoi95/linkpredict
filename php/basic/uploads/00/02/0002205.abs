Title: Hyperkahler Singularities in Superstrings Compactification and 2d N=4  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: A. Belhaj and E. H. Saidi
Abstract: We study the singularities of the Higgs branch of supersymmetric U(1)^r gauge theories with eight supercharges. We derive new solutions for the moduli space of vacua preserving manifestly the eight supercharges by using a geometric realization of the SU(2)_R symmetry and a separation procedure of the gauge and SU(2)_R charges, which allow us to put the hypermultiplet vacua in a form depending on a parameter $\gamma$. For $\gamma=1$, we obtain new models which flow in the infrared to 2d N=(4,4) conformal models and we show that the classical moduli spaces are given by intersecting cotangent weighted complex projective spaces containing the small instanton singularity, discussed in [17], as a leading special case. We also make comments regarding the d$2d N=4 conformal Liouville description of the Higgs branch throat by following the analysis of [18]. Other features are also discussed.
