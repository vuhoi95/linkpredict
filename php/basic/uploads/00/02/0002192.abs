Title: A New Supersymmetric Compactification of Chiral IIB Supergravity
Authors: Krzysztof Pilch and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We present a new compactification of chiral, N=2 ten-dimensional supergravity down to five dimensions and show that it corresponds to the N=2 supersymmetric critical point of five-dimensional, N=8 gauged supergravity found in [KPW]. This solution presented here is of particular significance because it involves non-zero tensor gauge fields and, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, is dual to the non-trivial N=1 supersymmetric fixed point of N=4 Yang-Mills theory.
