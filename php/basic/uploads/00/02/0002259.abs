Title: One particular approach to the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics
Authors: E. s. Tututi and P. Jizba
Abstract: We present a particular approach to the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theory. This approach is based on the Jaynes-Gibbs principle of the maximal entropy and its implementation, throghout the initial value data, into the dynamical equations for Green's functions.
