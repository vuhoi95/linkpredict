Authors: J. F. Gomes and E. P. Gueuvoghlanian and G. M. Sotkov and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: A general construction of affine Non Abelian Toda models in terms of gauged two loop WZNW model is discussed. In particular we find the Lie algebraic condition defining a subclass of {\it T-selfdual torsionless NA Toda models} and their zero curvature representation.
