Title: Stability and BPS branes
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Bartomeu Fiol and Christian RÃ¶melsberger
Abstract: We define the concept of Pi-stability, a generalization of mu-stability of vector bundles, and argue that it characterizes N=1 supersymmetric brane configurations and BPS states in very general string theory compactifications with N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions.
