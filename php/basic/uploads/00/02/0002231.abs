Abstract: The cutoff scheme dependence in the several formulations of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) is investigated. It is shown that the cutoff scheme dependence of the Wilsonian effective action is regarded as a certain coordinate transformation on the theory space. From this observation the Wilsonian effective actions are found to suffer from strong dependence on the schemes even in the infra-red asymptotic region for massive theories. However there is no such scheme dependence in the one particle irreducible parts of them, which is called the effective average actions. We also derive the explicit form of the Polchinski RG equation in the sharp cutoff limit. Finally this equation is shown to be identical with the Wegner-Houghton RG equation.
