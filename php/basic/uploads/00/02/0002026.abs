Title: Triplectic Quantization of W2 gravity
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Cresus F. L. Godinho
Abstract: The role of one loop order corrections in the triplectic quantization is discussed in the case of W2 theory. This model illustrates the presence of anomalies and Wess Zumino terms in this quantization scheme where extended BRST invariance is represented in a completely anticanonical form.
