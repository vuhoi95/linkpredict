Abstract: We study the ultraviolet asymptotics in non-simply laced affine Toda theories considering them as perturbed non-affine Toda theories, which possess the extended conformal symmetry. We calculate the reflection amplitudes, in non-affine Toda theories and use them to derive the quantization condition for the vacuum wave function, describing zero-mode dynamics. The solution of this quantization conditions for the ground state energy determines the UV asymptotics of the effective central charge. These asymptotics are in a good agreement with Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz(TBA) results. To make the comparison with TBA possible, we give the exact relations between parameters of the action and masses of particles as well as the bulk free energies for non-simply laced affine Toda theories.
