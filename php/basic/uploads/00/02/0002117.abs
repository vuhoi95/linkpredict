Title: D-Branes as Unstable Lumps in Bosonic Open String Field Theory
Authors: Jeffrey A. Harvey and Per Kraus
Abstract: We construct Dp-branes in bosonic string theory as unstable lumps in a truncated string field theory of open strings on a D25-brane. We find that the lowest level truncation gives good quantitative agreement with the predicted D-brane tension and low-lying spectrum of the D-brane for sufficiently large p and study the effect of the next level corrections for p=24. We show that a U(1) gauge field zero mode on the D-brane arises through a mechanism reminiscent of the Randall-Sundrum mechanism for gravity.
