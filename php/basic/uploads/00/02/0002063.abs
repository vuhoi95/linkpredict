Title: The dynamics of curved gravitating walls
Authors: Filipe Bonjour and Christos Charmousis and Ruth Gregory
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a self-gravitating domain wall using the $\lambda \Phi^4$ model as a specific example. We find that the Nambu motion of the wall is quite generic and dominates the wall motion even in the presence of gravity. We calculate the corrections to this leading order motion, and estimate the effect of the inclusion of gravity on the dynamics of the wall. We then treat the case of a spherical gravitating thick wall as a particular example, solving the field equations and calculating the corrections to the Nambu motion analytically for this specific case. We find that the presence of gravity retards collapse in this case.
