Abstract: Recently, by studying exact flat directions of non-Abelian singlet fields, we demonstrated the existence of free fermionic heterotic-string models in which the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged matter spectrum, just below the string scale, consists solely of the MSSM spectrum. In this paper we generalize the analysis to include VEVs of non-Abelian fields. We find several, MSSM-producing, exact non-Abelian flat directions, which are the first such examples in the literature. We examine the possibility that hidden sector condensates lift the flat directions.
