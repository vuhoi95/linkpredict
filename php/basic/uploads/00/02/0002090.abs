Title: Branes and BPS Configurations of Non-Commutative/Commutative Gauge  Theories
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Takayuki Hirayama
Abstract: We study BPS Dirac monopole in U(1) gauge theory on non-commutative spacetime. The corresponding brane configuration is obtained in the equivalent ordinary gauge theory through the map proposed by Seiberg and Witten. This configuration coincides exactly with a tilted D-string as predicted. This study provides an interesting check of the equivalence of the non-commutative and ordinary gauge theories.
