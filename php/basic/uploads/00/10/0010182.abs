Title: Supersymmetric R^4 actions and quantum corrections to superspace torsion  constraints
Authors: Kasper Peeters and Pierre Vanhove and Anders Westerberg
Abstract: We present the supersymmetrisation of the anomaly-related R^4 term in eleven dimensions and show that it induces no non-trivial modifications to the on-shell supertranslation algebra and the superspace torsion constraints before inclusion of gauge-field terms.
