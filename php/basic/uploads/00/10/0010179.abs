Title: D-branes in non-tachyonic 0B orientifolds
Authors: E. Dudas and J. Mourad
Abstract: We determine all D-branes in the non-tachyonic 0'B orientifold, examine their world-volume anomalies and study orbifold compactifications. We find that the spectrum of the D-branes contains chiral fermions in the symmetric, antisymmetric and fundamental representations of (unitary) gauge groups on the branes. The cancellation of the world-volume anomalies requires Wess-Zumino terms which we determine explicitly. We examine a non-tachyonic compactification to 9D whose closed part interpolates between 0B and IIB and revisit compactifications on orbifolds. The D3-brane allows to conjecture, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, a supergravity dual to a non-supersymmetric and infrared-free gauge theory. The D-string gives hints concerning the S-dual of the 0'B orientifold.
