Title: Deconfining Phase Transition in 2+1 D: the Georgi-Glashow Model
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Ian I. Kogan and Alex Kovner and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We analyze the finite temperature deconfining phase transition in 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model. We show explicitly that the transition is due to the restoration of the magnetic $Z_2$ symmetry and that it is in the Ising universality class. We find that neglecting effects of the charged $W$ bosons leads to incorrect predictions for the value of the critical temperature and the universality class of the transition, as well as for various correlation functions in the high temperature phase. We derive the effective action for the Polyakov loop in the high temperature phase and calculate the correlation functions of magnetic vortex operators.
