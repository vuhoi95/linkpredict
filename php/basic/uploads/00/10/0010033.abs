Title: Duality and quasiparticles in the Calogero-Sutherland model: Some exact  results
Authors: Ivan Andric and Larisa Jonke
Abstract: The quantum-mechanical many-body system with the potential proportional to the pairwise inverse-square distance possesses a strong-weak coupling duality. Based on this duality, particle and/or quasiparticle states are described as SU(1,1) coherent states. The constructed quasiparticle states are of hierarchical nature.
