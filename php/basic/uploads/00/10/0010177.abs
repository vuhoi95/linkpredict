Title: Transport coefficients in high temperature gauge theories: (I)  Leading-log results
Authors: Peter Arnold and Guy D. Moore and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Leading-log results are derived for the shear viscosity, electrical conductivity, and flavor diffusion constants in both Abelian and non-Abelian high temperature gauge theories with various matter field content.
