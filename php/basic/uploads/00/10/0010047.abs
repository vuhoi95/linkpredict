Abstract: We introduce a basis for a bi-dimensional finite matrix calculus and a bi-dimensional finite matrix action principle. As an application, we analyze scalar and spinorial fields in $D=4n+2$ in this approach. We verify that to establish a bi-dimensional matrix action principle we have to define a Dirac-algebra-modified Lebniz rule. From the bi-dimensional equations of motion, we obtain a matrix holomorphic feature for massless matrix scalar and spinorial fields.
