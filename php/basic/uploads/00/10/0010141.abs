Title: Supersymmetry Breaking by Dimensional Reduction over Coset Spaces
Authors: P. Manousselis and G. Zoupanos
Abstract: We study the dimensional reduction of a ten-dimensional supersymmetric E_8 gauge theory over six-dimensional coset spaces. We find that the coset space dimensional reduction over a symmetric coset space leaves the four dimensional gauge theory without any track of the original supersymmetry. On the contrary the dimensional reduction over a non symmetric coset space leads to a softly broken supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions. The SO_7/SO_6 and G_2/SU(3) are used as representative prototypes of symmetric and non symmetric coset spaces respectively.
