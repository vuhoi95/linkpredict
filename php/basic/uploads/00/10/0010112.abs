Title: Localized Gravitons, Gauge Bosons and Chiral Fermions in Smooth Spaces  Generated by a Bounce
Authors: A. Kehagias and K. Tamvakis
Abstract: We study five-dimensional solutions to Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field. Bounce-type solutions for the scalar field are associated with AdS_5 spaces with smooth warp functions. Gravitons are dynamically localized in this framework in analogy to the Randall-Sundrum solution whereas, a bulk fermion gives rise to a single chiral zero mode localized at the bounce. Additional bulk scalar fields are incorporated in this picture. The dilaton, as a bulk scalar leads, through its coupling, to localized gauge boson fields, something that holds also in the case that the bounce system is replaced by a brane.
