Title: Generalized Lorentzian Triangulations and the Calogero Hamiltonian
Authors: P. Di Francesco and E. Guitter and C. Kristjansen
Abstract: We introduce and solve a generalized model of 1+1D Lorentzian triangulations in which a certain subclass of outgrowths is allowed, the occurrence of these being governed by a coupling constant \beta. Combining transfer matrix-, saddle point- and path integral techniques we show that for \beta<1 it is possible to take a continuum limit in which the model is described by a 1D quantum Calogero Hamiltonian. The coupling constant \beta survives the continuum limit and appears as a parameter of the Calogero potential.
