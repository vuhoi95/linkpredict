Abstract: In this paper we show how two dimensional electron systems can be modeled by strings interacting with D-branes. The dualities of string theory allow several descriptions of the system. These include descriptions in terms of solitons in the near horizon D6-brane theory, non-commutative gauge theory on a D2-brane, the Matrix Theory of D0-branes and finally as a giant graviton in M-theory. The soliton can be described as a D2-brane with an incompressible fluid of D0-branes and charged string-ends moving on it. Including an NS5 brane in the system allows for the existence of an edge with the characteristic massless chiral edge states of the Quantum Hall system.
