Title: Fractional Spin through Quantum Affine Algebra $\hat A(n)$ and quantum  affine superalgebra $\hat A(n,m)$
Authors: M. Mansour and M. Daoud
Abstract: Using the splitting of a $Q$-deformed boson, in the $Q \to q= e^{\frac{\rm 2\pi i}{\rm k}}$ limit, the fractional decomposition of the quantum affine algebra $\hat A(n)$ and the quantum affine superalgebra $\hat A(n,m)$ are found. This decomposition is based on the oscillator representation and can be related to the fractional supersymmetry and k-fermionic spin. We establish also the equivalence between the quantum affine algebra $\hat A(n)$ and the classical one in the fermionic realization.
