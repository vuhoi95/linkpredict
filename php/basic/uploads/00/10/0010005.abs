Title: Four - Point Functions of Chiral Primary Operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: B. Eden and C. Schubert and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the determination of correlators of chiral primary operators in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory, based on a combination of superconformal covariance arguments in N=2 harmonic superspace, and Intriligator's insertion formula. Applying this technique to the calculation of the supercurrent four - point function we obtain a compact and explicit result for its three-loop contribution with comparatively little effort.
