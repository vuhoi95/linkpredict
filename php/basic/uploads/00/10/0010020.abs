Title: Boundary Dynamics of Higher Dimensional Chern-Simons Gravity
Authors: J. Gegenberg and G. Kunstatter
Abstract: We review the relevance to the black hole entropy problem of boundary dynamics in Chern-Simons gravity. We then describe a recent derivation of the action induced on the four dimensional boundary in a five dimensional Chern-Simons gravity theory with gauge invariant, anti-deSitter boundary conditions.
