Title: Tachyon Condensation in Noncommutative Gauge Theory
Authors: Per Kraus and Arvind Rajaraman and Stephen Shenker
Abstract: We show that the decay of the D2-\bar{D2} system with large worldvolume magnetic fields can be described in noncommutative gauge theory. Tachyon condensation in this system describes the annihilation of D2-\bar{D2} into $D0$-branes. From the 2+1 dimensional point of view, this is the decay of a nonabelian magnetic flux into vortices. The semiclassical approximation is valid over a long period of the decay. Our analysis allows us to clarify earlier results in the literature related to tachyon condensation and noncommutative gauge theory.
