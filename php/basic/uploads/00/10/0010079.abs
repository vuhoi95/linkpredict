Title: Renormalization Constant of the Color Gauge Field as a Probe of  Confinement
Authors: M. Chaichian and K. Nishijima
Abstract: The mechanism of color confinement as a consequence of an unbroken non-abelian gauge symmetry and asymptotic freedom is elucidated and compared with that of other models based on an analogy with the type II superconductor. It is demonstrated that a sufficient condition for color confinement is given by $Z_3^{-1}=0$ where $Z_3$ denotes the renormalization constant of the color gauge field. It is shown that this condition is actually satisfied in quantum chromodynamics and that some of the characteristic features of other models follow from it.
