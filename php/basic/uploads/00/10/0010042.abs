Title: Generalised 11-dimensional supergravity
Authors: Martin Cederwall and Ulf Gran and Mikkel Nielsen and Bengt EW Nilsson
Abstract: The low-energy effective dynamics of M-theory, eleven-dimensional supergravity, is taken off-shell in a manifestly supersymmetric superspace formulation. We show that a previously proposed relaxation of the torsion constraints can indeed accomodate a current supermultiplet. We comment on the relation and application of this completely general formalism to higher-derivative (R^4) corrections. This talk was presented by Bengt EW Nilsson at the Triangle Meeting 2000 ``Non-perturbative Methods in Field and String Theory'', NORDITA, Copenhagen, June 19-22, 2000, and by Martin Cederwall at the International Conference ``Quantization, Gauge Theory and Strings'' in memory of Efim Fradkin, Moscow, June 5-10, 2000.
