Title: New instantons in the double-well potential
Authors: Stefan Vandoren and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: A new instanton solution is found in the quantum-mechanical double-well potential with a four-fermion term. The solution has finite action and depends on four fermionic collective coordinates. We explain why in general the instanton action can depend on collective coordinates.
