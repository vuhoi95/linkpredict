Title: Curved, extended classical solutions I. The undulating kink
Authors: A. Herat and R. Rademacher and P. Suranyi
Abstract: The energy of extended classical objects, such as vortices, depends on their shape. In particular, we show that the curvature energy of a kink in two spatial dimensions, as a prototype of extended classical solutions, is always negative. We obtain a closed form for the curvature energy, assuming small deviations from the straight line.
