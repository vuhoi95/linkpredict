Title: Introduction to stochastic error correction methods
Authors: Dean Lee and Nathan Salwen and Mark Windoloski
Abstract: We propose a method for eliminating the truncation error associated with any subspace diagonalization calculation. The new method, called stochastic error correction, uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute the contribution of the remaining basis vectors not included in the initial diagonalization. The method is part of a new approach to computational quantum physics which combines both diagonalization and Monte Carlo techniques.
