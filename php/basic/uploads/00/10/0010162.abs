Title: Recurrent dynamical symmetry breaking and restoration by Wilson lines at  finite densities on a torus
Authors: Chung-Chieh Lee and Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: In this paper we derive the general expression of a one-loop effective potential of the nonintegrable phases of Wilson lines for an SU(N) gauge theory with a massless adjoint fermion defined on the spactime manifold $R^{1,d-3}\times T^2$ at finite temperature and fermion density. The Phase structure of the vacuum is presented for the case with $d=4$ and N=2 at zero temperature. It is found that gauge symmetry is broken and restored alternately as the fermion density increases, a feature not found in the Higgs mechanism. It is the manifestation of the quantum effects of the nonintegrable phases.
