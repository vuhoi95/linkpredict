Title: Antifield BRST quantization of duality-symmetric Maxwell theory
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Sorin Cucu
Abstract: We perform the antifield BRST quantization of duality-symmetric Maxwell theory and show explicitly the quantum equivalence of the different formulations (covariant and non-covariant). The non-covariant gauge-fixed action is used in the computation of propagators for this model.
