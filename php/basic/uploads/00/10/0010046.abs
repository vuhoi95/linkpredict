Title: Deconfinement Through Chiral Transition In 2 Flavour QCD
Authors: S. Digal and E. Laermann and H. Satz
Abstract: We propose that in QCD with dynamical quarks, colour deconfinement occurs when an external field induced by the chiral condensate strongly aligns the Polyakov loop. This effect sets in at the chiral symmetry restoration temperature $T_{\chi}$ and thus makes deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration coincide. The predicted singular behavior of Polyakov loop susceptibilities at $T_{\chi}$ is shown to be supported by finite temperature lattice calculations.
