Title: Laughlin type wave function for two-dimensional anyon fields in a  KMS-state
Authors: N. Ilieva and W. Thirring
Abstract: The correlation functions of two-dimensional anyon fields in a KMS-state are studied. For T=0 the $n$-particle wave functions of noncanonical fermions of level $\alpha$, $\alpha$ odd, are shown to be of Laughlin type of order $\alpha$. For $T>0$ they are given by a simple finite-temperature generalization of Laughlin's wave function. This relates the first and second quantized pictures of the fractional quantum Hall effect.
