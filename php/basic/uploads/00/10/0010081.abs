Title: BFFT formalism applied to the minimal chiral Schwinger model

Abstract: We consider the minimal chiral Schwinger model, by embedding the gauge noninvariant formulation into a gauge theory following the Batalin-Fradkin-Fradkina-Tyutin point of view. Within the BFFT procedure, the second class constraints are converted into strongly involutive first-class ones, leading to an extended gauge invariant formulation. We also show that, like the standard chiral model, in the minimal chiral model the Wess-Zumino action can be obtained by performing a q-number gauge transformation into the effective gauge noninvariant action.
