Title: Nonanalyticity of the beta-function and systematic errors in  field-theoretic calculations of critical quantities
Authors: M. Caselle and A. Pelissetto and E. Vicari
Abstract: We consider the fixed-dimension perturbative expansion. We discuss the nonanalyticity of the renormalization-group functions at the fixed point and its consequences for the numerical determination of critical quantities.
