Abstract: A class of non abelian affine Toda models is constructed in terms of the axial and vector gauged WZW model. It is shown that the multivacua structure of the potential together with non abelian nature of the zero grade subalgebra allows soliton solutions with non trivial electric and topological charges. Their zero curvature representation and the classical $r$-matrix are also constructed in order to prove their classical integrability.
