Authors: S. Liberati and F. Belgiorno and Matt Visser
Abstract: In [hep-th/0009173] Milton has presented a brief review of some interesting aspects of the theory of the Casimir effect. This comment is aimed at correcting some imprecise statements in that work with respect to the relevance of the Casimir effect for explaining the phenomenon of sonoluminescence.
