Title: Damped harmonic oscillators in the holomorphic representation
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: Quantum dynamical semigroups are applied to the study of the time evolution of harmonic oscillators, both bosonic and fermionic. Explicit expressions for the density matrices describing the states of these systems are derived using the holomorphic representation. Bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are then put together to form a supersymmetric oscillator; the conditions that assure supersymmetry invariance of the corresponding dynamical equations are explicitly derived.
