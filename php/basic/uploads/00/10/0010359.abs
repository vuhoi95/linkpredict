Title: Surface Tension of a Metal-Electrolyte Boundary: Exactly Solvable Model
Authors: L. Å amaj and B. Jancovici
Abstract: An ideal conductor electrode in contact with a semi-infinite two-dimensional two-component plasma in an external potential is considered. The model is mapped onto an integrable sine-Gordon theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The information gained from the mapping provides an explicit form of the surface tension in the plasma-stability regime.
