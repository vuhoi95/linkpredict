Title: Perturbations of brane worlds
Authors: Nathalie Deruelle and Tomas Dolezel and Joseph Katz
Abstract: We consider cosmological models where the universe, governed by Einstein's equations, is a piece of a five dimensional double-sided anti-de Sitter spacetime (that is, a "$Z_2$-symmetric bulk") with matter confined to its four dimensional Robertson-Walker boundary or "brane". We study the perturbations of such models. We use conformally minkowskian coordinates to disentangle the contributions of the bulk gravitons and of the motion of the brane. We find the restrictions put on the bulk gravitons when matter on the brane is taken to be a scalar field and we solve in that case the brane perturbation equations.
