Title: Off-shell d=5 Supergravity coupled to Matter-Yang-Mills System
Authors: T. Kugo and K. Ohashi
Abstract: We present an off-shell formulation of matter-Yang-Mills system coupled to supergravity in five dimensional space-time. We give an invariant action for the general system of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets coupled to supergravity as well as the supersymmetry transformation rules. All the auxiliary fields are kept un-eliminated so that the supersymmetry transformation rules remain unchanged even when the action is changed.
