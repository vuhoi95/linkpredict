Title: Vortices and bags in 2+1 dimension
Authors: Cesar D. Fosco and Alex Kovner
Abstract: We consider the effect of the (heavy) fundamental quarks on the low energy effective Lagrangian description of nonabelian gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in the presence of the fundamental charges, the magnetic $Z_N$ symmetry becomes local. We construct the effective Lagrangian representing this local symmetry in terms of magnetic vortex fields, and discuss its physical consequences. We show that the finite energy states described by this Lagrangian have distinct bag-like structure. The point-like quarks are confined to the region of space where the value of the vortex field is much smaller than in the surrounding vacuum.
