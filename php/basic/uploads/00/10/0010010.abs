Title: Conformal general relativity contains the quantum
Authors: R. Bonal and I. Quiros and R. Cardenas
Abstract: Based on the de Broglie-Bohm relativistic quantum theory of motion we show that the conformal formulation of general relativity, being linked with a Weyl-integrable geometry, may implicitly contain the quantum effects of matter. In this context the Mach's principle is discussed.
