Title: On one-parametric families of Backlund transformations
Authors: Sergei Igonin and Joseph Krasil'shchik
Abstract: In the context of the cohomological deformation theory, infinitesimal description of one-parametric families of Backlund transformations of special type including classical examples is given. It is shown that any family of such a kind evolves in the direction of a nonlocal symmetry shadow.
