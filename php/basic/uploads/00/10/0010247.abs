Title: Renormalization Group Analysis of Tachyon Condensation
Authors: Satabhisa Dasgupta and Tathagata Dasgupta
Abstract: Renormalization group analysis of boundary conformal field theory on bosonic D25-brane is used to study tachyon condensation. Placing the lump on a finite circle and triggering only the first three tachyon modes, the theory flows to nearby IR fixed point representing lumps that are extended object with definite profile. The boundary entropy corresponding to the D24-brane tension is calculated in the leading order in perturbative analysis which decreases under RG flow and agrees with the expected result to an accuracy of 8%. Multicritical behaviour of the IR theory suggests that the end point of the flow represents a configuration of two D24-branes. Analogy with Kondo physics is discussed.
