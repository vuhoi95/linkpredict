Title: Geodesic Deviation in Kaluza-Klein Theories
Authors: Richard Kerner and Jerome Martin and Salvatore Mignemi and Jan-Willem van Holten
Abstract: We study in detail the equations of the geodesic deviation in multidimensional theories of Kaluza-Klein type. We show that their 4-dimensional space-time projections are identical with the equations obtained by direct variation of the usual geodesic equation in the presence of the Lorentz force, provided that the fifth component of the deviation vector satisfies an extra constraint derived here.
