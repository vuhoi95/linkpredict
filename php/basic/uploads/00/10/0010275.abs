Title: One-loop four-point function in noncommutative {\cal N}=4 Yang-Mills  theory
Authors: Alberto Santambrogio and Daniela Zanon
Abstract: We compute the one-loop four-point function in {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N). We perform the calculation in {\cal N}=1 superspace using the background field method and obtain the complete off-shell contributions to the effective action from planar and non planar supergraphs. In the low-energy approximation the result simplifies and we can study its properties under gauge transformations. It appears that the nonplanar contributions do not maintain the gauge invariance of the classical action.
