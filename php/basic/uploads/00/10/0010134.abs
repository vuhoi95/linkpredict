Title: Chaotic Quantization of Classical Gauge Fields
Authors: T. S. Biro and S. G. Matinyan and B. Muller
Abstract: We argue that higher dimensional classical, nonabelian gauge theory may lead to a lower dimensional quantum field theory due to its inherent chaotic dynamics which acts like stohastic quantization. The dimensional reduction is based upon magnetic screening effects analagous to that in nonabelian plasmas.
