Title: RR charges of D2-branes in group manifold and Hanany-Witten effect
Authors: Takahiro Kubota and Jian-Ge Zhou
Abstract: By exploiting the correspondence between the Cardy boundary state in SU(2) group manifold and the BPS D3-brane configuration in the full asymptotically flat geometry of NS5-branes, we show that the Hanany-Witten effect in 10D background is encoded in the Cardy boundary states. The two RR Page D0 charges of the $n$-th spherical D2-brane due to the contraction to $e$ or ($-e$) is interpreted, and attributed to the Hanany-Witten effect.
