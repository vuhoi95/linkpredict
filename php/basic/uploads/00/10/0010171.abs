Title: Hodge Duality on the Brane
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu
Abstract: It has been claimed that whereas scalars can be bound to a Randall-Sundrum brane, higher p-form potentials cannot, in contradiction with the Hodge duality between 0-form and 3-form potentials in the five-dimensional bulk. Here we show that a 3-form in the bulk correctly yields a 2-form on the brane, in complete agreement with both bulk and brane duality. We also emphasize that the phenomenon of photon screening in the Randall-Sundrum geometry is ruled out by the bulk Einstein equation.
