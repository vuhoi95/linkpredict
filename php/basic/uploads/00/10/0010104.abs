Title: Superstrings on AdS_5 x S^5 supertwistor space
Authors: Radu Roiban and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We derive the Green-Schwarz action on AdS_5 x S^5 using an alternate version of the coset superspace construction. By Wick rotations and Lie algebra identifications we bring the coset to GL(4|4)/(Sp(4) x GL(1))^2, which allows us to represent the conformal transformations on unconstrained matrices. The derivation is more streamlined even for the bosonic sector, and conformal symmetry is manifest at every step. Kappa-symmetry gauge fixing is more transparent.
