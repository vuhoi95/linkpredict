Title: When is S=A/4?
Authors: Alejandro Corichi and Daniel Sudarsky
Abstract: Black hole entropy and its relation to the horizon area are considered. More precisely, the conditions and specifications that are expected to be required for the assignment of entropy, and the consequences that these expectations have when applied to a black hole are explored. In particular, the following questions are addressed: When do we expect to assign an entropy?; when are entropy and area proportional? and, what is the nature of the horizon? It is concluded that our present understanding of black hole entropy is somewhat incomplete, and some of the relevant issues that should be addressed in pursuing these questions are pointed out.
