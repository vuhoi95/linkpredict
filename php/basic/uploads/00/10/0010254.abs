Title: Generalized Gauge Theories and Weinberg-Salam Model with Dirac-KÃ¤hler  Fermions
Authors: Noboru Kawamoto and Takuya Tsukioka and Hiroshi Umetsu
Abstract: We extend previously proposed generalized gauge theory formulation of Chern-Simons type and topological Yang-Mills type actions into Yang-Mills type actions. We formulate gauge fields and Dirac-K\"ahler matter fermions by all degrees of differential forms. The simplest version of the model which includes only zero and one form gauge fields accommodated with the graded Lie algebra of $SU(2|1)$ supergroup leads Weinberg-Salam model. Thus the Weinberg-Salam model formulated by noncommutative geometry is a particular example of the present formulation.
