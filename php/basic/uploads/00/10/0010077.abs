Authors: Enrique Alvarez and Manuel Donaire and Lorenzo Hernandez
Abstract: Sigma model ($\alpha^{\prime}$) corrections to the confining string background are obtained. The main result is that the Poincar\'e invariant ansatz is maintained. Physical conditions for the dissapearance of the naked singularity are discussed.
