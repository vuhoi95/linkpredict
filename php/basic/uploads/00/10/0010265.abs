Abstract: We consider gluodynamics in case when both color and magnetic charges are present. We discuss first short distance physics, where only the fundamental |Q|=1 monopoles introduced via the `t Hooft loop can be considered consistently. We show that at short distances the external monopoles interact as pure Abelian objects. This result can be reproduced by a Zwanziger-type Lagrangian with an Abelian dual gluon. We introduce also an effective dual gluodynamics which might be a valid approximation at distances where the monopoles |Q|=2 can be considered as point-like as well. Assuming the monopole condensation we arrive at a model which is reminiscent in some respect of the Abelian Higgs model but, unlike the latter leaves space for the Casimir scaling.
