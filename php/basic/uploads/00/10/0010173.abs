Title: Nonlinear Supersymmetry Without the GSO Projection and Unstable D9-Brane
Authors: Tabito Hara and Tamiaki Yoneya
Abstract: Orientable open string theories containing both bosons and fermions without the GSO projection are expected to have the 10 dimensional N=2(A) space-time supersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. We study the low-energy theorem for the nonlinearly realized N=2 supersymmetry using the effective action for an unstable D9-brane. It is explicitly confirmed that the 4-fermion open string amplitudes without the GSO projection obey the low-energy theorem derived from the nonlinear N=2 supersymmetry. An intimate connection between the existence of the hidden supersymmetry and the open-open string (s-t) duality is pointed out.
