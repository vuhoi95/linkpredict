Title: Phenomenological Consequences of Non-commutative QED
Authors: H. Arfaei and M. H. Yavartanoo
Abstract: In the context of the noncommutative QED we consider few phenomena which reflect the noncommutativity. In all of them the new interactions in the Feynmann diagrams that are responsible for the deviation from the standard QED results. These deviations appear as the violations of Lorentz symmetry. We suggest experimental situations where these effects may be observed. The extra phases have far reaching consequences including violation of crossing symmetry. Considering the e-p scattering and Compton scattering the electric dipole moments of the electron and the photon is calculated.
