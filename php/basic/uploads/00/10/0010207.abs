Title: Vector Manifestation of the Chiral Symmetry
Authors: Masayasu Harada and Koichi Yamawaki
Abstract: We propose ``vector manifestation (VM)'' of the Wigner realization of the chiral symmetry in which the symmetry is restored at the critical point by the massless degenerate pion (and its flavor partners) and rho meson (and its flavor partners) as the chiral partner, in sharp contrast to the traditional manifestation \'a la linear sigma model where the symmetry is restored by the degenerate pion and scalar meson. The application to the chiral phase transition of the large Nf QCD is performed using the hidden local symmetry Lagrangian. Combined with the Wilsonian matching proposed recently, the VM determines the critical number of massless flavors Nf \simeq 5 without much ambiguity.
