Title: Supergravity Instantons for N=2 Hypermultiplets
Authors: Michael Gutperle and Michal Spalinski
Abstract: The dimensional reduction of eleven dimensional supergravity on a Calabi-Yau manifold gives N=2 supergravity in five dimensions with $h_{1,1}$ vector and $h_{2,1}+1$ hypermultiplets. In this paper instanton solutions are constructed which are responsible for nonperturbtative corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli spaces. These instantons are wrapped Euclidean membranes and fivebranes. For vanishing fivebrane charge the BPS conditions for these solutions define a flow in the hypermultiplet moduli space and are isomorphic to the attractor equations for four dimensional black holes.
