Title: Some infinite series related to Feynman diagrams
Authors: Odd Magne Ogreid and Per Osland
Abstract: Results are presented for some infinite series appearing in Feynman diagram calculations, many of which are similar to the Euler series. These include both one-, two- and three-dimensional series. The sums of these series can be evaluated with the help of various integral representations for hypergeometric functions, and expressed in terms of $\zeta(2)$, $\zeta(3)$, the Catalan constant $G$ and ${\rm Cl}_2(\pi/3)$ where ${\rm Cl}_2(\theta)$ is Clausen's function.
