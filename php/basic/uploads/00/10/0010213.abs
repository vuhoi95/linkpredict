Title: D-dimensional Ideal Quantum Gases in $Ar^{n}+Br^{-n}$ Potential
Authors: Ahmed Jellal and Mohammed Daoud
Abstract: The paper is concerned with thermostatistics of both $D$-dimensional Bose and Fermi ideal gases in a confining potential of type $Ar^{n}+Br^{-n}$. The investigation is performed in the framework of the semiclassical approximation. Some physical quantities for such systems are derived, like density of states, density profiles and number of particles. Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is discussed in the high and low temperature regimes.
