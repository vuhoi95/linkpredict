Title: Patterns of Broken Chiral Symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics
Authors: R. Acharya and P. Narayana Swamy
Abstract: We establish that in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at zero temperature, SU_(L+R)(N_F) exhibits the vector mode conjectured by Georgi and SU_(L-R)(N_F)is realized in either the Nambu-Goldstone mode or else the axial-vector charge is also screened from view at infinity. The Wigner-Weyl mode is ruled out unless the beta function in QCD develops an infrared stable zero.
