Title: Lorentz harmonics and superfield action. D=10, N=1 superstring
Authors: Igor Bandos and Tatyana Bandos
Abstract: We propose a new version of the superfield action for a closed D=10, N=1 superstring where the Lorentz harmonics are used as auxiliary superfields. The incorporation of Lorentz harmonics into the superfield action makes possible to obtain superfield constraints of the induced worldsheet supergravity as equations of motion. Moreover, it becomes evident that a so-called 'Wess-Zumino part' of the superfield action is basically a Lagrangian form of the generalized action principle. We propose to use the second Noether theorem to handle the essential terms in the transformation lows of hidden gauge symmetries, which remove dynamical degrees of freedom from the Lagrange multiplier superfield.
