Title: Discrete Torsion, Non-Abelian Orbifolds and the Schur Multiplier
Authors: Bo Feng and Amihay Hanany and Yang-Hui He and Nikolaos Prezas
Abstract: Armed with the explicit computation of Schur Multipliers, we offer a classification of SU(n) orbifolds for n = 2,3,4 which permit the turning on of discrete torsion. This is in response to the host of activity lately in vogue on the application of discrete torsion to D-brane orbifold theories. As a by-product, we find a hitherto unknown class of N = 1 orbifolds with non-cyclic discrete torsion group. Furthermore, we supplement the status quo ante by investigating a first example of a non-Abelian orbifold admitting discrete torsion, namely the ordinary dihedral group as a subgroup of SU(3). A comparison of the quiver theory thereof with that of its covering group, the binary dihedral group, without discrete torsion, is also performed.
