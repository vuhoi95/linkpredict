Title: Higher-dimensional BF theories in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: The  BV action and generalized Wilson loops
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Carlo A. Rossi
Abstract: This paper analyzes in details the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization procedure for BF theories on n-dimensional manifolds and describes a suitable superformalism to deal with the master equation and the search of observables. In particular, generalized Wilson loops for BF theories with additional polynomial B-interactions are discussed in any dimensions. The paper also contains the explicit proofs to the Theorems stated in math.QA/0003073.
