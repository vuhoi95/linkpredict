Title: On Exact Noncommutative BPS Solitons
Authors: Masashi Hamanaka and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: We construct new exact BPS solitons in various noncommutative gauge theories by the ``gauge'' transformation of known BPS solitons. This ``gauge'' transformation introduced by Harvey, Kraus and Larsen adds localized solitons to the known soliton. These solitons include, for example, the bound state of a noncommutative Abelian monopole and N fluxons at threshold. This corresponds, in superstring theories, to a D-string which attaches to a D3-brane and N D-strings which pierce the D3-brane, where all D-strings are parallel to each other.
