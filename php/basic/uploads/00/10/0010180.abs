Title: Quantum-mechanical tunnelling and the renormalization group
Authors: A. S. Kapoyannis and N. Tetradis
Abstract: We explore the applicability of the exact renormalization group to the study of tunnelling phenomena. We investigate quantum-mechanical systems whose energy eigenstates are affected significantly by tunnelling through a barrier in the potential. Within the approximation of the derivative expansion, we find that the exact renormalization group predicts the correct qualitative behaviour for the lowest energy eigenvalues. However, quantitative accuracy is achieved only for potentials with small barriers. For large barriers, the use of alternative methods, such as saddle-point expansions, can provide quantitative accuracy.
