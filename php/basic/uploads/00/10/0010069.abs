Title: Friedel oscillations in a Luttinger liquid with long-range interactions
Authors: Victoria I. Fernández and Carlos M. Naón
Abstract: We introduce a path-integral approach that allows to compute charge density oscillations in a Luttinger liquid with impurities. We obtain an explicit expression for the envelope of Friedel oscillations in the presence of arbitrary electron-electron potentials. As examples, in order to illustrate the procedure, we show how to use our formula for contact and Coulomb potentials.
