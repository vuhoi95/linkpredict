Title: Nonassociative geometry: Towards discrete structure of spacetime
Authors: Alexander I. Nesterov and L. V. Sabinin
Abstract: In the framework of nonassociative geometry (hep-th/0003238) a unified description of continuum and discrete spacetime is proposed. In our approach at the Planck scales the spacetime is described as a so-called "diodular discrete structure" which at large spacetime scales `looks like' a differentiable manifold. After a brief review of foundations of nonassociative geometry,we discuss the nonassociative smooth and discrete de Sitter spacetimes.
