Title: Exact Noncommutative Solitons
Authors: Jeffrey A. Harvey and Per Kraus and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We find exact solitons in a large class of noncommutative gauge theories using a simple solution generating technique. The solitons in the effective field theory description of open string field theory are interpreted as D-branes for any value of the noncommutativity. We discuss the vacuum structure of open string field theory in view of our results.
