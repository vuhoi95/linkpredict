Title: Pseudoconformal field theory at the "wrong level"
Authors: Doron Gepner and Dmitry Kerner
Abstract: Pseudoaffine theories are characterized by formal replacement of the level to the fractional number: $k\to\frac{k}{q}$, where $q$ is integer strange to $k(g+k)$ ($g$ - dual Coxeter number). An example of "forbidden" $q$ is considered (SU(2), $q=2$). The fusions of obtained theory are similar to the affine ones. Spectra of minimal models are calculated.
