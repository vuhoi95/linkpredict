Title: Running couplings and triviality of field theories on non-commutative  spaces
Authors: Emil T. Akhmedov and Philip DeBoer and Gordon W. Semenoff
Abstract: We examine the issue of renormalizability of asymptotically free field theories on non-commutative spaces. As an example, we solve the non-commutative O(N) invariant Gross-Neveu model at large N. On commutative space this is a renormalizable model with non-trivial interactions. On the noncommutative space, if we take the translation invariant ground state, we find that the model is non-renormalizable. Removing the ultraviolet cutoff yields a trivial non-interacting theory.
