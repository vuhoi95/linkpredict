Title: Radiatively Induced Lorentz and CPT Violation in Schwinger Constant  Field Approximation
Authors: M. Chaichian and W. F. Chen and R. Gonzalez Felipe
Abstract: The Schwinger proper-time method is an effective calculation method, explicitly gauge invariant and nonperturbative. We make use of this method to investigate the radiatively induced Lorentz and CPT-violating effects in quantum electrodynamics when an axial vector interaction term is introduced in the fermionic sector. The induced Lorentz and CPT-violating Chern-Simons term coincides with the one obtained using a covariant derivative expansion but differs from the result usually obtained in other regularization schemes. A possible ambiguity in the approach is also discussed.
