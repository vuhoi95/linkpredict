Title: 6D trace anomalies from quantum mechanical path integrals
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Olindo Corradini
Abstract: We use the recently developed dimensional regularization (DR) scheme for quantum mechanical path integrals in curved space and with a finite time interval to compute the trace anomalies for a scalar field in six dimensions. This application provides a further test of the DR method applied to quantum mechanics. It shows the efficiency in higher loop computations of having to deal with covariant counterterms only, as required by the DR scheme.
