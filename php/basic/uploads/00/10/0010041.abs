Title: Complete integrability of the coupled KdV-mKdV system
Authors: Paul Kersten and Joseph Krasil'shchik
Abstract: The coupled KdV-mKdV system arises as the classical part of one of superextensions of the KdV equation. For this system, we prove its complete integrability, i.e., existence of a recursion operator and of infinite series of symmetries.
