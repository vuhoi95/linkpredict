Title: Vector Deformations of N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory, Pinned Branes, and  Arched Strings
Authors: K. Dasgupta and O. J. Ganor and G. Rajesh
Abstract: We study a deformation of N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory by a dimension-5 vector operator. There is a simple nonlocal "dipole" field-theory that realizes this deformation. We present evidence that this theory is realized in the setting of "pinned-branes". The dipoles correspond to open strings that arch out of the brane. We find the gravitational dual of the theory at large N. We also discuss the generalization to the (2,0) theory.
