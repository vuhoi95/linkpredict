Title: Antisymmetrised 2p-forms generalising curvature 2-forms II: a  p-hierarchy of Reissner-Nordstrom type metrics in dimensions d>2p+1
Authors: A. Chakrabarti and D. H. Tchrakian
Abstract: The p-hierarchy of Schwarzschild type metrics obtained in a preceing paper is generalised here to a corresponding Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) type hierarchy in the presence of a point charge q in d-dimensions. Certain special features arising, concerning the horizons and the interior region, are discussed.
