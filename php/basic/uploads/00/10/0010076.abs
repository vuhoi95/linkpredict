Title: Maximal gauged supergravity in three dimensions
Authors: H. Nicolai and H. Samtleben
Abstract: We construct maximally supersymmetric gauged N=16 supergravity in three dimensions, thereby obtaining an entirely new class of AdS supergravities. These models are not derivable from any known higher-dimensional theory, indicating the existence of a new type of supergravity beyond D=11. They are expected to be of special importance also for the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence. One of their noteworthy features is a nonabelian generalization of the duality between scalar and vector fields in three dimensions. Among the possible gauge groups, SO(8)xSO(8) is distinguished as the maximal compact gauge group, but there are also more exotic possibilities such as F_4 x G_2.
