Title: Chern-Simons action in noncommutative space
Authors: N. Grandi and G. A. Silva
Abstract: We derive the noncommutative Chern-Simons action induced by Dirac fermions coupled to a background gauge field, for the fundamental, antifundamental, and the adjoint representation. We discuss properties of the noncommutative Chern-Simons action showing in particular that the Seiberg-Witten formula maps it into the standard commutative Chern-Simons action.
