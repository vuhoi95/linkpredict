Title: A Brief History of the Stringy Instanton
Authors: Nick Dorey and Timothy J. Hollowood and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: The arcane ADHM construction of Yang-Mills instantons can be very naturally understood in the framework of D-brane dynamics in string theory. In this point-of-view, the mysterious auxiliary symmetry of the ADHM construction arises as a gauge symmetry and the instantons are modified at short distances where string effects become important. By decoupling the stringy effects, one can recover all the instanton formalism, including the all-important volume form on the instanton moduli space. We describe applications of the instanton calculus to the AdS/CFT correspondence and higher derivative terms in the D3-brane effective action. In these applications, there is an interesting relation between instanton partition functions, the Euler characteristic of instanton moduli space and modular symmetry. We also describe how it is now possible to do multi-instanton calculations in gauge theory and we resolve an old puzzle involving the gluino condensate in supersymmetric QCD.
