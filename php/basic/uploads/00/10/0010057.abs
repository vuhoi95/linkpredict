Title: Bethe vectors of the osp(1|2) Gaudin model
Authors: P. P. Kulish and N. Manojlovic
Abstract: The eigenvectors of the osp(1|2) invariant Gaudin hamiltonians are found using explicitly constructed creation operators. Commutation relations between the creation operators and the generators of the loop superalgebra are calculated. The coordinate representation of the Bethe states is presented. The relation between the Bethe vectors and solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation yields the norm of the eigenvectors.
