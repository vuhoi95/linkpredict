Title: Electromagnetic Contributions to Lepton g-2 in a Thick Brane-World
Authors: R. Casadio and A. Gruppuso and G. Venturi
Abstract: We consider Standard Model fields living inside a thick four dimensional flat brane embedded in a (possibly warped) five dimensional space-time and estimate the electromagnetic corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the electron and muon by including virtual massive fermion and gauge boson states. Constraints on the mass of the ``excited'' states (or thickness of the brane-world) are obtained.
