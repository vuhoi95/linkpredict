Title: World-Volume Potentials on D-branes
Authors: M. R. Garousi and R. C. Myers
Abstract: By evaluating string scattering amplitudes, we investigate various low energy interactions for the massless scalars on a nonabelian Dirichlet brane. We confirm the existence of couplings of closed string fields to the world-volume scalars, involving commutators of the latter. Our results are consistent with the recently proposed nonabelian world-volume actions for Dp-branes.
