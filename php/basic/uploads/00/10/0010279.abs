Title: Type-I vacua and brane transmutation
Authors: C. Angelantonj and A. Sagnotti
Abstract: In a classic paper, Fradkin and Tseytlin showed how magnetic deformations can be introduced in open strings. In this contribution we review some recent work on type-I vacua with magnetised branes and describe the role of additional discrete deformations, related to quantised values of the NS-NS antisymmetric tensor B_ab.
