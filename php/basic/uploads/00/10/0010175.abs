Title: Hydrogen Atom Spectrum and the Lamb Shift in Noncommutative QED
Authors: M. Chaichian and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari and A. Tureanu
Abstract: We have calculated the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and as well the Lamb shift within the noncommutative quantum electrodynamics theory. The results show deviations from the usual QED both on the classical and on the quantum levels. On both levels, the deviations depend on the parameter of space/space noncommutativity.
