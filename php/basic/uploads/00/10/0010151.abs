Title: Towards a supersymmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld theory
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and M. de Roo and A. Sevrin
Abstract: We define an iterative procedure to obtain a non-abelian generalization of the Born-Infeld action. This construction is made possible by the use of the severe restrictions imposed by kappa-symmetry. We have calculated all bosonic terms in the action up to terms quartic in the Yang-Mills field strength and all fermion bilinear terms up to terms cubic in the field strength. Already at this order the fermionic terms do not satisfy the symmetric trace-prescription.
