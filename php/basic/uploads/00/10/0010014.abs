Title: Cosmological Evolution of a Brane Universe in a Type 0 String Background
Authors: E. Papantonopoulos and I. Pappa
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a D3-brane Universe in a type 0 string background. We follow the brane-universe along the radial coordinate of the background and we calculate the energy density which is induced on the brane because of its motion in the bulk. We find that for some typical values of the parameters and for a particular range of values of the scale factor of the brane-universe, the effective energy density is dominated by a term proportional to $\frac{1}{(loga)^{4}}$ indicating a slow varying inflationary phase. For larger values of the scale factor the effective energy density takes a constant value and the brane-universe enters its usual inflationary period.
