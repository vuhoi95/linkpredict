Abstract: Connes' gauge theory on $M_4\times Z_2$ is reformulated in the Lagrangian level. It is pointed out that the field strength in Connes' gauge theory is not unique. We explicitly construct a field strength different from Connes' one and prove that our definition leads to the generation-number independent Higgs potential. It is also shown that the nonuniqueness is related to the assumption that two different extensions of the differential geometry are possible when the extra one-form basis $\chi$ is introduced to define the differential geometry on $M_4\times Z_2$. Our reformulation is applied to the standard model based on Connes' color-flavor algebra. A connection between the unimodularity condition and the electric charge quantization is then discussed in the presence or absence of $\nu_R$.
