Title: Charged Rotating Black Holes in 5d Einstein-Maxwell-(A)dS Gravity
Authors: D. Klemm and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: We obtain charged rotating black hole solutions to the theory of Einstein-Maxwell gravity with cosmological constant in five dimensions. Some of the physical properties of these black holes are discussed.
