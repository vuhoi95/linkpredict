Title: Local Field Theory ON $Îº$-Minkowski Space, Star Products and  Noncommutative Translations
Authors: P. Kosinski and J. Lukierski and P. Maslanka
Abstract: We consider local field theory on $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space which is an example of solvable Lie-algebraic noncommutative structure. Using integration formula over $\kappa$-Minkowski space and $\kappa$-deformed Fourier transform we consider for deformed local fields the reality conditions as well as deformation of action functionals in standard Minkowski space. We present explicite formulas for two equivalent star products describing CBH quantization of field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space. We express also via star product technique the noncommutative translations in $\kappa$-Minkowski space by commutative translations in standard Minkowski space.
