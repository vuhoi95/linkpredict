Title: Covariant Quantization of the Brink-Schwarz Superparticle
Authors: P. A. Grassi and G. Policastro and M. Porrati
Abstract: The quantization of the Brink-Schwarz-Casalbuoni superparticle is performed in an explicitly covariant way using the antibracket formalism. Since an infinite number of ghost fields are required, within a suitable off-shell twistor-like formalism, we are able to fix the gauge of each ghost sector without modifying the physical content of the theory. The computation reveals that the antibracket cohomology contains only the physical degrees of freedom.
