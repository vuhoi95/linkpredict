Title: Abelian and center gauges in continuum Yang-Mills-Theory
Authors: H. Reinhardt and T. Tok
Abstract: Abelian and center gauges are considered in continuum Yang-Mills theory in order to detect the magnetic monopole and center vortex content of gauge field configurations. Specifically we examine the Laplacian Abelian and center gauges, which are free of Gribov copies, as well as the center gauge analog of the (Abelian) Polyakov gauge. In particular, we study meron, instanton and instanton-anti-instanton field configurations in these gauges and determine their monopole and vortex content. While a single instanton does not give rise to a center vortex, we find center vortices for merons. Furthermore we provide evidence, that merons can be interpreted as intersection points of center vortices. For the instanton-anti-instanton pair, we find a center vortex enclosing their centers, which carries two monopole loops.
