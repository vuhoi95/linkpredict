Title: Instability of charged black holes in anti-de Sitter space
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Indrajit Mitra
Abstract: We exhibit a tachyonic mode in a linearized analysis of perturbations of large anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four dimensions. In the large black hole limit, and up to a 0.7% discrepancy which is probably round-off error in the numerical analysis, the tachyon appears precisely when the black hole becomes thermodynamically unstable.
