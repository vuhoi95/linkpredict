Title: Holographic Duals of 4D Field Theories
Authors: M. Porrati and A. Starinets
Abstract: We discuss various aspect of the holographic correspondence between 5-d gravity and 4-d field theory. First of all, we describe deformations of N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories in terms of 5-d gauged supergravity. In particular, we describe N=0 and N=1 deformations of N=4 SYM to confining theories. Secondly, we describe recent proposals for the holographic dual of the renormalization group and for 4-d central charges associated to it. We conclude with a ``holographic'' proof of the Goldstone theorem.
