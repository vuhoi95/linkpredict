Title: Brane tunneling and the Brane World scenario
Authors: Alexander Gorsky and Konstantin Selivanov
Abstract: Fate of branes in external fields is reviewed. Spontaneous creation of the Brane World in $AdS_{5}$ with external field is described. The resulting Brane World consists of a flat 4d spatially finite expanding Universe and curved expanding "regulator" branes. All branes have a positive tension.
