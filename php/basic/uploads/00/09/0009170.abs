Title: Quantum Cauchy problem in cosmology
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and D. V. Nesterov
Abstract: We develop a general framework for effective equations of expectation values in quantum cosmology and pose for them the quantum Cauchy problem with no-boundary and tunneling wavefunctions. We apply this framework in the model with a big negative non-minimal coupling, which incorporates a recently proposed low energy (GUT scale) mechanism of the quantum origin of the inflationary Universe and study the effects of the quantum inflaton mode.
