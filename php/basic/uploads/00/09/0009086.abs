Title: Clifford algebra as quantum language
Authors: James Baugh and David Ritz Finkelstein and Andrei Galiautdinov and Heinrich Saller
Abstract: We suggest Clifford algebra as a useful simplifying language for present quantum dynamics. Clifford algebras arise from representations of the permutation groups as they arise from representations of the rotation groups. Aggregates using such representations for their permutations obey Clifford statistics. The vectors supporting the Clifford algebras of permutations and rotations are plexors and spinors respectively. Physical spinors may actually be plexors describing quantum ensembles, not simple individuals. We use Clifford statistics to define quantum fields on a quantum space-time, and to formulate a quantum dynamics-field-space-time unity that evades the compactification problem. The quantum bits of history regarded as a quantum computation seem to obey a Clifford statistics.
