Title: Effective dissipative dynamics for polarized photons
Authors: F. Benatti and R. Floreanini
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, the propagation of polarized photons can be effectively described using quantum dynamical semigroups. These extended time-evolutions induce irreversibility and dissipation. Planned, high sensitive experiments, both in the laboratory and in space, will be able to put stringent bounds on these non-standard effects.
