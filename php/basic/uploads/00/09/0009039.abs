Title: Numerical evidence for monopoles in 3-dimensional Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Pushan Majumdar and Dong-Shin Shin
Abstract: Recently Anishetty, Majumdar and Sharatchandra have proposed a way of characterizing topologically non-trivial configurations for 2+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory in a local and manifestly gauge invariant manner. In this paper paper we develop criteria to locate such objects in lattice gauge theory and find them in numerical simulations.
