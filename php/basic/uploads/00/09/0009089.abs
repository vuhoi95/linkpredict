Title: Dilaton Stabilization in Effective Type I String Models
Authors: S. A. Abel and G. Servant
Abstract: We show that the dilaton and T-moduli can be stabilized by a single gaugino condensation mechanism in the four-dimensional effective field theory derived from Type IIB orientifolds. A crucial role is played by the mixing of the blowing-up modes Mk with the T-moduli in the Kahler metric, and by the presence of the Mk in the gauge kinetic functions. Supersymmetry breaking in these models is dominated by the auxiliary fields of the T moduli, and phenomenologically interesting patterns can emerge.
