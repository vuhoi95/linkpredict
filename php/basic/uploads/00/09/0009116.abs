Title: An alternative formulation of classical electromagnetic duality
Authors: Kang Li and Carlos M. Na√≥n
Abstract: By introducing a doublet of electromagnetic four dimensional vector potentials, we set up a manifestly Lorentz covariant and SO(2) duality invariant classical field theory of electric and magnetic charges. In our formulation one does not need to introduce the concept of Dirac string.
