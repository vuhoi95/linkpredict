Title: Poisson-Lie T-Duality in Supersymmetric WZNW Model
Authors: F. Assaoui and N. Benhamou and T. Lhallabi
Abstract: The description of the two sets of (4,0) supersymmetric models that are related by non-abelian duality transformations is given. The (4,0) supersymmetric WZNW is constructed and the formulation of the (4,0) supersymmetric sigma model dual to (4,0) supersymmetric WZNW model in the sense of Poisson-Lie T-duality is described.
