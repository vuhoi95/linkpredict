Title: Strong Coupling Effects in non-commutative spaces from OM Theory and  supergravity
Authors: J. G. Russo and M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: We show that a four-parameter class of 3+1 dimensional NCOS theories can be obtained by dimensional reduction on a general 2-torus from OM theory. Compactifying two spatial directions of NCOS theory on a 2-torus, we study the transformation properties under the $SO(2,2;Z)$ T-duality group. We then discuss non-perturbative configurations of non-commutative super Yang-Mills theory. In particular, we calculate the tension for magnetic monopoles and (p,q) dyons and exhibit their six-dimensional origin, and construct a supergravity solution representing an instanton in the gauge theory. We also compute the potential for a monopole-antimonopole in the supergravity approximation.
