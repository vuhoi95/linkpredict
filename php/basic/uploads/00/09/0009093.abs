Title: Behavior of the thermal gluon self-energy in the Coulomb gauge
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We study, to one loop order, the behavior of the gluon self-energy in the non covariant Coulomb gauge at finite temperature. The cancellation of the peculiar energy divergences, which arise in such a gauge, is explicitly verified in the complete two point function of the Yang-Mills theory. At high temperatures, the leading T^2 term is determined to be transverse and nonlocal, in agreement with the results obtained in covariant gauges. The coefficient of the sub-leading ln(T) contribution, is non transverse but local and coincides (up to a multiplicative constant) with that of the ultraviolet pole term of the zero temperature amplitude.
