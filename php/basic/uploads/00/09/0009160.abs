Title: Quantum Fluctuations of Bulk Inflaton in Inflationary Brane World
Authors: Shinpei Kobayashi and Kazuya Koyama and Jiro Soda
Abstract: The inflationary scenario for the brane world driven by the bulk inflaton is proposed. The quantum fluctuations of the inflaton is calculated and compared to those of the conventional 4-dimensional inflationary scenario. It is shown that the deviation of the primordial spectrum of this model from that of the conventional one is too small to be observed even if $AdS$ radius is very large. Hence, it turns out that the inflation caused by the bulk inflaton is viable in the context of brane world cosmology.
