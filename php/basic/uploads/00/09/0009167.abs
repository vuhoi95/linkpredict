Title: Five-Dimensional Gauged Supergravities with Universal Hypermultiplet and  Warped Brane Worlds
Authors: Adam Falkowski and Zygmunt Lalak and Stefan Pokorski
Abstract: We present five dimensional gauged supergravity with universal hypermultiplet on M_4 \times S^1 / Z_2 coupled supersymmetrically to three-branes located at the fixed points. The construction is extended to the smooth picture with auxiliary singlet and four-form fields. The model admits the Randall-Sundrum solution as a BPS vacuum with vanishing energy. We give the form of all KK-tower modes for fields present in the model.
