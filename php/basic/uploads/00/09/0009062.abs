Title: Calibrations and Fayyazuddin-Smith Spacetimes
Authors: Hyunji Cho and Moataz Emam and David Kastor and Jennie Traschen
Abstract: We show that a class of spacetimes introduced by Fayyazuddin and Smith to describe intersecting M5-branes admit a generalized Kahler calibration. Equipped with this understanding, we are able to construct spacetimes corresponding to further classes of calibrated $p$-brane world-volume solitons. We note that these classes of spacetimes also describe the fields of $p$-branes wrapping certain supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
