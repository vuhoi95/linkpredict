Title: Self-Duality of a Topologically Massive Born-Infeld Theory
Authors: Prasanta K. Tripathy and Avinash Khare
Abstract: We consider self-duality in a 2+1 dimensional gauge theory containing both the Born-Infeld and the Chern-Simons terms. We introduce a Born-Infeld inspired generalization of the Proca term and show that the corresponding self dual equation is identical to that of the Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons theory.
