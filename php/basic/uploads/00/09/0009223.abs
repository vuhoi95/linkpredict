Title: Gauge models in modified triplectic quantization
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Petr M. Lavrov and Pavel Yu. Moshin
Abstract: We apply the modified triplectic formalism for quantizing several popular gauge models - non-abelian antisymmetric tensor field model, W2-gravity and two-dimensional gravity with dynamical torsion. The explicit solutions are obtained for the generating equations of the quantum action and the gauge-fixing functional. Using these solutions we construct the vacuum functional and obtain the corresponding transformations of the extended BRST symmetry.
