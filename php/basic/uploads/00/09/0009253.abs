Title: A Model of the Electroweak Interactions with Invisible Higgs Particle
Authors: I. Vitev and V. Rizov
Abstract: We propose a minimal unified model of the electroweak interactions without a Higgs particle in the final physical spectrum. This is achieved through adding a nonlinear constraint for the Higgs field in the Lagrangian in which the field's content is the same as in the Weinberg-Salam (WS) model. In the unitary gauge the generation of masses of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons, as well as for the leptons and quarks, reproduces the known pattern in the WS model. The path integral quantization shows that with the exception of the scalar particles' all other vertices, known from the WS model in the unitary gauge, remain. A Ward identity relative to the electromagnetic gauge group is also derived.
