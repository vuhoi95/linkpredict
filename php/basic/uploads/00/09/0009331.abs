Title: Color conductivity and ladder summation in hot QCD
Authors: J. M. Martinez Resco and M. A. Valle Basagoiti
Abstract: The color conductivity is computed at leading logarithmic order using a Kubo formula. We show how to sum an infinite series of planar ladder diagrams, assuming some approximations based on the dominance of soft scattering processes between hard particles in the plasma. The result agrees with the one obtained previously from a kinetical approach.
