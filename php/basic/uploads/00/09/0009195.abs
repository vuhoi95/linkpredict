Title: Gravitationally bound monopoles
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Burkhard Kleihaus and Jutta Kunz
Abstract: We construct monopole solutions in SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, carrying magnetic charge n. For vanishing and small Higgs selfcoupling, these multimonopole solutions are gravitationally bound. Their mass per unit charge is lower than the mass of the n=1 monopole. For large Higgs selfcoupling only a repulsive phase exists.
