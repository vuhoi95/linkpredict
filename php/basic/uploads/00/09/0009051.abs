Title: CFT Description of Small Objects in AdS
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Veronika E. Hubeny
Abstract: By the AdS/CFT correspondence, the expectation value of certain local operators in the CFT is given by the asymptotic value of supergravity fields. We show that these local expectation values contain a remarkable amount of information about small sources deep inside AdS_p x S^q. In particular, they contain essentially all the multipole moments. More importantly, one can use them to determine the size of a spherical source. This is not a small effect: The size appears in an exponentially large contribution to the expectation values. This provides an easy way for the CFT to distinguish stars from black holes with the same mass, or to distinguish different "giant graviton" configurations.
