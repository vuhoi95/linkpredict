Title: Polar Homology
Authors: Boris Khesin and Alexei Rosly
Abstract: For complex projective manifolds we introduce polar homology groups, which are holomorphic analogues of the homology groups in topology. The polar k-chains are subvarieties of complex dimension k with meromorphic forms on them, while the boundary operator is defined by taking the polar divisor and the Poincare residue on it.
