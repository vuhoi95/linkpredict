Title: Equivalent Relations between Quantum Dynamics as Derived from a Gauge  Transformation
Authors: Chuan-Tsung Chan and Chun-Khiang Chua
Abstract: Equivalent relations between quantum mechanical systems in the Robertson-Walker (RW) background metric and quantum dynamics with an induced quadratic background potential are derived in this work. Two elementary applications, which include an algebraic derivation of the evolution operator for a simple harmonic oscillator without using any special function or the path integral technique, and a moving soliton solution of a free particle in an oscillating universe, are presented to illustrate the use of these equivalent relations.
