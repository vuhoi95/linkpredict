Title: Anomaly and Nonplanar Diagrams in Noncommutative Gauge Theories
Authors: Farhad Ardalan and Neda Sadooghi
Abstract: Anomalies arising from nonplanar triangle diagrams of noncommutative gauge theory are studied. Local chiral gauge anomalies for both noncommutative U(1) and U(N) gauge theories with adjoint matter fields are shown to vanish. For noncommutative QED with fundamental matters, due to UV/IR mixing a finite anomaly emerges from the nonplanar contributions. It involves a generalized $\star$-product of gauge fields.
