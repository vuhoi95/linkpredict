Abstract: We derive and analyze the Bethe-Salpeter equations for spin zero diquarks in the color superconducting phase of cold dense QCD with two massless flavors. The spectrum of diquarks contains an infinite number of massive excitations and five (nearly) massless pseudoscalars. The former are singlets while the latter include a doublet, an antidoublet and a singlet with respect to the unbroken $SU(2)_{c}$. Because of an approximate parity doubling at large chemical potential, all massive states come in pairs. The decay constants, as well as the velocities of the (nearly) massless pseudoscalars are derived. The different role of the Meissner effect for tightly bound states and quasiclassical bound states is revealed.
