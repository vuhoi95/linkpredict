Authors: S. Alexeyev and A. Toporensky and V. Ustiansky
Abstract: We investigate Bianchi I cosmological model in the theory of a dilatonM field coupled to gravity through a Gauss-Bonnet term. Two type ofM cosmological singularity are distinguished. The former is analogous toM the Einstein gravity singularity, the latter (which does not appear inM classical General Relativity) occurs when the main determinant of theM system of field equations vanishes. An analogy between the latterM cosmological singularity and the singularity inside a black hole withM a dilatonic hair is discussed. Initial conditions, leading to theseM two types of cosmological singularity are found via numericalM integration of the equation of motion.
