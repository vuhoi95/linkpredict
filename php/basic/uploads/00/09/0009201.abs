Title: N=4 Supergravity with Antisymmetric Tensor in Central Charge Superspace
Authors: Richard Grimm and Carl Herrmann and Annamaria Kiss
Abstract: A concise geometrical formulation of N=4 supergravity containing an antisymmetric tensor gauge field is given in central charge superspace: graviphotons are identified in the super-vielbein on the same footing as the vierbein and the Rarita-Schwinger fields. As a consequence of superspace soldering, Chern-Simons terms in the fieldstrength of the antisymmetric tensor arise as an intrinsic property of superspace with central charge coordinates.
