Title: Quantum anharmonic oscillator and quasi-exactly solvable Bose systems
Authors: S. N. Dolya and O. B. Zaslavskii
Abstract: We extend the notion of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) models from potential ones and differential equations to Bose systems. We obtain conditions under which algebraization of the part of the spectrum occurs. In some particular cases simple exact expressions for several energy levels of an anharmonic Bose oscillator are obtained explicitly. The corresponding results do not exploit perturbation theory and include strong coupling regime. A generic Hamiltonian under discussion cannot, in contrast to QES potential models, be expressed as a polynomial in generators of $sl_{2}$ algebra. The suggested approach is extendable to many-particle Bose systems with interaction.
