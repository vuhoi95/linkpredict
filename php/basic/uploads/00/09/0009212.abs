Title: Localization of supergravity on the brane
Authors: M. J. Duff and James T. Liu and W. A. Sabra
Abstract: A supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane-world demands that not merely the graviton but the entire supergravity multiplet be trapped on the brane. To demonstrate this, we present a complete ansatz for the reduction of (D=5,N=4) gauged supergravity to (D=4,N=2) ungauged supergravity in the Randall-Sundrum geometry. We verify that it is consistent to lowest order in fermion terms. In particular, we show how the graviphotons avoid the `no photons on the brane' result because they do not originate from Maxwell's equations in D=5 but rather from odd-dimensional self-duality equations. In the case of the fivebrane, the Randall-Sundrum mechanism also provides a new Kaluza-Klein way of obtaining chiral supergravity starting from non-chiral.
