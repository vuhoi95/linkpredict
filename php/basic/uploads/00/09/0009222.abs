Title: Schwinger terms in two-dimensional gravitation and Kallen's method
Authors: R. A. Bertlmann and E. Kohlprath
Abstract: We evaluate the gravitational Schwinger terms for the specific two-dimensional model of Weyl fermions in a gravitational background field using a technique introduced by Kallen and find a relation which connects the Schwinger terms with the linearized gravitational anomalies.
