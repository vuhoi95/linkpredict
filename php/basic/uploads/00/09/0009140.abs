Abstract: The Hagedorn transition in non-commutative open string theory (NCOS) is relatively simple because gravity decouples. For NCOS theories in no more than five spacetime dimensions, the Hagedorn transition is second order, and the high temperature phase involves long, nearly straight fundamental strings separating from the D-brane on which the NCOS theory is defined. Above five spacetime dimensions interaction effects become important below the Hagedorn temperature. Although this complicates studies of the transition, we believe that the high temperature phase again involves long strings liberated from the bound state.
