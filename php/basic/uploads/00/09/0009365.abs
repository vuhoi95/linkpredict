Title: Critical dimensions of the diffusion equation
Authors: T. J. Newman and Will Loinaz
Abstract: We study the evolution of a random initial field under pure diffusion in various space dimensions. From numerical calculations we find that the persistence properties of the system show sharp transitions at critical dimensions d1 ~ 26 and d2 ~ 46. We also give refined measurements of the persistence exponents for low dimensions.
