Title: Gravitational waves and spinning test particles
Authors: M. Mohseni and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: The motion of a classical spinning test particle in the field of a weak plane gravitational wave is studied. It is found that the characteristic dimensions of the particle's orbit is sensitive to the ratio of the spin to the mass of the particle. The results are compared with the corresponding motion of a particle without spin.
