Title: On the c-theorem in more than two dimensions
Authors: A. Cappelli and G. D'Appollonio and R. Guida and N. Magnoli
Abstract: Several pieces of evidence have been recently brought up in favour of the c-theorem in four and higher dimensions, but a solid proof is still lacking. We present two basic results which could be useful for this search: i) the values of the putative c-number for free field theories in any even dimension, which illustrate some properties of this number; ii) the general form of three-point function of the stress tensor in four dimensions, which shows some physical consequences of the c-number and of the other trace-anomaly numbers.
