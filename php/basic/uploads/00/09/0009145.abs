Title: Second Law of Black Hole Mechanics for all 2d Dilaton Theories
Authors: Norbert Duechting and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: It is shown that all generalized two--dimensional dilaton theories with arbitrary matter content (with a curvature independent coupling to gravity) do not only obey a first law of black hole mechanics (which follows from Wald's general considerations, if the entropy S is defined appropriately), but also a second law: \delta S \ge 0 provided only that the null energy condition holds and that, loosely speaking, for late times a stationary state is assumed. Also any two-dimensional f(R)--theory is covered. This generalizes a previous proof of Frolov [1] to a much wider class of theories.
