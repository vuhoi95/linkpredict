Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Anomaly with General Homotopic Paths
Authors: S. J. Gates, Jr. and M. T. Grisaru and M. E. Knutt and S. Penati and H. Suzuki
Abstract: We use the method of Banerjee, Banerjee and Mitra and minimal homotopy paths to compute the consistent gauge anomaly for several superspace models of SSYM coupled to matter. We review the derivation of the anomaly for N=1 in four dimensions and then discuss the anomaly for two-dimensional models with (2,0) supersymmetry.
