Title: Dynamical Localization of Gravity
Authors: Aharon Davidson and Philip D. Mannheim
Abstract: We show that the thin wall limit of the thick domain wall associated with a sine-Gordon soliton in a single non-compactified patch of 5-dimensional spacetime explicitly yields the Randall-Sundrum localized gravity two patch brane, with its discrete $Z_2$ symmetry arising from the discrete symmetry of the potential, and with the thin Minkowski brane $\Lambda_5+\kappa^2_5\Lambda^2_b/6=0$ relation between bulk and brane cosmological constants arising naturally without any need for fine tuning. Additionally we show that for an embedded thin de Sitter brane, localization of gravity is again possible provided the 5-space is compactified, with the now non-zero net cosmological constant $\Lambda_5+\kappa^2_5\Lambda^2_b/6$ on the brane being found to vary inversely with the compactification radius.
