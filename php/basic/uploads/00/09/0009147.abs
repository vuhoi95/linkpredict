Title: M-brane interpolations and (2,0) Renormalization Group flow
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and R-G. Cai and N. Ohta and P. K. Townsend
Abstract: We obtain the M5-M2-MW bound state solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity corresponding to the 1/2 supersymmetric vacua of the M5-brane equations with constant background fields. In the `near-horizon' case the solution interpolates between the $adS_7\times S^4$ Kaluza-Klein vacuum and D=11 Minkowski spacetime via a Domain Wall spacetime. We discuss implications for renormalization group flow of (2,0) D=6 field theories.
