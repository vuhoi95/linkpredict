Title: Poincar√© covariance of relativistic quantum position
Authors: Sz. Farkas and Z. Kurucz and M. Weiner
Abstract: A great number of problems of relativistic position in quantum mechanics are due to the use of coordinates which are not inherent objects of spacetime, cause unnecessary complications and can lead to misconceptions. We apply a coordinate-free approach to rule out such problems. Thus it will be clear, for example, that the Lorentz covariance of position, required usually on the analogy of Lorentz covariance of spacetime coordinates, is not well posed and we show that in a right setting the Newton--Wigner position is Poincar\'e covariant, in contradiction with the usual assertions.
