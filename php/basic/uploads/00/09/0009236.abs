Title: Absence of higher order corrections to the non-Abelian Chern-Simons  coefficient
Authors: F. T. Brandt and Ashok Das and J. Frenkel
Abstract: We extend the Coleman-Hill analysis to non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories containing a tree level topological mass term. We show, in the case of a pure Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, that there are no corrections to the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term beyond one loop in the axial gauge. Our arguments use constraints coming only from small gauge Ward identities as well as the analyticity of the amplitudes, much like the proof in the Abelian case. Some implications of this result are also discussed.
