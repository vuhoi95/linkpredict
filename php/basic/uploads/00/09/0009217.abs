Title: Harmonic Superspaces and Superconformal Fields
Authors: P. Heslop and P. S. Howe
Abstract: Representations of four-dimensional superconformal groups on harmonic superfields are discussed. It is argued that any representation can be given as a superfield on many superflag manifolds. Representations on analytic superspaces do not require constraints. We discuss short representations and how to obtain them as explicit products of fundamental fields. We also discuss superfields that transform under supergroups.
