Title: A Poisson Bracket on Multisymplectic Phase Space
Authors: Michael Forger and Hartmann RÃ¶mer
Abstract: A new Poisson bracket for Hamiltonian forms on the full multisymplectic phase space is defined. At least for forms of degree n-1, where n is the dimension of space-time, Jacobi's identity is fulfilled.
