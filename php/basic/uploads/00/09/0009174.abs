Title: On the Structure of Noncommutative N=2 Super Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Diego Bellisai and Jose' M. Isidro and Marco Matone
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed formulation of noncommutative N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory implies that the commutative and noncommutative effective coupling constants \tau(u) and \tau_{nc}(u) coincide. We then introduce a key relation which allows to find a nontrivial solution of such equation, thus fixing the form of the low-energy effective action. The dependence on the noncommutative parameter arises from a rational function deforming the Seiberg-Witten differential.
