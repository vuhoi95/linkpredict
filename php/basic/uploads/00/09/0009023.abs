Title: SUSY Breaking by Overlap of Wave Functions in Coexisting Walls
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Norisuke Sakai and Yutaka Sakamura and Ryo Sugisaka
Abstract: SUSY breaking without messenger fields is proposed. We assume that our world is on a wall and SUSY is broken only by the coexistence of another wall with some distance from our wall. The Nambu-Goldstone fermion is localized on the distant wall. Its overlap with the wave functions of physical fields on our wall gives the mass splitting of physical fields on our wall thanks to a low-energy theorem. We propose that this overlap provides a practical method to evaluate mass splitting in models with SUSY breaking due to the coexisting walls.
