Title: Phase transition in Wilson loop correlator from AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: P. Olesen and K. Zarembo
Abstract: A previous calculation of the phase transition in the Wilson loop correlator in the zero temperature AdS/CFT correspondence is extended to the case where the loops are concentric circles of unequal radii. This phase transition occurs due to the instability of the classical string stretched between the loops. We compute the string action and its expansion in the distance h between the loops for small h. We also find that the connected minimal surface is subleading or does not even exist when h=0 and the radii are considerably different. This feature has no analogue in flat space.
