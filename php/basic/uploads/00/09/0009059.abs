Authors: S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov and K. E. Osetrin
Abstract: d5 dilatonic gravity action with surface counterterms motivated by AdS/CFT correspondence and with contributions of brane quantum CFTs is considered around AdS-like bulk. The effective equations of motion are constructed. They admit two (outer and inner) or multi-brane solutions where brane CFTs may be different. The role of quantum brane CFT is in inducing of complicated brane dilatonic gravity. For exponential bulk potentials the number of AdS-like bulk spaces is found in analytical form.The correspondent flat or curved (de Sitter or hyperbolic) dilatonic two branes are created, as a rule, thanks to quantum effects. The observable early Universe may correspond to inflationary brane. The found dilatonic quantum two brane-worlds usually contain the naked singularity but in couple explicit examples the curvature is finite and horizon (corresponding to wormhole-like space) appears.
