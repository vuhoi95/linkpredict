Title: On Link Invariants and Topological String Amplitudes
Authors: P. Ramadevi and Tapobrata Sarkar
Abstract: We explicitly show that the new polynomial invariants for knots, upto nine crossings, agree with the Ooguri-Vafa conjecture relating Chern-Simons gauge theory to topological string theory on the resolution of the conifold.
