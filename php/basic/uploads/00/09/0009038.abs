Title: Singular lagrangians: some geometric structures along the Legendre map
Authors: Xavier Gracia and Josep M. Pons
Abstract: New geometric structures that relate the lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms defined upon a singular lagrangian are presented. Several vector fields are constructed in velocity space that give new and precise answers to several topics like the projectability of a vector field to a hamiltonian vector field, the computation of the kernel of the presymplectic form of lagrangian formalism, the construction of the lagrangian dynamical vector fields, and the characterisation of dynamical symmetries.
