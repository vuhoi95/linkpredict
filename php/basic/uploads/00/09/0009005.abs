Title: QED_{2+1}: Compton effect on Dirac-Landau electrons
Authors: J. Mateos Guilarte and M. de la Torre Mayado
Abstract: Planar Quantum Electrodynamics is developed when charged fermions are under the influence of a constant and homogeneous external magnetic field. We compute the cross-length for the scattering of optical/ultraviolet photons by Dirac-Landau electrons.
