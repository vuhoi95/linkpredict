Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equations for diquarks with the quantum numbers of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are analyzed in the color-flavor locked phase of cold dense QCD with three quark flavors. The decay constants and the velocities of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are calculated in the Pagels-Stokar approximation. It is also shown that, in contrast to the case of dense QCD with two flavors, there are no massive radial excitations with quantum numbers of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the color-flavor locked phase. The role of the Meissner effect in the pairing dynamics of diquarks is explained.
