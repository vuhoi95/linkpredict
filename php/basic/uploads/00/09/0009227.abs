Title: On the Canonical c-Function in 4-d Field Theories Possessing  Supergravity Duals
Authors: M. Porrati and A. Starinets
Abstract: We study monotonicity and other properties of the canonical c-function (defined through the correlator of the energy-momentum tensor) in some holographic duals of 4-d quantum field theories. The canonical c-function and its derivatives are related to the 5-d Green's function of the dual supergravity theory. While positivity of the canonical c-function is obvious, we have not found a general proof of its monotonicity, even though c is monotonic in the few explicit examples we examine in this paper.
