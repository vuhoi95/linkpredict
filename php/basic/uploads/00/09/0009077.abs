Title: The Bardeen Model as a Nonlinear Magnetic Monopole
Authors: Eloy Ayón-Beato and Alberto García
Abstract: The Bardeen model -- the first regular black hole model in General Relativity -- is reinterpreted as the gravitational field of a nonlinear magnetic monopole, i.e., as a magnetic solution to Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics.
