Title: Light-cone Superstring in AdS Space-time
Authors: R. R. Metsaev and C. B. Thorn and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We consider fixing the bosonic light-cone gauge for string in AdS in the phase space framework, i.e. by choosing $x^+ = \tau$, and by choosing $\sigma$ so that $P^+$ is distributed uniformly (its density is independent of $\sigma$). We discuss classical bosonic string in AdS space and superstring in AdS_5 x S^5. In the latter case the starting point is the action found in hep-th/0007036 where the kappa-symmetry is fixed by a fermionic light cone gauge. We derive the light cone Hamiltonian in the AdS_5 x S^5 case and in the case of superstring in AdS_3 x S^3. We also obtain a realization of the generators of the basic symmetry superalgebra psu(2,2|4) in terms of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring coordinate fields.
