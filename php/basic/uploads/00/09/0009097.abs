Title: Dilaton Gravity with a Non-minmally Coupled Scalar Field
Authors: M. Alves and V. B. Bezerra
Abstract: We discuss the two-dimensional dilaton gravity with a scalar field as the source matter. The coupling between the gravity and the scalar, massless, field is presented in an unusual form. We work out two examples of these couplings and solutions with black-hole behaviour are discussed and compared with those found in the literature.
