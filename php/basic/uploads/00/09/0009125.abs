Title: The effect of a topological gauge field on Bose-Einstein condensation
Authors: P. F. Borges and H. Boschi-Filho and C. Farina
Abstract: We show that Bose-Einstein condensation of charged scalar fields interacting with a topological gauge field at finite temperature is inhibited except for special values of the topological field. We also show that fermions interacting with this topological gauge field can condense for some values of the gauge field.
