Title: Rationality of conformally invariant local correlation functions on  compactified Minkowski space
Authors: Nikolay M. Nikolov and Ivan T. Todorov
Abstract: Rationality of the Wightman functions is proven to follow from energy positivity, locality and a natural condition of global conformal invariance (GCI) in any number D of space-time dimensions. The GCI condition allows to treat correlation functions as generalized sections of a vector bundle over the compactification of Minkowski space and yields a strong form of locality valid for all non-isotropic intervals if assumed true for space-like separations.
