Title: Localized Gravity and Higher Curvature Terms
Authors: Olindo Corradini and Zurab Kakushadze
Abstract: We consider localization of gravity in smooth domain wall solutions of gravity coupled to a scalar field with a generic potential in the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss conditions on the scalar potential such that domain wall solutions are non-singular. We point out that the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term does not allow flat solutions with localized gravity that violate the weak energy condition. We also point out that in the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term infinite tension flat domain walls violate positivity. In fact, for flat solutions unitarity requires that on the solution the scalar potential be bounded below.
