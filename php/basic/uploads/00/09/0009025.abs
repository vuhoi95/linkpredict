Title: BPS states of curves in Calabi--Yau 3--folds
Authors: Jim Bryan and Rahul Pandharipande
Abstract: The Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture is defined and studied for the local geometry of a curve in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The integrality predicted in Gromov-Witten theory by the Gopakumar-Vafa BPS count is verified in a natural series of cases in this local geometry. The method involves Gromov-Witten computations, Mobius inversion, and a combinatorial analysis of the numbers of etale covers of a curve.
