Title: Bosonization of the pairing Hamiltonian
Authors: M. B. Barbaro and A. Molinari and F. Palumbo and M. R. Quaglia
Abstract: The problem of the pairing interaction is dealt with even Grassmann variables in the hamiltonian framework. Eigenfunctions of given energy, seniority and zero third component of angular momentum are given in terms of single particle and collective bosonic fields.
