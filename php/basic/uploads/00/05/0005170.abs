Title: Exact solution of the supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model with boundary
Authors: Changrim Ahn and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: The boundary supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model is an integrable quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions with bulk N=1 supersymmetry, whose bulk and boundary S matrices are not diagonal. We present an exact solution of this model. In particular, we derive an exact inversion identity and the corresponding thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations. We also compute the boundary entropy, and find a rich pattern of boundary roaming trajectories corresponding to c < 3/2 superconformal models.
