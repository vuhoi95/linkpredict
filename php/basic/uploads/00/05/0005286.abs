Abstract: It has been known for some time that topological geons in quantum gravity may lead to a complete violation of the canonical spin-statistics relation : there may exist no connection between spin and statistics for a pair of geons. We present an algebraic description of quantum gravity in (2 + 1)d based on the first order formalism of general relativity and show that, although the usual spin-statistics theorem is not valid, statistics is completely determined by spin. Hence, a new spin-statistics theorem can be formulated.
