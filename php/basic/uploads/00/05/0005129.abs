Title: Space-Time Noncommutative Field Theories And Unitarity
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Thomas Mehen
Abstract: We study the perturbative unitarity of noncommutative scalar field theories. Field theories with space-time noncommutativity do not have a unitary S-matrix. Field theories with only space noncommutativity are perturbatively unitary. This can be understood from string theory, since space noncommutative field theories describe a low energy limit of string theory in a background magnetic field. On the other hand, there is no regime in which space-time noncommutative field theory is an appropriate description of string theory. Whenever space-time noncommutative field theory becomes relevant massive open string states cannot be neglected.
