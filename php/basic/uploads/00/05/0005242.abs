Title: Supergravity Description of Non-BPS Branes
Authors: Philippe Brax and Gautam Mandal and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We construct supergravity solutions that correspond to N Dp-branes coinciding with \bar{N} \bar{Dp}-branes. We study the physical properties of the solutions and analyse the supergravity description of tachyon condensation. We construct an interpolation between the brane-antibrane solution and the Schwarzschild solution and discuss its possible application to the study of non-supersymmetric black holes.
