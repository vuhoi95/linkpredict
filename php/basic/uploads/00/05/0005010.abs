Title: Dual Projection and Selfduality in Three Dimensions
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Clovis Wotzasek
Abstract: We discuss the notion of duality and selfduality in the context of the dual projection operation that creates an internal space of potentials. Contrary to the prevailing algebraic or group theoretical methods, this technique is applicable to both even and odd dimensions. The role of parity in the kernel of the Gauss law to determine the dimensional dependence is clarified. We derive the appropriate invariant actions, discuss the symmetry groups and their proper generators. In particular, the novel concept of duality symmetry and selfduality in Maxwell theory in (2+1) dimensions is analysed in details. The corresponding action is a 3D version of the familiar duality symmetric electromagnetic theory in 4D. Finally, the duality symmetric actions in the different dimensions constructed here manifest both the SO(2) and $Z_2$ symmetries, contrary to conventional results.
