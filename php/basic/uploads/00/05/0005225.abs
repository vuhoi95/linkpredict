Title: Supergravity couplings: a geometric formulation
Authors: P. Binetruy and G. Girardi and R. Grimm
Abstract: This report provides a pedagogical introduction to the description of the general Poincare supergravity/matter/Yang-Mills couplings using methods of Kahler superspace geometry. At a more advanced level this approach is generalized to include tensor field and Chern-Simons couplings in supersymmetry and supergravity, relevant in the context of weakly and strongly coupled string theories.
