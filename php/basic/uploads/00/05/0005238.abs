Title: Monopole in the dilatonic gauge field theory
Authors: D. Karczewska and R. Manka
Abstract: A numerical study of coupled to the dilaton field, static, spherically symmetric monopole solutions inspired by the Kaluza-Klein theory with large extra dimensions are presented. The generalized Prasad-Sommerfield solution is obtained. We show that monopole may have also the dilaton cloud configurations.
