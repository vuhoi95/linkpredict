Title: Light-cone formulation and spin spectra of massive strings
Authors: Marcin Daszkiewicz and Zbigniew Jaskolski
Abstract: It is shown that all bosonic and fermionic massive string models admit consistent light-cone formulations. This result is used to derive the spin generating functions of these models in four dimensions.
