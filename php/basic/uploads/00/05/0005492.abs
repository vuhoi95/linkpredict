Title: An introduction to bosonization and aome of its applications
Authors: Sumathi Rao and Diptiman Sen
Abstract: We discuss the technique of bosonization for studying systems of interacting fermions in one dimension. After briefly reviewing the low-energy properties of Fermi and Luttinger liquids, we present some of the relations between bosonic and fermionic operators in one dimension. We use these relations to calculate the correlation functions and the renormalization group properties of various operators for a system of spinless fermions. We then apply the methods of bosonization to study the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain, the Hubbard model in one dimension, and transport in clean quantum wires and in the presence of isolated impurities.
