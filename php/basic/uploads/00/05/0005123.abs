Title: Non-differentiable Degrees of Freedom : Fluctuating Metric Signature
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev and D. Singleton
Abstract: In this article we investigate the metric signature as a non-differentiable ({\it i.e.} discrete as opposed to continuous) degree of freedom. The specific model is a vacuum 7D Universe on the principal bundle with an SU(2) structural group. An analytical solution is found which to a 4D observer appears as a flat Universe with a fluctuating metric signature, and frozen extra dimensions with an SU(2) instanton gauge field. A piece of this solution with linear size of the Planck length ($\approx l_{Pl}$) can be considered as seeding the quantum birth of a regular Universe. A boundary of this piece can initiate the formation of a Lorentzian Universe filled with the gauge fields and in which the extra dimensions have been ``frozen''.
