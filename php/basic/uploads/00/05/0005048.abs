Title: S-Duality and Noncommutative Gauge Theory
Authors: Rajesh Gopakumar and Juan Maldacena and Shiraz Minwalla and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: It is conjectured that strongly coupled, spatially noncommutative $\CN=4$ Yang-Mills theory has a dual description as a weakly coupled open string theory in a near critical electric field, and that this dual theory is fully decoupled from closed strings. Evidence for this conjecture is given by the absence of physical closed string poles in the non-planar one-loop open string diagram. The open string theory can be viewed as living in a geometry in which space and time coordinates do not commute.
