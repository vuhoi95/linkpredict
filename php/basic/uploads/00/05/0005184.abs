Title: Hurwitz theorem and parallelizable spheres from tensor analysis
Authors: J. A. Nieto and L. N. Alejo-Armenta
Abstract: By using tensor analysis, we find a connection between normed algebras and the parallelizability of the spheres S$^1$, S$^3$ and S$^7.$ In this process, we discovered the analogue of Hurwitz theorem for curved spaces and a geometrical unified formalism for the metric and the torsion. In order to achieve these goals we first develope a proof of Hurwitz theorem based in tensor analysis. It turns out that in contrast to the doubling procedure and Clifford algebra mechanism, our proof is entirely based in tensor algebra applied to the normed algebra condition. From the tersor analysis point of view our proof is straightforward and short. We also discuss a possible connection between our formalism and the Cayley-Dickson algebras and Hopf maps.
