Title: One-Loop Quantum Energy Densities of Domain Wall Field Configurations
Authors: Andrei Parnachev and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: We discuss a simple procedure for computing one-loop quantum energies of any static field configuration that depends non-trivially on only a single spatial coordinate. We specifically focus on domain wall-type field configurations that connect two distinct minima of the effective potential, and may or may not be the solutions of classical field equations. We avoid the conventional summation of zero-point energies, and instead exploit the relation between functional determinants and solutions of associated differential equations. This approach allows ultraviolet divergences to be easily isolated and extracted using any convenient regularization scheme. Two examples are considered: two-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, and three-dimensional scalar electrodynamics with spontaneous symmetry breaking at the one-loop level.
