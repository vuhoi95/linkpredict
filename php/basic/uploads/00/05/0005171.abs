Abstract: In this work we compare the quantization of a massless scalar field in an inertial frame with the quantization in a rotating frame. We used the Trocheries-Takeno mapping to relate measurements in the inertial and the rotating frames. An exact solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in the rotating coordinate system is found and the Bogolubov transformation between the inertial and rotating modes is calculated, showing that the rotating observer defines a vacuum state different from the Minkowski one. We also obtain the response function of an Unruh-De Witt detector coupled with the scalar field travelling in a uniformly rotating world-line. The response function is obtained for two different situations: when the quantum field is prepared in the usual Minkowski vacuum state and when it is prepared in the Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state. We also consider the case of an inertial detector interacting with the field in the rotating vacuum.
