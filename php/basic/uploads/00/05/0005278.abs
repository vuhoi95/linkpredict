Title: Liouville Integrability of Classical Calogero-Moser Models
Authors: S. P. Khastgir and R. Sasaki
Abstract: Liouville integrability of classical Calogero-Moser models is proved for models based on any root systems, including the non-crystallographic ones. It applies to all types of elliptic potentials, i.e. untwisted and twisted together with their degenerations (hyperbolic, trigonometric and rational), except for the rational potential models confined by a harmonic force.
