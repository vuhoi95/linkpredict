Title: Massive random matrix ensembles at beta = 1 & 4 : QCD in three  dimensions
Authors: T. Nagao and S. M. Nishigaki
Abstract: The zero momentum sectors in effective theories of three dimensional QCD coupled to pseudoreal (two colors) and real (adjoint) quarks in a classically parity-invariant manner have alternative descriptions in terms of orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using this correspondence, we compute finite-volume QCD partition functions and correlation functions of Dirac operator eigenvalues in a presence of finite quark masses of the order of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue. These novel correlation functions, expressed in terms of quaternion determinants, are reduced to conventional results for the Gaussian ensembles in the quenched limit.
