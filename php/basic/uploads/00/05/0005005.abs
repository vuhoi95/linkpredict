Title: Noncommutative gauge theory for Poisson manifolds
Authors: Branislav Jurco and Peter Schupp and Julius Wess
Abstract: A noncommutative gauge theory is associated to every Abelian gauge theory on a Poisson manifold. The semi-classical and full quantum version of the map from the ordinary gauge theory to the noncommutative gauge theory (Seiberg-Witten map) is given explicitly to all orders for any Poisson manifold in the Abelian case. In the quantum case the construction is based on Kontsevich's formality theorem.
