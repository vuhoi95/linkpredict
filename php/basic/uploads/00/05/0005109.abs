Title: New vortex solution in SU(3) gauge-Higgs theory
Authors: F. A. Schaposnik and P. Suranyi
Abstract: Following a brief review of known vortex solutions in SU(N) gauge-adjoint Higgs theories we show the existence of a new ``minimal'' vortex solution in SU(3) gauge theory with two adjoint Higgs bosons. At a critical coupling the vortex decouples into two abelian vortices, satisfying Bogomol'nyi type, first order, field equations. The exact value of the vortex energy (per unit length) is found in terms of the topological charge that equals to the N=2 supersymmetric charge, at the critical coupling. The critical coupling signals the increase of the underlying supersymmetry.
