Title: p-Adic and Adelic Harmonic Oscillator with Time-Dependent Frequency
Authors: Goran S. Djordjevic and Branko Dragovich
Abstract: The classical and quantum formalism for a p-adic and adelic harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency is developed, and general formulae for main theoretical quantities are obtained. In particular, the p-adic propagator is calculated, and the existence of a simple vacuum state as well as adelic quantum dynamics is shown. Space discreteness and p-adic quantum-mechanical phase are noted.
