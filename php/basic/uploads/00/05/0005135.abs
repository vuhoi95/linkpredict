Title: On Harmonic Superspaces and Superconformal Fields in Four Dimensions
Authors: P. Heslop and P. S. Howe
Abstract: Representations of four-dimensional superconformal groups on harmonic superfields are discussed. It is shown how various short representations can be obtained by parabolic induction. It is also shown that such short multiplets may admit several descriptions as superfields on different superspaces. In particular, this is the case for on-shell massless superfields. This allows a description of short representations as explicit products of fundamental fields. Superconformal transformations of analytic fields in real harmonic superspaces are given explicitly.
