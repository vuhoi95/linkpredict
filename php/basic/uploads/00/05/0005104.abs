Title: Crossing probabilities on same-spin clusters in the two-dimensional  Ising model
Authors: Ervig Lapalme and Yvan Saint-Aubin
Abstract: Probabilities of crossing on same-spin clusters, seen as order parameters, have been introduced recently for the critical 2d Ising model by Langlands, Lewis and Saint-Aubin. We extend Cardy's ideas, introduced for percolation, to obtain an ordinary differential equation of order 6 for the horizontal crossing probability pih. Due to the identity pih(r)+pih(1/r)=1, the function pih must lie in a 3-dimensional subspace. New measurements of pih are made for 40 values of the aspect ratio r (r in [0.1443,6.928]). These data are more precise than those obtained by Langlands et al as the 95%-confidence interval is brought to 4x10^{-4}. A 3-parameter fit using these new data determines the solution of the differential equation. The largest gap between this solution and the 40 data is smaller than 4x10^{-4}. The probability pihv of simultaneous horizontal and vertical crossings is also treated.
