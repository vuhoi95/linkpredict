Title: Some remarks on the epsilon-expansion of dimensionally regulated Feynman  diagrams
Authors: A. I. Davydychev and M. Yu. Kalmykov
Abstract: Some problems related to construction of the epsilon-expansion of dimensionally regulated Feynman integrals are discussed. For certain classes of diagrams, an arbitrary term of the epsilon-expansion can be expressed in terms of log-sine integrals related to the polylogarithms. It is shown how the analytic continuation of these functions can be constructed in terms of the generalized Nielsen polylogarithms.
