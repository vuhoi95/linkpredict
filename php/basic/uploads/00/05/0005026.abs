Title: p-Adic Path Integrals for Quadratic Actions
Authors: G. S. Djordjevic and B. Dragovich
Abstract: The Feynman path integral in p-adic quantum mechanics is considered. The probability amplitude ${\cal K}_p (x^{\prime\prime},t^{\prime\prime}; x^\prime,t^\prime)$ for one-dimensional systems with quadratic actions is calculated in an exact form, which is the same as that in ordinary quantum mechanics.
