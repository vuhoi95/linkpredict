Title: Inertial Force, Equivalence Principle and Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minoru Omote and Susumu Kamefuchi
Abstract: On the basis of a manifestly covariant formalism of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in general coordinate systems, proposed by us recently, we derive general expressions for inertial forces. The results enable us further to discuss, and to explain the validity of, the equivalence principle in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
