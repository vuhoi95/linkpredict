Title: Generalized Field Theoretical Approach to General Relativity and  Conserved Quantities in Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes
Authors: N. Pinto-Neto and R. Rodrigues da Silva
Abstract: A new prescription to calculate the total energies and angular momenta of asymptotically $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes is proposed. The method is based on an extension of the field theoretical approach to General Relativity to the case where there is an effective cosmological constant. A $(d-1)$-form $\Omega$ is exhibited which, when integrated on asymptotic $(d-1)$-dimensional boundary surfaces, yields the values of those conserved quantities. The calculations are gauge independent once asymptotic conditions are not violated . Total energies and angular momenta of some known solutions in four and five dimensions are calculated agreeing with standard results.
