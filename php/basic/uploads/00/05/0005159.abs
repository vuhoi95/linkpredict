Title: Noncommutative D-Brane in Non-Constant NS-NS B Field Background
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Yu-Ting Yeh
Abstract: We show that when the field strength H of the NS-NS B field does not vanish, the coordinates X and momenta P of an open string endpoints satisfy a set of mixed commutation relations among themselves. Identifying X and P with the coordinates and derivatives of the D-brane world volume, we find a new type of noncommutative spaces which is very different from those associated with a constant B field background.
