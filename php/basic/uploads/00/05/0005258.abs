Title: Renormalization Group Study of Chern-Simons Field Coupled to Scalar  Matter in a Modified BPHZ Subtraction Scheme
Authors: L. C. de Albuquerque and M. Gomes and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We apply a soft version of the BPHZ subtraction scheme to the computation of two-loop corrections from an Abelian Chern-Simons field coupled to (massive) scalar matter with a $\lambda(\Phi^\dag\Phi)^2$ and $\nu(\Phi^\dag\Phi)^3$ self-interactions. The two-loop renormalization group functions are calculated. We compare our results with those in the literature.
