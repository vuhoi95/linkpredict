Title: Confinement, asymptotic freedom and renormalons in type 0 string duals
Authors: Roberto Grena and Simone Lelli and Michele Maggiore and Anna Rissone
Abstract: Type 0B string theory has been proposed as the dual description of non-supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory coupled to six scalars, in four dimensions. We study numerically and analytically the equations of motion of type 0B gravity and we find RG trajectories of the dual theory that flow from an asymptotically free UV regime to a confining IR regime. In the UV we find a one-parameter family of solutions that approach asymptotically $AdS_5\times S^5$ with a logarithmic flow of the coupling plus non-perturbative terms that correctly reproduce all UV and IR renormalon singularities. The first UV renormalon gives a contribution $\sim F_1(E)/E^2$ and we are able to predict also the form of the function $F_1(E)$, which, from the YM side, corresponds to summing all multiple-chain bubble graphs. The fact that the positions of the renormalon singularities in the Borel plane come out correctly is a non-trivial test of the conjectured duality.
