Abstract: d3 and d5 maximally SUSY gauged supergravity is considered in the parametrization (flow) of full scalar coset where the kinetic term for scalars takes the standard field theory form and the bulk potential is an arbitrary one subject to consistent parametrization. From such SG duals we calculate d2 and d4 holographic conformal anomaly which depends on bulk scalars potential. AdS/CFT correspondence suggests that such SG side conformal anomaly should be identified with (non-perturbative) QFT conformal anomaly (taking account of radiative corrections) for the theory living on the boundary of AdS space. In the limit of constant bulk potential and single scalar, d4 result reproduces the known exact conformal anomaly corresponding to maximally SUSY super Yang-Mills theory coupled to ${\cal N}=4$ conformal supergravity.
