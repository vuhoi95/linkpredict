Title: Strings in Background Electric Field, Space/Time Noncommutativity and A  New Noncritical String Theory
Authors: N. Seiberg and L. Susskind and N. Toumbas
Abstract: Searching for space/time noncommutativity we reconsider open strings in a constant background electric field. The main difference between this situation and its magnetic counterpart is that here there is a critical electric field beyond which the theory does not make sense. We show that this critical field prevents us from finding a limit in which the theory becomes a field theory on a noncommutative spacetime. However, an appropriate limit toward the critical field leads to a novel noncritical string theory on a noncommutative spacetime.
