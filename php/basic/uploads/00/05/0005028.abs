Title: Hagedorn inflation of D-branes
Authors: Steven Abel and Katherine Freese and Ian I. Kogan
Abstract: We examine the cosmological effects of the Hagedorn phase in models where the observable universe is pictured as a D-brane. It is shown that, even in the absence of a cosmological constant, winding modes cause a negative `pressure' that can drive brane inflation of various types including both power law and exponential. We also find regimes in which the cosmology is stable but oscillating (a bouncing universe) with the Hagedorn phase softening the singular behavior associated with the collapse.
