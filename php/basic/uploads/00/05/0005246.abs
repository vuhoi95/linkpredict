Title: AdS in Warped Spacetimes
Authors: M. Cvetic and H. Lu and C. N. Pope and J. F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We obtain a large class of AdS spacetimes warped with certain internal spaces in eleven-dimensional and type IIA/IIB supergravities. The warp factors depend only on the internal coordinates. These solutions arise as the near-horizon geometries of more general semi-localised multi-intersections of $p$-branes. We achieve this by noting that any sphere (or AdS spacetime) of dimension greater than 3 can be viewed as a foliation involving S^3 (or AdS_3). Then the S^3 (or AdS_3) can be replaced by a three-dimensional lens space (or a BTZ black hole), which arises naturally from the introduction of a NUT (or a pp-wave) to the M-branes or the D3-brane. We then obtain multi-intersections by performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction or Hopf T-duality transformation on the fibre coordinate of the lens space (or the BTZ black hole). These geometries provide further possible examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of consistent embeddings of lower-dimensional gauged supergravities in D=11 or D=10.
