Title: A note on topological brane theories
Authors: Ingemar Bengtsson and Nuno Barros e Sa and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We consider the theory of closed $p$-branes propagating on $(p+1)$-dimensional space-time manifolds. This theory has no local degrees of freedom. Here we study its canonical and BRST structures of the theory. In the case of locally flat backgrounds one can show that the $p$-brane theory is related to another known topological field theory. In the general situation some equivalent actions can also be written for the topological $p$-brane theory.
