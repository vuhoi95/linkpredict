Title: Curved dilatonic brane-worlds and the cosmological constant problem
Authors: Natxo Alonso-Alberca and Bert Janssen and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: We construct a model for dilatonic brane worlds with constant curvature on the brane, i.e. a non-zero four-dimensional cosmological constant, given in function of the dilaton coupling and the cosmological constant of the bulk. We compare this family of solutions to other known dilatonic domain wall solutions and apply a self-tunning mechanism to check the stability of our solutions under quantum fluctuations living on the brane.
