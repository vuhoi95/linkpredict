Title: Zero modes in finite range magnetic fields
Authors: C. Adam and B. Muratori and C. Nash
Abstract: We find a class of Fermion zero modes of Abelian Dirac operators in three dimensional Euclidean space where the gauge potentials and the related magnetic fields are nonzero only in a finite space region.
