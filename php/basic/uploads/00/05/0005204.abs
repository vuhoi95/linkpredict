Title: Monopoles and Strings in Noncommutative Gauge Theory
Authors: David J. Gross and Nikita A. Nekrasov
Abstract: We study some non-perturbative aspects of noncommutative gauge theories. We find analytic solutions of the equations of motion, for noncommutative U(1) gauge theory, that describe magnetic monopoles with a finite tension string attached. These solutions are non-singular, finite and sourceless. We identify the string with the projection of a D-string ending on a D3-brane in the presence of a constant B-field.
