Title: Path Integral Approach to String Theory on AdS_3
Authors: Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Kazumi Okuyama and Yuji Satoh
Abstract: Using the path integral approach, we discuss the correlation functions of the $SL(2,\bfC)/SU(2)$ WZW model, which corresponds to the string theory on the Euclidean $AdS_3$. We obtain the two- and three-point functions for generic primary fields in closed forms. By an appropriate change of the normalization of the primary fields, our results coincide with those by Teschner, which were obtained by using the bootstrap approach. The supergravity results are also obtained in the semi-classical limit.
