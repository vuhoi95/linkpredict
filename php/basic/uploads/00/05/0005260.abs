Abstract: We present an analysis of the low-energy implications of an intermediate scale ~10^{11} GeV string theory. We mainly focus on the evolution of the physical parameters under the renormalisation group equations (RGEs) and find several interesting new features that differ from the standard GUT scale or Planck scale scenarios. We give a general discussion of soft supersymmetry breaking terms in type I theories and then investigate the renormalization group running. In the dilaton domination scenario, we present the sparticle spectra, analyzing constraints from charge and colour breaking, fine tuning and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. We compare with the allowed regions of parameter space when the RGEs start running at the standard GUT or the intermediate scales, and find quite remarkably that the dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario, which is essentially ruled out from constraints on charge and colour breaking if the fundamental scale is close to the Planck mass, is allowed in a large region of parameter space if the fundamental scale is intermediate.
