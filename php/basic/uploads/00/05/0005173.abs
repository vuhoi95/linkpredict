Title: Loop dynamics and AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: A. M. Polyakov and V. S. Rychkov
Abstract: We consider the strong coupling limit of conformal gauge theories in 4 dimensions. The action of the loop operator on the minimal area in the AdS space is analyzed, and the Schwinger-Dyson equations of gauge theory are checked. The general approach to the loop dynamics developed here goes beyond the special case of conformal theories.
