Title: On p-Adic Functional Integration
Authors: Goran S. Djordjevic and Branko Dragovich
Abstract: p-Adic generalization of the Feynman path integrals in quantum mechanics is considered. The probability amplitude for a particle in a constant field is calculated. Path integrals over p-adic space have the same form as those over R.
