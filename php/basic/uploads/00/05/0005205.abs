Title: Matrix Theory Compactification on Noncommutative $T^4/Z_2$
Authors: Eunsang Kim and Hoil Kim and Chang-Yeong Lee
Abstract: In this paper, we construct gauge bundles on a noncommutative toroidal orbifold $T^4_\theta/Z_2$. First, we explicitly construct a bundle with constant curvature connections on a noncommutative $T^4_\theta$ following Rieffel's method. Then, applying the appropriate quotient conditions for its $Z_2$ orbifold, we find a Connes-Douglas-Schwarz type solution of matrix theory compactified on $T^4_\theta/Z_2$. When we consider two copies of a bundle on $T^4_\theta$ invariant under the $Z_2$ action, the resulting Higgs branch moduli space of equivariant constant curvature connections becomes an ordinary toroidal orbifold $T^4/Z_2$.
