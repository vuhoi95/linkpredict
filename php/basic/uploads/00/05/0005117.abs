Title: $\hat{Q}$ operator for canonical quantum gravity
Authors: Yongge Ma and Yi Ling
Abstract: We study the properties of $\hat{Q}[\omega]$ operator on the kinematical Hilbert space ${\cal H}$ for canonical quantum gravity. Its complete spectrum with respect to the spin network basis is obtained. It turns out that $\hat{Q}[\omega]$ is diagonalized in this basis, and it is a well defined self-adjoint operator on ${\cal H}$. The same conclusions are also tenable on the SU(2) gauge invariant Hilbert space with the gauge invariant spin network basis.
