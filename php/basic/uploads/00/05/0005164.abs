Title: String Junctions in B Field Background
Authors: Jiro Hashiba and Kazuo Hosomichi and Seiji Terashima
Abstract: It has been recently shown that F-theory on K3 with background B fields (NSNS and RR 2-forms) is dual to the CHL string in 8 dimensions. In this paper, we reexamine this duality in terms of string junctions in type IIB string theory. It is in particular stressed that certain 7-brane configurations produce Sp gauge groups in a novel way.
