Title: Solitons and black holes in non-Abelian Einstein-Born-Infeld theory
Authors: V. V. Dyadichev and D. V. Gal'tsov
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the Born-Infeld-type modification of the quadratic Yang-Mills action gives rise to classical particle-like solutions in the flat space which have a striking similarity with the Bartnik-McKinnon solutions known in the gravity coupled Yang-Mills theory. We show that both families are continuously related within the framework of the Einstein-Born-Infeld theory through interpolating sequences of parameters. We also investigate an internal structure of the associated black holes. It is found that the Born-Infeld non-linearity leads to a drastic modification of the black hole interior typical for the usual Yang-Mills theory. In the latter case a generic solution exhibits violent metric oscillations near the singularity. In the Born-Infeld case a generic interior solution is smooth, the metric has the standard Schwarzschild type singularity, and we did not observe internal horizons. Such smoothing of the 'violent' EYM singularity may be interpreted as a result of quantum effects.
