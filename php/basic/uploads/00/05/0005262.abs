Title: Euler number of Instanton Moduli space and Seiberg-Witten invariants
Authors: Akifumi Sako and Toru Sasaki
Abstract: We show that a partition function of topological twisted N=4 Yang-Mills theory is given by Seiberg-Witten invariants on a Riemannian four manifolds under the condition that the sum of Euler number and signature of the four manifolds vanish. The partition function is the sum of Euler number of instanton moduli space when it is possible to apply the vanishing theorem. And we get a relation of Euler number labeled by the instanton number $k$ with Seiberg-Witten invariants, too. All calculation in this paper is done without assuming duality.
