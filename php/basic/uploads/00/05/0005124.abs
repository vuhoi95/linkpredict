Title: Orbifold Hodge numbers of the wreath product orbifolds
Authors: Weiqiang Wang and Jian Zhou
Abstract: We prove that the wreath product orbifolds studied earlier by the first author provide a large class of higher dimensional examples of orbifolds whose orbifold Hodge numbers coincide with the ordinary ones of suitable resolutions of singularities. We also make explicit conjectures on elliptic genera for the wreath product orbifolds.
