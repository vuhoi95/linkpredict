Title: Dynamics of Cosmic Necklaces
Authors: Xavier Siemens and Xavier Martin and Ken D. Olum
Abstract: We perform numerical simulations of cosmic necklaces (systems of monopoles connected to two strings each) and investigate the conditions under which monopoles annihilate. When the total monopole energy is large compared to the string energy, we find that the string motion is no longer periodic, and thus the strings will be chopped up by self intersection. When the total monopole energy is much smaller than the string energy, the string motion is periodic, but that of the monopoles is not, and thus the monopoles travel along the string and annihilate with each other.
