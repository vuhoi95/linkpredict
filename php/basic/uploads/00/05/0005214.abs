Title: An Extended Abelian Chern-Simons Model and the Symplectic Projector  Method
Authors: L. R. U. Manssur and A. L. M. A. Nogueira and M. A. Santos
Abstract: The Symplectic Projector Method is applied to discuss quantisation aspects of an extended Abelian model with a pair of gauge potentials coupled by means of a mixed Chern-Simons term. We focuss on a field content that spans an N=2-D=3 supersymmetric theory whenever scalar and fermionic matter is suitably coupled to the family of gauge potentials.
