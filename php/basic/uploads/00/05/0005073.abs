Title: Stringy Fuzziness as the Custodian of Time-Space Noncommutativity
Authors: J. L. F. Barbon and E. Rabinovici
Abstract: We study aspects of obtaining field theories with noncommuting time-space coordinates as limits of open-string theories in constant electric-field backgrounds. We find that, within the standard closed-string backgrounds, there is an obstruction to decoupling the time-space noncommutativity scale from that of the string fuzziness scale. We speculate that this censorship may be string-theory's way of protecting the causality and unitarity structure. We study the moduli space of the obstruction in terms of the open- and closed-string backgrounds. Cases of both zero and infinite brane tensions as well as zero string couplings are obtained. A decoupling can be achieved formally by considering complex values of the dilaton and inverting the role of space and time in the light cone. This is reminiscent of a black-hole horizon. We study the corresponding supergravity solution in the large-N limit and find that the geometry has a naked singularity at the physical scale of noncommutativity.
