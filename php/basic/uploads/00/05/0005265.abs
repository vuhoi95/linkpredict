Title: Softly Broken Supersymmetric Gauge-Higgs-Yukawa Theories as  Renormalizable Composite Models
Authors: Tatsuo Kobayashi and Haruhiko Terao
Abstract: We examine the (softly broken) supersymmetric gauge-Higgs-Yukawa theories satisfying the compositeness conditions at a certain scale. In these theories the Higgs superfields can be regarded as the chiral composite fields. It is found that there are the fundamental theories, which contain the dimension 5 interactions and the hard SUSY breaking in perturbation, turn to be renormalizable and also softly broken theories in the nonperturbative framework. The soft SUSY breaking parameters as well as the Yukawa coupling in the corresponding gauge-Higgs-Yukawa theories are restricted by the renormalization group invariant relations.
