Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the colored Hubbard model
Authors: Tobias Baier and Eike Bick and Christof Wetterich
Abstract: The Hubbard model is reformulated in terms of different ``colored'' fermion species for the electrons or holes at different lattice sites. Antiferromagnetic ordering or d-wave superconductivity can then be described in terms of translationally invariant expectation values for colored composite scalar fields. A suitable mean field approximation for the two dimensional colored Hubbard model shows indeed phases with antiferromagnetic ordering or d-wave superconductivity at low temperature. At low enough temperature the transition to the antiferromagnetic phase is of first order. The present formulation also allows an easy extension to more complicated microscopic interactions.
