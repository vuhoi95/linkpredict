Title: Entangled Simultaneous Measurement and Elementary Particle  Representations
Authors: Robert Y. Levin and Victor Dannon
Abstract: We propose that the principles of relativistic quantum mechanics are incomplete for simultaneous measurement of non-commuting operators. Consistent joint measurement of incompatible observables at a single point in space-time requires that the system be in an entangled state with vacuum meters. We suggest that entagled simultaneous mesurement for noncommuting observables is the basis for the observed fermionic multiplets. This generalizes the standard spin representations for particles arising from Lorentz invariance. We show that operator entanglement for all quantum observables in the Poincare algebra, coupled with Fermi-Dirac statistics, mandates six fermions. We propose that the quark and lepton generations form a super-structure of the Poincare algebra based on the principles of entangled simultaneity. Mathematically, that super-structure is known as a Naimark extension. The required entanglement between particle generations for left-handed quarks is observed in the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-maskawa matrix. We show that the Naimark-extended von Neumann lattice is ditributive, thereby suggesting the principle of entangled simultaneity as a mechanism to avoid quantum non-locality. Keywords: enatangled simultaneous quantum measurement, Naimark extension, Lepton/quark generations. PACS Number: 03.65.BZ
