Title: Black hole solutions in Euler-Heisenberg theory
Authors: Hiroki Yajima and Takashi Tamaki
Abstract: We construct static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) system which is considered as an effective action of a superstring theory. We considered electrically charged, magnetically charged and dyon solutions. We can solve analytically for the magnetically charged case. We find that they have some remarkable properties about causality and black hole thermodynamics depending on the coupling constant of the EH theory $a$ and $b$, though they have central singularity as in the Schwarzschild black hole.
