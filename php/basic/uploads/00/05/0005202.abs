Title: Bosonic Open Strings in a Tachyonic Background Field
Authors: Tasneem Zehra Husain and Maxim Zabzine
Abstract: We study a bosonic open string coupled to a tachyonic background field $T[X]$ and find that the tachyon field can effectively be replaced by a configuration of D-branes placed at either the zeros or the critical points of $T[X]$, depending on our choice of boundary conditions. This dual picture of the open string tachyon is explored in detail for the explicit case when the tachyonic field is quadratic.
