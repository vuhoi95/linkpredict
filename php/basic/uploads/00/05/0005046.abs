Title: Duality and Non-Commutative Gauge Theory
Authors: Ori J. Ganor and Govindan Rajesh and Savdeep Sethi
Abstract: We study the generalization of S-duality to non-commutative gauge theories. For rank one theories, we obtain the leading terms of the dual theory by Legendre transforming the Lagrangian of the non-commutative theory expressed in terms of a commutative gauge field. The dual description is weakly coupled when the original theory is strongly coupled if we appropriately scale the non-commutativity parameter. However, the dual theory appears to be non-commutative in space-time when the original theory is non-commutative in space. This suggests that locality in time for non-commutative theories is an artifact of perturbation theory.
