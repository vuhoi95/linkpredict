Title: Evolution of interfaces and expansion in width
Authors: H. Arodz and R. Pelka
Abstract: Interfaces in a model with a single, real nonconserved order parameter and purely dissipative evolution equation are considered. We show that a systematic perturbative approach, called the expansion in width and developed for curved domain walls, can be generalized to the interfaces. Procedure for calculating curvature corrections is described. We also derive formulas for local velocity and local surface tension of the interface. As an example, evolution of spherical interfaces is discussed, including an estimate of critical size of small droplets.
