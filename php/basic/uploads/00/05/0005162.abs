Title: Exponential Hierarchy From Spacetime Variable String Vacua
Authors: P. Berglund and T. Hubsch and D. Minic
Abstract: It is shown that non-supersymmetric spacetime varying string vacua can lead to an exponential hierarchy between the electroweak and the gravitational scales. The hierarchy is naturally generated by a string coupling of O(1).
