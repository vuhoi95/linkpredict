Title: The non-dynamical r-matrices of the degenerate Calogero-Moser models
Authors: L. Feher and B. G. Pusztai
Abstract: A complete description of the non-dynamical r-matrices of the degenerate Calogero-Moser models based on $gl_n$ is presented. First the most general momentum independent r-matrices are given for the standard Lax representation of these systems and those r-matrices whose coordinate dependence can be gauged away are selected. Then the constant r-matrices resulting from gauge transformation are determined and are related to well-known r-matrices. In the hyperbolic/trigonometric case a non-dynamical r-matrix equivalent to a real/imaginary multiple of the Cremmer-Gervais classical r-matrix is found. In the rational case the constant r-matrix corresponds to the antisymmetric solution of the classical Yang-Baxter equation associated with the Frobenius subalgebra of $gl_n$ consisting of the matrices with vanishing last row. These claims are consistent with previous results of Hasegawa and others, which imply that Belavin's elliptic r-matrix and its degenerations appear in the Calogero-Moser models. The advantages of our analysis are that it is elementary and also clarifies the extent to which the constant r-matrix is unique in the degenerate cases.
