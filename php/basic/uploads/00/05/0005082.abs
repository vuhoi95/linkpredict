Title: NDIM achievements: Massive, Arbitrary tensor rank and N-loop insertions  in Feynman integrals
Authors: A. T. Suzuki and A. G. M. Schmidt
Abstract: One of the main difficulties in studying Quantum Field Theory, in the perturbative regime, is the calculation of D-dimensional Feynman integrals. In general, one introduces the so-called Feynman parameters and associated with them the cumbersome parametric integrals. Solving these integrals beyond the one-loop level can be a difficult task. Negative dimensional integration method (\ndim{}) is a technique whereby such problem is dramatically reduced. In this work we present the calculation of two-loop integrals in three diferent cases: scalar ones with three diferent masses, massless with arbitrary tensor rank, with N-insertions of a 2-loop diagram.
