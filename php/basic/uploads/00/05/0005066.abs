Title: Tunneling into the Randall-Sundrum Brane World
Authors: A. Gorsky and K. Selivanov
Abstract: We suggest a modification of the Randall-Sundrum scenario which doesn't involve branes with the negative tensions. In our scenario four-dimensional brane world is produced by the external field. The probability of this process is calculated and the physical features of the model are discussed.
