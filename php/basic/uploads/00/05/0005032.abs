Title: Cosmological Perturbations in Brane-World Theories: Formalism
Authors: C. van de Bruck and M. Dorca and R. H. Brandenberger and A. Lukas
Abstract: We develop a gauge-invariant formalism to describe metric perturbations in five-dimensional brane-world theories. In particular, this formalism applies to models originating from heterotic M-theory. We introduce a generalized longitudinal gauge for scalar perturbations. As an application, we discuss some aspects of the evolution of fluctuations on the brane. Moreover, we show how the five-dimensional formalism can be matched to the known four-dimensional one in the limit where an effective four-dimensional description is appropriate.
