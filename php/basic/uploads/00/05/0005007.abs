Title: A Note on Supergravity Duals of Noncommutative Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Banhiman Ghosh
Abstract: A class of supergravity backgrounds have been proposed as dual descriptions of strong coupling large-N noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories in 3+1 dimensions. However calculations of correlation functions in supergravity from an evaluation of relevant classical actions appear ambiguous. We propose a resolution of this ambiguity. Assuming that {\it some} holographic description exists - regardless of whether it is the NCYM theory - we argue that there should be operators in the holographic boundary theory which create normalized states of definite energy and momenta. An operator version of the dual correspondence then provides a calculation of correlators of these operators in terms of bulk Green's functions. We show that in the low energy limit the correlators reproduce expected answers of the ordinary Yang-Mills theory.
