Title: Symmetry and Covariance of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Minoru Omote and Susumu Kamefuchi
Abstract: On the basis of a 5-dimensional form of space-time transformations non-relativistic quantum mechanics is reformulated in a manifestly covariant manner. The resulting covariance resembles that of the conventional relativistic quantum mechanics.
