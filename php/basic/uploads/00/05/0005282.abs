Title: Mesonic Spectrum of Two Dimensional Supersymmetric Theories
Authors: Oleg Lunin and Stephen Pinsky
Abstract: We consider a bound state problem for a family of supersymmetric gauge theories with fundamental matter. These theories can be obtained by a dimensional reduction of supersymmetric QCD from three dimensions to 1+1 and subsequent truncation of some of the fields. We find that the models without adjoint scalar converge to well-defined continuum limits and calculate the resulting spectra of these theories. We also find the critical value of coupling at which an additional massless state is observed. By contrast, the models containing adjoint scalars, seem to have a continuous mass spectrum in the limit of infinite volume.
