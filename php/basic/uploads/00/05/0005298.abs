Title: Brane-Universe in Six Dimensions
Authors: Merab Gogberashvili and Paul Midodashvili
Abstract: Growing non-singular solution of 6-dimensional Einstein equations for the 4-brane in infinite transversal 2-space is found. This solution provides gravitational trapping of matter and 4-dimensional gravity on the brane without extra delta-like source. The suitable solution exists in the case of the (2+4)-space and not exists for the (1+5)-signature.
