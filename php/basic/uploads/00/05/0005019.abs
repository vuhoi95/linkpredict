Title: Covariant Schwinger terms
Authors: C. Adam and C. Ekstrand and T. Sykora
Abstract: There exist two versions of the covariant Schwinger term in the literature. They only differ by a sign. However, we shall show that this is an essential difference. We shall carefully (taking all signs into account) review the existing quantum field theoretical computations for the covariant Schwinger term in order to determine the correct expression.
