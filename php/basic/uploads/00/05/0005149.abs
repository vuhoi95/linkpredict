Title: Width and Partial Widths of Unstable Particles
Authors: P. A. Grassi and B. A. Kniehl and A. Sirlin
Abstract: In the gauge theory context, a definition of branching ratios and partial widths of unstable particles is proposed that satisfies the basic principles of additivity and gauge independence. A simpler definition, similar to the conventional one, is examined in the Z^0-boson case. In order to establish contact with experiment, we show that it leads to a peak cross section that justifies the expression used by the LEP Electroweak Working Group through next-to-next-to-leading order, provided that the pole rather than the on-shell mass and width of the Z^0 boson are employed.
