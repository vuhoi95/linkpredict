Title: Two Two-Dimensional Supergravity Theories from Calabi-Yau Four-Folds
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Sergei Gukov and Edward Witten
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional supergravity theories with four supercharges constructed from compactification of Type II string theory on a generic Calabi-Yau four-fold. In Type IIA and Type IIB cases, respectively, new superspace formulations of N=(2,2) and N=(0,4) dilaton supergravities are found and their coupling to matter multiplets is discussed.
