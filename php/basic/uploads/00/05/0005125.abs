Title: Quasi-normal modes of charged, dilaton black holes
Authors: Valeria Ferrari and Massimo Pauri and Federico Piazza
Abstract: In this paper we study the perturbations of the charged, dilaton black hole, described by the solution of the low energy limit of the superstring action found by Garfinkle, Horowitz and Strominger. We compute the complex frequencies of the quasi-normal modes of this black hole, and compare the results with those obtained for a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and a Schwarzschild black hole. The most remarkable feature which emerges from this study is that the presence of the dilaton breaks the \emph{isospectrality} of axial and polar perturbations, which characterizes both Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes.
