Title: E8 Gauge Theory, and a Derivation of K-Theory from M-Theory
Authors: Duiliu-Emanuel Diaconescu and Gregory Moore and Edward Witten
Abstract: The partition function of Ramond-Ramond p-form fields in Type IIA supergravity on a ten-manifold X contains subtle phase factors that are associated with T-duality, self-duality, and the relation of the RR fields to K-theory. The analogous partition function of M-theory on X x S1 contains subtle phases that are similarly associated with E8 gauge theory. We analyze the detailed phase factors on the two sides and show that they agree, thereby testing M-theory/Type IIA duality as well as the K-theory formalism in an interesting way. We also show that certain D-brane states wrapped on nontrivial homology cycles are actually unstable, that (-1)^{F_L} symmetry in Type IIA superstring theory depends in general on a cancellation between a fermion anomaly and an anomaly of RR fields, and that Type IIA superstring theory with no wrapped branes is well-defined only on a spacetime with W_7=0.
