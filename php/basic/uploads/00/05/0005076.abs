Title: Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric SU(n_c) and USp(2n_c)  Gauge Theories
Authors: Giuseppe Carlino and Kenichi Konishi and Hitoshi Murayama
Abstract: We find the phase and flavor symmetry breaking pattern of each N=1 supersymmetric vacuum of SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) gauge theories, constructed from the exactly solvable N=2 theories by perturbing them with small adjoint and generic bare hypermultiplet (quark) masses. In SU(n_c) theories with n_f \leq n_c the vacua are labelled by an integer r, in which the flavor U(n_f) symmetry is dynamically broken to U(r) \times U(n_f-r) in the limit of vanishing bare hyperquark masses. In the r=1 vacua the dynamical symmetry breaking is caused by the condensation of magnetic monopoles in the n_f representation. For general r, however, the monopoles in the {}_{n_f}C_r representation, whose condensation could explain the flavor symmetry breaking but would produce too-many Nambu--Goldstone multiplets, actually "break up" into "magnetic quarks": the latter with nonabelian interactions condense and induce confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking. In USp(2n_c) theories with n_f \leq n_c + 1, the flavor SO(2n_f) symmetry is dynamically broken to U(n_f), but with no description in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory. In both SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) theories, with larger numbers of quark flavors, besides the vacua with these properties, there exist also vacua in free magnetic phase, with unbroken global symmetry.
