Title: Anisotropic Four-Dimensional NS-NS String Cosmology
Authors: Chiang-Mei Chen and T. Harko and M. K. Mak
Abstract: An anisotropic (Bianchi type I) cosmology is considered in the four-dimensional NS-NS sector of low-energy effective string theory coupled to a dilaton and an axion-like $H$-field within a de Sitter-Einstein frame background. The time evolution of this Universe is discussed in both the Einstein and string frames.
