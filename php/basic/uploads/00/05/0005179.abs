Title: Two-dimensional black holes as open strings: A new realization of the  ADS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Mariano Cadoni and Marco Cavaglia'
Abstract: We show that weak-coupled two-dimensional dilaton gravity on Anti-de Sitter space can be described by the dynamics of an open string. Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the string lead to two different realizations of the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence. In particular, in the Dirichlet case the thermodynamical entropy of two-dimensional black holes can be exactly reproduced by counting the string states.
