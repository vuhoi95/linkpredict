Title: RTT presentation of finite W-algebras
Authors: C. Briot and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We construct a wide class of finite W-algebras as truncations of Yangians. These truncations correspond to algebra homomorphisms and allow to construct the W-algebras as exchange algebras, the R-matrix being the Yangian's one. As an application, we classify all irreducible finite dimensionnal representations of these W-algebras and determine their center.
