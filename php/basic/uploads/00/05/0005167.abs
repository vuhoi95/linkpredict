Title: High-dimensional sources for the four-dimensional gravity
Authors: M. Chaichian and M. Gogberashvili and A. B. Kobakhidze
Abstract: We argue that a certain distribution of matter in higher dimensions can provide the correct behaviour of gravity in four dimensions. Some explicit examples illustrating the idea are considered.
