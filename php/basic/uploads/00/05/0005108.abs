Title: Statistical Entropy of Schwarzschild Black Strings and Black Holes
Authors: Saurya Das and Amit Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: The statistical entropy of a Schwarzschild black string in five dimensions is obtained by counting the black string states which form a representation of the near-horizon conformal symmetry with a central charge. The statistical entropy of the string agrees with its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as that of the Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensions. The choice of the string length which gives the Virasoro algebra also reproduces the precise value of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and lies inside the stability bound of the string.
