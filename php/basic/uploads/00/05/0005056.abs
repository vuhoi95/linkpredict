Title: Generalized Dynamics of Two Distict BPS Monopoles
Authors: Choonkyu Lee and Kimyeong Lee
Abstract: Classical and quantum dynamics of two distinct BPS monopoles in the case of non-aligned Higgs fields are studied on the basis of the recently determined low energy effective theory. Despite the presence of a specific potential together with a kinetic term provided by the metric of a Taub-NUT manifold, an O(4) or O(3,1) symmetry of the system allows for a group theoretical derivation of the bound-state spectrum and the scattering cross section.
