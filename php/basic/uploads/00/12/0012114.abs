Title: Harmonic-Superspace Method Of Solving N=3 Super-Yang-Mills Equations
Authors: J. Niederle and B. Zupnik
Abstract: We analyze the superfield constraints of the D=4, N=3 SYM-theory using light-cone gauge conditions. The SU(3)/U(1) x U(1) harmonic variables are interpreted as auxiliary spectral parameters, and the transform to the harmonic-superspace representation is considered. The harmonic superfield equations of motion are drastically simplified in our gauge, in particular, the basic matrix of the harmonic transform and the corresponding harmonic analytic gauge connections become nilpotent on-shell. It is shown that these harmonic SYM-equations are equivalent to the finite set of solvable linear iterative equations.
