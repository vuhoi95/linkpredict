Title: Supersymmetry of Green-Schwarz Superstring and Matrix String Theory
Authors: Seungjoon Hyun and Hyeonjoon Shin
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Green-Schwarz superstring on the gravitational wave background corresponding to the Matrix string theory and the supersymmetry transformation rules of the superstring. The dynamics is obtained in the light-cone formulation and is shown to agree with that derived from the Matrix string theory. The supersymmetry structure has the corrections due to the effect of the background and is identified with that of the low energy one-loop effective action of Matrix string theory in two superstring background in the weak string coupling limit.
