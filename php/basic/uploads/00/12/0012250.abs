Title: Type I Superconductivity upon Monopole Condensation in Seiberg-Witten  Theory
Authors: A. Vainshtein and A. Yung
Abstract: We study the confinement scenario in N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory near the monopole point upon breaking of N=2 supersymmetry by the adjoint matter mass term. We confirm claims made previously that the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string near the monopole point fails to be a BPS state once next-to-leading corrections in the adjoint mass parameter taken into account. Our results shows that type I superconductivity arises upon monopole condensation. This conclusion allows us to make qualitative predictions on the structure of the hadron mass spectrum near the monopole point.
