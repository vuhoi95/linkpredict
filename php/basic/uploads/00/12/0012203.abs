Authors: Laura Andrianopoli and Francesco Cordaro and Pietro Fre' and Leonardo Gualtieri
Abstract: The recent construction of the non-semisimple gaugings of maximal D=5 supergravity is reported here. This construction is worked out in the so-called rheonomic approach, based on Free Differential Algebras and the solution of their Bianchi identities. In this approach the dualization mechanism between one-forms and two-forms is more transparent. The lagrangian is unnecessary since the field equations follow from closure of the supersymmetry algebra. These theories contain 12-r self-dual two-forms and 15+r gauge vectors, r of which are abelian and neutral. Such theories, whose existence has been proved and their supersymmetry algebra constructed, have potentially interesting properties in relation with domain wall solutions and the trapping of gravity.
