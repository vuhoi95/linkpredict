Title: Higgs description of two-flavor QCD vacuum
Authors: J. Berges and C. Wetterich
Abstract: A Higgs description for the QCD vacuum in the limit of two quark flavors is proposed. Complete ``spontaneous breaking'' of color symmetry is realized by condensation of an adjoint quark-antiquark and a quark-quark pair. The vacuum is invariant under isospin symmetry applying color and flavor transformations simultaneously. All elementary excitations acquire integral charges. The dressed microscopic quark and gluon degrees of freedom can be identified with the macroscopic baryon and vector meson degrees of freedom. In addition to the nucleons we find soliton--type fermions with integer isospin. Their presence provides an important test accessible to lattice QCD simulations.
