Title: High-precision estimates of critical quantities by means of improved  Hamiltonians
Authors: M. Campostrini and M. Hasenbusch and A. Pelissetto and P. Rossi and E. Vicari
Abstract: Three-dimensional spin models of the Ising and XY universality classes are studied by a combination of high-temperature expansions and Monte Carlo simulations applied to improved Hamiltonians. The critical exponents and the critical equation of state are determined to very high precision.
