Title: A Spectral Quadruple for de Sitter Space
Authors: T. Kopf and M. Paschke
Abstract: A set of data supposed to give possible axioms for spacetimes with a sufficient number of isometries in spectral geometry is given. These data are shown to be sufficient to obtain 1+1 dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The data rely at the moment somewhat on the guidance given by a required symmetry, in part to allow explicit calculations in a specific model. The framework applies also to the noncommutative case. Finite spectral triples are discussed as an example.
