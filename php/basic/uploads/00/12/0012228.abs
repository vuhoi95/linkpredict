Title: From local to global deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds
Authors: Alberto S. Cattaneo and Giovanni Felder and Lorenzo Tomassini
Abstract: We give an explicit construction of a deformation quantization of the algebra of functions on a Poisson manifolds, based on Kontsevich's local formula. The deformed algebra of functions is realized as the algebra of horizontal sections of a vector bundle with flat connection.
