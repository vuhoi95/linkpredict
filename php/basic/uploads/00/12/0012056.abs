Title: Noncommutative Parameters of Quantum Symmetries and Star Products
Authors: P. Kosiński and J. Lukierski and P. Maślanka
Abstract: The star product technique translates the framework of local fields on noncommutative space-time into nonlocal fields on standard space-time. We consider the example of fields on $\kappa$- deformed Minkowski space, transforming under $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group with noncommutative parameters. By extending the star product to the tensor product of functions on $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space and $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group we represent the algebra of noncommutative parameters of deformed relativistic symmetries by functions on classical Poincar\'{e} group.
