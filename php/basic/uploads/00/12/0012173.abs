Title: Vector Supersymmetry and Finite Quantum Correction of Chern-Simons  Theory in the Light-Cone Gauge
Authors: W. F. Chen and G. Leibbrandt
Abstract: Vector supersymmetry is shown to exist also in light-cone gauge Chern-Simons theory. Using a gauge invariant regularization scheme, we demonstrate explicitly that the finite quantum correction to the coupling constant of Chern-Simons theory is intimately associated with the breaking of vector supersymmetry at the regularization level. The advantage of investigating such a quantum phenomenon in the light-cone gauge is emphasized and the BRST and vector supersymmetry invariance of quantum effective action is discussed.
