Title: Fractional Super Lie Algebras and Groups
Authors: H. Ahmedov and A. Yildiz and Y. Ucan
Abstract: n^{th} root of a Lie algebra and its dual (that is fractional supergroup) based on the permutation group $S_n$ invariant forms are formulated in the Hopf algebra formalism. Detailed discussion of $S_3$-graided $sl(2)$ algebras is done.
