Title: Is nonperturbative inflatino production during preheating a real threat  to cosmology?
Authors: Rouzbeh Allahverdi and Mar Bastero-Gil and Anupam Mazumdar
Abstract: We discuss toy models where supersymmetry is broken due to non-vanishing time-varying vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field during preheating. We discuss the production of inflatino the superpartner of inflaton due to vacuum fluctuations and then we argue that they do not survive until nucleosynthesis and decay along with the inflaton to produce a thermal bath after preheating. Thus the only relevant remnant is the helicity \pm 3/2 gravitinos which can genuinely cause problem to nucleosynthesis.
