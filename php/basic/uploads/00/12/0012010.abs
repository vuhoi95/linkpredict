Title: T-duality of the Green-Schwarz superstring
Authors: Bogdan Kulik and Radu Roiban
Abstract: We study T-duality in the Green-Schwarz formalism to all orders in superspace coordinates. We find two analogs of Buscher rules for the supervielbein and clarify their meaning from the superstring point of view. The transformation rules for the dilaton, spin 1/2 fermions and Ramond-Ramond superfields are also derived.
