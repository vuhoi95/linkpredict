Title: Errata and Addenda to ``Anomaly Cancellation Condition in Lattice Gauge  Theory''
Authors: Hiroshi Igarashi and Kiyoshi Okuyama and Hiroshi Suzuki
Abstract: We correct some intermediate expressions and arguments in hep-lat/0002009 (Nucl. Phys. B 585 (2000) 471--513). The main results do not change. We also mention some additional observations, including a constraint on a coefficient of the possible nontrivial anomaly which was not given in the paper.
