Title: Response of an electron system to a periodic potential
Authors: S. Nagy and K. Sailer
Abstract: We give a quantum field theoretical treatment of a one dimensional electron system with a fixed chemical potential $\mu$. The non-perturbative Lindhard response function is found for an electron system in a sinusoidal potential.
