Title: On the path integral representation for Wilson loops and the non-Abelian  Stokes theorem II
Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov and N. I. Troitskaya
Abstract: This paper is a revised version of our recent publication Faber et al., Phys. Rev. D62 (2000) 025019, hep-th/9907048. The main revision concerns the expansion into group characters that we have used for the evaluation of path integrals over gauge degrees of freedom. In the present paper we apply the expansion recommended by Diakonov and Petrov in hep-lat/0008004. Our former expansion was approximate and in the region of the particular values of parameters violated the completeness condition by 1.4%. We show that by using the expansion into characters recommended by Diakonov and Petrov in hep-lat/0008004 our previous results are retained and the path integral over gauge degrees of freedom for Wilson loops derived by Diakonov and Petrov (Phys. Lett. B224 (1989) 131 and hep-lat/0008004) by using a special regularization is erroneous and predicts zero value for the Wilson loop. We give comments on the paper hep-lat/0008004.
