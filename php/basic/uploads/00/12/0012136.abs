Title: SO and Sp Chern-Simons at Large N
Authors: S. Sinha and C. Vafa
Abstract: We study the large N limit of SO(N) and Sp(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory on S^3 and identify its closed string dual as topological strings on an orientifold of the small resolution of the conifold. Applications to large N dualities for N=1 supersymmetric gauge systems in 4 dimensions are also discussed.
