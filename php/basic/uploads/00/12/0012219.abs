Title: General Two-Dimensional Supergravity from Poisson Superalgebras
Authors: M. Ertl and W. Kummer and T. Strobl
Abstract: We provide the geometric actions for most general N=1 supergravity in two spacetime dimensions. Our construction implies an extension to arbitrary N. This provides a supersymmetrization of any generalized dilaton gravity theory or of any theory with an action being an (essentially) arbitrary function of curvature and torsion. Technically we proceed as follows: The bosonic part of any of these theories may be characterized by a generically nonlinear Poisson bracket on a three-dimensional target space. In analogy to a given ordinary Lie algebra, we derive all possible N=1 extensions of any of the given Poisson (or W-) algebras. Using the concept of graded Poisson Sigma Models, any extension of the algebra yields a possible supergravity extension of the original theory, local Lorentz and super-diffeomorphism invariance follow by construction. Our procedure automatically restricts the fermionic extension to the minimal one; thus local supersymmetry is realized on-shell. By avoiding a superfield approach we are also able to circumvent in this way the introduction of constraints and their solution. For many well-known dilaton theories different supergravity extensions are derived. In generic cases their field equations are solved explicitly.
