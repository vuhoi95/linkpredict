Title: Lattice Gauge Theory - A short Primer
Authors: G. MÃ¼nster and M. Walzl
Abstract: In this contribution we give an introduction to the foundations and methods of lattice gauge theory. Starting with a brief discussion of the quantum mechanical path integral, we develop the main ingredients of lattice field theory: functional integrals, Euclidean field theory and the space-time discretization of scalar, fermion and gauge fields. Some of the methods used in calculations are reviewed and illustrated by a collection of typical results.
