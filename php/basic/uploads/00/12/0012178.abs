Title: Multi-Domain Walls in Massive Supersymmetric Sigma-Models
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and David Tong and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: Massive maximally-supersymmetric sigma models are shown to exhibit multiple static kink-domain wall solutions that preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry. The kink moduli space admits a natural Kahler metric. We examine in some detail the case when the target of the sigma model is given by the co-tangent bundle of CP^n equipped with the Calabi metric, and we show that there exist BPS solutions corresponding to n kinks at arbitrary separation. We also describe how 1/4-BPS charged and intersecting domain walls are described in the low-energy dynamics on the kink moduli space. We comment on the similarity of these results to monopole dynamics.
