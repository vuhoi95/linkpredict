Title: The Superspace WZNW Action for 4D, N=1 Supersymmetric QCD
Authors: S. James Gates, Jr. and Marcus T. Grisaru and Marcia E. Knutt and Silvia Penati
Abstract: We discuss features of the 4D, N = 1 WZNW term expressed as a function of chiral superfields and defined in a manner appropriate to calculate phenomenological matrix elements.
