Title: Bound States of D(2p)-D0 Systems and Supersymmetric p-Cycles
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Volker Braun and Robert Helling
Abstract: We discuss some issues related to D(2p)-D0 branes with background magnetic fluxes respectively, in a T-dual picture, Dp-Dp branes at angles. In particular, we describe the nature of the supersymmetric bound states appearing after tachyon condensation. We present a very elementary derivation of the conditions to be satisfied by such general supersymmetric gauge configurations, which are simply related by T-duality to the conditions for supersymmetric p-cycles in C^p.
