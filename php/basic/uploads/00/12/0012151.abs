Title: General approach to potentials with two known levels
Authors: S. N. Dolya and O. B. Zaslavskii
Abstract: We present the general form of potentials with two given energy levels $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$ and find corresponding wave functions. These entities are expressed in terms of one function $\xi (x)$ and one parameter $\Delta E=E_{2}$-$E_{1}$. We show how the quantum numbers of both levels depend on properties of the function $\xi (x)$. Our approach does not need resorting to the technique of supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics but automatically generates both the potential and superpotential.
