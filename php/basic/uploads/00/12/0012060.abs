Title: Stability, Causality, and Lorentz and CPT Violation
Authors: Alan Kostelecky and Ralf Lehnert
Abstract: Stability and causality are investigated for quantum field theories incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. Explicit calculations in the quadratic sector of a general renormalizable lagrangian for a massive fermion reveal that no difficulty arises for low energies if the parameters controlling the breaking are small, but for high energies either energy positivity or microcausality is violated in some observer frame. However, this can be avoided if the lagrangian is the sub-Planck limit of a nonlocal theory with spontaneous Lorentz and CPT violation. Our analysis supports the stability and causality of the Lorentz- and CPT-violating standard-model extension that would emerge at low energies from spontaneous breaking in a realistic string theory.
