Title: On the PCT--Theorem in the Theory of Local Observables
Authors: H. J. Borchers and J. Yngvason
Abstract: We review the PCT-theorem and problems connected with its demonstration. We add a new proof of the PCT-theorem in the theory of local observables which is similar to that one of Jost in Wightman quantum field theory. We also look at consequences in case the PCT-symmetry is given on the algebraic level. At the end we present some examples which answer general questions and throw some light on open problems.
