Title: Type I Strings with F- and B-Flux
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Boris Kors and Dieter Lust
Abstract: We present non-supersymmetric toroidal compactifications of type I string theory with both constant background NSNS two-form flux and non-trivial magnetic flux on the various D9-branes. The non-vanishing B-flux admits four-dimensional models with three generations of chiral fermions in standard model like gauge groups. Additionally, we consider the orbifold T^4/Z_2, again with both kinds of background flux present, leading to non-supersymmetric as well as supersymmetric models in six dimensions. All models have T-dual descriptions as intersecting brane worlds.
