Title: High Energy Behavior of Wilson Lines
Authors: A. Dhar and Y. Kitazawa
Abstract: We investigate the high energy behavior of the correlation functions of the open Wilson lines in noncommutative gauge theory. We obtain a very simple physical picture that they are bound to form a group of closed Wilson loops. We prove our claim in the weak coupling region by perturbative analysis. We emphasize the importance of respecting the cyclic symmetry of the straight Wilson lines to compute the correlation functions. The implications for stringy calculation of the correlators are also discussed.
