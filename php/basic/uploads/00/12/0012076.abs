Title: Brane Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: S. F. King and D. A. J. Rayner
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for mediating supersymmetry breaking in Type I string constructions. The basic set-up consists of a system of three D-branes: two parallel D-branes, a matter D-brane and a source D-brane, with supersymmetry breaking communicated via a third D-brane, the mediating D-brane, which intersects both of the parallel D-branes. We discuss an example in which the first and second family matter fields correspond to open strings living on the intersection of the matter D-brane and mediating D-brane, while the gauge fields, Higgs doublets and third family matter fields correspond to open strings living on the mediating D-brane. As in gaugino mediated models, the gauginos and Higgs doublets receive direct soft masses from the source brane, and flavour-changing neutral currents are naturally suppressed since the first and second family squarks and sleptons receive suppressed soft masses. However, unlike the gaugino mediated model, the third family squarks and sleptons receive unsuppressed soft masses, resulting in a very distinctive spectrum with heavier stops, sbottoms and staus.
