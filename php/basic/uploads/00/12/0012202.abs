Title: Radion Stabilization by Brane Matter
Authors: Benjamin Grinstein and Detlef R. Nolte and Witold Skiba
Abstract: We find a static solution to Einstein's field equations on a five-dimensional orbifold with a compact S_1/Z_2 fifth direction and Poincare invariant 3+1 sections. The solution describes a theory with bulk cosmological constant and 3-branes at the orbifold fixed points which carry matter density and pressure in addition to tension. The radius of the fifth dimension is determined by the matter content of the branes. The ratio of the space and time components of the metric depends on the fifth coordinate. Thus, the speed of propagation of massless fields is path dependent. For example, bulk and brane fields propagate with different speeds.
