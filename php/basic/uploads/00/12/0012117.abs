Title: Exactly Solvable Three-body SUSY Systems with Internal Degrees of  Freedom
Authors: F. Cannata and M. Ioffe
Abstract: The approach of multi-dimensional SUSY Quantum Mechanics is used in an explicit construction of exactly solvable 3-body (and quasi-exactly-solvable $N$-body) matrix problems on a line. From intertwining relations with time-dependent operators, we build exactly solvable non-stationary scalar and $2\times 2$ matrix 3-body models which are time-dependent extensions of the Calogero model. Finally, we investigate the invariant operators associated to these systems.
