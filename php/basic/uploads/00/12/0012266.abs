Title: Charge and spin separation in the 1D Hubbard model
Authors: Vladimir E. Korepin and Itzhak Roditi
Abstract: We consider the repulsive Hubbard model in one dimension and show the different mechanisms present in the charge and spin separation phenomena for an electron, at half filling and bellow half filling. We also comment recent experimental results.
