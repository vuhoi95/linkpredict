Title: Vaccum Polarization for a Massless Scalar Field in the Global Monopole  Spacetime at Finite Temperature
Authors: F. C. Carvalho and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the effects produced by temperature in the renormalized vaccum expectation value of the square of the massless scalar field in the pointlike global monopole spacetime. In order to develop this calculation, we had to construct the Euclidean thermal Green function associated with this field in this background. We also calculate the high-temperature limit for the thermal average of the zero-zero component of the energy-momentum tensor.
