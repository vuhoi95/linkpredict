Title: Ricci-flat Metrics, Harmonic Forms and Brane Resolutions
Authors: M. Cvetic and G. W. Gibbons and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We discuss the geometry and topology of the complete, non-compact, Ricci-flat Stenzel metric, on the tangent bundle of S^{n+1}. We obtain explicit results for all the metrics, and show how they can be obtained from first-order equations derivable from a superpotential. We then provide an explicit construction for the harmonic self-dual (p,q)-forms in the middle dimension p+q=(n+1) for the Stenzel metrics in 2(n+1) dimensions. Only the (p,p)-forms are L^2-normalisable, while for (p,q)-forms the degree of divergence grows with |p-q|. We also construct a set of Ricci-flat metrics whose level surfaces are U(1) bundles over a product of N Einstein-Kahler manifolds, and we construct examples of harmonic forms there. As an application, we construct new examples of deformed supersymmetric non-singular M2-branes with such 8-dimensional transverse Ricci-flat spaces. We show explicitly that the fractional D3-branes on the 6-dimensional Stenzel metric found by Klebanov and Strassler is supported by a pure (2,1)-form, and thus it is supersymmetric, while the example of Pando Zayas-Tseytlin is supported by a mixture of (1,2) and (2,1) forms. We comment on the implications for the corresponding dual field theories of our resolved brane solutions.
