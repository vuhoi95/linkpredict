Title: 7-Branes and Higher Kaluza-Klein Branes
Authors: Ernesto Lozano-Tellechea and Tomas Ortin
Abstract: We present and study a new chain of 10-d T duality related solutions and their 11-d parents whose existence had been predicted in the literature based in U duality requirements in 4 d. The first link is the S dual of the D7-brane. The next link has 6 spatial worldvolume dimensions, it is charged w.r.t. the RR 7-form but depends only on 2 transverse dimensions since the third has to be compactified in a circle and is isometric and hence is similar in this respect to the KK monopole. The next link has 5 spatial worldvolume dimensions, it is charged w.r.t. the RR 6-form but depends only on 2 transverse dimensions since the 3rd and 4th have to be compactified in circles and are isometric and so on. All these solutions are identical when reduced over the p spatial worldvolume dimensions and preserve a 1/2 on the supersymmetries. Their masses depend on the square of the radii of the isometric directions, just as for the KK monopole. We give a general map of these branes and their duality relations and show how they must appear in the supersymmetry algebra.
