Authors: A. Gerhold and J. Grimstrup and H. Grosse and L. Popp and M. Schweda and R. Wulkenhaar
Abstract: We present the discussion of the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar $\phi^4$- theory on a noncommutative space. The Noether procedure is performed at the operator level. Additionally, the broken dilatation symmetry will be considered in a Moyal-Weyl deformed scalar field theory at the classical level.
