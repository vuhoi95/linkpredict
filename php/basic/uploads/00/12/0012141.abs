Abstract: We study brane-world preheating in massive chaotic inflationary scenario where scalar fields are confined on the 3-brane. Assuming that quadratic contribution in energy densities dominates the Hubble expansion rate during preheating, the amplitude of inflaton decreases slowly relative to the standard dust-dominated case. This leads to an efficient production of $\chi$ particles via nonperturbative decay of inflaton even if its coupling is of order $g=10^{-5}$. We also discuss massive particle creation heavier than inflaton, which may play important roles for the baryo- and lepto-genesis scenarios.
