Abstract: In the framework of a (2+1)-dimensional P-even massive Gross-Neveu model, an external magnetic field is shown to induce a parity breaking first order phase transition. Possibility of applying the results obtained to description of magnetic phase transitions in high-temperature superconductors is discussed.
