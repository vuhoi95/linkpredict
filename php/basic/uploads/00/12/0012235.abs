Title: On gravitational interaction of spin 3/2 Nambu-Goldstone fermion
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: A new gravitational interaction of spin 3/2 Nambu-Goldstone(N-G) fermion is constructed, which gives a new framework for the consistent gravitational coupling of spin 3/2 massless field. The action is invariant under a new global supersymmetry.
