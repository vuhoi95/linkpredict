Title: Holography and Phenomenology
Authors: Nima Arkani-Hamed and Massimo Porrati and Lisa Randall
Abstract: We examine various aspects of the conjectured duality between warped AdS$_5$ geometries with boundary branes and strongly coupled (broken) conformal field theories coupled to dynamical gravity. We also examine compactifications with 5-d gauge fields, in which case the holographic dual is a broken CFT weakly coupled to dynamical gauge fields in addition to gravity. The holographic picture is used to clarify a number of important phenomenological issues in these and related models, including the questions of black hole production, radius stabilization, early universe cosmology, and gauge coupling unification.
