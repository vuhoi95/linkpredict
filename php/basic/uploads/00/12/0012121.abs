Title: Goldstone-Soliton Interactions and Brane World Neutrinos
Authors: N. D. Lambert and P. C. West
Abstract: We discuss the interactions of Goldstone particles with solitonic states. We observe that, contrary to the familiar situation in the vacuum sector, the Goldstone particles can have non-derivative interactions with the solitons. This result is applied to brane physics and in particular leads to the possibility that neutrinos in brane world scenarios are Goldstone particles for broken supersymmetry.
