Title: Gravity localization on string-like defects in codimension two and the  AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Eduardo Ponton and Erich Poppitz
Abstract: We study the localization of gravity on string-like defects in codimension two. We point out that the gravity-localizing `local cosmic string' spacetime has an orbifold singularity at the horizon. The supergravity embedding and the AdS/CFT correspondence suggest ways to resolve the singularity. We find two resolutions of the singularity that have a semiclassical gravity description and study their effect on the low-energy physics on the defect. The first resolution leads, at long distances, to a codimension one Randall-Sundrum scenario. In the second case, the infrared physics is like that of a conventional finite-size Kaluza-Klein compactification, with no power-law corrections to the gravitational potential. Similar resolutions apply also in higher codimension gravity-localizing backgrounds.
