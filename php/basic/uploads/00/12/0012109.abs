Title: Twistor and "weak" gauge structures in the framework of quaternionic  analysis
Authors: Vladimir V. Kassandrov and Joseph A. Rizcallah
Abstract: The earlier proposed conditions of (bi)quaternionic differentiability are nonlinear, give rize to the 2-spinor and the self-dual gauge structures and may be considered as the it generating system of equations (GSE) with respect to the source-free Maxwell, Yang-Mills and eikonal equations. We present the general solution of the GSE in terms of twistor variables, analize its rather specific gauge symmetry and demonstrate the relation of GSE to the equations of shear-free null congruences and, consequently, - to effective metrics of Kerr- Shild type. The concept of particles as singularities of physical fields associated with the solutions of GSE is developed
