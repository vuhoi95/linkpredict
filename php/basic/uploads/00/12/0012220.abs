Title: On S-duality in (2+1)-Chern-Simons Supergravity
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and O. Obregon and C. Ramirez and M. Sabido
Abstract: Strong/weak coupling duality in Chern-Simons supergravity is studied. It is argued that this duality can be regarded as an example of superduality. The use of supergroup techniques for the description of Chern-Simons supergravity greatly facilitates the analysis.
