Title: Some Problems Concerning Interchange of Order of Integration in  Functional Integral Formalism of U(1) Gauge Field Theories
Authors: Wei-Min Sun and Xiang-Song Chen and Fan Wang
Abstract: We show that in the functional integral formalism of U(1) gauge field theory some formal manipulation such as interchange of order of integration can yield erroneous results. The example studied is analysed by Fubini theorem.
