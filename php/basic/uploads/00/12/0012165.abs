Title: Global p-Brane World: A New Approach to Stable Mass Hierarchy
Authors: Sei-Hoon Moon and Soo-Jong Rey and Yoon-Bai Kim
Abstract: We find a class of extremal black hole-like global p-brane in higher-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The region inside the p-brane horizon possesses all essential features required for the Randall-Sundrum-type brane world scenario. The set-up allows to interpret the horizon size as the compactification size in that the Planck scale is determined by the fundamental scale M* and the horizon size r_H via the familiar relation M_Pl^2 ~ M*^{2+n} r_{H}^n, and the gravity behaves as expected in a world with n-extra dimensions compactified with size r_H. Most importantly, a stable mass hierarchy between M_Pl and M* can be generated from topological charge of the p-brane and the horizon size r_H therein. We also offer a new perspective on various issues associated to the brane world scenarios including the cosmological constant problem.
