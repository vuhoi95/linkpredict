Abstract: The exceptional superalgebra $\D21a$ has been classified as a candidate conformal supersymmetry algera in two dimensions. We propose an alternative interpretation of it as an extended BFV-BRST quantisation superalgebra in 2D ($D(2,1;1) \simeq osp(2,2|2)$). A superfield realization is presented wherein the standard extended phase space coordinates can be identified. The physical states are studied via the cohomology of the BRST operator. Finally we reverse engineer a classical action corresponding to the algebraic model we have constructed, and identify the Lagrangian equations of motion.
