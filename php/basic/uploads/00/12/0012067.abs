Title: Finiteness of PST self-dual models
Authors: Oswaldo M. Del Cima and Olivier Piguet and Marcelo S. Sarandy
Abstract: The Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin model for describing chiral forms is considered at the quantum level. We study the ultraviolet and infrared behaviour of the model in two, four and six dimensions in the framework of algebraic renormalization. The absence of anomalies, as well as the finiteness, up to non-physical renormalizations, are shown in all dimensions analyzed.
