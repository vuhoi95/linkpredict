Title: D-branes in type I string theory
Authors: M. Frau and L. Gallot and A. Lerda and P. Strigazzi
Abstract: We review the boundary state description of D-branes in type I string theory and show that the only stable non-BPS configurations are the D-particle and the D-instanton. We also compute the gauge and gravitational interactions of the non-BPS D-particles and compare them with the interactions of the dual non-BPS states of the heterotic string, finding complete agreement.
