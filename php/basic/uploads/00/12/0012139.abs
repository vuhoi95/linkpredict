Abstract: We examine the boundary behaviour of the gauged N=(2,0) supergravity in D=3 coupled to an arbitrary number of scalar supermultiplets which parametrize a Kahler manifold. In addition to the gravitational coupling constant, the model depends on two parameters, namely the cosmological constant and the size of the Kahler manifold. It is shown that regular and irregular boundary conditions can be imposed on the matter fields depending on the size of the sigma model manifold. It is also shown that the super AdS transformations in the bulk produce the transformations of the N=(2,0) conformal supergravity and scalar multiplets on the boundary, containing fields with nonvanishing Weyl weights determined by the ratio of the sigma model and the gravitational coupling constants. Various types of (2,0) superconformal multiplets are found on the boundary and in one case the superconformal symmetry is shown to be realized in an unconventional way.
