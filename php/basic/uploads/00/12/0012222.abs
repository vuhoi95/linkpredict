Title: On Superconnections and the Tachyon Effective Action
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Harald Ita and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We propose a form of the effective action of the tachyon and gauge fields for brane-antibrane systems and non-BPS Dp-branes, written in terms of the supercurvature. Kink and vortex solutions with constant infinite gauge field strength reproduce the exact tensions of the lower-dimensional D-branes. We discuss the relation to BSFT and other models in the literature.
