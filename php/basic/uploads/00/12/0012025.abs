Title: On the asymptotic expansion of the solutions of the separated nonlinear  Schroedinger equation
Authors: A. A. Kapaev and V. E. Korepin
Abstract: Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (with the Schwarzian initial data) is important in nonlinear optics, Bose condensation and in the theory of strongly correlated electrons. The asymptotic solutions in the region $x/t={\cal O}(1)$, $t\to\infty$, can be represented as a double series in $t^{-1}$ and $\ln t$. Our current purpose is the description of the asymptotics of the coefficients of the series.
