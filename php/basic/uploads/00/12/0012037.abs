Title: Bosonic M Theory
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz and Leonard Susskind
Abstract: We conjecture that there exists a strong coupling limit of bosonic string theory which is related to the 26 dimensional theory in the same way that 11 dimensional M theory is related to superstring theory. More precisely, we believe that bosonic string theory is the compactification on a line interval of a 27 dimensional theory whose low energy limit contains gravity and a three-form potential. The line interval becomes infinite in the strong coupling limit, and this may provide a stable ground state of the theory. We discuss some of the consequences of this conjecture.
