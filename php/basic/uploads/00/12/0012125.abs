Title: Gravitational domain walls and p-brane distributions
Authors: I. Bakas and K. Sfetsos
Abstract: We review the main algebraic aspects that characterize and determine the domain wall solutions of maximal gauged supergravity in various spacetime dimensions by considering consistent truncations that retain a number of components in the diagonal of the coset space scalar manifold of the theory. Starting from the algebraic classification of domain walls in D=4 gauged supergravity, we also derive the corresponding solutions in D=5 and D=7 dimensions. From a higher dimensional point of view, these solutions describe the gravitatonal field, in the field theory limit, of a large number of M2-, D3- and M5-branes that are distributed on hypersurfaces in the transverse space to the branes. As a new result we employ a smearing procedure as well as various dualities to list the irreducible curves and the symmetry groups of p-brane distributions for all values of p that are of interest in current applications of string theory. Some emphasis is placed on the presentation of new results in the case of NS5-branes.
