Title: Living Inside the Horizon of the D3-Brane
Authors: Won Suk Bae and Y. M. Cho and Sei-Hoon Moon
Abstract: We consider a brane world residing in the interior region inside the horizon of the D3-brane. The horizon size then can be interpreted as the compactification size. The macroscopically large size of extra dimensions can be derived from the underlying string theory that has only one physical scale, {\it i.e.,} the string scale. Then, the hierarchy between the string scale and the Planck scale is provided by Ramon-Ramon charge of the D3-brane. This picture also offers a new perspective on various issues associated with the brane world scenarios including the cosmological constant.
