Title: Geometry of Reduced Supersymmetric 4D Yang-Mills Integrals
Authors: Z. Burda and B. Petersson and J. Tabaczek
Abstract: We study numerically the geometric properties of reduced supersymmetric non-compact SU(N) Yang-Mills integrals in D=4 dimensions, for N = 2,3, ..., 8. We show that in the range of large eigenvalues of the matrices A^mu, the original D-dimensional rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken and the dominating field configurations become one-dimensional, as anticipated by studies of the underlying surface theory. We also discuss possible implications of our results for the IKKT model.
