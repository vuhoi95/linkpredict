Title: Noncommutativity in Space and Primordial Magnetic Field
Authors: Anupam Mazumdar and Mohammad M. Sheikh-Jabbari
Abstract: In this paper we show that noncommutativity in spatial coordinates can generate magnetic field in the early Universe on a horizon scale. The strength of such a magnetic field depends on the number density of massive charged particles present at a given moment. This allows us to trace back the temperature dependence of the noncommutativity scale from the bounds on primordial magnetic field coming from nucleosynthesis.
