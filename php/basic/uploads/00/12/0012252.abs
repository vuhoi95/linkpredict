Title: Non-Minimally Coupled Massive Scalar Field in a 2D Black Hole: Exactly  Solvable Model
Authors: V. Frolov and A. Zelnikov
Abstract: We study a nonminimal massive scalar field in a 2-dimensional black hole spacetime. We consider the black hole which is the solution of the 2d dilaton gravity derived from string-theoretical models. We found an explicit solution in a closed form for all modes and the Green function of the scalar field with an arbitrary mass and a nonminimal coupling to the curvature. Greybody factors, the Hawking radiation, and $ < \phi^2 >^{ren} $ are calculated explicitly for this exactly solvable model.
