Title: E_(10), BE_(10) and Arithmetical Chaos in Superstring Cosmology
Authors: Thibault Damour and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: It is shown that the never ending oscillatory behaviour of the generic solution, near a cosmological singularity, of the massless bosonic sector of superstring theory can be described as a billiard motion within a simplex in 9-dimensional hyperbolic space. The Coxeter group of reflections of this billiard is discrete and is the Weyl group of the hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E$_{10}$ (for type II) or BE$_{10}$ (for type I or heterotic), which are both arithmetic. These results lead to a proof of the chaotic (``Anosov'') nature of the classical cosmological oscillations, and suggest a ``chaotic quantum billiard'' scenario of vacuum selection in string theory.
