Title: The Heterotic Dyonic Instanton
Authors: E. Eyras and P. K. Townsend and M. Zamaklar
Abstract: The static Yang-Mills-Higgs dyonic instanton is shown to have a non-vanishing, but anti-self-dual, angular momentum 2-form with skew eigenvalues equal to the electric charge; for large charge the angular momentum causes the instanton to expand into a hyper-spherical shell. A class of exact multi dyonic instantons is then found and then generalized to a new class of 1/4 supersymmetric, non-singular, stationary, exact solutions of the ten-dimensional supergravity/Yang-Mills theory. These self-gravitating dyonic instantons yield new heterotic string solitons, to leading order in the inverse string tension.
