Title: Quantum Violations of the Equivalence Principle in a Modified  Schwarzschild Geometry. Neutrino Oscillations
Authors: V. Bozza and G. Lambiase and G. Papini and G. Scarpetta
Abstract: Neutrino flavour oscillations are analyzed in a model in which particles experience an effective Schwarzschild geometry modified by maximal acceleration corrections. These imply a quantum violation of the equivalence principle. The corresponding shifts in the phase of the neutrino mass eigenstates are calculated and discussed.
