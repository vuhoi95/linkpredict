Title: Comment on stability of atoms and nuclei in multidimensional TeV scale  gravity
Authors: U. Guenther and A. Kuklov and A. Zhuk
Abstract: We discuss the stability of atoms and nucleons in the presence of multidimensional gravity characterized by the unified energy scale 1TeV. We point out that the multidimensional gravitational attraction can create additional bound states deep inside of atomic and nucleon constituents. These states would be characterized by sizes comparable to the TeV scale distance. We show that shallow gravity induced bound states between an electron and a quark are ruled out, because collapse processes in atoms to such bound states would occur on time scales which are in contradiction to current data on the stability of ordinary matter. The gravitational attraction may also produce diquark states, which should be considered in addition to those discussed in the literature. The estimates indicate that, for TeV scale gravity, the problem of UV divergencies and UV renormalization is crucial. Some universal renormalization mechanism should exist, which stabilizes atoms in the presence of multidimensional gravity.
