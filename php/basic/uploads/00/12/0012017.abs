Title: Exact late time Hawking radiation and the information loss problem for  evaporating near-extremal black holes

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the effects of gravitational backreaction for the late time Hawking radiation of evaporating near-extremal black holes. This problem can be studied within the framework of an effective one-loop solvable model on AdS_2. We find that the Hawking flux goes down exponentially and it is proportional to a parameter which depends on details of the collapsing matter. This result seems to suggest that the information of the initial state is not lost and that the boundary of AdS_2 acts, at least at late times, as a sort of stretched horizon in the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime.
