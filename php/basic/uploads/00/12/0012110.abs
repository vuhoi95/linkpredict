Title: Supersymmetry of RS bulk and brane
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Renata Kallosh and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We review the construction of actions with supersymmetry on spaces with a domain wall. The latter objects act as sources inducing a jump in the gauge coupling constant. Despite these singularities, supersymmetry can be formulated, maintaining its role as a square root of translations in this singular space. The setup is designed for the application in five dimensions related to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario. The space has two domain walls. We discuss the solutions of the theory with fixed scalars and full preserved supersymmetry, in which case one of the branes can be pushed to infinity, and solutions where half of the supersymmetries are preserved.
