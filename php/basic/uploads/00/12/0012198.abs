Title: Boundary String Field Theory of the DDbar System
Authors: Per Kraus and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We develop the boundary string field theory approach to tachyon condensation on the DDbar system. Particular attention is paid to the gauge fields, which combine with the tachyons in a natural way. We derive the RR-couplings of the system and express the result in terms of Quillen's superconnection. The result is related to an index theorem, and is thus shown to be exact.
