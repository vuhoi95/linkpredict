Title: The Non-commutative Brane World
Authors: Luigi Pilo and Antonio Riotto
Abstract: We propose a new higher-dimensional mechanism to localize scalar fields as well as fermionic and gauge fields. The underlying theory is a six-dimensional non-commutative field theory where non-commutativity is allowed along two extra infinite spatial dimensions and the four-dimensional brane is provided by a scalar soliton living in the non-commutative space. Making use of the powerful correspondence between non-commutative coordinates and operators on a single particle Hilbert space, we show that the non-commutative brane world admits localized chiral fermions and it ensures the localization of massless gauge fields. It may also give rise to a variety of different low-energy spectra since the localized zero mode may come along either with a discrete tower of degenerate heavy states or with a tower of Kaluza-Klein heavy states, or it may even be the only state in the low-energy spectrum.
