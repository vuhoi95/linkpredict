Title: Effect of spins on the quantum entropy of black holes
Authors: Jiliang Jing and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: By using the Newman-Penrose formalism and 't Hooft brick-wall model, the quantum entropies of the Kerr-Newman black hole due to the Dirac and electromagnetic fields are calculated and the effects of the spins of the photons and Dirac particles on the entropies are investigated. It is shown that the entropies depend only on the square of the spins of the particles and the contribution of the spins is dependent on the rotation of the black hole, except that different fields obey different statistics.
