Title: Traveling Faster than the Speed of Light in Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: Akikazu Hashimoto and N. Itzhaki
Abstract: We study various dynamical aspects of solitons in non-commutative gauge theories and find surprising results. Among them is the observation that the solitons can travel faster than the speed of light for arbitrarily long distances.
