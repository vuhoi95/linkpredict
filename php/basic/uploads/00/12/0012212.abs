Title: Quadratic s-Form Field Actions with Semi-bounded Energy
Authors: J. Fernando Barbero G. and Eduardo J. S. Villase√±or
Abstract: We give in this paper a partial classification of the consistent quadratic gauge actions that can be written in terms of s-form fields. This provides a starting point to study the uniqueness of the Yang-Mills action as a deformation of Maxwell-like theories. We also show that it is impossible to write kinetic 1-form terms that can be consistently added to other 1-form actions such as tetrad gravity in four space-time dimensions even in the presence of a Minkowskian metric background.
