Title: Newtonian Gravitons and D-brane Collective Coordinates in Wound String  Theory
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson and Alberto Guijosa and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: Recently it was shown that NCOS theories are part of a ten-dimensional theory known as Non-relativistic Wound string theory. We clarify the sense in which gravity is present in this theory. We show that Wound string theory contains exceptional unwound strings, including a graviton, which mediate the previously discovered instantaneous long-range interactions, but are negligible as asymptotic states. Unwound strings also provide the expected collective coordinates for the transverse D-branes in the theory. These and other results are shown to follow both from a direct analysis of the effect of the NCOS limit on the parent string theory, and from the worldsheet formalism developed by Gomis and Ooguri, about which we make some additional remarks. We also devote some attention to supergravity duals, and in particular show that the open and closed strings of the theory are respectively described by short and long strings on the supergravity side.
