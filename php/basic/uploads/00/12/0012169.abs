Title: Stable non-BPS D-branes and their classical description
Authors: M. Bertolini and A. Lerda
Abstract: We review how to describe the stable non-BPS D-branes of type II string theory from a classical perspective, and discuss the properties of the space-time geometry associated to these configurations. This is relevant in order to see whether and how the gauge/gravity correspondence can be formulated in non-conformal and non-supersymmetric settings.
