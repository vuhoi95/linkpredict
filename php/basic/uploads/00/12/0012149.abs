Title: Current Algebra Associated with Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories
Authors: S. Moghimi-Araghi and S. Rouhani and M. Saadat
Abstract: We propose a general frame work for deriving the OPEs within a logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT). This naturally leads to the emergence of a logarithmic partner of the energy momentum tensor within an LCFT, and implies that the current algebra associated with an LCFT is expanded. We derive this algebra for a generic LCFT and discuss some of its implications. We observe that two constants arise in the OPE of the energy-momentum tensor with itself. One of these is the usual central charge.
