Abstract: The construction of brane setups for the exceptional series E6,E7,E8 of SU(2) orbifolds remains an ever-haunting conundrum. Motivated by techniques in some works by Muto on non-Abelian SU(3) orbifolds, we here provide an algorithmic outlook, a method which we call stepwise projection, that may shed some light on this puzzle. We exemplify this method, consisting of transformation rules for obtaining complex quivers and brane setups from more elementary ones, to the cases of the D-series and E6 finite subgroups of SU(2). Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the stepwise procedure by appealing to Frobenius' theory of Induced Representations. Our algorithm suggests the existence of generalisations of the orientifold plane in string theory.
