Title: A Warped Supersymmetric Standard Model
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Alex Pomarol
Abstract: We study the breaking of supersymmetry in five-dimensional (5d) warped spaces, using the Randall-Sundrum model as a prototype. In particular, we present a supersymmetry-breaking mechanism which has a geometrical origin, and consists of imposing different boundary conditions between the fermions and bosons living in the 5d bulk. The scale of supersymmetry breaking is exponentially small due to the warp factor of the AdS metric. We apply this mechanism to a supersymmetric standard model where supersymmetry breaking is transmitted through the AdS bulk to matter fields confined on the Planck-brane. This leads to a predictable superparticle mass spectrum where the gravitino mass is $10^{-3}$eV and scalar particles receive masses at the one-loop level via bulk gauge interactions. We calculate the mass spectrum in full detail using the 5d AdS propagators. The AdS/CFT correspondence suggests that our 5d warped model is dual to the ordinary 4d MSSM with a strongly coupled CFT sector responsible for the breaking of supersymmetry.
