Title: World Sheet Logarithmic CFT in AdS Strings, Ghost-Matter Mixing and  M-theory
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Dimitri Polyakov
Abstract: We discuss several closely related concepts in the NSR formulation of superstring theory. We demonstrated that recently proposed NSR model for superstrings on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ is described by the world-sheet logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT). The origin of LCFT on a world-sheet is closely connected to the matter-ghost mixing in the structure of a brane-like vortex operators. We suggest a dynamical origin of M theory as a string theory with an extra dimension given by bosonised superconformal ghosts.
