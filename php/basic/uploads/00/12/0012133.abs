Title: Pressure, Resistance, and Current Activation of Anisotropic Compressible  Hall States
Authors: K. Ishikawa and N. Maeda
Abstract: Thermodynamic and electric properties of anisotropic compressible Hall states at higher Landau levels are studied using a mean field theory on the von Neumann lattice basis. It is shown that resistances agree with the recent experiments of anisotropic compressible states and the states have negative pressure. As implications, the collapse phenomena of the integer quantum Hall effect are discussed.
