Abstract: We discuss explicit examples of BPS solutions in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity with R^2-interactions. We demonstrate how to construct solutions by iteration. Generically, the presence of higher-curvature interactions leads to non-static spacetime line elements. We comment on the existence of horizons for multi-centered solutions.
