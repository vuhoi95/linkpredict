Title: Universal Properties in Low Dimensional Fermionic Systems and  Bosonization
Authors: L. E. Oxman and D. G. Barci and E. R. Mucciolo
Abstract: We analyze the universal transport behavior in 1D and 2D fermionic systems by following the unified framework provided by bosonization. The role played by the adiabatic transition between interacting and noninteracting regions is emphasized.
