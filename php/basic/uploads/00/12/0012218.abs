Title: How Noncommutative Gauge Theories Couple to Gravity
Authors: Yuji Okawa and Hirosi Ooguri
Abstract: We study coupling of noncommutative gauge theories on branes to closed string in the bulk. We derive an expression for the gauge theory operator dual to the bulk graviton, both in bosonic string theory and superstring theory. In either case, we find that the coupling is different from what was expected in the literature when the graviton is polarized in the noncommutative directions. In the case of superstring, the expression for the energy-momentum tensor is consistent with the way the bulk metric appears in the action for the noncommutative gauge theory. We also clarify some aspects of the correspondence between operators in the gauge theory and boundary conditions in the dual gravitational description.
