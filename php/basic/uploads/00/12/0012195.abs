Title: M-Fivebranes Wrapped on Supersymmetric Cycles
Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Nakwoo Kim and Daniel Waldram
Abstract: We construct supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theories arising when M-theory fivebranes wrap general supersymmetric cycles. The solutions are constructed in maximal D=7 gauged supergravity and then uplifted to D=11. Our analysis covers Kahler, special Lagrangian and exceptional calibrated cycles. The metric on the cycles are Einstein, but do not necessarily have constant curvature. We find many new examples of AdS/CFT duality, corresponding to the IR superconformal fixed points of the twisted field theories.
