Title: de Sitter Brane Gravity: from Close-Up to Panorama
Authors: Maulik K. Parikh and Sergey N. Solodukhin
Abstract: We find explicitly the induced graviton propagator on de Sitter branes embedded in various five-dimensional spacetimes; de Sitter branes in AdS and Minkowski space are particular cases. By studying the structure of the momentum-space propagator, we are able to extract interesting physics, much of which is qualitatively different from that of flat branes. We find that 1) there can be a set of graviton-like particles which mediate brane gravity at different scales; 2) localized gravity can exist even on de Sitter branes in Minkowski space; 3) Kaluza-Klein modes also contribute to conventional 4-D gravity for de Sitter branes in AdS; and 4) Newton's constant can vary considerably with scale. We comment on the implications for the effective cosmological constant.
