Abstract: A V-duality conjecture for noncommutative open string theories (NCOS) that result from decoupling D-branes in Lorentz-boost related backgrounds was put forward recently in hep-th/0006013. The aim of this paper is to test the Galilean nature of this conjecture in the gravity dual setup. We start with an (F, D3) bound state Lorentz-boosted along one D3-brane direction perpendicular to the F-string, and show that insisting a decoupled NCOS allows only infinitesimal Lorentz boosts. In this way, it is shown that the V-duality relates a family of NCOS by Galileo boosts. Starting with a Lorentz-boosted (D1,D3) bound state, we show that a similar V-duality works for noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories as well. In addition, we deduce by a holography argument that the running string tension, as a function of the energy scale, for NCOS (or NCYM) remains unchanged under V-duality.
