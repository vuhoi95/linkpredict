Title: Solitons on compact and noncompact spaces in large noncommutativity
Authors: El Mostapha Sahraoui and El Hassan Saidi
Abstract: We study solutions at the minima of scalar field potentials for Moyal spaces and torii in the large non-commutativity and interprete these solitons in terms of non-BPS D-branes of string theory. We derive a mass spectrum formula linking different D-branes together on quantum torii and suggest that it describes general systems of D-brane bound states extending the D2-D0 one. Then we propose a shape for the effective potential approaching these quasi-stable bound states. We give the gauge symmetries of these systems of branes and show that they depend on the quantum torii representations.
