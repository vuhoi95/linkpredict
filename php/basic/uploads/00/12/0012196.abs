Abstract: Fibrewise T-duality (Fourier-Mukai transform) for D-branes on an elliptic Calabi-Yau three-fold $X$ is seen to have an expected adiabatic form for its induced cohomology operation only when an appropriately twisted operation resp. twisted charge is defined. Some differences with the case of $K3$ as well as connections with the spectral cover construction for bundles on $X$ are pointed out. In the context of mirror symmetry Kontsevich's association of line bundle twists (resp. a certain 'diagonal' operation) with monodromies (esp. the conifold monodromy) is made explicit and checked for two example models. Interpreting this association as a relation between FM transforms and monodromies, we express the fibrewise FM transform through known monodromies. The operation of fibrewise duality as well as the notion of a certain index relevant to the computation of the moduli space of the bundle is transported to the sLag side. Finally the moduli space for D4-branes and its behaviour under the FM transform is considered with an application to the spectral cover.
