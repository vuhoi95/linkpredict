Title: Teleportation of general finite dimensional quantum systems
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: Teleportation of finite dimensional quantum states by a non-local entangled state is studied. For a generally given entangled state, an explicit equation that governs the teleportation is presented. Detailed examples and the roles played by the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces related to the sender, receiver and the auxiliary space are discussed.
