Title: Space-Time Foam Effects on Particle Interactions and the GZK Cutoff
Authors: John Ellis and N. E. Mavromatos and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: Modelling space-time foam using a non-critical Liouville-string model for the quantum fluctuations of D branes with recoil, we discuss the issues of momentum and energy conservation in particle propagation and interactions. We argue that momentum should be conserved exactly during propagation and on the average during interactions, but that energy is conserved only on the average during propagation and is in general not conserved during particle interactions, because of changes in the background metric. We discuss the possible modification of the GZK cutoff on high-energy cosmic rays, in the light of this energy non-conservation as well as the possible modification of the usual relativistic momentum-energy relation.
