Title: New results for the epsilon-expansion of certain one-, two- and  three-loop Feynman diagrams
Authors: A. I. Davydychev and M. Yu. Kalmykov
Abstract: For certain dimensionally-regulated one-, two- and three-loop diagrams, problems of constructing the epsilon-expansion and the analytic continuation of the results are studied. In some examples, an arbitrary term of the epsilon-expansion can be calculated. For more complicated cases, only a few higher terms in epsilon are obtained. Apart from the one-loop two- and three-point diagrams, the examples include two-loop (mainly on-shell) propagator-type diagrams and three-loop vacuum diagrams. As a by-product, some new relations involving Clausen function, generalized log-sine integrals and certain Euler--Zagier sums are established, and some useful results for the hypergeometric functions of argument 1/4 are presented.
