Title: Cherenkov radiation in a gravitational wave background
Authors: Alexander B. Balakin and Richard Kerner and Jose' P. S. Lemos
Abstract: A covariant criterion for the Cherenkov radiation emission in the field of a non-linear gravitational wave is considered in the framework of exact integrable models of particle dynamics and electromagnetic wave propagation. It is shown that vacuum interacting with curvature can give rise to Cherenkov radiation. The conically shaped spatial distribution of radiation is derived and its basic properties are discussed.
