Title: Quons in Relativistic Theories Must be Bosons or Fermions
Authors: Chi-Keung Chow and O. W. Greenberg
Abstract: The quon algebra describes particles, ``quons,'' that are neither fermions nor bosons using a label q that parametrizes a smooth interpolation between bosons (q = +1) and fermions (q = -1). We derive ``conservation of statistics'' relations for quons in relativistic theories, and show that in relativistic theories quons must be either bosons or fermions.
