Title: Kaluza-Klein Vortices
Authors: Vakif K. Onemli and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We study static vortex type solutions of pure gravity for $D \geq 4+1 $. Non-singular vortex solutions can be obtained by considering periodic Kaluza-Klein monopoles. We also show that away from the center of the vortices the space is described by the gravitational instantons derived from minimal surfaces.
