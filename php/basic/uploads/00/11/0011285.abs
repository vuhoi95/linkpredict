Title: Branes from Unstable Systems of Branes
Authors: Laurent Houart and Yolanda Lozano
Abstract: We discuss various aspects of the description of branes as topological solitons in unstable brane systems of higher dimensions. We first describe a classification of all the possible realisations of branes of M and type II theories as topological solitons of a brane-antibrane system. We then present a description of type IIB NS-NS p-branes in terms of topological solitons in systems of spacetime-filling NS9, anti-NS9 pairs and discuss the implications of these constructions in the description of BPS and non-BPS states in the strongly coupled Heterotic SO(32) theory. We finally present briefly the construction of a conjectured spacetime-filling non-BPS M10-brane, starting point for a brane descent construction of the branes of M-theory.
