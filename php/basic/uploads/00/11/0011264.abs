Title: On the supersymmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld action
Authors: E. A. Bergshoeff and M. de Roo and A. Sevrin
Abstract: We review an iterative construction of the supersymmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld action. We obtain the action through second order in the fieldstrength. Kappa-invariance fixes the ordenings which turn out to deviate from the symmetrized trace proposal.
