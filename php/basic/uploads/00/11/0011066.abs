Title: Alternative N=2 Supergravity in Five Dimensions with Singularities
Authors: Hitoshi Nishino and Subhash Rajpoot
Abstract: We present an alternative N=2 supergravity multiplet coupled to n copies of vector multiplets and n' copies of hypermultiplets in five dimensions. Our supergravity multiplet contains a single antisymmetric tensor and a dilaton, which are natural Neveu-Schwarz massless fields in superstring theory. The absence of the explicit Chern-Simons terms in our lagrangian deletes the non-trivial constraints on the couplings of vector multiplets in the conventional formulation. The scalars in the vector multiplets form the sigma-model for the coset SO(n,1) / SO(n), like those in the vector multiplets coupled to N=1 supergravity in nine dimensions, while the scalars in the hypermultiplets form that for the quaternionic Kahler manifold Sp(n',1) / Sp(n') X Sp(1). We also perform the gauging of the SO(2) subgroup of the Sp(1) = SL(2,R) automorphism group of N=2 supersymmetry. Our result is also generalized to singular 5D space-time as in the conventional formulation, as a preliminary for supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario.
