Title: Remarks on Inflation and Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Brian R. Greene and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We briefly discuss some possible cosmological implications of noncommutative geometry. While the noncommutativity we consider does not affect gravity, it can play an important role in the dynamics of other fields that are present in the early universe. We point out the possibility that noncommutativity may cause inflation induced fluctuations to become non-gaussian and anisotropic, and may modify the short distance dispersion relations.
