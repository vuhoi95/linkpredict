Title: Convex Functions and Spacetime Geometry
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Akihiro Ishibashi
Abstract: Convexity and convex functions play an important role in theoretical physics. To initiate a study of the possible uses of convex functions in General Relativity, we discuss the consequences of a spacetime $(M,g_{\mu \nu})$ or an initial data set $(\Sigma, h_{ij}, K_{ij})$ admitting a suitably defined convex function. We show how the existence of a convex function on a spacetime places restrictions on the properties of the spacetime geometry.
