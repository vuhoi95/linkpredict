Title: Non-commutative Geometry and the Higgs Masses
Authors: A. Catal and T. Dereli
Abstract: We study a non-commutative generalization of the standard electroweak model proposed by Balakrishna, Gursey and Wali [ Phys.Lett. B254(1991)430] that is formulated in terms of the derivations Der_2(M_3) of a three-dimensional representation of the su(2) Lie algebra of weak isospin. The linearized Higgs field equations and the scalar boson mass eigenvalues are explicitly given. A light Higgs boson with mass around 130 GeV together with four very heavy scalar bosons are predicted.
