Title: Supergravity couplings to Noncommutative Branes, Open Wilson Lines and  Generalised Star Products
Authors: S. R. Das and S. P. Trivedi
Abstract: Noncommutative gauge theories can be constructed from ordinary $U(\infty)$ gauge theories in lower dimensions. Using this construction we identify the operators on noncommutative D-branes which couple to linearized supergravity backgrounds, from a knowledge of such couplings to lower dimensional D-branes with no $B$ field. These operators belong to a class of gauge invariant observables involving open Wilson lines. Assuming a DBI form of the coupling we show, to second order in the gauge potential but to all orders of the noncommutativity parameter, that our proposal agrees with the operator obtained in terms of ordinary gauge fields by considering brane actions in backgrounds and then using the Seiberg-Witten map to rewrite this in terms of noncommutative gauge fields. Our result clarify why a certain {\it commutative} but {\it non-associative} ``generalized star product'' appears both in the expansion of the open Wilson line, as well as in string amplitude computations of open string - closed string couplings. We outline how our procedure can be used to obtain operators in the noncommutative theory which are holographically dual to supergravity modes.
