Authors: S. Yajima and Y. Higasida and K. Kawano and S. -I. Kubota
Abstract: By applying the covariant Taylor expansion method, the fifth lower coefficients the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel associated with a fermion of spin 1/2 in Riemann-Cartan space are manifestly given. These coefficients in Riemann-Cartan space is derived from those obtained in Riemannian space by simple replacements.
