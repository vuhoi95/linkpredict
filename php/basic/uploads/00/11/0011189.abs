Title: On the Beta Function for Anisotropic Current Interactions in 2D
Authors: B. Gerganov and A. LeClair and M. Moriconi
Abstract: By making use of current-algebra Ward identities we study renormalization of general anisotropic current-current interactions in 2D. We obtain a set of algebraic conditions that ensure the renormalizability of the theory to all orders. In a certain minimal prescription we compute the beta function to all orders.
