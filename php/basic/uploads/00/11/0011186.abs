Title: Classification of Conformality Models Based on Nonabelian Orbifolds
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: A systematic analysis is presented of compactifications of the IIB superstring on $AdS_5 \times S^5/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a non-abelian discrete group. Every possible $\Gamma$ with order $g \leq 31$ is considered. There exist 45 such groups but a majority cannot yield chiral fermions due to a certain theorem that is proved. The lowest order to embrace the nonSUSY standard $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ model with three chiral families is $\Gamma = D_4 \times Z_3$, with $g=24$; this is the only successful model found in the search. The consequent uniqueness of the successful model arises primarily from the scalar sector, prescribed by the construction, being sufficient to allow the correct symmetry breakdown.
