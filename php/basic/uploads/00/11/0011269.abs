Title: Dilaton Tadpoles, Warped Geometries and Large Extra Dimensions for  Non-Supersymmetric Strings
Authors: Ralph Blumenhagen and Anamaria Font
Abstract: We analyze the backreaction of dilaton tadpoles on the geometry of non-supersymmetric strings. After finding explicit warped solutions for a T-dual version of the Sugimoto model, we examine the possibility of realizing large extra dimension scenarios within the context of non-supersymmetric string models. Our analysis reveals an appealing mechanism to dynamically reduce the number of flat, non-compact directions in non-supersymmetric string theories.
