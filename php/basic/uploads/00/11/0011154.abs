Abstract: The coefficient of the Chern-Simons term in the effective action for massive Dirac fermions in three dimensions is computed by using the point-splitting regularization method. We show that in this framework no ambiguities arise. This is related to the fact that the point-splitting regularization does not introduce additional parity breaking effects, implementing one possible physical criterion in order to uniquely characterize the system.
