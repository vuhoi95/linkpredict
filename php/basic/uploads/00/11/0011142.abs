Title: Numerical Aspects of Bubble Nucleation
Authors: Surujhdeo Seunarine and Douglas W. McKay
Abstract: Bubble nucleation has been studied on lattices using phenomenological Langevin equations. Recently there have been theoretical motivations for using these equations. These studies also conclude that the simple Langevin description requires some modification. We study bubble nucleation on a lattice and determine effects of the modified Langevin equations.
