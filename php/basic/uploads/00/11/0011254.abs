Title: On Metric Perturbations in Brane-World Scenarios
Authors: Andrey Neronov and Ivo Sachs
Abstract: In this note we reconsider linearised metric perturbations in the one-brane Randall-Sundrum Model. We present a simple formalism to describe metric perturbations caused by matter perturbations on the brane and remedy some misconceptions concerning the constraints imposed on the metric and matter perturbations by the presence of the brane.
