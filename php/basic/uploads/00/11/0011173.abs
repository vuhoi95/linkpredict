Title: Norcor vs the Abominable Gauge Completion
Authors: Marcus T. Grisaru and Marcia E. Knutt
Abstract: We use normal coordinate methods to obtain the expansion with respect to fermionic coordinates of the 11-dimensional supermembrane action in a supergravity background. Likewise, expansions for various branes in other dimensions can be obtained. These methods allow a systematic and unambiguous expansion of the vielbein to any order in the fermionic coordinates and avoid the complications encountered in the gauge completion approach.
