Title: Non-invariant two-loop counterterms for the three-gauge-boson vertices
Authors: P. A. Grassi and T. Hurth and M. Steinhauser
Abstract: Some practical applications of algebraic renormalization are discussed. In particular we consider the two-loop QCD corrections to the three-gauge-boson vertices involving photons, Z and W bosons. For this purpose also the corresponding two-point functions have to be discussed. A recently developed procedure is used to analyze the breaking terms of the functional identities and explicit formulae for the universal counterterms are provided. Special attention is devoted to the treatment of infra-red divergences.
