Title: Orbifold boundary states from Cardy's condition
Authors: M. Billo' and B. Craps and F. Roose
Abstract: Boundary states for D-branes at orbifold fixed points are constructed in close analogy with Cardy's derivation of consistent boundary states in RCFT. Comments are made on the interpretation of the various coefficients in the explicit expressions, and the relation between fractional branes and wrapped branes is investigated for $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$ orbifolds. The boundary states are generalised to theories with discrete torsion and a new check is performed on the relation between discrete torsion phases and projective representations.
