Title: Noncommutative N=2 Strings
Authors: Alok Kumar and Aalok Misra and Kamal Lochan Panigrahi
Abstract: We analyze open and mixed sector tree-level amplitudes of N=2 strings in a space-time with (2,2) signature, in the presence of constant B field. The expected topological nature of string amplitudes in the open sector is shown to impose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding noncommutative field theory. In the mixed sector, we first compute a 3-point function and show that the corresponding field theory is written in terms of a generalized *-product. We also analyze a 4-point function (A_{oooc}) of the mixed sector in Theta ---> infinity limit.
