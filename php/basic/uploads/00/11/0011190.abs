Title: Fivebranes Wrapped On Associative Three-Cycles
Authors: Bobby S. Acharya and Jerome P. Gauntlett and Nakwoo Kim
Abstract: We construct supergravity solutions corresponding to fivebranes wrapping associative three-cycles of constant curvature in manifolds of G_2-holonomy. The solutions preserve 2 supercharges and are first constructed in D=7 gauged supergravity and then lifted to D=10,11. We show that the low-energy theory of M-fivebranes wrapped on a compact hyperbolic three-space is dual to a superconformal field theory in D=3 by exhibiting a flow to an AdS_4 region. For IIB-fivebranes wrapped on a three-sphere we speculate on a connection with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking of pure N=1 super Yang-Mills theory in D=3.
