Title: Glueball Masses for the Deformed Conifold Theory
Authors: Elena Caceres and Rafael Hernandez
Abstract: We obtain the spectrum of glueball masses for the N=1 non-conformal cascade theory whose supergravity dual was recently constructed by Klebanov and Strassler. The glueball masses are calculated by solving the supergravity equations of motion for the dilaton and the two-form in the deformed conifold background.
