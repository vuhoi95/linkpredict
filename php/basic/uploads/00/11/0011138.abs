Title: The m->0 limit for massive graviton in dS_4 and AdS_4. How to circumvent  the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity
Authors: Ian I. Kogan and Stavros Mouslopoulos and Antonios Papazoglou
Abstract: We show that, by considering physics in dS_4 or AdS_4 spacetime, one can circumvent the van Dam - Veltman - Zakharov theorem which requires that the extra polarization states of a massive graviton do not decouple in the massless limit. It is shown that the smoothness of the m->0 limit is ensured if the H (``Hubble'') parameter, associated with the horizon of the dS_4 or AdS_4 space, tends to zero slower than the mass of the graviton m.
