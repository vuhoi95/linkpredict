Title: Clifford algebras obtained by twisting of group algebras
Authors: H. Albuquerque and S. Majid
Abstract: We investigate the construction and properties of Clifford algebras by a similar manner as our previous construction of the octonions, namely as a twisting of group algebras of Z_2^n by a cocycle. Our approach is more general than the usual one based on generators and relations. We obtain in particular the periodicity properties and a new construction of spinors in terms of left and right multiplication in the Clifford algebra.
