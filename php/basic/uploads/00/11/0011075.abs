Title: Super-Hubble Nonlinear Perturbations During Inflation
Authors: Niayesh Afshordi and Robert Brandenberger
Abstract: We show that the non-linear evolution of long wavelength perturbations may be important in a wide class of inflationary scenarios. We develop a solution for the evolution of such nonlinear perturbations which is exact to first order in a gradient expansion. As a first application, we demonstrate that in single field models of inflation there can be no parametric amplification of super-Hubble modes during reheating. We consider the implications of the solution for recent discussions of the back-reaction effect of long wavelength perturbations on the background geometry, give a new derivation of the equation of motion of stochastic inflation, and demonstrate that if the (generalized) slow-rolling condition is not satisfied, then inevitably long wavelength vector modes for gravitational fluctuations will be generated.
