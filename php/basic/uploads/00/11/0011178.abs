Title: Cycles, submanifolds, and structures on normal bundles
Authors: C. Bohr and B. Hanke and D. Kotschick
Abstract: We give explicit examples of degree 3 cohomology classes not Poincare dual to submanifolds, and discuss the realisability of homology classes by submanifolds with Spin-C normal bundles.
