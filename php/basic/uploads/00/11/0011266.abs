Title: Large N limit of Calogero-Moser models and Conformal Field Theories
Authors: M. Cadoni and P. Carta and D. Klemm
Abstract: We discuss the large N limit of Calogero-Moser models for the classical infinite families of simple Lie algebras A_N, B_N, C_N and D_N. We show that the limit defines two different Conformal Field Theories with central charge c>1. The value of c and the dimension of the primary field are dictated by the underlying algebraic symmetries of the model.
