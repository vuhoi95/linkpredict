Title: Abelian and center gauge fixing in continuum Yang-Mills-Theory for  general gauge groups
Authors: H. Reinhardt and T. Tok
Abstract: A prescription for center gauge fixing for pure Yang-Mills theory in the continuum with general gauge groups is presented. The emergence of various types of singularities (magnetic monopoles and center vortices) appearing in the course of the gauge fixing procedure are discussed.
