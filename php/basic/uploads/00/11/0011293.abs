Abstract: In this talk, we present a parity-preserving QED3 model with spontaneous breaking of a local U(1)-symmetry. The breaking is accomplished by a potential of the phi^6-type. It is shown that a net attractive interaction appears in the Moeller scattering (s- and p-wave scatterings between two electrons) as mediated by the gauge field and a Higgs scalar. We show, by solving numerically the Schroedinger equation for both the scattering potentials (s- and p-wave), that in the weak-coupling regime only s-wave bound states appear, whereas in the strong-coupling regime s- and p-wave bound states show up. Also, we discuss possible applications of the model to the phenomenology of high-Tc superconductors and to the re-entrant superconductivity effect.
