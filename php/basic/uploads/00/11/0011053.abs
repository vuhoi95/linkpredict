Title: Quantum Deformations of Space-Time SUSY and Noncommutative Superfield  Theory
Authors: P. Kosinski and J. Lukierski and P. Maslanka
Abstract: We review shortly present status of quantum deformations of Poincar\'{e} and conformal supersymmetries. After recalling the $\kappa$-deformation of $\hbox{D=4}$ Poincar\'{e} supersymmetries we describe the corresponding star product multiplication for chiral superfields. In order to describe the deformation of chiral vertices in momentum space the integration formula over $\kappa$-deformed chiral superspace is proposed.
