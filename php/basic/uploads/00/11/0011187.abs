Abstract: A class of non abelian affine Toda models arising from the axial gauged two-loop WZW model is presented. Their zero curvature representation is constructed in terms of a graded Kac-Moody algebra. It is shown that the discrete multivacua structure of the potential together with non abelian nature of the zero grade subalgebra allows soliton solutions with non trivial electric and topological charges. The dressing transformation is employed to explicitly construct one and two soliton solutions and their bound states in terms of the tau functions. A discussion of the classical spectra of such solutions and the time delays are given in detail.
