Title: The global phase diagram of a modular invariant two dimensional  statistical model
Authors: G. Cristofano and D. Giuliano and G. Maiella
Abstract: A generalization of the Coulomb Gas model with modular SL(2, Z)-symmetry allows for a discrete infinity of phases which are characterized by the condensation of dyonic pseudoparticles and the breaking of parity and time reversal. Here we study the phase diagram of such a model by using renormalization group techniques. Then the symmetry SL(2,Z) acting on the two-dimensional parameter space gives us a nested shape of its global phase diagram and all the infrared stable fixed points. Finally we propose a connection with the 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory description of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.
