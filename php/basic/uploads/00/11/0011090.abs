Abstract: We analyse the noncommutative U(1) sigma model, which arises from the vacuum dynamics of the noncommutative charged tachyonic field. The sector of ``spherically symmetric'' excitations of the model is equivalent to a chain of rotators. Classical solutions for this model are found, which are static and ``spherically symmetric'' in noncommutative spatial dimensions. The limit of small noncommutativity reveals the presence of Polyakov vortices in the model. A generalisation of the model to q-deformed space, which may serve as a regularisation of the non-deformed model is also considered.
