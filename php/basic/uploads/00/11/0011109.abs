Title: Conformal field theory, boundary conditions and applications to string  theory
Authors: C. Schweigert and J. Fuchs and J. Walcher
Abstract: This is an introduction to two-dimensional conformal field theory and its applications in string theory. Modern concepts of conformal field theory are explained, and it is outlined how they are used in recent studies of D-branes in the strong curvature regime by means of CFT on surfaces with boundary.
