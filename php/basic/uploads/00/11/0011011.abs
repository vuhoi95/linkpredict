Title: Polarization Vectors, Doublet Structure and Wigner's Little Group in  Planar Field Theory
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Biswajit Chakraborty and Tomy Scaria
Abstract: We establish the equivalence of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca model to a doublet of Maxwell-Chern-Simons models at the level of polarization vectors of the basic fields using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. The analysis reveals a U(1) invariance of the polarization vectors in the momentum space. Its implications are discussed. We also study the role of Wigner's little group as a generator of gauge transformations in three space-time dimensions.
