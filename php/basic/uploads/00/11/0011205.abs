Title: Nielsen-Olesen vortices in noncommutative space
Authors: G. S. Lozano and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We construct an exact regular vortex solution to the self-dual equations of the Abelian Higgs model in non-commutative space for arbitrary values of $\theta$. To this end, we propose an ansatz which is the analogous, in Fock space, to the one leading to exact solutions for the Nielsen-Olesen vortex in commutative space. We compute the flux and energy of the solution and discuss its relevant properties.
