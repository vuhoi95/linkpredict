Title: Cosmological Constraints on Bulk Neutrinos
Authors: Kevork Abazajian and George M. Fuller and Mitesh Patel
Abstract: Recent models invoking extra spacelike dimensions inhabited by (bulk) neutrinos are shown to have significant cosmological effects if the size of the largest extra dimension is R > 1 fm. We consider effects on cosmic microwave background anisotropies, big bang nucleosynthesis, deuterium and Li-6 photoproduction, diffuse photon backgrounds, and structure formation. The resulting constraints can be stronger than either bulk graviton overproduction constraints or laboratory constraints.
