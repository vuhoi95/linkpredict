Title: Conformal Invariance and Quantum Aspects of Matter
Authors: Hossein Motavali and Hadi Salehi and Mehdi Golshani
Abstract: The vacuum sector of the Brans-Dicke theory is studied from the viewpoint of a non-conformally invariant gravitational model. We show that, this theory can be conformally symmetrized using an appropriate conformal transformation. The resulting theory allows a particle interpretation, and suggests that the quantum aspects of matter may be geometrized.
