Authors: R. R. Metsaev and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: We discuss superparticle and superstring dynamics in AdS_3 x S^3 supported by R-R 3-form background using light-cone gauge approach. Starting with the superalgebra psu(1,1|2) + psu(1,1|2) representing the basic symmetry of this background we find the light-cone superparticle Hamiltonian. We determine the harmonic decomposition of light-cone superfield describing fluctuations of type IIB supergravity fields expanded near AdS_3 x S^3 background and compute the corresponding Kaluza-Klein spectrum. We fix the fermionic and bosonic light-cone gauges in the covariant Green-Schwarz AdS_3 x S^3 superstring action and find the light-cone string Hamiltonian. We also obtain a realization of the generators of psu(1,1|2) + psu(1,1|2) in terms of the superstring 2-d fields in the light-cone gauge.
