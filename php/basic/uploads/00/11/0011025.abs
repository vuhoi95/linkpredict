Title: Regularization of Non-Linear Spinor Field Models by Discrete Symmetries
Authors: Bertfried Fauser and Heinz Dehnen
Abstract: We generalize a regularization method of Stumpf 1984 in the case of non-linear spinor field models to fourth order theories and to non-scalar interactions. The involved discrete symmetries can be connected with C,P,T transformations.
