Title: Geometrical aspects of superbrane dynamics
Authors: Paolo Pasti and Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin
Abstract: The geometrical (superembedding) approach is used as a tool for deriving from the worldvolume dynamics of superbranes field theoretical models exhibiting partial supersymmetry breaking. In this way we obtain nonlinear actions for Goldstone superfields associated with physical degrees of freedom of the superbranes.
