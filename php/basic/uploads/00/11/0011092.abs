Title: Scale Invariance and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Adel M. Awad and Clifford V. Johnson
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we show that the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) rotating (Kerr) black holes in five and seven dimensions provide us with examples of non-trivial field theories which are scale, but not conformally invariant. This is demonstrated by our computation of the actions and the stress-energy tensors of the four and six dimensional field theories residing on the boundary of these Kerr-AdS black holes spacetimes.
