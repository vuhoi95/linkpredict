Title: Background Independent Open String Field Theory and Constant B-Field
Authors: D. Nemeschansky and V. Yasnov
Abstract: We calculate the background independent action for bosonic and supersymmetric open string field theory in a constant B-field. We also determine the tachyon effective action in the presence of constant B-field.
