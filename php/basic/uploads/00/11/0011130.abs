Title: Rolling among G_2 vacua
Authors: H. Partouche and B. Pioline
Abstract: We consider topology-changing transitions between 7-manifolds of holonomy G_2 constructed as a quotient of CY x S^1 by an antiholomorphic involution. We classify involutions for Complete Intersection CY threefolds, focussing primarily on cases without fixed points. The ordinary conifold transition between CY threefolds descends to a transition between G_2 manifolds, corresponding in the N=1 effective theory incorporating the light black hole states either to a change of branch in the scalar potential or to a Higgs mechanism. A simple example of conifold transition with a fixed nodal point is also discussed. As a spin-off, we obtain examples of G_2 manifolds with the same value for the sum of Betti numbers b_2+b_3, and hence potential candidates for mirror manifolds.
