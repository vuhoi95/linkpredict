Title: Exact Solvability of Superintegrable Systems
Authors: Piergiulio Tempesta and Alexander V. Turbiner and Pavel Winternitz
Abstract: It is shown that all four superintegrable quantum systems on the Euclidean plane possess the same underlying hidden algebra $sl(3)$. The gauge-rotated Hamiltonians, as well as their integrals of motion, once rewritten in appropriate coordinates, preserve a flag of polynomials. This flag corresponds to highest-weight finite-dimensional representations of the $sl(3)$-algebra, realized by first order differential operators.
