Title: The Condensed Matter Physics of QCD
Authors: Krishna Rajagopal and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: Important progress in understanding the behavior of hadronic matter at high density has been achieved recently, by adapting the techniques of condensed matter theory. At asymptotic densities, the combination of asymptotic freedom and BCS theory make a rigorous analysis possible. New phases of matter with remarkable properties are predicted. They provide a theoretical laboratory within which chiral symmetry breaking and confinement can be studied at weak coupling. They may also play a role in the description of neutron star interiors. We discuss the phase diagram of QCD as a function of temperature and density, and close with a look at possible astrophysical signatures.
