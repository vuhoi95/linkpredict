Title: Neutrino-Induced Giant Air Showers in Large Extra Dimension Models
Authors: Ambar Jain and Pankaj Jain and Douglas W. McKay and John P. Ralston
Abstract: In models based on large extra dimensions where massive spin 2 exchange can dominate at high energies, the neutrino-proton cross section can rise to typical hadronic values at energies above 10^20 eV. The neutrino then becomes a candidate for the primary that initiates the highest energy cosmic ray showers. We investigate characteristics of neutrino-induced showers compared to proton-induced showers. The comparison includes study of starting depth, profile with depth, lateral particle distribution at ground and muon lateral distribution at ground level. We find that for cross sections above 20 mb there are regions of parameter space where the two types of showers are essentially indistinguishable. We conclude that the neutrino candidate hypothesis cannot be ruled out on the basis of shower characteristics.
