Title: Uniqueness of the asymptotic AdS3 geometry
Authors: M. Rooman and Ph. Spindel
Abstract: We explicitly show that in (2+1) dimensions the general solution of the Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant on a neigbourhood of timelike spatial infinity can be obtained from BTZ metrics by coordinate transformations corresponding geometrically to deformations of their spatial infinity surface. Thus, whatever the topology and geometry of the bulk, the metric on the timelike extremities is BTZ.
