Title: Electroweak Physics for Color Superconductivity
Authors: R. Casalbuoni and Z. Duan and F. Sannino
Abstract: We construct the effective theories describing the electroweak interactions for the low energy excitations associated with the color superconductive phases of QCD at high matter density. The main result, for the 3 flavor case, is that the quasiparticle Goldstone boson $\pi^0$ decay into two physical massless photons is identical to the zero density case once we use the new Goldstone decay constant and the modified electric charge $\widetilde{e}=e \cos\theta$, with $\tan\theta =2e/\sqrt{3}g_s$ and $g_s$ the strong coupling constant. For 2 flavors we find that the coupling of the quarks to the neutral vector boson $Z^0$ is modified with respect to the zero density case. We finally point out possible applications of our result to the physics of compact objects.
