Title: No van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov Discontinuity for Supergravity in AdS Space
Authors: P. A. Grassi and P. van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: Adding explicit mass terms for the spin 2 and spin 3/2 field of N=1 anti-de Sitter supergravity, the limit M --> 0 for these mass terms is smooth: there is no van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov mass discontinuity in the propagators when the cosmological constant is non-vanishing.
