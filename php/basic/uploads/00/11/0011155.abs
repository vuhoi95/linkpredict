Title: On the stability of the Quantum Hall soliton
Authors: Iosif Bena and Aleksey Nudelman
Abstract: In this note we investigate the stability of the classical ground state of the Quantum Hall Soliton proposed recently in hep-th/0010105 . We explore two possible perturbations which are not spherically symmetric and we find that the potential energy decreases in both case. This implies that the system either decays or is dynamically stabilized (because of the presence of magnetic fields). If one makes an extra assumption that in the real quantum treatment of the problem string ends and D0 branes move together (as electrons and vortices in the Quantum Hall effect), a static equilibrium configuration is possible.
