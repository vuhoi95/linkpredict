Title: Probing Some N=1 AdS/CFT RG Flows
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson and Kenneth J. Lovis and David C. Page
Abstract: We present the results of probing the ten dimensional type IIB supergravity solution corresponding to a renormalisation group flow of supersymmetric SU(n) Yang-Mills theory from pure gauge N=4 to N=1 with two massless adjoint flavours. The endpoint of the flow is an infrared fixed point theory, and because of this simplicity of the theory, the effective Lagrangian for the probe is very well-behaved, having no zeros or singularities in the tension, and a smooth potential, all of which we exhibit. Specialising to the locus of points where the potential vanishes, we also characterise a part of the Coulomb branch of the N=1 theory. The simplicity of the gauge theory physics allows us to isolate and emphasise a key holographic feature of brane probe physics which has wider applications in the study of geometry/gauge theory duals.
