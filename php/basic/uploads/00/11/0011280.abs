Abstract: The calculation of bound state properties using renormalization group techniques to compute the corresponding Regge trajectories is presented. In particular, we investigate the bound states in different charge sectors of a scalar theory with interaction (phi^dagger phi chi). The resulting bound state spectrum is surprisingly rich. Where possible we compare and contrast with known results of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation and, in the non-relativistic limit, with the corresponding Schr"odinger equation.
