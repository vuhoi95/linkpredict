Title: Some Issues in Noncommutative Solitons as D-branes
Authors: S. P. de Alwis and A. T. Flournoy
Abstract: We investigate and interpret a large class of soliton solutions found in noncommutative tachyon condensation. These constructions make extensive use of the idea that Dp-branes may be built out of lower dimensional branes. Finally we comment on a recently proposed solution generating technique.
