Title: Thermal fluctuations of a quantized massive scalar field in Rindler  background
Authors: R. Medina and E. S. Moreira and jr
Abstract: Thermal fluctuations for a massive scalar field in the Rindler wedge are obtained by applying the point-splitting procedure to the zero temperature Feynman propagator in a conical spacetime. Renormalization is implemented by removing the zero temperature contribution. It is shown that for a field of non vanishing mass the thermal fluctuations, when expressed in terms of the local temperature, do not have Minkowski form. As a by product, Minkowski vacuum fluctuations seen by an uniformly accelerated observer are determined and confronted with the literature.
