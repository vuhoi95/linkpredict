Title: Quantum Jacobi fields in Hamiltonian mechanics
Authors: G. Giachetta and L. Mangiarotti and G. Sardanashvily
Abstract: Jacobi fields of classical solutions of a Hamiltonian mechanical system are quantized in the framework of vertical-extended Hamiltonian formalism. Quantum Jacobi fields characterize quantum transitions between classical solutions.
