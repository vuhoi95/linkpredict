Title: Homological mirror symmetry and torus fibrations
Authors: Maxim Kontsevich and Yan Soibelman
Abstract: In this paper we discuss two major conjectures in Mirror Symmetry: Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture about torus fibrations, and the homological mirror conjecture (about an equivalence of the Fukaya category of a Calabi-Yau manifold and the derived category of coherent sheaves on the dual Calabi-Yau manifold). Our point of view on the origin of torus fibrations is based on the standard differential-geometric picture of collapsing Riemannian manifolds as well as analogous considerations for Conformal Field Theories. It seems to give a description of mirror manifolds much more transparent than the one in terms of D-branes. Also we make an attempt to prove the homological mirror conjecture using the torus fibrations. In the case of abelian varieties, and for a large class of Lagrangian submanifolds, we obtain an identification of Massey products on the symplectic and holomorphic sides. Tools used in the proof are of a mixed origin: not so classical Morse theory, homological perturbation theory and non-archimedean analysis.
