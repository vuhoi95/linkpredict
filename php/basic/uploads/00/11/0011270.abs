Title: The mass of asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times
Authors: Piotr T. Chrusciel and Gabriel Nagy
Abstract: We give a definition of mass for spacelike hypersurfaces in space-times with metrics which are asymptotic to the anti-de Sitter one, or to a class of generalizations thereof. We present the results of gr-qc/0110014 which show that our definition provides a geometric invariant for a spacelike hypersurface embedded in a space-time. Some further global invariants are also given.
