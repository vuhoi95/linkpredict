Title: Non-Gaussian Effects on Domain Growth
Authors: Sang Pyo Kim and F. C. Khanna
Abstract: The vacuum two-point function is calculated beyond the Gaussian approximation during the second order phase transition. It is found that the correlation function is dominated by the Gaussian term immediately after the phase transition but later is taken over by non-Gaussian terms as the spinodal instability continues. The non-Gaussian effects lead to larger size of domains and may imply a smaller density of topological defects than that predicted by the Hartree-Fock approximation.
