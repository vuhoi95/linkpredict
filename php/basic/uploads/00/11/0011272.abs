Title: The Challenge of Light-Front Quantisation: Recent Results
Authors: Victor T. Kim and Victor A. Matveev and Grigorii B. Pivovarov and James P. Vary
Abstract: We explain what is the challenge of light-front quantisation, and how we can now answer it because of recent progress in solving the problem of zero modes in the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. We also give a description of the light-front Hamiltonian for SU(2) finite volume gluodynamics resulting from this recent solution to the problem of light-front zero modes.
