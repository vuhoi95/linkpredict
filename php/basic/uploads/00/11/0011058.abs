Title: SUSY Breaking through Compactification
Authors: M. Sakamoto and M. Tachibana and K. Takenaga
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The existence of extra dimensions with nontrivial topology plays an important role. We investigate new features resulting from this mechanism. One noteworthy feature is that there exists a phase in which the translational invariance for the compactified directions is broken spontaneously. The mechanism we propose also yields quite different vacuum structures for models with different global symmetries.
