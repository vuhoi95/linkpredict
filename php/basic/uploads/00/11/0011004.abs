Title: Polynomial Heisenberg algebras and higher order supersymmetry
Authors: David J. Fernandez C. and Veronique Hussin
Abstract: It is shown that the higher order supersymmetric partners of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian provide the simplest non-trivial realizations of the polynomial Heisenberg algebras. A linearized version of the corresponding annihilation and creation operator leads to a Fock representation which is the same as for the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
