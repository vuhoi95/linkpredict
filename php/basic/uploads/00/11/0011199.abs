Title: Percolation and the existence of a soft phase in the classical  Heisenberg model
Authors: Adrian Patrascioiu and Erhard Seiler
Abstract: We present the results of a numerical investigation of percolation properties in a version of the classical Heisenberg model. In particular we study the percolation properties of the subsets of the lattice corresponding to equatorial strips of the target manifold ${\cal S}^2$. As shown by us several years ago, this is relevant for the existence of a massless phase of the model. Our investigation yields strong evidence that such a massless phase does indeed exist. It is further shown that this result implies lack of asymptotic freedom in the massive continuum limit. A heuristic estimate of the transition temperature is given which is consistent with the numerical data.
