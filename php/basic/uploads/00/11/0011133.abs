Title: Soft Resummation of Quark Anomalous Dimensions and Coefficient Functions  in MS-bar Factorization
Authors: Simon Albino and Richard D. Ball
Abstract: The asymptotic behaviour at large N of the MS-bar quark anomalous dimensions is derived to all orders assuming only MS-bar factorization and standard results for the exponentiation of soft logarithms in the quark initiated bare cross sections for deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan. The result is then used to write the MS-bar quark coefficient functions in a form in which all terms of $O(\ln^m N)$ are resummed.
