Title: Anomaly-Induced Effective Action and Inflation
Authors: J. C. Fabris and A. M. Pelinson and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: In the early Universe matter can be described as a conformal invariant ultra-relativistic perfect fluid, which does not contribute, on classical level, to the evolution of the isotropic and homogeneous metric. If we suppose that there is some desert in the particle spectrum just below the Planck mass, then the effect of conformal trace anomaly is dominating at the corresponding energies. With some additional constraints on the particle content of the underlying gauge model (which favor extended or supersymmetric versions of the Standard Model rather than the minimal one), one arrives at the stable inflation. We review the model and report about the calculation of the gravitational waves on the background of the anomaly-induced inflation. The result for the perturbation spectrum is close to the one for the conventional inflaton model, and is in agreement with the existing Cobe data (see also [hep-th/0009197]).
