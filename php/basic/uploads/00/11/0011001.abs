Abstract: Using the Vafa-Witten twisted version of N=4 Super Yang-Mills a subset of the supercharges actually relevant for the nonrenormalization properties of the theory is identified. In particular, a relationship between the gauge-fixed action and the chiral primary operator tr(\phi)^2 is worked out. This result can be understood as an off-shell extension of the reduction formula introduced by Intriligator.
