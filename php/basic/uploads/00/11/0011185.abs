Title: Stable Non-BPS States and Their Holographic Duals
Authors: Sunil Mukhi and Nemani V. Suryanarayana
Abstract: Stable non-BPS states can be constructed and studied in a variety of contexts in string theory. Here we review some interesting constructions that arise from suspended and wrapped branes. We also exhibit some stable non-BPS states that have holographic duals.
