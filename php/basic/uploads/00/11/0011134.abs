Abstract: We present numerical simulations of fragmentation of the Affleck-Dine condensate in two spatial dimensions. We argue analytically that the final state should consist of both Q-balls and anti-Q-balls in a state of maximum entropy, with most of the balls small and relativistic. Such a behaviour is found in simulations on a 100x100 lattice with cosmologically realistic parameter values. During fragmentation process, we observe filament-like texture in the spatial distribution of charge. The total charge in Q-balls is found to be almost equal to the charge in anti-Q-balls and typically orders of magnitude larger than charge asymmetry. Analytical considerations indicate that, apart from geometrical factors, the results of the simulated two dimensional case should apply also to the fully realistic three dimensional case.
