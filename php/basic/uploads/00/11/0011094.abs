Title: Matrix Model, Noncommutative Gauge Theory and the Tachyon Potential
Authors: Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: The D2brane-anti-D2brane system is described in the framework of BFSS Matrix model and noncommutative (NC) gauge theory. The physical spectrum of fields is found by appropriate gauge fixing. The exact tachyon potential is computed in terms of these variables and an exact description of tachyon condensation provided. We exhibit multiple vortex production with increasing topological charge and interpret this as gradual conversion of the brane-antibrane system to $D0$ branes. The entire analysis is carried out using the known hamiltonian of the Matrix model, which is equivalent to the hamiltonian of the NC gauge theory. We identify the supersymmetric ground state of this hamiltonian with the tachyonic vacuum; Sen's conjecture about the latter follows simply from this identification. We also find two types of closed string excitations, solitonic (a la Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde) as well as perturbative, around the tachyonic vacuum.
