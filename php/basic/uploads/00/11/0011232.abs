Title: Massive Schwinger model and its confining aspects on curved space-time
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and H. Mohseni Sadjadi
Abstract: Using a covariant method to regularize the composite operators, we obtain the bosonized action of the massive Schwinger model on a classical curved background. Using the solution of the bosonic effective action, the energy of two static external charges with finite and large distance separation on a static curved space-time is obtained. The confining behavior of this model is also explicitly discussed.
