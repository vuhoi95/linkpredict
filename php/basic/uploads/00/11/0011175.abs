Title: Gaussian and Mean Field Approximations for Reduced Yang-Mills Integrals
Authors: Satsuki Oda and Fumihiko Sugino
Abstract: In this paper, we consider bosonic reduced Yang-Mills integrals by using some approximation schemes, which are a kind of mean field approximation called Gaussian approximation and its improved version. We calculate the free energy and the expectation values of various operators including Polyakov loop and Wilson loop. Our results nicely match to the exact and the numerical results obtained before. Quite good scaling behaviors of the Polyakov loop and of the Wilson loop can be seen under the 't Hooft like large $N$ limit for the case of the loop length smaller. Then, simple analytic expressions for the loops are obtained. Furthermore, we compute the Polyakov loop and the Wilson loop for the case of the loop length sufficiently large, where with respect to the Polyakov loop there seems to be no known results in appropriate literatures even in numerical calculations. The result of the Wilson loop exhibits a strong resemblance to the result simulated for a few smaller values of $N$ in the supersymmetric case.
