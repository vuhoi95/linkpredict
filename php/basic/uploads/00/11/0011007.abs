Title: Scale Invariance in a Non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Matter Model
Authors: J. L. Acebal and D. H. T. Franco
Abstract: The general method of reduction in the number of coupling parameters is applied in a Chern-Simons-matter model with several independent couplings. We claim that considering the asymptotic region, and expressing all dimensionless coupling parameters as functions of the Chern-Simons coupling, it is possible to show that all $\beta$-functions vanish to any order of perturbative series. Therefore, the model is asymptotically scale invariant.
