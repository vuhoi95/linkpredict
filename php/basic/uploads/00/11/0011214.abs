Authors: J. Lukierski and P. C. Stichel and W. J. Zakrzewski
Abstract: The model of nonrelativistic particles coupled to nonstandard (2+1)-gravity [1] is extended to include Abelian or non-Abelian charges coupled to Chern-Simons gauge fields. Equivalently, the model may be viewed as describing the (Abelian or non-Abelian) anyonic dynamics of Chern-Simons particles coupled, in a reparametrization invariant way, to a translational Chern-Simons action. The quantum two-body problem is described by a nonstandard Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a noninteger angular momentum depending on energy as well as particle charges. Some numerical results describing the modification of the energy levels by these charges in the confined regime are presented. The modification involves a shift as well as splitting of the levels.
