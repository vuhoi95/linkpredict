Title: Hairy Black Holes, Horizon Mass and Solitons
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Alejandro Corichi and Daniel Sudarsky
Abstract: Properties of the horizon mass of hairy black holes are discussed with emphasis on certain subtle and initially unexpected features. A key property suggests that hairy black holes may be regarded as `bound states' of ordinary black holes without hair and colored solitons. This model is then used to predict the qualitative behavior of the horizon properties of hairy black holes, to provide a physical `explanation' of their instability and to put qualitative constraints on the end point configurations that result from this instability. The available numerical calculations support these predictions. Furthermore, the physical arguments are robust and should be applicable also in more complicated situations where detailed numerical work is yet to be carried out.
