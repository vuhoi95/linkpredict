Title: Holographic renormalization group and conformal anomaly for AdS_9/CFT_8  correspondence
Authors: Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov and Sachiko Ogushi
Abstract: Holographic Renormalization Group (RG) in nine dimensions is considered. The d8 holographic conformal anomaly is found. It should correspond to d8 CFT in AdS_9/CFT_8 correspondence. The comparison of holographic and QFT anomalies in d8 de Sitter space is done. It may give the indication for rigorous AdS_9/CFT_8 correspondence proposal.
