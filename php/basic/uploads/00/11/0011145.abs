Title: The Lax pairs for elliptic C_n and BC_n Ruijsenaars-Schneider models and  their spectral curves
Authors: Kai Chen and Bo-yu Hou and Wen-Li Yang
Abstract: We study the elliptic C_n and BC_n Ruijsenaars-Schneider models which is elliptic generalization of system given in hep-th/0006004. The Lax pairs for these models are constructed by Hamiltonian reduction technology. We show that the spectral curves can be parameterized by the involutive integrals of motion for these models. Taking nonrelativistic limit and scaling limit, we verify that they lead to the systems corresponding to Calogero-Moser and Toda types.
