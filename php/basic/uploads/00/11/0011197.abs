Title: Integrable Many-Body Systems and Gauge Theories
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Mironov
Abstract: The review studies connections between integrable many-body systems and gauge theories. It is shown how the degrees of freedom in integrable systems are related with topological degrees of freedom in gauge theories. The relations between families of integrable systems and N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories are described. It is explained that the degrees of freedom in the many-body systems can be identified with collective coordinates of D-branes, solitons in string theory.
