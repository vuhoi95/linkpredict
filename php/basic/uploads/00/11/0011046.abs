Title: The Spectrum of N=3 String Theory on AdS_3 x G/H
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Amit Giveon and Assaf Shomer
Abstract: We continue the study of string theory on AdS_3 x SU(3)/U(1) and AdS_3 x SO(5)/SO(3). We compute the spacetime spectrum of the N=3 supersymmetric dual CFT using worldsheet techniques. The spectrum of chiral primaries coincides for the two models. Unlike N=4 theories, the building block of the symmetric product in spacetime (corresponding to a single long string) is not by itself in the moduli space of a symmetric product.
