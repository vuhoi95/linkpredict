Title: Electric-Magnetic Duality in QED Effective Action
Authors: W. S. Bae and Y. M. Cho and D. G. Pak
Abstract: Recently we have obtained a non-perturbative but convergent series expression of the one loop effective action of QED, and discussed the renormalization of the effective action. In this paper we establish the electric-magnetic duality in the quantum effective action.
