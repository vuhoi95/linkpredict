Title: Static Solution in Source-Free SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: X. -J. Wang and M. -L. Yan
Abstract: We show that a non-trivial topological effect breaks the conformal invariance of pure Yang-Mills theory. Thus it is possible that classic particle-like solutions exists in pure non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory. We find a static, non-singular solution in source-free SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space. This solution is a stable soliton characterized by non-trivial topology and imaginary $A_0^a$, i.e., $A_0^aA_0^a<0$. It yields hermitian Hamilton, and finite, positive energy.
