Title: Noncommutative scalar solitons: existence and nonexistence
Authors: B. Durhuus and T. Jonsson and R. Nest
Abstract: We study the variational equations for solitons in noncommutative scalar field theories in an even number of spatial dimensions. We prove the existence of spherically symmetric solutions for a sufficiently large noncommutativity parameter $\theta$ and we prove the absence of spherically symmetric solutions for small $\theta$.
