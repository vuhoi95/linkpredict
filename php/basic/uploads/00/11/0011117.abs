Title: On the String-Theoretic Euler Number of 3-dimensional A-D-E  Singularities
Authors: Dimitrios I. Dais and Marko Roczen
Abstract: The string-theoretic E-functions E_{str}(X;u,v) of normal complex varieties X having at most log-terminal singularities are defined by means of snc-resolutions. We give a direct computation of them in the case in which X is the underlying space of the 3-dimensional A-D-E singularities by making use of a canonical resolution process. Moreover, we compute the string-theoretic Euler number for several compact complex threefolds with prescribed A-D-E singularities.
