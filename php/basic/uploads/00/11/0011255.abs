Title: The Standard Model: Physical Basis and Scattering Experiments
Authors: H. Spiesberger and M. Spira and P. M. Zerwas
Abstract: We present an introduction into the basic concepts of the Standard Model, i.e. the gauge theories of the forces and the Higgs mechanism for generating masses. The Glashow-Salam-Weinberg theory of the electroweak interactions will be described in detail. The key experiments are reviewed, including the precision tests at high energies. Finally, the limitations and possible physics areas beyond the Standard Model are discussed.
