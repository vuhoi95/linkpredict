Title: Braided Hopf Algebras and Differential Calculus
Authors: M. Schlieker and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We show that the algebra of the bicovariant differential calculus on a quantum group can be understood as a projection of the cross product between a braided Hopf algebra and the quantum double of the quantum group. The resulting super-Hopf algebra can be reproduced by extending the exterior derivative to tensor products.
