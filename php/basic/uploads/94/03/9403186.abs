Title: Exact Four-Dimensional Dyonic Black Holes and Bertotti-Robinson  Spacetimes in String Theory
Authors: David A. Lowe and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Conformal field theories corresponding to two-dimensional electrically charged black holes and to two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with a covariantly constant electric field are simply constructed as $SL(2,R)/Z$ WZW coset models. The two-dimensional electrically charged black holes are related by Kaluza-Klein reduction to the 2+1-dimensional rotating black hole of Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, and our construction is correspondingly related to its realization as a WZW model. Four-dimensional spacetime solutions are obtained by tensoring these two-dimensional theories with $SU(2)/Z(m)$ coset models. These describe a family of dyonic black holes and the Bertotti--Robinson universe.
