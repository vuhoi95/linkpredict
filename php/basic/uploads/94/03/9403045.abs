Title: Quantum States of String-Inspired Lineal Gravity
Authors: D. Cangemi and R. Jackiw
Abstract: We construct quantum states for a (1+1) dimensional gravity-matter model that is also a gauge theory based on the centrally extended Poincar\'e group. Explicit formulas are found, which exhibit interesting structures. For example wave functionals are gauge invariant except for a gauge non-invariant phase factor that is the Kirillov-Kostant 1-form on the (co-) adjoint orbit of the group. However no evidence for gravity-matter forces is found.
