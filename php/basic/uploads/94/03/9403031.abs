Title: Dilaton Production in String Cosmology
Authors: M. Gasperini and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We consider the coupled evolution of density, (scalar) metric and dilaton perturbations in the transition from a ``stringy" phase of growing curvature and gravitational coupling to the standard radiation-dominated cosmology. We show that dilaton production, with a spectrum tilted towards large frequencies, emerges as a general property of this scenario. We discuss the frame-independence of the dilaton spectrum and of the inflationary properties of the metric background by using, as model of source, a pressureless gas of weakly interacting strings, which is shown to provide an approximate but consistent solution to the full system of background equations and string equations of motion. We combine various cosmological bounds on a growing dilaton spectrum with the bound on the dilaton mass obtained from tests of the equivalence principle, and we find allowed windows compatible with a universe presently dominated by a relic background of dilatonic dark matter.
