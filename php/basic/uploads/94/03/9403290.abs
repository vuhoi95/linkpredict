Title: Production of Kaluza-Klein States at Future Colliders
Authors: I. Antoniadis and K. Benakli and M. Quir√≥s
Abstract: Perturbative breaking of supersymmetry in four-dimensional string theories predict in general the existence of new large dimensions at the TeV scale. Such large dimensions lie in a domain of energies accessible to particle accelerators. Their main signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein excitations which can be detected at future colliders. We study this possibility for hadron colliders (TEVATRON, LHC) and $e^+ e^-$ colliders (LEP-200, NLC-500).
