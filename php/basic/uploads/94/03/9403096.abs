Title: Lectures on Mirror Symmetry
Authors: S. Hosono and A. Klemm and S. Theisen
Abstract: We give an introduction to mirror symmetry of strings on Calabi-Yau manifolds with an emphasis on its applications e.g. for the computation of Yukawa couplings. We introduce all necessary concepts and tools such as the basics of toric geometry, resolution of singularities, construction of mirror pairs, Picard-Fuchs equations, etc. and illustrate all of this on a non-trivial example. Extended version of a lecture given at the Third Baltic Student Seminar, Helsinki September 1993
