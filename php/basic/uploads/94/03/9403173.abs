Title: Nonabelian Bosonization as Duality
Authors: C. P. Burgess and F. Quevedo
Abstract: Applying the techniques of nonabelian duality to a system of Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions we obtain the level-one Wess-Zumino-Witten model as the dual theory. This makes nonabelian bosonization a particular case of a nonabelian duality transformation, generalizing our previous result (hep-th/9401105) for the abelian case.
