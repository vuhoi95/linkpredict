Title: Equivariance, BRST and Superspace
Authors: Antti J. Niemi and O. Tirkkonen
Abstract: The structure of equivariant cohomology in non-abelian localization formulas and topological field theories is discussed. Equivariance is formulated in terms of a nilpotent BRST symmetry, and another nilpotent operator which restricts the BRST cohomology onto the equivariant, or basic sector. A superfield formulation is presented and connections to reducible (BFV) quantization of topological Yang-Mills theory are discussed.
