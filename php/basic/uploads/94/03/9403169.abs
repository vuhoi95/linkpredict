Title: Classical Electrodynamics with Dual Potentials
Authors: M. Baker and James S. Ball and F. Zachariasen
Abstract: We present Dirac's method for using dual potentials to solve classical electrodynamics for an oppositely charged pair of particles, with a view to extending these techniques to non-Abelian gauge theories.
