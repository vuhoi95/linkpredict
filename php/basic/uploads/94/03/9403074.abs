Title: Axial anomalies in gauge theory by exact renormalization group method
Authors: M. Bonini and M. D'Attanasio and G. Marchesini
Abstract: The global chiral symmetry of a $SU(2)$ gauge theory is studied in the framework of renormalization group (RG). The theory is defined by the RG flow equations in the infrared cutoff $\L$ and the boundary conditions for the relevant couplings. The physical theory is obtained at $\L=0$. In our approach the symmetry is implemented by choosing the boundary conditions for the relevant couplings not at the ultraviolet point $\L=\L_0\to\infty$ but at the physical value $\L=0$. As an illustration, we compute the triangle axial anomalies.
