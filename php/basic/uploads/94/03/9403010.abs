Title: Finite Size Effects in Fluid Interfaces
Authors: M. Caselle and F. Gliozzi and P. Provero and S. Vinti
Abstract: It is shown that finite size effects in the free energy of a rough interface of the 3D Ising and three--state Potts models are well described by the capillary wave model at {\em two--loop} order. The agreement between theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations strongly supports the idea of the universality of this description of order--order interfaces in 3D statistical systems above the roughening temperature.
