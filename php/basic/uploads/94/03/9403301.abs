Title: Resummations in Hot Scalar Electrodynamics
Authors: U. Kraemmer and A. K. Rebhan and H. Schulz
Abstract: The gauge-boson sector of perturbative scalar electrodynamics is investigated in detail as a testing ground for resummation methods in hot gauge theories. It also serves as a simple non-trivial reference system for the non-Abelian gluon plasma. The complete next-to-leading order contributions to the polarization tensor are obtained within the resummation scheme of Braaten and Pisarski. The simpler scheme proposed recently by Arnold and Espinosa is shown to apply to static quantities only, whereas Braaten-Pisarski resummation turns out to need modification for collective phenomena close to the light-cone. Finally, a recently proposed resummation of quasi-particle damping contributions is assessed critically.
