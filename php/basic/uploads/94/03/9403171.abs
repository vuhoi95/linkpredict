Title: Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations in Field Theory
Authors: Sen-Ben Liao and Janos Polonyi and Dapeng Xu
Abstract: Blocking transformation is performed in quantum field theory at finite temperature. It is found that the manner temperature deforms the renormalized trajectories can be used to understand better the role played by the quantum fluctuations. In particular, it is conjectured that domain formation and mass parameter generation can be observed in theories without spontaneous symmetry breaking.
