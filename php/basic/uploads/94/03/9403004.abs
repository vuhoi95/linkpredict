Title: Loop Algebra Symmetries and Commuting Flows for the  Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Hierarchy
Authors: A. Yu. Orlov and P. Winternitz
Abstract: The relation between the $\widehat\gl(\infty)$ symmetry of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy and the Kac-Moody-Virasoro Lie point symmetries of the individual equations is established. The Lie point symmetries are shown to be the only local ones.
