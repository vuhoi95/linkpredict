Title: Moving Mirror Model of Hawking Evaporation
Authors: M. Hotta and M. Shino and M. Yoshimura
Abstract: The moving mirror model is designed to extract essential features of the black hole formation and the subsequent Hawking radiation by neglecting complication due to a finite curvature. We extend this approach to dynamically treat back reaction against the mirror motion due to Hawking radiation. It is found that a unique model in two spacetime dimensions exists in which Hawking radiation completely stops and the end point of evaporation contains a disconnected remnant. When viewed from asymptotic observers at one side of the spacetime, quantum mechanical correlation is recovered in the end. Although the thermal stage accompanying short range correlation may last for an arbitrarily long period, at a much longer time scale a long tail of non-thermal correlation is clearly detected.
