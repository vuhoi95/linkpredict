Title: Reply to Hagen & Sudarshan's Comment
Authors: C. L. Ho and Y. Hosotani
Abstract: We show that the argument in Phys Rev Lett 70 (1993) 1360 is correct and consistent, and that Hagen & Sudarshan's solution has inconsistency leading to non-vanishing commutators of $[P^1, P^2]$ and $[P^j, H]$ even in physical states. This proves that many of HS's statements in their Comment are based merely on incorrect guess, but not on careful algebra.
