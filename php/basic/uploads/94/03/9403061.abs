Title: Covariant Phase Space Formulations of Superparticles and Supersymmetric  WZW Models
Authors: G. Au and B. Spence
Abstract: We present new covariant phase space formulations of superparticles moving on a group manifold, deriving the fundamental Poisson brackets and current algebras. We show how these formulations naturally generalise to the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten models.
