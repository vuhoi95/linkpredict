Title: Integration on the space of Connections Modulo Gauge Transformations
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Donald Marolf and Jose Mourao
Abstract: A summary of the known results on integration theory on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations is presented and its significance to quantum theories of gauge fields and gravity is discussed. The emphasis is on the underlying ideas rather than the technical subtleties.
