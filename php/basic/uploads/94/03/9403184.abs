Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and S. D. Odintsov and S. Zerbini
Abstract: Making use of some results concerning the theory of partitions, relevant in number theory, the complete asymptotic behavior, for large $n$, of the level density of states for a parabosonic string is derived. It is also pointed out the similarity between parabosonic strings and membranes.
