Title: On the Multilevel Field--Antifield Formalism with the Most General  Lagrangian Hypergauges
Authors: I. A. Batalin and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: The multilevel field-antifield formalism is constructed in a geometrically covariant way without imposing the unimodularity conditions on the hypergauge functions. Thus the previously given version [1,2] is extended to cover the most general case of Lagrangian surface bases. It is shown that the extra measure factors, required to enter the gauge-independent functional integrals, can be included naturally into the multilevel scheme by modifying the boundary conditions to the quantum master equation.
