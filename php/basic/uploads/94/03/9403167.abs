Title: Quantization of Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Podolsky Theory
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and Marcelo Hott
Abstract: We quantize a generalized electromagnetism in 2 + 1 dimensions which contains a higher-order derivative term by using Dirac's method. By introducing auxiliary fields we transform the original theory in a lower-order derivative one which can be treated in a usual way.
