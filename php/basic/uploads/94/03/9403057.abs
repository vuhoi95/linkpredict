Title: Quantized Topological 2-form Gravity
Authors: Tomoyuki Inui and Akika Nakamichi
Abstract: We develop a perturbation theory of four-dimensional topological 2-form gravity without cosmological constant. A 2-form and an $SU(2)$ connection 1-form are used as fundamental variables instead of metric. There is no quantum correction from two-loop and higher orders in covariant gauge, in Landau gauge and in background covariant gauge. We improve naive dimensional regularization and calculate an exact quantum correction at one-loop order. We observe that the renormalizability depends on gauge choice in topological 2-form gravity. It is unrenormalizable in the covariant gauge and in the background covariant gauge. On the other hand in the Landau gauge, we obtain finite but $SU(2)$ non-covariant quantum corrections. There may exist anomaly for the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. (Talk given by A. Nakamichi at the Workshop on General Relativity and Gravitation held at Tokyo University, January 17-20,1994.)
