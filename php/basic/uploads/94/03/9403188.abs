Title: Batalin-Tyutin Quantization of the (2+1) dimensional nonabelian  Chern-Simons field theory
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: The (2+1) dimensional nonabelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to complex scalar fields is quantized by using the Batalin-Tyutin canonical Hamiltonian method which systematically embeds second-class constraint system into first-class one. We obtain the gauge-invariant nonabelian Wess-Zumino type action in the extended phase space.
