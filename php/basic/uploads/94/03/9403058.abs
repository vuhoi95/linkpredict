Title: Chaotic Coupling Constants
Authors: James H. Horne and Gregory Moore
Abstract: We examine some novel physical consequences of the general structure of moduli spaces of string vacua. These include (1) finiteness of the volume of the moduli space and (2) chaotic motion of the moduli in the early universe. To fix ideas we examine in detail the example of the (conjectural) dilaton-axion ``$S$-duality'' of four-dimensional string compactifications. The facts (1) and (2) together might help to solve some problems with the standard scenarios for supersymmetry breaking and vacuum selection in string theory.
