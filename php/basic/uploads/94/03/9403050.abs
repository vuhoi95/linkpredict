Title: String Field Theory of Two Dimensional QCD: A Realization of W-infinity  Algebra
Authors: Avinash Dhar and Gautam Mandal and Spenta R. Wadia
Abstract: We consider the formulation of two dimensional QCD in terms of gauge invariant bilocal operators (string field) which satisfy a $W_\infty$ algebra. In analogy with our work on the $c=1$ string field theory we derive an action and associated constraints for the bilocal field using the method of coadjoint orbits. The $1/N$ perturbation theory around a classical solution that corresponds to the filled Dirac sea leads to the 'tHooft equation for meson fluctuations. It is shown that the spectrum of mesons, which are the higher string modes, transform as a representation of the wedge subalgebra $W_{\infty+} \otimes W_{\infty-}$. We briefly discuss the baryon as a stringy solitonic configuration and its characterization in terms of $W_\infty$ algebra.
