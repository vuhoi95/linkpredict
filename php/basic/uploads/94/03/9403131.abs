Title: Quantum Cosmology with Yang-Mills Fields
Authors: D. Kapetanakis and G. Koutsoumbas and A. Lukas and P. Mayr
Abstract: We examine an extension of the ideas of quantum cosmology and, in particular, the proposal of Hartle and Hawking for the boundary conditions of the Universe, to models which incorporate Yang-Mills fields. Inhomogeneous perturbations about a homogeneous, isotropic minisuperspace background model are considered, by expanding the Yang-Mills fields in harmonics of the spatial directions which are taken to be three-spheres. The expansions are made explicit for $SO(N)$ gauge fields thereby obtaining formulae compatible with the formalism conventionally used in quantum cosmology. We apply these results to the gauge group $SO(3)$ and derive the Lagrangian and the semi-classical wave function for this special case.
