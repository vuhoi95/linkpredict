Title: Two loop results from one loop computations and non perturbative  solutions of exact evolution equations
Authors: T. Papenbrock and C. Wetterich
Abstract: A nonperturbative method is proposed for the approximative solution of the exact evolution equation which describes the scale dependence of the effective average action. It consists of a combination of exact evolution equations for independent couplings with renormalization group improved one loop expressions of secondary couplings. Our method is illustrated by an example: We compute the beta-function of the quartic coupling lambda of an O(N) symmetric scalar field theory to order lambda^3 as well as the anomalous dimension to order lambda^2 using only one loop expressions and find agreement with the two loop perturbation theory. We also treat the case of very strong coupling and confirm the existence of a "triviality bound".
