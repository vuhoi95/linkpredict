Title: Nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory for the Repulsive Bose Gas
Authors: Igor V. Barashenkov and Alexander O. Harin
Abstract: We propose a new nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory based on a simple modification of the standard Lagrangian. This admits asymptotically nonvanishing field configurations and is applicable to the description of systems of repulsive bosons. The new model supports topological vortices and has a self-dual limit, both in the pure Chern-Simons and in the mixed Chern-Simons-Maxwell cases. The analysis is based on a new formulation of the Chern-Simons theories as constrained Hamiltonian systems.
