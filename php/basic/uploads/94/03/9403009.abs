Title: The Hamiltonian Formulation of Higher Order Dynamical Systems
Authors: Jan Govaerts and Maher S. Rashid
Abstract: Using Dirac's approach to constrained dynamics, the Hamiltonian formulation of regular higher order Lagrangians is developed. The conventional description of such systems due to Ostrogradsky is recovered. However, unlike the latter, the present analysis yields in a transparent manner the local structure of the associated phase space and its local sympletic geometry, and is of direct application to {\em constrained\/} higher order Lagrangian systems which are beyond the scope of Ostrogradsky's approach.
