Title: On Universal Vassiliev Invariants
Authors: Daniel Altschuler and Laurent Freidel
Abstract: Using properties of ordered exponentials and the definition of the Drinfeld associator as a monodromy operator for the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, we prove that the analytic and the combinatorial definitions of the universal Vassiliev invariants of links are equivalent.
