Title: A Particular Class of GUTs with Vanishing One-Loop Beta Functions
Authors: Wolfgang Lucha and Franz F. SCHÃ–berl
Abstract: By explicit solution of the one-loop finiteness conditions for gauge and quartic scalar-boson self-interaction coupling constants, a particular class of grand unified theories with vanishing Yukawa couplings as well as vanishing one-loop renormalization-group beta functions is constructed.
