Title: Z Flux-Line Lattices and Self-Dual Equations in the Standard Model
Authors: G. Bimonte and G. Lozano
Abstract: We derive gauge covariant self-dual equations for the $SU(2) \times U(1)_Y$ theory of electro-weak interactions and show that they admit solutions describing a periodic lattice of Z-strings.} \newpage
