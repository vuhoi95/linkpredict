Title: Renormalization Ambiguities in Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: M. Asorey and F. Falceto and J. L. Lopez and G. Luzon
Abstract: We introduce a new family of gauge invariant regularizations of Chern-Simons theories which generate one-loop renormalizations of the coupling constant of the form $k\to k+2 s c_v$ where $s$ can take any arbitrary integer value. In the particular case $s=0$ we get an explicit example of a gauge invariant regularization which does not generate radiative corrections to the bare coupling constant. This ambiguity in the radiative corrections to $k$ is reminiscent of the Coste-L\"uscher results for the parity anomaly in (2+1) fermionic effective actions.
