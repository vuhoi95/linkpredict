Title: Cosmic String Nucleation near the Inflationary Phase Boundary
Authors: Minos Axenides and Arne L. Larsen
Abstract: We investigate the nucleation of circular cosmic strings in models of generalized inflationary universes with an accelerating scale factor. We consider toy cosmological models of a smooth inflationary exit and transition into a flat Minkowski spacetime. Our results establish that an inflationary expanding phase is necessary but not sufficient for quantum nucleation of circular cosmic strings to occur.
