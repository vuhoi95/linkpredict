Title: Towards a Complete Twistorization of the Heterotic String
Authors: Igor A. Bandos and Martin Cederwall and Dmitrij P. Sorokin and Dmitrij V. Volkov
Abstract: In $D=3,4,6$ and 10 space--time dimensions considered is a string model invariant under transformations of $N=1$ space--time supersymmetry and $n=D-2$ local worldsheet supersymmetry with the both Virasoro constraints solved in the twistor form. The twistor solution survives in a modified form even in the presence of the heterotic fermions.
