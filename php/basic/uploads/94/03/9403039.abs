Title: Fock Representations of Quantum Fields with Generalized Statistic
Authors: A. Liguori and M. Mintchev
Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for constructing Fock representations of quantum fields obeying generalized statistics associated with certain solutions of the spectral quantum Yang-Baxter equation. The main features of these representations are investigated. Various aspects of the underlying mathematical structure are illustrated by means of explicit examples.
