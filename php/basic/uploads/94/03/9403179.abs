Title: String--Kaluza--Klein Cosmology
Authors: K. Behrndt and S. Foerste
Abstract: We generalize a five dimensional black hole solution of low energy effective string theory to arbitrary constant spatial curvature. After interchanging the signature of time and radius we reduce the 5d solution to four dimensions and obtain that way a four dimensional isotropic cosmological space time. The solution contains a dilaton, modulus field and torsion. Several features of the solution are discussed.
