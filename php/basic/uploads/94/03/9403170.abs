Title: Models of Quantum Space Time: Quantum Field Planes
Authors: G. Mack and V. Schomerus
Abstract: Quantum field planes furnish a noncommutative differential algebra $\Omega$ which substitutes for the commutative algebra of functions and forms on a contractible manifold. The data required in their construction come from a quantum field theory. The basic idea is to replace the ground field ${\bf C}$ of quantum planes by the noncommutative algebra ${\cal A}$ of observables of the quantum field theory.
