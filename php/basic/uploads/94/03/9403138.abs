Title: An operator approach to BRST invariant transition amplitudes
Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Arvind N. Vaidya
Abstract: The transition amplitudes for the free spinless and spinning relativistic particles are obtained by applying an operator method developed long ago by Dirac and Schwinger to the BFV form of the BRST theory for constrained systems.
