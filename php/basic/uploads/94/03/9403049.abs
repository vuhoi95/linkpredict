Title: Statistical Models with a Line of Defect
Authors: G. Delfino and G. Mussardo and P. Simonetti
Abstract: The factorization condition for the scattering amplitudes of an integrable model with a line of defect gives rise to a set of Reflection-Transmission equations. The solutions of these equations in the case of diagonal $S$-matrix in the bulk are only those with $S =\pm 1$. The choice $S=-1$ corresponds to the Ising model. We compute the transmission and reflection amplitudes relative to the interaction of the Majorana fermion with the defect and we discuss their relevant features.
