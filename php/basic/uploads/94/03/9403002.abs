Title: On Polynomial Relations in the Heisenberg Algebra
Authors: N. Fleury and A. Turbiner
Abstract: Polynomial relations between the generators of the classical and quantum Heisenberg algebras are presented. Some of those relations can have a meaning of the formulas of the normal ordering for the creation/annihilation operators occurred in the method of the second quantization.
