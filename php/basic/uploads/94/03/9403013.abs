Title: Detecting Dual Superconductivity in the Ground State of Gauge Theory
Authors: L. Del Debbio A. Di Giacomo and G. Paffuti
Abstract: We explicitly construct a monopole creation operator: its vacuum expectation value is an order parameter for dual superconductivity, in that, if different from zero, it signals a spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry corresponding to monopole charge conservation. This operator is tested by numerical simulations in compact $U(1)$ gauge theory. Our construction provides a general recipe for detection of the condensation of any topological soliton. In particular our operator can be used to detect dual superconductivity of the QCD vacuum.
