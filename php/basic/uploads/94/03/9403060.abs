Title: The Graceful Exit Problem in String Cosmology
Authors: R. Brustein and G. Veneziano
Abstract: Isotropic string cosmology solutions can be classified into two duality related branches: one can be connected smoothly to an expanding Friedman-Robertson-Walker Universe, the other describes accelerated inflation or contraction. We show that, if the dilaton potential has certain generic properties, the two branches can evolve smoothly into each other. We find, however, that just the effects of a potential do not allow for a graceful exit from accelerated inflation in the weak curvature regime. We explain how conformal field theory techniques could be used to give a decisive answer on whether graceful exit from accelerated inflation is possible at all.
