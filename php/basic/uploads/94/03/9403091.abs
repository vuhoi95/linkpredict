Title: Path Integral Quantization of Cosmological Perturbations
Authors: S. Anderegg and V. Mukhanov
Abstract: We derive the first order canonical formulation of cosmological perturbation theory in a Universe filled by a few scalar fields. This theory is quantized via well-defined Hamiltonian path integral. The propagator which describes the evolution of the initial (for instance, vacuum) state, is calculated.
