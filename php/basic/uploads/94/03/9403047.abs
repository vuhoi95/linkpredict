Title: Decoherent Histories and Quantum State Diffusion
Authors: L. Diosi and N. Gisin and J. J. Halliwell and I. G. Percival
Abstract: We demonstrate a close connection between the decoherent histories (DH) approach to quantum mechanics and the quantum state diffusion (QSD) picture, for open quantum systems described by a master equation of Lindblad form. The (physically unique) set of variables that localize in the QSD picture also define an approximately decoherent set of histories in the DH approach. The degree of localization is related to the degree of decoherence, and the probabilities for histories prescribed by each approach are essentially the same.
