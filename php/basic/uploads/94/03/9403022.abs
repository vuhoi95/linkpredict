Title: Solution of the Thirring Model with Imaginary Mass and Massless  Scattering
Authors: Hubert Saleur and Sergei Skorik
Abstract: The Thirring model with imaginary mass (or the sine-Gordon model with imaginary coupling) is deeply related to all the flows between minimal conformal theories. We solve this model explicitely using the Bethe ansatz. We find that there are Left and Right moving massless excitations with non trivial LR scattering. We compute the S matrix and recover the result conjectured by Fendley et al.
