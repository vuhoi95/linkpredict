Title: A Strong Coupling Test of S-Duality
Authors: Cumrun Vafa and Edward Witten
Abstract: By studying the partition function of $N=4$ topologically twisted supersymmetric Yang-Mills on four-manifolds, we make an exact strong coupling test of the Montonen-Olive strong-weak duality conjecture. Unexpected and exciting links are found with two-dimensional rational conformal field theory.
