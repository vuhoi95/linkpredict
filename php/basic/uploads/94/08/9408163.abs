Title: Topology of a Nontopological Magnetic Monopole
Authors: Choonkyu Lee and Piljin Yi
Abstract: Certain nontopological magnetic monopoles, recently found by Lee and Weinberg, are reinterpreted as topological solitons of a non-Abelian gauged Higgs model. Our study makes the nature of the Lee-Weinberg monopoles more transparent, especially with regard to their singularity structure.
