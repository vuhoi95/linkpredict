Title: A $SU(2)$ Generalized Gauge Field Model With Higgs Mechanism
Authors: Hanying Guo and Jianming Li and 7 pages and Latex and ASITP-94-25
Abstract: By means of the non-commutative differential geometry, we construct an $SU(2)$ generalized gauge field model. It is of $SU(2) \times \pi_4(SU(2))$ gauge invariance. We show that this model not only includes the Higgs field automatically on the equal footing with ordinary Yang-Mills gauge potentials but also is stable against quantum correlation.
