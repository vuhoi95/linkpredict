Authors: M. N. Chernodub and M. I. Polikarpov and A. I. Veselov
Abstract: We show that the monopole confinement mechanism in lattice gluodynamics is a particular feature of the maximal abelian projection. We give an explicit example of the $SU(2) \rightarrow U(1)$ projection (the minimal abelian projection), in which the confinement is due to topological objects other than monopoles. We perform analytical and numerical study of the loop expansion of the Faddeev--Popov determinant for the maximal and the minimal abelian projections, and discuss the fundamental modular region for these projections.
