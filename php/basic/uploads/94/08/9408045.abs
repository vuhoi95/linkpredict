Title: Constrained Analysis of Topologically Massive Gravity
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and T. G. Dargam
Abstract: We quantize the Einstein gravity in the formalism of weak gravitational fields by using the constrained Hamiltonian method. Special emphasis is given to the 2+1 spacetime dimensional case where a (topological) Chern-Simons term is added to the Lagrangian.
