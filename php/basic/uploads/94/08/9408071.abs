Title: Supersymmetric classical mechanics
Authors: Georg Junker and Stephan Matthiesen
Abstract: We study the classical properties of a supersymmetric system which is often used as a model for supersymmetric quantum mechanics. It is found that the classical dynamics of the bosonic as well as the fermionic degrees of freedom is fully described by a so--called quasi--classical solution. We also comment on the importance of this quasi--classical solution in the semi--classical treatment of the supersymmetric quantum model.
