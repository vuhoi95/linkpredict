Title: Entropy and the Approach to the Thermodynamic Limit in Three-Dimensional  Simplicial Gravity
Authors: S. Catterall and J. Kogut and R. Renken
Abstract: We present numerical results supporting the existence of an exponential bound in the dynamical triangulation model of three-dimensional quantum gravity.Both the critical coupling and various other quantities show a slow power law approach to the infinite volume limit.
