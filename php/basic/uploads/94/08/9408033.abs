Title: Superstrings from Hamiltonian Reduction
Authors: A. Boresch and K. Landsteiner and W. Lerche and A. Sevrin
Abstract: In any string theory there is a hidden, twisted superconformal symmetry algebra, part of which is made up by the BRST current and the anti-ghost. We investigate how this algebra can be systematically constructed for strings with $N\!-\!2$ supersymmetries, via quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the Lie superalgebras $osp(N|2)$. The motivation is to understand how one could systematically construct generalized string theories from superalgebras. We also briefly discuss the BRST algebra of the topological string, which is a doubly twisted $N\!=\!4$ superconformal algebra.
