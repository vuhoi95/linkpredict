Title: The integrable hierarchy constructed from a pair of KdV-type hierarchies  and its associated $W$ algebra
Authors: L. Bonora and Q. P. Liu and C. S. Xiong
Abstract: For any two arbitrary positive integers `$n$' and `$m$', using the $m$--th KdV hierarchy and the $(n+m)$--th KdV hierarchy as building blocks, we are able to construct another integrable hierarchy (referred to as the $(n,m)$--th KdV hierarchy). The $W$--algebra associated to the \shs\, of the $(n,m)$--th KdV hierarchy (called $W(n,m)$ algebra) is isomorphic via a Miura map to the direct sum of $W_m$--algebra, $W_{n+m}$--algebra and an additional $U(1)$ current algebra. In turn, from the latter, we can always construct a representation of $W_\infty$--algebra.
