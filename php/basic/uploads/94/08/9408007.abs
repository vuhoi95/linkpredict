Title: A Hierarchy of Super $w$\ Strings
Authors: Hiroshi Kunitomo and Makoto Sakaguchi and Akira Tokura
Abstract: It is shown that the N-extended super $w_n$\ string can be obtained as a special class of vacua of both the N-extended super $w_{n+1}$\ string and the (N+1)-extended super $w_n$\ string. This hierarchy of super $w$\ string theories includes as subhierarchies both the superstring hierarchy given by Bastianelli, Ohta and Petersen and the $w$\ string hierarchy given by the authors.
