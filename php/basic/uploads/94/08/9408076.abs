Title: From Weak to Strong Coupling in Two-Dimensional Gravity
Authors: Jean-Loup Gervais and Jean-Fran√ßois Roussel
Abstract: The strong coupling physics of two dimensional gravity at C=7, 13, 19 is deciphered, by building up on previous works along the same line (for a recent review, of the background material, see hep-th/9408069). It is shown that chirality becomes deconfined. The string suceptibility is derived, and found to be real contrary to the continuation of the KPZ formula. Topological Liouville string theories (without transverse degree of freedom) are explicitely solved. Altough they involve strongly coupled gravity, they share many features with the standard matrix models.
