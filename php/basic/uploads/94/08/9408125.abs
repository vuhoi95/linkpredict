Title: Multiplicative BRST renormalization of the $SU(2)$ Higgs model
Authors: Anne Schilling and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We reformulate the proof of the renormalization of a spontaneously broken gauge theory by multiplicatively renormalizing the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field in the $SU(2)$~Higgs model.
