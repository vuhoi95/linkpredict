Title: Realizations of the $q$-Heisenberg and $q$-Virasoro Algebras
Authors: C. H. Oh and K. Singh
Abstract: We give field theoretic realizations of both the $q$-Heisenberg and the $q$-Virasoro algebra. In particular, we obtain the operator product expansions among the current and the energy momentum tensor obtained using the Sugawara construction.
