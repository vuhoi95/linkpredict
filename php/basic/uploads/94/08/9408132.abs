Title: Coleman-Weinberg Phase Transition in Two-Scalar Models
Authors: S. Bornholdt and N. Tetradis and C. Wetterich
Abstract: We explore the Coleman-Weinberg phase transition in regions outside the validity of perturbation theory. For this purpose we study a Euclidean field theory with two scalars and discrete symmetry in four dimensions. The phase diagram is established by a numerical solution of a suitable truncation of exact non-perturbative flow equations. We find regions in parameter space where the phase transition (in dependence on the mass term) is of the second or the first order, separated by a triple point. Our quantitative results for the first order phase transition compare well to the standard perturbative Coleman-Weinberg calculation of the effective potential.
