Title: A superspace formulation of the BV action
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Ashok Das
Abstract: We show that the BV (Batalin Vilkovisky) action, formulated with an extended BRST symmetry (including the shift symmetry), is also invariant under an extended anti-BRST transformation (where the antifields are the parameters of the transformation), when the gauge fixing Lagrangian is both BRST and anti-BRST invariant. We show that for a general gauge fixing Lagrangian, the BV action can be written in a manifestly extended BRST invariant manner in a superspace with one Grassmann coordinate whereas it can be expressed in a manifestly extended BRST and anti-BRST invariant manner in a superspace with two Grassmann coordinates when the gauge fixing Lagrangian is invariant under both BRST and anti-BRST transformations.
