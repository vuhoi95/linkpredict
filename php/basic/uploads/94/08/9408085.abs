Title: Anomalous Magnetic Moment of Anyons
Authors: Gil Gat and Rashmi Ray
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of anyons is calculated to leading order in a 1/N expansion. It is shown that the gyromagnetic ratio g remains 2 to the leading order in 1/N. This result strongly supports that obtained in \cite{poly}, namely that g=2 is in fact exact.
