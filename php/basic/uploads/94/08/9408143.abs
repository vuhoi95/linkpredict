Title: Quantum groups and zeta-functions
Authors: Kimio Ueno and Michitomo Nishizawa
Abstract: A $q$-analogue of the Hurwitz zeta-function is introduced through considerations on the spectral zeta-function of quantum group $SU_{q}(2)$, and its analytic aspects are studied via the Euler-MacLaurin summation formula. Asymptotic formulas of some relevant $q$-functions are discussed.
