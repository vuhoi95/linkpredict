Title: Deformed Minimal Models and Generalized Toda Theory
Authors: Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of $A_{r}$-type Toda theory based on a non-abelian group G, which we call the $(A_{r},G)$-Toda theory, and its affine extensions in terms of gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten actions with deformation terms. In particular, the affine $(A_{1},SU(2))$-Toda theory describes the integrable deformation of the minimal conformal theory for the critical Ising model by the operator $\Phi_{(2,1)}$. We derive infinite conserved charges and soliton solutions from the Lax pair of the affine $(A_{1}, SU(2))$-Toda theory. Another type of integrable deformation which accounts for the $\Phi_{(3,1)}$-deformation of the minimal model is also found in the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten context and its infinite conserved charges are given.
