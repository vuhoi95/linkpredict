Title: Target Space Duality In Orbifolds With Continuous And Discrete Wilson  Lines
Authors: D. Bailin and A. Love and W. A. Sabra and S. Thomas
Abstract: Duality Symmetry is studied for heterotic string orbifold compactifications in the presence of a general background which in addition to the metric and antisymmetric tensor contains both discrete and continuous Wilson lines background.
