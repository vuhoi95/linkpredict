Title: Self-Interaction Correction to Black Hole Radiance
Authors: Per Kraus and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We consider the modification of the formulas for black hole radiation, due to the self-gravitation of the radiation. This is done by truncating the coupled particle-hole system to a small set of modes, that are plausibly the most significant ones, and quantizing the reduced system. In this way we find that the particles no longer move along geodesics, nor is the action along the rays zero for a massless particle. The radiation is no longer thermal, but is corrected in a definite way that we calculate. Our methods can be extended in a straightforward manner to discuss correlations in the radiation, or between incoming particles and the radiation.
