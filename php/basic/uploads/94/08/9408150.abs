Authors: Hanying Guo and Jianming Li and Ke Wu and 10 pages and Latex ASITP-93-67
Abstract: In terms of non-commutative geometry, we show that the $\sigma$--model can be built up by the gauge theory on discrete group $Z_2$. We introduce a constraint in the gauge theory, which lead to the constraint imposed on linear $\sigma$ model to get nonlinear $\sigma$ model .
