Title: Symplectic Quantization for Reducible Systems
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto and M. B. D. Silva
Abstract: We study an extension of the symplectic formalism in order to quantize reducible systems. We show that a procedure like {\it ghost-of-ghost} of the BFV method can be applied in terms of Lagrange multipliers. We use the developed formalism to quantize the antisymmetric Abelian gauge fields.
