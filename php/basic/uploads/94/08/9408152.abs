Title: Standard Model With Higgs As Gauge Field On Fourth Homotopy Group
Authors: Hanying Guo and Jianming Li and Ke Wu
Abstract: Based upon a first principle, the generalized gauge principle, we construct a general model with $G_L\times G'_R \times Z_2$ gauge symmetry, where $Z_2=\pi_4(G_L)$ is the fourth homotopy group of the gauge group $G_L$, by means of the non-commutative differential geometry and reformulate the Weinberg-Salam model and the standard model with the Higgs field being a gauge field on the fourth homotopy group of their gauge groups. We show that in this approach not only the Higgs field is automatically introduced on the equal footing with ordinary Yang-Mills gauge potentials and there are no extra constraints among the parameters at the tree level but also it most importantly is stable against quantum correlation.
