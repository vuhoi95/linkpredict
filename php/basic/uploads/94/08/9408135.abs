Title: Functional Relations and Analytic Bethe Ansatz for Twisted Quantum  Affine Algebras
Authors: Atsuo Kuniba and Junji Suzuki
Abstract: Functional relations are proposed for transfer matrices of solvable vertex models associated with the twisted quantum affine algebras $U_q(X^{(\kappa)}_n)$ where $X^{(\kappa)}_n = A^{(2)}_n, D^{(2)}_n, E^{(2)}_6$ and $D^{(3)}_4$. Their solutions are obtained for $A^{(2)}_n$ and conjectured for $D^{(3)}_4$ in the dressed vacuum form in the analytic Bethe ansatz.
