Title: Yang-Mills gauge anomalies in the presence of gravity with torsion
Authors: O. Moritsch and M. Schweda and T. Sommer
Abstract: The BRST transformations for the Yang-Mills gauge fields in the presence of gravity with torsion are discussed by using the so-called Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. With the help of an operator $\d$ which allows to decompose the exterior spacetime derivative as a BRST commutator we solve the Wess-Zumino consistency condition corresponding to invariant Chern-Simons terms and gauge anomalies.
