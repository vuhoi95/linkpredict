Title: Yang-Mills Fields and Riemannian Geometry
Authors: Peter E. Haagensen and Kenneth Johnson
Abstract: It is possible to define new, gauge invariant variables in the Hilbert space of Yang-Mills theories which manifestly implement Gauss' law on physical states. These variables have furthermore a geometrical meaning, and allow one to uncover further constraints physical states must satisfy. For gauge group $SU(2)$, the underlying geometry is Riemannian and based on the group $GL(3)$. The formalism allows also for the inclusion of static color sources and the extension to gauge groups $SU(N>2)$, both of which are discussed here.
