Title: Tachyon Condensates and Anisotropic Universe
Authors: Swapna Mahapatra and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological solutions in closed bosonic string theory in the presence of non zero tachyon condensate. We specifically obtain time dependent solutions which describe an anisotropic universe. We also discuss the nature of such time dependent solutions when small tachyon fluctuations around the condensate are taken into account.
