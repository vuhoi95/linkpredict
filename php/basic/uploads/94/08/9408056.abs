Title: Anyonic FRT construction
Authors: Shahn Majid and M. J. Rodriguez-Plaza
Abstract: The Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan method to construct matrix bialgebras from non-singular solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation is extended to the anyonic or $\Z_n$-graded case. The resulting anyonic quantum matrices are braided groups in which the braiding is given by a phase factor.
