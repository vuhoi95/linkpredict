Authors: H. Awata and M. Fukuma and Y. Matsuo and S. Odake
Abstract: We review the recent development in the representation theory of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. The topics that we concern are, Quasifinite representation, Free field realizations, (Super) Matrix Generalization, Structure of subalgebras such as $W_\infty$ algebra, Determinant formula, Character formula.
