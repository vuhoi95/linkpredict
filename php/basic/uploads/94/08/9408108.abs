Title: A Manifestly Gauge-Invariant Approach to Quantum Theories of Gauge  Fields
Authors: A. Ashtekar and J. Lewandowski and D. Marolf and J. Mourao and T. Thiemann
Abstract: In gauge theories, physical histories are represented by space-time connections modulo gauge transformations. The space of histories is thus intrinsically non-linear. The standard framework of constructive quantum field theory has to be extended to face these {\it kinematical} non-linearities squarely. We first present a pedagogical account of this problem and then suggest an avenue for its resolution.
