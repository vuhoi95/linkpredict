Title: Fermionic Operators from Bosonic Fields in 3+1 Dimensions
Authors: A. Kovner and B. Rosenstein
Abstract: We present a construction of fermionic operators in 3+1 dimensions in terms of bosonic fields in the framework of $QED_4$. The basic bosonic variables are the electric fields $E_i$ and their conjugate momenta $A_i$. Our construction generalizes the analogous constuction of fermionic operators in 2+1 dimensions. Loosely speaking, a fermionic operator is represented as a product of an operator that creates a pointlike charge and an operator that creates an infinitesimal t'Hooft loop of half integer strength. We also show how the axial $U(1)$ transformations are realized in this construction.
