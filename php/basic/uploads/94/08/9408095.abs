Title: The Effective Action in Gauged Supergravity on Hyperbolic Background and  Induced Cosmological Constant
Authors: A. A. Bytsenko and S. D. Odintsov and s. Zerbini
Abstract: The one-loop effective action for 4-dimensional gauged supergravity with negative cosmological constant, is investigated in space-times with compact hyperbolic spatial section. The explicit expansion of the effective action as a power series of the curvature on hyperbolic background is derived, making use of heat-kernel and zeta-regularization techniques. The induced cosmological and Newton constants are computed.
