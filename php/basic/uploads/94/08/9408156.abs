Title: Bounce in Valley: Study of the extended structures from thick-wall to  thin-wall vacuum bubbles
Authors: Hideaki Aoyama and Shinya Wada
Abstract: The valley structure associated with quantum meta-stability is examined. It is defined by the new valley equation, which enables consistent evaluation of the imaginary-time path-integral. We study the structure of this new valley equation and solve these equations numerically. The valley is shown to contain the bounce solution, as well as other bubble structures. We find that even when the bubble solution has thick wall, the outer region of the valley is made of large-radius, thin-wall bubble, which interior is occupied by the true-vacuum. Smaller size bubbles, which contribute to decay at higher energies, are also identified.
