Title: Lotka--Volterra Type Equations and their Explicit Integration
Authors: Jean-Loup Gervais and Mikhail V. Saveliev
Abstract: In the present note we give an explicit integration of some two--dimensionalised Lotka--Volterra type equations associated with simple Lie algebras, other than the familiar $A_n$ case, possessing a representation without branching. This allows us, in particular, to treat the first fundamental representations of $A_r$, $B_r$, $C_r$, and $G_2$ on the same footing.
