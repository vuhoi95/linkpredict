Title: A Note on Abelian Conversion of Constraints
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Ashok Das
Abstract: We show that for a system containing a set of general second class constraints which are linear in the phase space variables, the Abelian conversion can be obtained in a closed form and that the first class constraints generate a generalized shift symmetry. We study in detail the example of a general first order Lagrangian and show how the shift symmetry noted in the context of BV quantization arises.
