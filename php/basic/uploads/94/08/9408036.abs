Title: On the Geometry of Moduli Space of Vacua in N=2 Supersymmetric  Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: A. Ceresole and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Abstract: We consider generic properties of the moduli space of vacua in $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory recently studied by Seiberg and Witten. We find, on general grounds, Picard--Fuchs type of differential equations expressing the existence of a flat holomorphic connection, which for one parameter (i.e. for gauge group $G=SU(2)$), are second order equations. In the case of coupling to gravity (as in string theory), where also ``gravitational'' electric and magnetic monopoles are present, the electric--magnetic S duality, due to quantum corrections, does not seem any longer to be related to $Sl(2,\IZ)$ as for $N=4$ supersymmetric theory.
