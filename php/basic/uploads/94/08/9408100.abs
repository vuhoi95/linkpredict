Title: Field Redefinition Invariance and "Extra Terms"
Authors: K. M. Apfeldorf and C. R. Ordonez
Abstract: We investigate the issue of coordinate redefinition invariance by carefully performing nonlinear transformations in the discretized quantum mechanical path integral. By resorting to hamiltonian path integral methods, we provide the first complete derivation of the extra terms (beyond the usual jacobian term) which arises in the action when a nonlinear transformation is made. We comment on possible connections with the renormalization group, by showing that these extra terms may emerge from a ``blocking" procedure. Finally, by performing field redefinitions before and after dimensional reduction of a two dimensional field theory, we derive an explicit form fo an extra term appearing in a field theory.
