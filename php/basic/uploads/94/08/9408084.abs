Title: Superradiance around Rotating Dilatonic Black Hole
Authors: Jun-ichirou Koga and Kei-ichi Maeda
Abstract: We consider a superradiance effect around rotating dilatonic black holes. We analyze two cases: one is an exact solution with the coupling constant $\alpha=\sqrt{3}$, which effective action is reduced from the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, and the other is a slowly rotating dilatonic black holes with arbitrary coupling constant. We find that there exists a critical value ($\alpha \sim 1$), which is predicted from a superstring model, and the superradiant emission rate with coupling larger than the critical value becomes much higher than the Kerr-Newman case ($\alpha=0$) in the maximally charged limit. Consequently, 4-dimensional primordial black holes in higher dimensional unified theories are either rotating but almost neutral or charged but effectively non-rotating.
