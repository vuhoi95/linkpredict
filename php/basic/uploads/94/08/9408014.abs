Title: Calculation of Graviton Scattering Amplitudes using String-Based Methods
Authors: David C. Dunbar and Paul S. Norridge
Abstract: Techniques based upon the string organisation of amplitudes may be used to simplify field theory calculations. We apply these techniques to perturbative gravity and calculate all one-loop amplitudes for four-graviton scattering with arbitrary internal particle content. Decomposing the amplitudes into contributions arising from supersymmetric multiplets greatly simplifies these calculations. We also discuss how unitarity may be used to constrain the amplitudes.
