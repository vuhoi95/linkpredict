Title: Projective Invariance and One-Loop Effective Action in Affine-Metric  Gravity Interacting with Scalar Field
Authors: M. Yu. Kalmykov and P. I. Pronin and K. V. Stepanyantz
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the projective invariance on the renormalization properties of the theory. One-loop counterterms are calculated in the most general case of interaction of gravity with scalar field.
