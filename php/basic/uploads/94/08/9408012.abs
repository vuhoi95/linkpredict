Title: Interrelation of a Z(3) Gauge Theory on the Flat Lattices and a Spin-1  BEG Model
Authors: N. S. Ananikian and R. R. Shcherbakov
Abstract: The Z(3) gauge model with double plaquette representation of the action on the flat triangular and square lattices is constructed. It is reduced to the spin-1 Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model. An Ising-type critical line of a second-order phase transition is found.
