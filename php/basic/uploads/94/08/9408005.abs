Title: Critical Behavior of the Marinari-Parisi Model
Authors: S. Chaudhuri and J. Polchinski
Abstract: We consider the continuum string theory corresponding to the Marinari-Parisi supersymmetric matrix model. We argue that the world-sheet physics is exotic, and different from any known supersymmetric string theory. The embedding superspace coordinates become disordered on the world-sheet, but because of the noncompactness of the embedding time the disorder becomes complete only at asymptotic world-sheet scales.
