Title: Inequivalence of the Massive Vector Meson and Higgs Models on a Manifold  with Boundary
Authors: L. Chandar and E. Ercolessi
Abstract: The exact quantization of two models, the massive vector meson model and the Higgs model in the London limit, both describing massive photons, is presented. Even though naive arguments (based on gauge-fixing) may indicate the equivalence of these models, it is shown here that this is not true in general when we consider these theories on manifolds with boundaries. We show, in particular, that they are equivalent only for a special choice of the boundary conditions that we are allowed to impose on the fields.
