Title: On Little Groups and Boosts of $Îº$-deformed Poincare Group
Authors: S. Rouhani and A. Shariati
Abstract: We show how Wigner's little group approach to the representation theory of Poincar\'e group may be generalized to the case of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e group. We also derive the deformed Lorentz transformations of energy and momentum. We find that if the $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e group is adopted as the fundamental symmetry of nature, it results in deviations from predictions of the Poincar\'e symmetry at large energies, which may be experimentally observable.
