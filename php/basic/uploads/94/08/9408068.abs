Title: Exact Conductance through Point Contacts in the $Î½=1/3$ Fractional  Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: P. Fendley and A. W. W. Ludwig and H. Saleur
Abstract: The conductance for tunneling through a point contact between two $\nu =1/3$ quantum Hall edges is described by a universal scaling function, which has recently been measured experimentally. We compute this universal function exactly, by using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and a Boltzmann equation.
