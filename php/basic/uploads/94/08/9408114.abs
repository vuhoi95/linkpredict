Title: Discrete Differential Manifolds and Dynamics on Networks
Authors: A. Dimakis and F. M"uller-Hoissen and F. Vanderseypen
Abstract: A `discrete differential manifold' we call a countable set together with an algebraic differential calculus on it. This structure has already been explored in previous work and provides us with a convenient framework for the formulation of dynamical models on networks and physical theories with discrete space and time. We present several examples and introduce a notion of differentiability of maps between discrete differential manifolds. Particular attention is given to differentiable curves in such spaces. Every discrete differentiable manifold carries a topology and we show that differentiability of a map implies continuity.
