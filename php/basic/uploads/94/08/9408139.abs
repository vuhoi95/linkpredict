Title: Remarks on the Star-Triangle Relation in the Baxter-Bazhanov Model
Authors: Zhan-Ning Hu and Bo-Yu Hou
Abstract: In this letter we show that the restricted star-triangle relation introduced by Bazhanov and Baxter can be obtained either from the star-triangle relation of chiral Potts model or from the star-square relation which is proposed by Kashaev $et ~al$ and give a response of the guess which is suggested by Bazhanov and Baxter in Ref. \cite{b2}.
