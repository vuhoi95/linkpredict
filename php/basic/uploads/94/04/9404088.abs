Title: Dynamical Mass Generation for Non-Abelian Gauge Fields without the Higgs
Authors: Didier Caenepeel and Martin Leblanc
Abstract: We present an alternative to the Higgs mechanism to generate masses for non-abelian gauge fields in (3+1)-dimensions. The initial Lagrangian is composed of a fermion with current-current and dipole-dipole type self-interactions minimally coupled to non-abelian gauge fields. The mass generation occurs upon the fermionic functional integration. We show that by fine-tuning the coupling constants the effective theory contains massive non-abelian gauge fields without any residual scalars or other degrees of freedom.
