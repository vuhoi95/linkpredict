Title: Multicritical Behavior of $c=1$ Matrix Model
Authors: H. Itoyama and M. Koike
Abstract: We discuss multicritical behavior of $c=1$ matrix model, extending the recent work of ref. \cite{CIO} on a nonperturbative completion of the density of states function. For the odd orders of multicriticality, we are able to determine the higher genus contributions and a nonperturbative completion from the WKB wave function of the multicritical periodic potential. The expression for the contributions as a function of the scaled chemical potential is found to be the same as the one at the lowest critical point. We point out a strange scaling behavior.
