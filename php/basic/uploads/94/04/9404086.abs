Title: Renormalization Group Approach to Scalar Theory
Authors: Sen-Ben Liao and Chengqian Gong
Abstract: Effective potential for scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory is obtained using the exact renormalization group method which includes both the usual one-loop contribution as well as the dominant higher loop effects. Our numerical calculation indicates a breakdown of naive one-loop result for sufficiently large renormalized coupling constant.
