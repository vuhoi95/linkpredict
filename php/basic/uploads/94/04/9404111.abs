Title: $N$-Dimensional Representations of the Braid Groups $B_{N}$
Authors: Dian-Min Tong and Shan-De Yang and Zhong-Qi Ma
Abstract: In this note, a new class of representations of the braid groups $B_{N}$ is constructed. It is proved that those representations contain three kinds of irreducible representations: the trivial (identity) one, the Burau one, and an $N$-dimensional one. The explicit form of the $N$-dimensional irreducible representation of the braid group $B_{N}$ is given here.
