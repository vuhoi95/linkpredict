Title: Quasifinite Highest Weight Modules over Super $W_{1+\infty}$ Algebra
Authors: H. Awata and M. Fukuma and Y. Matsuo and S. Odake
Abstract: We study quasifinite highest weight modules over the supersymmetric extension of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra on the basis of the analysis by Kac and Radul. We find that the quasifiniteness of the modules is again characterized by polynomials, and obtain the differential equations for highest weights. The spectral flow, free field realization over the $(B,C)$--system, and the embedding into $\Glinf$ are also presented.
