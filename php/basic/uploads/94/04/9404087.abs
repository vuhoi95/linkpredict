Title: On the physical interpretation of effective actions using Schwinger's  formula
Authors: L. C. de Albuquerque and C. Farina and Silvio J. Rabello and Arvind N. Vaidya
Abstract: We show explicitly that Schwinger's formula for one-loop effective actions corresponds to the summation of energies associated with the zero-point oscillations of the fields. We begin with a formal proof, and after that we confirm it using a regularization prescription.
