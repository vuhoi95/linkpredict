Title: Generalized Schroedinger representation in BRST-quantization
Authors: Kh. S. Nirov and A. V. Razumov
Abstract: An analysis of the state space in the BRST--quantization in the Schroedinger representation is performed on the basis of the results obtained earlier in the framework of the Fock space representation. It is shown that to get satisfactory results it is necessary to have from the very beginning a meaningful definition of the total state space.
