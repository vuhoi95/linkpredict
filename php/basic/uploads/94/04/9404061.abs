Title: Second Order Derivative Supersymmetry and Scattering Problem
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and F. Cannata and J. -P-Dedonder and M. V. Ioffe
Abstract: Extensions of standard one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics are discussed. Supercharges involving higher order derivatives are introduced leading to an algebra which incorporates a higher order polynomial in the Hamiltonian. We study scattering amplitudes for that problem. We also study the role of a dilatation of the spatial coordinate leading to a q-deformed supersymmetric algebra. An explicit model for the scattering amplitude is constructed in terms of a hypergeometric function which corresponds to a reflectionless potential with infinitely many bound states.
