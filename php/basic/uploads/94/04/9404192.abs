Title: Density Correlation Functions in Calogero Sutherland Models
Authors: Joseph A. Minahan and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: Using arguments from two dimensional Yang-Mills theory and the collective coordinate formulation of the Calogero-Sutherland model, we conjecture the dynamical density correlation function for coupling $l$ and $1/l$, where $l$ is an integer. We present overwhelming evidence that the conjecture is indeed correct.
