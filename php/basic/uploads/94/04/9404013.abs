Title: Equivalent Sets of Histories and Multiple Quasiclassical Realms
Authors: Murray Gell-Mann and James B. Hartle
Abstract: We consider notions of physical equivalence of sets of histories in the quantum mechanics of a closed system. We show first how the same set of histories can be relabeled in various ways, including the use of the Heisenberg equations of motion and of passive transformations of field variables. In the the usual approximate quantum mechanics of a measured subsystem, two observables re- presented by different Hermitian operators are physically distinguished by the different apparatus used to measure them. In the quantum mechanics of a closed system, however, any apparatus is part of the system and the notion of physically distinct situations has a different character. We show that a triple consisting of an initial condition, a Hamiltonian, and a set of histories is physically equivalent to another triple if the operators representing these initial conditions, Hamiltonians, and histories are related by any fixed unitary transformation. We apply this result to the question of whether the universe might exhibit physically inequivalent quasiclassical realms (which we earlier called quasiclassical domains), not just the one that includes familiar experience. We describe how the probabilities of alternative forms, behaviors, and evolutionary histories of information gathering and utilizing systems (IGUSes) using the usual quasiclassical realm could in principle be calculated in quantum cosmology, although it is, of course, impractical to perform the computations. We discuss how, in principle, the probabilities of occurence of IGUSes could be calculated in realms distinct from the usual quasiclassical one. We discuss how IGUSes adapted mainly to two different realms could draw inferences about each other using a hybrid realm consisting of alternatives drawn from each.
