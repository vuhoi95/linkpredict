Title: Exponential behavior of a quantum system in a macroscopic medium
Authors: Hiromichi Nakazato and Mikio Namiki and Saverio Pascazio
Abstract: An exponential behavior at all times is derived for a solvable dynamical model in the weak-coupling, macroscopic limit. Some implications for the quantum measurement problem are discussed, in particular in connection with dissipation.
