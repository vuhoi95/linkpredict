Title: BFV Quantization of Relativistic Spinning Particles with a Single  Bosonic Constraint
Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Arvind N. Vaidya
Abstract: Using the BFV approach we quantize a pseudoclassical model of the spin one half relativistic particle that contains a single bosonic constraint, contrary to the usual locally supersymmetric models that display first and second class constraints.
