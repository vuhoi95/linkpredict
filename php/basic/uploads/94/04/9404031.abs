Title: Spectral sum rules and finite volume partition function in gauge  theories with real and pseudoreal fermions
Authors: A. Smilga and J. Verbaarschot
Abstract: Based on the chiral symmetry breaking pattern and the corresponding low-energy effective lagrangian, we determine the fermion mass dependence of the partition function and derive sum rules for eigenvalues of the QCD Dirac operator in finite Euclidean volume. Results are given for $N_c = 2$ and for Yang-Mills theory coupled to several light adjoint Majorana fermions. They coincide with those derived earlier in the framework of random matrix theory.
