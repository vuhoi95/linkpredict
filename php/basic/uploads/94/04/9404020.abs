Title: Renormalization group effects in the conformal sector of 4d quantom  gravity with matter
Authors: S. Odintsov and R. Percacci
Abstract: We discuss the ``gravitationally dressed'' beta functions in the Gross--Neveu model interacting with 2d Liouville theory and in $SU(N)$ gauge theory interacting with the conformal sector of 4d quantum gravity. Among the effects that we suggest may feel the gravitational dressing are the minimum of the effective potential and the running of the gauge coupling.
