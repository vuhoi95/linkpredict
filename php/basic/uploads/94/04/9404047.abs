Title: Conformal Properties of Chern-Simons Vortices in External Fields
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horv√°thy and L. Palla
Abstract: The construction and the symmetries of Chern-Simons vortices in harmonic and uniform magnetic force backgrounds found by Ezawa, Hotta and Iwazaki, and by Jackiw and Pi are generalized using the non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type framework presented in our previous paper. All Schr\"odinger-symmetric backgrounds are determined. (10 pages. PlainTex)
