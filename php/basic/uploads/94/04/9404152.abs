Authors: Changrim Ahn and Kong-Ju-Bock Lee and Soonkeon Nam
Abstract: We use thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to study nonrelativistic scattering theory of low energy excitations of 1D Hubbard model, using the $S$-matrices proposed by E\ss ler and Korepin. This model can be described by two types of excitation states, holons and spinons, as asymptotic states. In the attractive regime, the spinon is massive while the holon is massless. The situation is reversed with a repulsive coupling. We derive that the central charge of the Hubbard model in the IR limit is $c=1$ while it vanishes in the UV limit. The contribution is due to the massless degree of freedom, i.e. the holon for the attractive regime, and the massive mode decouples completely. This result is consistent with various known results based on lattice Bethe ansatz computations. Our results make it possible to use the $S$-matrices of the excitations to compute more interesting quantities like correlation functions.
