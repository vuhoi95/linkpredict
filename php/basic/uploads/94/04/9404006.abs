Title: Supersymmetry, Trace Anomaly and Naked Singularities
Authors: R. Kallosh and T. Ortin
Abstract: We discuss stationary supersymmetric bosonic configurations of the Einstein-Maxwell theory embedded in $N=2$ supergravity. Some of these configurations, including the Kerr-Newman solutions with $m = |q|$ and arbitrary angular momentum per unit mass $a$, exhibit naked singularities. However, $N=2$ supergravity has trace anomaly. The nonvanishing anomalous energy-momentum tensor of these Kerr-Newman solutions violates a consistency condition for a configuration to admit unbroken supersymmetry. Thus, the trace anomaly of this theory prevents the supersymmetric solutions from exhibiting naked singularities.
