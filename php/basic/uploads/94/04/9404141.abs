Title: Exact Bethe Ansatz solution for $A_{n-1}$ chains with non-$SU_{q}(n)$  invariant open boundary conditions
Authors: H. J. de Vega and A. Gonz√°lez--Ruiz
Abstract: The Nested Bethe Ansatz is generalized to open and independent boundary conditions depending on two continuous and two discrete free parameters. This is used to find the exact eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the $A_{n-1}$ vertex models and $SU(n)$ spin chains with such boundary conditions. The solution is found for all diagonal families of solutions to the reflection equations in all possible combinations. The Bethe ansatz equations are used to find de first order finite size correction.
