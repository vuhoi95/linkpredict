Title: Spin Transmutation in (2+1) Dimensions
Authors: Wei Chen and Chigak Itoi
Abstract: We study a relativistic anyon model with a spin-$j$ matter field minimally coupled to a statistical gauge potential governed by the Chern-Simons dynamics with a statistical parameter $\alpha$. A spin and statistics transmutation is shown in terms of a continuous random walk method. An integer or odd-half-integer part of $\alpha$ can be reabsorbed by change of $j$. We discuss the equivalence of a large class of (infinite number) Chern-Simons matter models for given $j$ and $\alpha$.
