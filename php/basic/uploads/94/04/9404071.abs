Title: The Instability of Charged Black Strings and p-Branes
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Raymond Laflamme
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of small perturbations around charged black strings and branes which are solutions of low energy string theory. We give the details of the analysis for the uncharged case which was summarized in a previous paper. We extend the analysis to the small charge case and give also an analysis for the generic case, following the behavior of unstable modes as the charge is modified. We study specifically a magnetically charged black 6-brane, but show how the instability is generic, and that charge does not in general stabilise black strings and p-branes.
