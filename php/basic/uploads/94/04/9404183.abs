Title: Gauge Field Improvement,Form-Scalar Duality and Conformal Invariance
Authors: S. Deser and A. Schwimmer
Abstract: The problem of maintaining scale and conformal invariance in Maxwell and general N-form gauge theories away from their critical dimension d=2(N+1) is analyzed.We first exhibit the underlying group-theoretical clash between locality,gauge,Lorentz and conformal invariance require- ments. "Improved" traceless stress tensors are then constructed;each violates one of the above criteria.However,when d=N+2,there is a duality equivalence between N-form models and massless scalars.Here we show that conformal invariance is not lost,by constructing a quasilocal gauge invariant improved stress tensor.The correlators of the scalar theory are then reproduced,including the latter's trace anomaly.
