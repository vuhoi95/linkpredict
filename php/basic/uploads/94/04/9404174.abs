Title: Multiple Ising Spins Coupled to 2d Quantum Gravity
Authors: M. G. Harris and J. F. Wheater
Abstract: We study a model in which p independent Ising spins are coupled to 2d quantum gravity (in the form of dynamical planar phi-cubed graphs). Consideration is given to the p tends to infinity limit in which the partition function becomes dominated by certain graphs; we identify most of these graphs. A truncated model is solved exactly providing information about the behaviour of the full model in the limit of small beta. Finally, we derive a bound for the critical value of the coupling constant, beta_c and examine the magnetization transition in the limit p tends to zero.
