Title: On N=1 Superconformal Algebra in the Non-Critical Bosonic String Theory
Authors: Pablo M. Llatas and Shibaji Roy
Abstract: In a recent work it has been shown that the bosonic strings could be embedded into a special class of $N=1$ fermionic strings. We argue that the superpartners of any physical state in the spectrum of this fermionic string is non-physical. So, there is no supersymmetry in the space of physical states and the embedding is, in this sense, ``trivial''. We here propose two different constructions as possible candidates of non-trivial embeddings of the non-critical bosonic strings into some special class of $N=1$ fermionic strings of which one is the non-critical NSR string. The BRST charge of the $N=1$ fermionic strings in both cases decompose as $Q_{N=1} = Q_B + {\tilde Q}$, where $Q_B$ is the BRST charge of the bosonic string.
