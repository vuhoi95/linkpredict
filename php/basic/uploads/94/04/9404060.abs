Title: Generalized coordinates on the phase space of Yang-Mills theory
Authors: R. Loll and J. M. Mourao and J. N. Tavares
Abstract: We study the suitability of complex Wilson loop variables as (generalized) coordinates on the physical phase space of $SU(2)$-Yang-Mills theory. To this end, we construct a natural one-to-one map from the physical phase space of the Yang-Mills theory with compact gauge group $G$ to a subspace of the physical configuration space of the complex $G^\C$-Yang-Mills theory. Together with a recent result by Ashtekar and Lewandowski this implies that the complex Wilson loop variables form a complete set of generalized coordinates on the physical phase space of $SU(2)$-Yang-Mills theory. They also form a generalized canonical loop algebra. Implications for both general relativity and gauge theory are discussed.
