Title: High energy QCD as a completely integrable model
Authors: L. D. Faddeev and G. P. Korchemsky
Abstract: We show that the one-dimensional lattice model proposed by Lipatov to describe the high energy scattering of hadrons in multicolor QCD is completely integrable. We identify this model as the XXX Heisenberg chain of noncompact spin $s=0$ and find the conservation laws of the model. A generalized Bethe ansatz is developed for the diagonalization of the hamiltonian and for the calculation of hadron-hadron scattering amplitude.
