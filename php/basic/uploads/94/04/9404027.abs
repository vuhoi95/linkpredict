Title: An Algebraic Approach to Solving Evolution Problems in Some Nonlinear  Quantum Models
Authors: Valery P. Karassiov and Andrei B. Klimov
Abstract: A new general Lie-algebraic approach is proposed to solving evolution tasks in some nonlinear problems of quantum physics with polynomially deformed Lie algebras $su_{pd}(2)$ as their dynamic symmetry algebras. The method makes use of an expansion of the evolution operators by power series in the $su_{pd}(2)$ shift operators and a (recursive) reduction of finding coefficient functions to solving auxiliary exactly solvable $su(2)$ problems with quadratic Hamiltonians.
