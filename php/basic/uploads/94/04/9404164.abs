Title: Induced Parity Violation in Odd Dimensions
Authors: R. Delbourgo and A. B. Waites
Abstract: One of the interesting features about field theories in odd dimensions is the induction of parity violating terms and well-defined {\em finite} topological actions via quantum loops if a fermion mass term is originally present and conversely. Aspects of this issue are illustrated for electrodynamics in 2+1 and 4+1 dimensions. (3 uuencoded Postscript Files are appended at the end of the TexFile.)
