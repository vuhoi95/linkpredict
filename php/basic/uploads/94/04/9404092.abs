Title: Dynamical Topology Change in String Theory
Authors: E. Kiritsis and C. Kounnas
Abstract: Exact string solutions are presented, providing backgrounds where a dynamical change of topology is occuring. This is induced by the time variation of a modulus field. Some lessons are drawn concerning the region of validity of effective theories and how they can be glued together, using stringy information in the region where the topology changes.
