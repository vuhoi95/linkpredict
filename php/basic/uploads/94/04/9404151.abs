Title: String Theory on K3 Surfaces
Authors: P. S. Aspinwall and D. R. Morrison
Abstract: The moduli space of N=(4,4) string theories with a K3 target space is determined, establishing in particular that the discrete symmetry group is the full integral orthogonal group of an even unimodular lattice of signature (4,20). The method combines an analysis of the classical theory of K3 moduli spaces with mirror symmetry. A description of the moduli space is also presented from the viewpoint of quantum geometry, and consequences are drawn concerning mirror symmetry for algebraic K3 surfaces.
