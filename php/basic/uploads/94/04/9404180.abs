Title: On string cosmology and the RG flow in 2d field theory
Authors: C. Schmidhuber and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: Time-dependent solutions of bosonic string theory resemble renormalisation group trajectories in the space of 2d field theories: they often interpolate between repulsive and attractive static solutions. It is shown that the attractive static solutions are those whose spatial sections are minima of |\bar c-25|, where \bar c is the `c-function'. The size of the domain of attraction of such a solution may be a measure of the probability of the corresponding string vacuum. Our discussion has also an implication for the RG flow in theories coupled to dynamical 2d gravity: the flow from models with c>25 to models with c<25 is forbidden.
