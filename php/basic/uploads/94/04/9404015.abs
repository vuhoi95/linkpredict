Title: Self-Dual Charged Vortices of Finite Energy per Unit Length in $3+1$  Dimensions
Authors: Pijush K. Ghosh and Avinash Khare
Abstract: We obtain both topological as well as nontopological self-dual charged vortex solutions of finite energy per unit length in a generalized abelian Higgs model in $3+1$ dimensions. In this model the Bogomol'nyi bound on the energy per unit length is obtained as a linear combination of the magnetic flux and the electric charge per unit length.
