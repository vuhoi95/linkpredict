Title: Reality of Complex Affine Toda Solitons
Authors: Z. Zhu and D. G. Caldi
Abstract: There are infinitely many topological solitons in any given complex affine Toda theories and most of them have complex energy density. When we require the energy density of the solitons to be real, we find that the reality condition is related to a simple ``pairing condition.'' Unfortunately, rather few soliton solutions in these theories survive the reality constraint, especially if one also demands positivity. The resulting implications for the physical applicability of these theories are briefly discussed.
