Title: The supersymmetric version of the Green--Schwarz anomaly cancellation  mechanism
Authors: A. Candiello and K. Lechner
Abstract: The $N=1$, $D=10$ Supergravity--Super--Yang--Mills (SUGRA-SYM) theory is plagued by ABBJ gauge and Lorentz anomalies which are cancelled via the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. Due to the fact that the ABBJ anomalies are not invariant under supersymmetry (SUSY) transformations one concludes that the theory is plagued also by a SUSY anomaly. For the gauge groups $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ we compute this SUSY anomaly, by solving a coupled cohomology problem, and we show that it can be cancelled by subtracting from the action the known Green--Schwarz counterterm, the same which cancels also the ABBJ anomaly, the expected result. Finally, we argue that the corresponding mechanism does not apply in the dual SUGRA-SYM, related to the heterotic five-brane.
