Title: Observable algebra for the rational and trigonometric Euler Calogero  Moser models
Authors: J. Avan and E. Billey
Abstract: We construct polynomial Poisson algebras of observables for the classical Euler-Calogero-Moser (ECM) models. The conserved Hamiltonians and symmetry algebras derived in a previous work are subsets of these algebras. We define their linear, $N \rightarrow \infty$ limits, realizing $\w_{\infty}$ type algebras coupled to current algebras.
