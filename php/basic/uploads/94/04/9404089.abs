Title: Arbitrary Superspin Massive Superparticles
Authors: S. M. Kuzenko and S. L. Lyakhovich and A. Yu. Segal
Abstract: We propose the action for a massive $N$-extended superparticle with a pure (half)integer superspin $Y,~Y = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots$. Regardless of the superspin value, the configuration space is ${\Bbb R}^{4|4N} \times S^2$, where $S^2$ corresponds to spinning degrees of freedom. Being explicitly super-Poincar\'e invariant, the model possesses two gauge symmetries implying strong conservation of the squared momentum and superspin. Hamilton constrained dynamics is developed and canonical quantization is studied. For $N$ = 1 we show that the physical super wave-functions are to be on-shell massive chiral superfields. Central-charges generalizations of the model are given.
