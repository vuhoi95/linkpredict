Title: Spinons in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: D. Bernard and V. Pasquier and D. Serban
Abstract: We study the $su(2)$ conformal field theory in its spinon description, adapted to the Yangian invariance. By evaluating the action of the Yangian generators on the primary fields, we find a new connection between this conformal field theory and the Calogero-Sutherland model with $su(2)$ spin. We use this connection to describe how the spinons are the quasi-particles spanning the irreducible Yangian multiplet, and also to exhibit operators creating the $N$-spinon highest weight vectors.
