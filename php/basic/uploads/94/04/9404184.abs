Title: Mirror Symmetry as a Gauge Symmetry
Authors: Amit Giveon and Edward Witten
Abstract: It is shown that in string theory mirror duality is a gauge symmetry (a Weyl transformation) in the moduli space of $N=2$ backgrounds on group manifolds, and we conjecture on the possible generalization to other backgrounds, such as Calabi-Yau manifolds.
