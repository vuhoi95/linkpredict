Title: Conservation laws for the classical Toda field theories
Authors: E. G. B. Hohler and K. Olaussen
Abstract: We have performed some explicit calculations of the conservation laws for classical (affine) Toda field theories, and some generalizations of these models. We show that there is a huge class of generalized models which have an infinite set of conservation laws, with their integrated charges being in involution. Amongst these models we find that only the $A_m$ and $A_m^{(1)}$ ($m\ge 2$) Toda field theories admit such conservation laws for spin-3. We report on our explicit calculations of spin-4 and spin-5 conservation laws in the (affine) Toda models. Our perhaps most interesting finding is that there exist conservation laws in the $A_m$ models ($m\ge4)$ which have a different origin than the exponents of the corresponding affine theory or the energy-momentum tensor of a conformal theory.
