Authors: A. Ballesteros and F. J. Herranz and M. A. del Olmo and M. Santander
Abstract: An embedding method to get $q$-deformations for the non--semisimple algebras generating the motion groups of $N$--dimensional flat spaces is presented. This method gives a global and simultaneous scheme of $q$-deformation for all $iso(p,q)$ algebras and for those ones obtained from them by some In\"on\"u--Wigner contractions, such as the $N$--dimensional Euclidean, Poincar\'e and Galilei algebras.
