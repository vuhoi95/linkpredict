Title: On $W_{\infty/2}$ Strings
Authors: C. M. Hull and Z. Khatun
Abstract: The string theory defined by gauging $\W_{\infty/2}$, the sub-algebra of $\W_{\infty}$ generated by the currents of even spin, is discussed. The critical value of the central charge is calculated using zeta-function techniques and shown to be $c=1$. A critical string theory is constructed by coupling a free boson to $\W_{\infty/2}$-gravity and the physical states are analysed.
