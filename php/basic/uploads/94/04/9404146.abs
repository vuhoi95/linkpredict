Title: Phase Space Structure of Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Particles
Authors: Myung-Ho Kim and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We investigate the classical phase space structure of $N$ $SU(n+1)$ non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles by first constructing the product space of associated $SU(n+1)$ bundle with ${\bf CP}^n$ as the fiber. We calculate the Poisson bracket using the symplectic structure on the associated bundle and find that the minimal substitution in the presence of external gauge fields is equivalent to the modification of symplectic structure by the addition of field strength two form. Then, we take a direct product of the associated bundle by the space of all connections and choose a specific connection by the condition of vanishing momentum map corresponding to the gauge transformation, thus recovering the quantum mechanical model of NACS particles in Ref.\cite{lo1}.
