Title: q-deformed Dirac Monopole With Arbitrary Charge
Authors: Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: We construct the deformed Dirac monopole on the quantum sphere for arbitrary charge using two different methods and show that it is a quantum principal bundle in the sense of Brzezinski and Majid. We also give a connection and calculate the analog of its Chern number by integrating the curvature over $S^2_q$.
