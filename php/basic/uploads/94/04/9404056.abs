Title: Toda Lattice Hierarchy and the Topological Description of the c=1 String  Theory
Authors: T. Eguchi and H. Kanno
Abstract: The Toda lattice hierarchy is discussed in connection with the topological description of the $c=1$ string theory compactified at the self-dual radius. It is shown that when special constraints are imposed on the Toda hierarchy, it reproduces known results of the $c=1$ string theory, in particular the $W_{1+\infty}$ relations among tachyon correlation functions. These constraints are the analogues of string equations in the topological minimal theories. We also point out that at $c=1$ the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential becomes simply a $U(1)$ current operator.
