Title: Unified View of Deformed Single - Mode Oscillator Algebras
Authors: S. Meljanac and M. Milekovic and S. Pallua
Abstract: A general framework for the deformation of the single-mode oscillators is presented and all deformed single-mode oscillators are unified. The extensions of the Aric-Coon, genon, the para-Bose and the para-Fermi oscillators are proposed. The generalized harmonic oscillator considered by Brzezinski et al. is rederived in a simple way.Some remarks on deformation of $SU(1,1)$ and supersymmetry are made.
