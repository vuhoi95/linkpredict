Title: Persistent Current of Free Electrons in the Plane
Authors: Alain Comtet and Alexander Moroz and St√©phane Ouvry
Abstract: Predictions of Akkermans et al. are essentially changed when the Krein spectral displacement operator is regularized by means of zeta function. Instead of piecewise constant persistent current of free electrons on the plane one has a current which varies linearly with the flux and is antisymmetric with regard to all time preserving values of $\alpha$ including $1/2$. Different self-adjoint extensions of the problem and role of the resonance are discussed.
