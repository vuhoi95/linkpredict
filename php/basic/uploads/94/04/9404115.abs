Title: Topological Matter in Four Dimensions
Authors: M. Alvarez and J. M. F. Labastida
Abstract: Topological models involving matter couplings to Donaldson-Witten theory are presented. The construction is carried using both, the topological algebra and its central extension, which arise from the twisting of $N=2$ supersymmetry in four dimensions. The framework in which the construction is based is constituted by the superspace associated to these algebras. The models show new features of topological quantum field theories which could provide either a mechanism for topological symmetry breaking, or the analog of two-dimensional mirror symmetry in four dimensions.
