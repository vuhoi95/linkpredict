Title: Distances on a Lattice from Non-commutative Geometry
Authors: G. Bimonte and F. Lizzi and G. Sparano
Abstract: Using the tools of noncommutative geometry we calculate the distances between the points of a lattice on which the usual discretized Dirac operator has been defined. We find that these distances do not have the expected behaviour, revealing that from the metric point of view the lattice does not look at all as a set of points sitting on the continuum manifold. We thus have an additional criterion for the choice of the discretization of the Dirac operator.
