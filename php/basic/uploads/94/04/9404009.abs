Title: $N=2$ Topological Yang-Mills Theories and Donaldson's Polynomials
Authors: S. Hyun and J. -S. Park
Abstract: The $N=2$ topological Yang-Mills and holomorphic Yang-Mills theories on simply connected compact K\"{a}hler surfaces with $p_g\geq 1$ are reexamined. The $N=2$ symmetry is clarified in terms of a Dolbeault model of the equivariant cohomology. We realize the non-algebraic part of Donaldson's polynomial invariants as well as the algebraic part. We calculate Donaldson's polynomials on $H^{2,0}(S,\BZ)\oplus H^{0,2}(S,\BZ)$.
