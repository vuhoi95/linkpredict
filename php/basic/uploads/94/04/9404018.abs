Title: The Nappi-Witten example and gravitational waves
Authors: C. Duval and Z. Horváth and P. A. Horváthy
Abstract: The vanishing of the anomaly in the recent example of Nappi and Witten, constructed from the Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on a certain non-semisimple group, follows from a more general result valid for gravitational waves. The construction of the metric is explained.}
