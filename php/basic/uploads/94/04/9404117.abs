Title: Variational Formulation of Linear Time-Dependent Invariants
Authors: O. Castaños and R. López-Peña and V. I. Man'ko
Abstract: It is shown that linear time-dependent invariants for arbitrary multi\-dimensional quadratic systems can be obtained from the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation procedures by considering a variation of coordinates and momenta that follows the classical trajectory and defines a noetherian symmetry transformation.
