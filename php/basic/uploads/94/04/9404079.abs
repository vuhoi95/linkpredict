Title: The solution to Wheeler-DeWitt is eight
Authors: E. Adi and S. Solomon
Abstract: We describe a new geometrical solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in two dimensional quantum gravity. The solution is the amplitude of a surface whose boundary consists of two tangent loops. We further discuss a new method for estimating singular geometries amplitudes, which uses explicit recursive counting of discrete surfaces.
