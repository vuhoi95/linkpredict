Title: Electromagnetic Fields in a Thermal Background
Authors: Per Elmfors and Bo-Sture Skagerstam
Abstract: The one--loop effective action for a slowly varying electromagnetic field is computed at finite temperature and density using a real-time formalism. We discuss the gauge invariance of the result. Corrections to the Debye mass from an electric field are computed at high temperature and high density. The effective coupling constant, defined from a purely electric weak--field expansion, behaves at high temperature very differently from the case of a magnetic field, and does not satisfy the renormalization group equation. The issue of pair production in the real--time formalism is discussed and also its relevance for heavy--ion collisions.
