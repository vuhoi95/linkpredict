Title: Squeezing in a 2-D generalized oscillator
Authors: O. Castaños and R. López-Peña and V. I. Man'ko
Abstract: A two-dimensional generalized oscillator with time-dependent parameters is considered to study the two-mode squeezing phenomena. Specific choices of the parameters are used to determine the dispersion matrix and analytic expressions, in terms of standard hermite polynomials, of the wavefunctions and photon distributions.
