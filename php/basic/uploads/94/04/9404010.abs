Title: Lattice Computation of the Effective Potential in O(2)-Invariant  $λΦ^4$ Theory
Authors: A. Agodi and G. Andronico and M. Consoli
Abstract: We present a lattice computation of the effective potential for O(2)-invariant $(\lambda\Phi^4)_4$ theory in the region of bare parameters corresponding to a classically scale-invariant theory. As expected from ``triviality'' and as in the one-component theory, we find very good agreement with the one-loop prediction, while a perturbative leading-log improvement of the effective potential fails to reproduce the Monte Carlo data. The mass $m_h$ of the free shifted radial field is related to the renormalized vacuum expectation value $v_R$ through the same relation $m^2_h=8\pi^2 v^2_R$ as in the one-component case. This confirms the prediction of a weakly interacting 2.2 TeV Higgs particle in the standard model.
