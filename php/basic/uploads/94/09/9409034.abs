Title: Inside a Spinning Black String
Authors: J. S. F. Chan and R. B. Mann
Abstract: We show that mass inflation occurs inside spinning black cosmic string, which is a solution of a low-energy effective string theory in $(3+1)$-dimensions. This confirms Poisson and Israel's conjecture that the inner mass parameter diverges even if spacetime is not spherically symmetric.
