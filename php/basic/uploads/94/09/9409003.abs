Title: Gauge-Yukawa Unification in Asymptotically Non-free Theories
Authors: Jisuke Kubo and Myriam Mondragon and Nicholas D. Tracas and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We study asymptotically non-free gauge theories and search for renormalization group invariant (i.e. technically natural) relations among the couplings which lead to successful gauge-Yukawa unification. To be definite, we consider a supersymmetric model based on $SU(4)\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L}$. It is found that among the couplings of the model, which can be expressed in this way by a single one in the lowest order approximation, are the tree gauge couplings and the Yukawa coupling of the third generation. The corrections to the lowest order results are computed, and we find that the predictions on the low energy parameters resulting from those relations are in agreement with the measurements at LEP and Tevatron for a certain range of supersymmetry breaking scale.
