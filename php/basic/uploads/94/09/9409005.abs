Title: Magnetic screening properties of an incompressible chiral fluid
Authors: Pietro Donatis and Roberto Iengo
Abstract: We study the possible penetration of a static magnetic field in an idealized sample of many layers supporting a two dimensional charged chiral quantum fluid, to see whether there is a kind of Meissner effect. This is a non standard problem since the quantum fluid is incompressible having a gap in its spectrum. We find that the system shows an intermediate behaviour between superconducting and non-superconducting fluids, the magnetic field being screened or not depending on its orientation relative to the layers.
