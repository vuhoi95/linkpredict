Title: Trees, forests and jungles: a botanical garden for cluster expansions
Authors: A. Abdesselam and V. Rivasseau
Abstract: Combinatoric formulas for cluster expansions have been improved many times over the years. Here we develop some new combinatoric proofs and extensions of the tree formulas of Brydges and Kennedy, and test them on a series of pedagogical examples.
