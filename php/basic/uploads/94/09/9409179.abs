Title: A Unified Approach to Solvable Models of Dilaton Gravity in  Two-Dimensions Based on Symmetry
Authors: Y. Kazama and Y. Satoh and A. Tsuchiya
Abstract: A large class of solvable models of dilaton gravity in two space-time dimensions, capable of describing black hole geometry, are analyzed in a unified way as non-linear sigma models possessing a special symmetry. This symmetry, which can be neatly formulated in the target-space-covariant manner, allows one to decompose the non-linearly interacting dilaton-gravity system into a free field and a field satisfying the Liouville equation with in general non-vanishing cosmological term. In this formulation, all the existent models are shown to fall into the category with vanishing cosmological constant. General analysis of the space-time structureinduced by a matter shock wave is performed and new models, with and without the cosmological term, are discussed.
