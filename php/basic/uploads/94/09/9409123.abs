Title: Topological Terms in String Theory on Orbifolds
Authors: M. Sakamoto and M. Tachibana
Abstract: We study toroidal orbifold models with topologically invariant terms in the path integral formalism and give physical interpretations of the terms from an operator formalism point of view. We briefly discuss a possibility of a new class of modular invariant orbifold models.
