Title: Deformed Poincare Algebra and Field Theory
Authors: Alexandros A. Kehagias and Patrick A. A. Meessen and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We examine deformed Poincar\'e algebras containing the exact Lorentz algebra. We impose constraints which are necessary for defining field theories on these algebras and we present simple field theoretical examples. Of particular interest is a case that exhibits improved renormalization properties.
