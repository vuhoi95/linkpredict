Title: One-Loop Corrections to Two-Quark Three-Gluon Amplitudes
Authors: Z. Bern and L. Dixon and D. A. Kosower
Abstract: We present the one-loop QCD amplitudes for two external massless quarks and three external gluons ($\bar{q}qggg$). This completes the set of one-loop amplitudes needed for the next-to-leading-order corrections to three-jet production at hadron colliders. We also discuss how to use group theory and supersymmetry to minimize the amount of calculation required for the more general case of one-loop two-quark $n$-gluon amplitudes. We use collinear limits to provide a stringent check on the amplitudes.
