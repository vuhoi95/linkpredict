Title: Remarks on Non-Abelian Duality
Authors: S. Elitzur and A. Giveon and E. Rabinovici and A. Schwimmer and G. Veneziano
Abstract: A class of two-dimensional globally scale-invariant, but not conformally invariant, theories is obtained. These systems are identified in the process of discussing global and local scaling properties of models related by duality transformations, based on non-semisimple isometry groups. The construction of the dual partner of a given model is followed through; non-local as well as local versions of the former are discussed.
