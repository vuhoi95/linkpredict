Title: Anomalous dimension of the gluon operator in pure Yang-Mills theory
Authors: B. W. Harris and J. Smith
Abstract: We present new one loop calculations that confirm the theorems of Joglekar and Lee on the renormalization of composite operators. We do this by considering physical matrix elements with the operators inserted at non-zero momentum. The resulting IR singularities are regulated dimensionally. We show that the physical matrix element of the BRST exact gauge variant operator which appears in the energy- momentum tensor is zero. We then show that the physical matrix elements of the classical energy-momentum tensor and the gauge invariant twist two gluon operator are independent of the gauge fixing parameter. A Sudakov factor appears in the latter cases. The universality of this factor and the UV finiteness of the energy-momentum tensor provide another method of finding the anomalous dimension of the gluon operator. We conjecture that this method applies to higher loops and takes full advantage of the triangularity of the mixing matrix.
