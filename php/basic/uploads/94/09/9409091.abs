Title: A Measure on a Subspace of FRW Solutions and ``The Flatness Problem" of  Standard Cosmology
Authors: H. T. Cho and R. Kantowski
Abstract: We use the metric on the space of gravity fields given by DeWitt to construct a unique kinematic measure on the space of FRW simple fluids and show that when the mass parameter $\Omega$ is used as a coordinate this measure is singular at $\Omega = 1$. This singularity, combined with the time evolution of $\Omega$, distorts distributions of $\Omega$ values to be concentrated in the neighborhood of 1 at early times. It is a distorted distribution of $\Omega$ values that sometimes misleads the casual observer to conclude that $\Omega$ must be exactly equal to 1.
