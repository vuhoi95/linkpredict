Title: On Orbifolds with Discrete Torsion
Authors: Cumrun Vafa and Edward Witten
Abstract: We consider the interpretation in classical geometry of conformal field theories constructed from orbifolds with discrete torsion. In examples we can analyze, these spacetimes contain ``stringy regions'' that from a classical point of view are singularities that are to be neither resolved nor blown up. Some of these models also give particularly simple and clear examples of mirror symmetry.
