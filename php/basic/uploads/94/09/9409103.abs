Title: Anomaly and Thermodynamics for 2D Spinors in the Aharonov--Bohm Gauge  Field
Authors: P. Giacconi and F. Maltoni and R. Soldati
Abstract: The axial anomaly is computed for Euclidean Dirac fermions on the plane. The dependence upon the self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac operator is investigated and its relevance concerning the second virial coefficient of the anyon gas is discussed.
