Title: Higgs signals modified by singlet scalars
Authors: T. Binoth and J. J. van der Bij
Abstract: The influence of massless scalar singlets on Higgs signals is discussed. It is shown, that in the case of strong interactions between the Higgs boson and the singlet fields, signals could be suppressed in such a way, that detection of the Higgs boson becomes impossible.
