Title: Massive Superstrings are Black Holes
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Thomas W. Kephart
Abstract: We argue that it is inconsistent to ignore the gravitational backreaction for on-shell superstring states at the Planck mass and beyond, and that these quantum states become Kerr black holes in the classical limit. Consequences are discussed.
