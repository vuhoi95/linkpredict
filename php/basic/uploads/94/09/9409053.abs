Title: Closedness of star products and cohomologies
Authors: Mosh√© Flato and Daniel Sternheimer
Abstract: We first review the introduction of star products in connection with deformations of Poisson brackets and the various cohomologies that are related to them. Then we concentrate on what we have called ``closed star products" and their relations with cyclic cohomology and index theorems. Finally we shall explain how quantum groups, especially in their recent topological form, are in essence examples of star products.
