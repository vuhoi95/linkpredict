Title: Characterizing Invariants for Local Extensions of Current Algebras
Authors: K. -H. Rehren and Ya. S. Stanev and I. T. Todorov
Abstract: Pairs $\aa \subset \bb$ of local quantum field theories are studied, where $\aa$ is a chiral conformal \qft and $\bb$ is a local extension, either chiral or two-dimensional. The local correlation functions of fields from $\bb$ have an expansion with respect to $\aa$ into \cfb s, which are non-local in general. Two methods of computing characteristic invariant ratios of structure constants in these expansions are compared: $(a)$ by constructing the monodromy \rep of the braid group in the space of solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov differential equation, and $(b)$ by an analysis of the local subfactors associated with the extension with methods from operator algebra (Jones theory) and algebraic quantum field theory. Both approaches apply also to the reverse problem: the characterization and (in principle) classification of local extensions of a given theory.
