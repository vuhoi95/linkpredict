Title: Interaction Hierarchy
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy
Abstract: We analyse a new class of statistical systems, which simulate different systems of random surfaces on a lattice. Geometrical hierarchy of the energy functionals on which these theories are based produces corresponding hierarchy of the surface dynamics and of the phase transitions. We specially consider 3D gonihedric system and have found that it is equivalent to the propagation of almost free 2D Ising fermions. We construct dual statistical system with new matchbox spin variable $G_{\xi}$, high temperature expansion of which equally well describe these surfaces.
