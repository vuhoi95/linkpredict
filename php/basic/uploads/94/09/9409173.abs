Title: Accuracy of the Semi--Classical Approximation: the Pullen Edmonds  Hamiltonian
Authors: S. Graffi and V. R. Manfredi and L. Salasnich
Abstract: A test on the numerical accuracy of the semiclassical approximation as a function of the principal quantum number has been performed for the Pullen--Edmonds model, a two--dimensional, non--integrable, scaling invariant perturbation of the resonant harmonic oscillator. A perturbative interpretation is obtained of the recently observed phenomenon of the accuracy decrease on the approximation of individual energy levels at the increase of the principal quantum number. Moreover, the accuracy provided by the semiclassical approximation formula is on the average the same as that provided by quantum perturbation theory.
