Title: QCD Flux Tubes as Sigma Model Relics
Authors: K. M. Benson and A. V. Manohar and M. Saadi
Abstract: We describe flux tubes and their interactions in a low energy sigma model induced by $SU(\NF) \goto SO(\NF)$ flavor symmetry breaking in $SO(N_c)$ QCD. Gauge confinement manifests itself in the low energy theory through flux tube interactions with unscreened sources. The flux tubes which mediate confinement also illustrate an interesting ambiguity in defining global Alice strings.
