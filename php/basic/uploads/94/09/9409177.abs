Title: Stringy Twists of the Taub--Nut Metric
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: In the low-energy limit, string theory has two remarkable symmetries, O(d,d+p) and SL(2,R). We illustrate the use of these transformations as techniques to generate new solutions by applying them to the Taub--NUT metric.
