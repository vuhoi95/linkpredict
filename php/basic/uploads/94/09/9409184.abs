Title: Cyclic Permutations in Kazama-Suzuki String Models
Authors: G. Aldazabal and I. Allekotte and E. Andres and Carmen Nunez
Abstract: Moddings by cyclic permutation symmetries are performed in 4-dimensional strings, built up from N=2 coset models of the type $CP_m=SU(m+1)/SU(m)\times U(1)$. For some exemplifying cases, the massless chiral and antichiral states of $E_6$ are computed. The extent of the equivalence between different conformal invariant theories which possess equal chiral rings is analyzed.
