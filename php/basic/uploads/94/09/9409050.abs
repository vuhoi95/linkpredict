Title: Gauge Fields Emerging From Extra Dimensions a Born-Oppenheimer approach
Authors: T. Hatsuda and H. Kuratsuji
Abstract: We propose a dynamical mechanism to induce gauge fields in four dimensional space-time from a single scalar field or a spinor field in higher dimensions. The Born-Oppenheimer treatment of the extra dimensions is an essential ingredient in our approach. A possible applications of the idea to low dimensional condensed matter systems and high temperature field theory are also pointed out. This paper is an extended version of our previous unpublished work (SUNY-NTG-89-48, Jan. 1990).
