Title: Covariant Quantization of d=4 Brink-Schwarz Superparticle with Lorentz  Harmonics
Authors: S. O. Fedoruk and V. G. Zima
Abstract: The first and second covariant quantization of a free massless $d=4$ superparticle with pure gauge auxiliary spinor variables have been carried out. Arised chiral harmonic superfield corresponds to superparticle with finite superspin and it is interpreted as Radon transformation of free massless finite superspin superfield. A prescription for the second quantization procedure of harmonic fields has been formulated. Microcausality is achievable only under description of the particles by cohomology class of harmonic superfields with integer negative homogeneity index and ordinary connection between spin and statistics.
