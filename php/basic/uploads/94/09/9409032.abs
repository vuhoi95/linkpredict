Title: Finite Unification and Top Quark Mass
Authors: Jisuke Kubo and Myriam Mondragon and George Zoupanos
Abstract: In unified gauge theories there exist renormalization group invariant relations among gauge and Yukawa couplings that are compatible with perturbative renormalizability, which could be considered as a Gauge-Yukawa Unification. Such relations are even necessary to ensure all-loop finiteness in Finite Unified Theories, which have vanishing $\beta$-functions beyond the unification point. We elucidate this alternative way of unification, and then present its phenomenological consequences in $SU(5)$-based models.
