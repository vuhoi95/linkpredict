Title: (1,0) superparticle in a curved background and the full set of (1,0)  supergravity constraints
Authors: A. A. Deriglazov and A. V. Galajinsky
Abstract: The classical (1,0) superparticle in a curved superspace is considered. The minimal set of constraints to be imposed on the background for correct inclusion of interaction is found. The most general form of Siegel-type local fermionic symmetry is presented. Local algebra of the theory is shown to be closed off-shell and nontrivially deformed as compared to the flat one. The requirements leading to the full set of (1,0) supergravity constraints are presented.
