Title: On the non-relativistic limit of the quantum sine-Gordon model with  integrable boundary condition
Authors: A. Kapustin and S. Skorik
Abstract: We show that the the generalized Calogero-Moser model with boundary potential of the P\"oschl-Teller type describes the non-relativistic limit of the quantum sine-Gordon model on a half-line with Dirichlet boundary condition.
