Title: On Hurwitz Transformations
Authors: M. Hage Hassan and M. Kibler
Abstract: A bibliography on the Hurwitz transformations is given. We deal here, with some details, with two particular Hurwitz transformations, viz, the $\grq \to \grt$ Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation and its $\grh \to \grc$ compact extension. These transformations are derived in the context of Fock-Bargmann-Schwinger calculus with special emphasis on angular momentum theory.
