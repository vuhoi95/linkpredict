Title: Dual Statistical Systems and Geometrical String
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and K. G. Savvidy and P. G. Savvidy
Abstract: We analyse statistical system with interface energy proportional to the length of the edges of interface. We have found the dual system high temperature expansion of which equally well generates surfaces with linear amplitude. These dual systems are in the same relation as 3D Ising ferromagnet to the 3D Gauge spin system.
