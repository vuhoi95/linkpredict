Title: Integrals of motion of classical lattice sine-Gordon system
Authors: B. Enriquez and B. L. Feigin
Abstract: We compute the local integrals of motions of the classical limit of the lattice sine-Gordon system, using a geometrical interpretation of the local sine-Gordon variables. Using an analogous description of the screened local variables, we show that these integrals are in involution. We present some remarks on relations with the situation at roots of 1 and results on another latticisation (linked to the principal subalgebra of $\widehat{s\ell}_{2}$ rather than the homogeneous one). Finally, we analyse a module of ``screened semilocal variables'', on which the whole $\widehat{s\ell}_{2}$ acts.
