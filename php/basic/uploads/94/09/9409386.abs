Title: Higgs-Sector Solitons
Authors: C. Bachas and T. N. Tomaras
Abstract: We establish the existence of static, classically-stable, winding solitons in renormalizable three-dimensional gauge models, with topologically trivial target space and vacuum manifold. They are prototypes for possible analogous particle-like excitations in the higgs sector of the standard electroweak theory.
