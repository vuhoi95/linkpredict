Title: Bosonization on the lattice: the emergence of the higher harmonics
Authors: Jaime Ferrer and J. González and M. -A. Martín-Delgado
Abstract: A general and transparent procedure to bosonize fermions placed on a lattice is presented. Harmonics higher than $k_F$ are shown to appear in the one-paticle Green function, due to the compact character of real electron bands. Quantitative estimations of the role of these higher harmonics are made possible by the bosonization technique presented here.
