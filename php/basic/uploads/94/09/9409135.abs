Title: Solutions in Self-Dual Gravity Constructed Via Chiral Equations
Authors: H. Garcia-Compean and T. Matos
Abstract: The chiral model for self-dual gravity given by Husain in the context of the chiral equations approach is discussed. A Lie algebra corresponding to a finite dimensional subgroup of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms is found, and then use for expanding the Lie algebra valued connections associated with the chiral model. The self-dual metric can be explicitly given in terms of harmonic maps and in terms of a basis of this subalgebra.
