Title: Batalin-Tyutin Quantization of the Self-Dual Massive Theory in Three  Dimensions
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Young-Jai Park and Kee Yong Kim and Yongduk Kim
Abstract: We quantize the self-dual massive theory by using the Batalin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method, which systematically embeds second class constraint system into first class one in the extended phase space by introducing the new fields. Through this analysis we obtain simultaneously the St\"uckelberg scalar term related to the explicit gauge-breaking effect and the new type of Wess-Zumino action related to the Chern-Simons term.
