Title: Properties of Consistent Histories
Authors: Fay Dowker and Adrian Kent
Abstract: We describe some properties of consistent sets of histories in the Gell-Mann--Hartle formalism, and give an example to illustrate that one cannot recover the standard predictions, retrodictions and inferences of quasiclassical physics using the criterion of consistency alone.
