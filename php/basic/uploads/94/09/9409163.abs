Title: On the R-Matrix Formulation of Deformed Algebras and Generalized  Jordan-Wigner Transformations
Authors: S. Meljanac and M. Milekovic and A. Perica
Abstract: The deformed algebra $\cal{A(R)}$, depending upon a Yang-Baxter R- matrix, is considered. The conditions under which the algebra is associative are discussed for a general number of oscillators. Four types of solutions satisfying these conditions are constructed and two of them can be represented by generalized Jordan-Wigner transformations.Our analysis is in some sense an extension of the boson realization of fermions from single-mode to multimode oscillators.
