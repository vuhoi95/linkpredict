Title: Mirror Symmetry and An Exact Calculation of N-2 Point Correlation  Function on Calabi-Yau Manifold embedded in CP^{N-1}
Authors: Masao Jinzenji and Masaru Nagura
Abstract: We consider an (N-2)-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold which is defined as the zero locus of the polynomial of degree N (of Fermat type) in CP^{N-1} and its mirror manifold. We introduce the (N-2)-point correlation function (generalized Yukawa coupling) and evaluate it both by solving the Picard-Fuchs equation for period integrals in the mirror manifold and also by explicitly calculating the contribution of holomorphic maps of degree 1 to the Yukawa coupling in the Calabi-Yau manifold using the method of Algebraic geometry...
