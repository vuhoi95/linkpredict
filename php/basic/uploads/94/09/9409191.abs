Title: Collective-Field Excitations in the Calogero Model
Authors: I. AndriÄ‡ and V. Bardek and L. Jonke
Abstract: We consider the large-N Calogero model in the \h\ collective-field approach based on the $1/N$ expansion. The Bogomol'nyi limit appears and the corresponding equation for the semiclassical configuration gives the correct ground-state energy. Using the method of the orthogonal polynomial we find the excitation spectrum of density fluctuations around the semiclassical solution for any value of the statistical parametar $\l$. The wave functions of the excited states are explicitly constructed as a product of Hermite polynomials in terms of the collective modes.The two-point correlation function is calculated as a series expansion in $1/\rho$ for any intermediate statistics.
