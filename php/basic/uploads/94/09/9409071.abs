Title: Discrete-time Calogero-Moser Model and Lattice KP Equations
Authors: F. W. Nijhoff and G. D. Pang
Abstract: We introduce an integrable time-discretized version of the classical Calogero-Moser model, which goes to the original model in a continuum limit. This discrete model is obtained from pole solutions of a semi-discretized version of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, leading to a finite-dimensional symplectic mapping. Lax pair, symplectic structure and sufficient set of invariants of the discrete Calogero-Moser model are constructed for both the rational and elliptic cases. The classical $r$-matrix is the same as for the continuum model. An exact solution of the initial value problem is given for the rational discrete-time Calogero-Moser model. The pole-expansion and elliptic solutions of the fully discretized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation are also discussed.
