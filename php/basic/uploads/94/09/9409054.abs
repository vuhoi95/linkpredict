Title: A star-product approach to noncompact quantum groups
Authors: Frédéric Bidegain and Georges Pinczon
Abstract: Using duality and topological theory of well behaved Hopf algebras (as defined in [2]) we construct star-product models of non compact quantum groups from Drinfeld and Reshetikhin standard deformations of enveloping Hopf algebras of simple Lie algebras. Our star-products act not only on coefficient functions of finite-dimensional representations, but actually on all $C^\infty$ functions, and they exist even for non linear (semi-simple) Lie groups.
