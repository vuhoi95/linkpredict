Title: New Pseudoclassical model for Weyl particles
Authors: D. M. Gitman and A. E. Goncalves and I. V. Tyutin
Abstract: A new pseudoclassical model to describe Weyl particles is proposed. Different ways of its quantization are presented. They all lead to the theory of Weyl particle; namely, the massless Dirac equation and the Weyl condition are reproduced. In contrast with models discussed previously, this one admits both the Dirac quantization and quasicanonical quantization, with the fixation of almost all gauge freedom on the classical level.
