Title: Generalized Quon Statistics
Authors: Stjepan Meljanac and Ante Perica
Abstract: Generalized quons interpolating between Bose, Fermi, para-Bose, para-Fermi, and anyonic statistics are proposed. They follow from the R-matrix approach to deformed associative algebras. It is proved that generalized quons have the same main properties as quons. A new result for the number operator is presented and some physical features of generalized quons are discussed in the limit $|q_{ij}^{2}| \rightarrow 1$.
