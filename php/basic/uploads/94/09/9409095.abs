Title: Universal Behavior of Correlations between Eigenvalues of Random  Matrices
Authors: T. S. Kobayakawa and Y. Hatsugai and M. Kohmoto and A. Zee
Abstract: The universal connected correlations proposed recently between eigenvalues of unitary random matrices is examined numerically. We perform an ensemble average by the Monte Carlo sampling. Although density of eigenvalues and a bare correlation of the eigenvalues are not universal, the connected correlation shows a universal behavior after smoothing.
