Title: Hawking Radiation of Dirac Fields in the (2+1)-Dimensional Black Hole  space-time
Authors: S. Hyun and Y. -S. Song and J. H. Yee
Abstract: By calculating the response function, we study the Hawking radiation of massless Dirac fields in the (2+1)-dimensional black hole geometry. We find that the response function has Planck distributions, with the temperature that agrees with the previous results obtained for the scalar field cases. We also find the Green's functions in (2+1)-dimensional Einstein static universe and anti de-Sitter space.
