Title: Integrable XYZ Spin Chain with Boundaries
Authors: Takeo Inami and Hitoshi Konno
Abstract: We consider a general class of boundary terms of the open XYZ spin-1/2 chain compatible with integrability. We have obtained the general elliptic solution of $K$-matrix obeying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation using the $R$-matrix of the eight vertex model and derived the associated integrable spin-chain Hamiltonian.
