Title: Operator Formalism on General Algebraic Curves
Authors: F. Ferrari and J. Sobczyk
Abstract: The usual Laurent expansion of the analytic tensors on the complex plane is generalized to any closed and orientable Riemann surface represented as an affine algebraic curve. As an application, the operator formalism for the $b-c$ systems is developed. The physical states are expressed by means of creation and annihilation operators as in the complex plane and the correlation functions are evaluated starting from simple normal ordering rules. The Hilbert space of the theory exhibits an interesting internal structure, being splitted into $n$ ($n$ is the number of branches of the curve) independent Hilbert spaces. Exploiting the operator formalism a large collection of explicit formulas of string theory is derived.
