Title: Consequence of Hawking radiation from 2d dilaton black holes
Authors: Tsukasa Tada and Shozo Uehara
Abstract: We investigate the CGHS model through numerical calculation. The behavior of the mass function, which we introduced in our previous work as a ``local mass'', is examined. We found that the mass function takes negative values, which means that the amount of Hawking radiation becomes greater than the initial mass of the black hole as in the case of the RST model.
