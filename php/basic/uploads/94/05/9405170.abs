Title: Conserved Quantities and Electroweak Phase Transitions
Authors: M. Chaichian and R. Gonzalez Felipe and H. Perez Rojas
Abstract: Some cosmological consequences of including the adequate conserved quantities in the density matrix of the electroweak theory are investigated. Several arguments against including the charges associated to the spontaneously broken symmetry are presented. Special attention is focused on the phenomenon of $W$-boson condensation and its interplay with the phase transition for the symmetry restoration is considered. The emerging cosmological implications, such as on the baryon and lepton number densities, are of interest.
