Authors: Jun Nishimura and Shinya Tamura and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We study $R^2$ gravity in $(2+\epsilon)$--dimensional quantum gravity. Taking care of the oversubtraction problem in the conformal mode dynamics, we perform a full order calculation of string susceptibility in the $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ limit. The result is consistent with that obtained through Liouville approach.
