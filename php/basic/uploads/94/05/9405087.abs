Title: Hirota equation as an example of integrable symplectic map
Authors: L. Faddeev and A. Yu. Volkov
Abstract: The hamiltonian formalism is developed for the sine-Gordon model on the space-time light-like lattice, first introduced by Hirota. The evolution operator is explicitely constructed in the quantum variant of the model, the integrability of the corresponding classical finite-dimensional system is established.
