Title: Phase Transition in Conformally Induced Gravity with Torsion
Authors: Jewan Kim and C. J. Park and Yongsung Yoon
Abstract: We have considered the quantum behavior of a conformally induced gravity in the minimal Riemann-Cartan space. The regularized one-loop effective potential considering the quantum fluctuations of the dilaton and the torsion fields in the Coleman-Weinberg sector gives a sensible phase transition for an inflationary phase in De Sitter space. For this effective potential, we have analyzed the semi-classical equation of motion of the dilaton field in the slow-rolling regime.
