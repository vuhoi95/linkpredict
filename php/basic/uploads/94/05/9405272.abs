Title: Baryon Magnetic Moments in a Simultaneous Expansion in $1/N$ and $m_s$
Authors: Markus A. Luty and John March-Russell and Martin White
Abstract: We consider the baryon octet and decuplet magnetic moments in a simultaneous expansion in $m_s$ and $1/N$ taking $N_F / N \sim 1$, where $N$ is the number of QCD colors and $N_F$ is the number of light quark flavors. At leading order in this expansion, the magnetic moments obey the non-relativistic quark-model relations. We compute corrections to these relations using an effective lagrangian formalism which respects chiral symmetry to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion. Including corrections up to order $m_s^{1/2}$, we find 8 relations among the 9 measured octet and decuplet magnetic moments; including corrections up to order $1/N$ and $m_s$, we find 4 remaining relations. The relations work well, and suggest that the expansion is under control. We give predictions for the unmeasured decuplet magnetic moments.
