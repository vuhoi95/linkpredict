Title: Four dimensional topological quantum field theory, Hopf categories, and  the canonical bases
Authors: Louis Crane and Igor B. Frenkel
Abstract: We propose a new mwthod of constructing 4D-TQFTs. The method uses a new type of algebraic structure called a Hopf Category. We also outline the construction of a family of Hopf categories related to the quantum groups, using the canonical bases.
