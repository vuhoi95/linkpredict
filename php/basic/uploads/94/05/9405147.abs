Title: Lorentz Symmetry Breaking in Abelian Vector-Field Models with  Wess-Zumino Interaction
Authors: A. A. Andrianov and R. Soldati
Abstract: We consider the abelian vector-field models in the presence of the Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The occurence of the dynamic breaking of Lorentz symmetry at classical and one-loop level is described for massless and massive vector fields. This phenomenon appears to be the non-perturbative counterpart of the perturbative renormalizability and/or unitarity breaking in the chiral gauge theories.
