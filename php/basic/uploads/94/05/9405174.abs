Abstract: We derive a model of constrained topological gravity, a theory recently introduced by us through the twist of N=2 Liouville theory, starting from the general BRST algebra and imposing the moduli space constraint as a gauge fixing. To do this, it is necessary to introduce a formalism that allows a careful treatment of the global and the local degrees of freedom of the fields. Surprisingly, the moduli space constraint arises from the simplest and most natural gauge-fermion ({\sl antighost} $\times$ {\sl Lagrange multiplier}), confirming the previous results. The simplified technical set-up provides a deeper understanding for constrained topological gravity and a convenient framework for future investigations, like the matter coupling and the analysis of the effects of the constraint on the holomorphic anomaly.
