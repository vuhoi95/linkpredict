Title: Chen and Itoi Reply
Authors: Wei Chen and Chigak Itoi
Abstract: We reply a Comment (hep-th/xxx) on our recent paper published in Phys Rev Lett 72 (1994) 2527-2530. We point out that the author of the Comment overlooks the highly non-trivial Chern-Simons interactions and his hand-waving arguments are totally groundless.
