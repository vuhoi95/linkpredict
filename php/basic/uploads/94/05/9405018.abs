Title: Relation Between Hyperelliptic Integrals
Authors: S. Pakuliak and A. Perelomov
Abstract: A simple property of the integrals over the hyperelliptic surfaces of arbitrary genus is observed. Namely, the derivatives of these integrals with respect to the branching points are given by the linear combination of the same integrals. We check that this property is responsible for the solution to the level zero Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation given in terms of hyperelliptic integrals.
