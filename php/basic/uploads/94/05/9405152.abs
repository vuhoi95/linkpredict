Title: Galilean limit of equilibrium relativistic mass distribution for  indistinguishable events
Authors: L. Burakovsky and L. P. Horwitz
Abstract: The relativistic distribution for indistinguishable events is considered in the mass-shell limit $m^2\cong M^2,$ where $M$ is a given intrinsic property of the events. The characteristic thermodynamic quantities are calculated and subject to the zero-mass and the high-temperature limits. The results are shown to be in agreement with the corresponding expressions of an on-mass-shell relativistic kinetic theory. The Galilean limit $c\rightarrow \infty ,$ which coincides in form with the low-temperature limit, is considered. The theory is shown to pass over to a nonrelativistic statistical mechanics of indistinguishable particles.
