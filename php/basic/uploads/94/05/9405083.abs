Title: On gauge invariance and the path integral
Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Carlos Farina
Abstract: Using a gauge covariant operator technique we deduce the path integral for a charged particle in a stationary magnetic field, verifying the "midpoint rule" for the discrete form of the interaction term with the vector potential.
