Title: Gravity and Discrete Symmetry
Authors: Bin Chen and Takesi Saito and Ke Wu
Abstract: Using the differential calculus on discrete group, we study the general relativity in the space-time which is the product of a four dimensional manifold by a two-point space. We generalize the usual concept of frame and connection in our space-time, and from the generalized torsion free condition we obtain an action of a scalar field coupled to Einstein gravity, which may be related to the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory.
