Abstract: The classical $r$-matrix for $N=1$ superPoincar{\'e} algebra, given by Lukierski, Nowicki and Sobczyk is used to describe the graded Poisson structure on the $N=1$ Poincar{\'e} supergroup. The standard correspondence principle between the even (odd) Poisson brackets and (anti)commutators leads to the consistent quantum deformation of the superPoincar{\'e} group with the deformation parameter $q$ described by fundamental mass parameter $\kappa \quad (\kappa^{-1}=\ln{q})$. The $\kappa$-deformation of $N=1$ superspace as dual to the $\kappa$-deformed supersymmetry algebra is discussed.
