Title: Spin--spin critical point correlation functions for the 2D random bond  Ising and Potts models
Authors: Vladimir Dotsenko and Marco Picco and Pierre Pujol
Abstract: We compute the combined two and three loop order correction to the spin-spin correlation functions for the 2D Ising and q-states Potts model with random bonds at the critical point. The procedure employed is the renormalisation group approach for the perturbation series around the conformal field theories representing the pure models. We obtain corrections for the correlations functions which produce crossover in the amplitude but don't change the critical exponent in the case of the Ising model and which produce a shift in the critical exponent, due to randomness, in the case of the Potts model. Comparison with numerical data is discussed briefly.
