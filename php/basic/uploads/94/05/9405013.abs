Title: Deformation theory and Lie algebra homology
Authors: Vladimir Hinich and Vadim Schechtman
Abstract: A description of a ring of functions on the base of a universal formal deformation for several moduli problems is given. The answer is given in terms of a homology group of a certain dg Lie algebra canonically (up to an essentially unique quasi-isomorphism) associated with a problem.
