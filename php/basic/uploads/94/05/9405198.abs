Title: Background Symmetries In Orbifolds With Discrete Wilson Lines
Authors: A. Love and W. A. Sabra and S. Thomas
Abstract: Target space symmetries are studied for orbifold compactified string theories containing Wilson line background fields. The symmetries determined are for those moduli which contribute to the string loop threshold corrections of the gauge coupling constants. The groups found are subgroups of the modular group $PSL(2, Z)$ and depend on the choice of discrete Wilson lines and the shape of the underlying six-dimensional lattice.
