Title: BRST Structures and Symplectic Geometry on a Class of Supermanifolds
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: By investigating the symplectic geometry and geometric quantization on a class of supermanifolds, we exhibit BRST structures for a certain kind of algebras. We discuss the undeformed and q-deformed cases in the classical as well as in the quantum cases.
