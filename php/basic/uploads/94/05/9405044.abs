Title: Conformal anomalies on Einstein spaces with Boundary
Authors: Ian G. Moss and Stephen J. Poletti
Abstract: The anomalous rescaling for antisymmetric tensor fields, including gauge bosons, and Dirac fermions on Einstein spaces with boundary has been prone to errors and these are corrected here. The explicit calculations lead to some interesting identities that indicate a deeper underlying structure.
