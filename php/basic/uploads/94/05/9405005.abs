Title: Random matrix theory and $QCD_3$
Authors: J. J. M. Verbaarschot and I. Zahed
Abstract: We suggest that the spectral properties near zero virtuality of three dimensional QCD, follow from a Hermitean random matrix model. The exact spectral density is derived for this family of random matrix models both for even and odd number of fermions. New sum rules for the inverse powers of the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are obtained. The issue of anomalies in random matrix theories is discussed.
