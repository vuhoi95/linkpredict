Title: Are p-Branes Asymptotically Black Holes?
Authors: Andrei Bytsenko and Klaus Kirsten and Sergio Zerbini
Abstract: An attempt is made to compare the asymptotic state density of twisted $p$-branes and the related state density of mass level $M$ of a $D$-dimensional neutral black hole. To this aim, the explicit form of the twisted $p$-brane total level degeneracy is calculated. The prefactor of the degeneracy, in contrast to the leading behaviour, is found to depend on the winding number of the $p$-brane.
