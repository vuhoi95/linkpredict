Title: Folded Strings Falling into a Black Hole
Authors: Itzhak Bars and JÃ¼rgen Schulze
Abstract: We find all the classical solutions (minimal surfaces) of open or closed strings in {\it any} two dimensional curved spacetime. As examples we consider the SL(2,R)/R two dimensional black hole, and any 4D black hole in the Schwarzschild family, provided the motion is restricted to the time-radial components. The solutions, which describe longitudinaly oscillating folded strings (radial oscillations in 4D), must be given in lattice-like patches of the worldsheet, and a transfer operation analogous to a transfer matrix determines the future evolution. Then the swallowing of a string by a black hole is analyzed. We find several new features that are not shared by particle motions. The most surprizing effect is the tunneling of the string into the bare singularity region that lies beyond the black hole that is classically forbidden to particles.
