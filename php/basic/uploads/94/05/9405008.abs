Title: Dynamical correlation functions in the Calogero-Sutherland model
Authors: F. Lesage and V. Pasquier and D. Serban
Abstract: We compute the dynamical Green function and density-density correlation in the Calogero-Sutherland model for all integer values of the coupling constant. An interpretation of the intermediate states in terms of quasi-particles is found.
