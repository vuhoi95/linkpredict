Title: The structure of the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in the N-vector  model in 4-epsilon dimensions
Authors: Stefan K. Kehrein and Franz Wegner
Abstract: In a recent publication we have investigated the spectrum of anomalous dimensions for arbitrary composite operators in the critical N-vector model in 4-epsilon dimensions. We could establish properties like upper and lower bounds for the anomalous dimensions in one-loop order. In this paper we extend these results and explicitly derive parts of the one-loop spectrum of anomalous dimensions. This analysis becomes possible by an explicit representation of the conformal symmetry group on the operator algebra. Still the structure of the spectrum of anomalous dimensions is quite complicated and does generally not resemble the algebraic structures familiar from two dimensional conformal field theories.
