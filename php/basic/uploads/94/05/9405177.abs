Title: New fields on super Riemann surfaces
Authors: Alice Rogers and Mark Langer
Abstract: A new $(1,1)$-dimensional super vector bundle which exists on any super Riemann surface is described. Cross-sections of this bundle provide a new class of fields on a super Riemann surface which closely resemble holomorphic functions on a super Riemann surface, but which (in contrast to the case with holomorphic functions) form spaces which have a well defined dimension which does not change as odd moduli become non-zero.
