Title: Wigner quantum oscillators. Osp(3/2) oscillators
Authors: T. D. Palev and N. I. Stoilova
Abstract: The properties of the three-dimensional noncanonical osp(3/2) oscillators, introduced in J.Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\bf 27} (1994) 977, are further studied. The angular momentum M of the oscillators can take at most three values M=p-1,p,p+1, which are either all integers or all half-integers. The coordinates anticommute with each other. Depending on the state space the energy spectrum can coincide or can be essentially different from those of the canonical oscillator. The ground state is in general degenerated.
