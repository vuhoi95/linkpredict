Title: Some Useful Properties of Rotational Gibbs States In Chiral Conformal  QFT
Authors: B. Schroer and FU Berlin
Abstract: We derive the Kac Wakimoto formula in the algebraic framework of chiral conformal QFT s a consequence of the universal behaviour of high-temperature Gibbs-states on intertwiner subalgebras. By studying selfintertwiners in the presence of other charges, we obtain charge-polarization coefficients which generalize the entries of Verlinde matrix S and belong to higher genus mapping class group matrices.
