Title: Finite Size Effects and Conformal Symmetry of $O(N)$ Nonlinear $Ïƒ$  Model in Three Dimensions
Authors: Akira Fujii and Takeo Inami
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model on a three-dimensional compact space $S^1 \times S^2$ (of radii $L$ and $R$ respectively) by means of large $N$ expansion, focusing on the finite size effects and conformal symmetries of this model at the critical point. We evaluate the correlation length and the Casimir energy of this model and study their dependence on $L$ and $R$. We examine the modular transformation properties of the partition function, and study the dependence of the specific heat on the mass gap in view of possible extension of the $C-$theorem to three dimensions.
