Title: QED With Unequal Charges: A study of spontaneous Zn symmetry breaking
Authors: T. H. Hansson and H. B. Nielsen and I. Zahed
Abstract: We study two-dimensional QED with unequal charges at finite temperature, and show that there is a phase with a spontaneously broken $Z_n$ symmetry. In spite of this, we were not able to establish the presence of domain walls. The relevance for QCD in higher dimensions is discussed.
