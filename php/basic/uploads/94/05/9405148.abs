Title: Replica Field Theory for Deterministic Models: Binary Sequences with Low  Autocorrelation
Authors: E. Marinari and G. Parisi and F. Ritort
Abstract: We study systems without quenched disorder with a complex landscape, and we use replica symmetry theory to describe them. We discuss the Golay-Bernasconi-Derrida approximation of the low autocorrelation model, and we reconstruct it by using replica calculations. Then we consider the full model, its low $T$ properties (with the help of number theory) and a Hartree-Fock resummation of the high-temperature series. We show that replica theory allows to solve the model in the high $T$ phase. Our solution is based on one-link integral techniques, and is based on substituting a Fourier transform with a generic unitary transformation. We discuss this approach as a powerful tool to describe systems with a complex landscape in the absence of quenched disorder.
