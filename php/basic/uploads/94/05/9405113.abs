Title: N=1 SUPER-P-BRANES in twistor-like Lorentz harmonic formulation
Authors: I. A. Bandos and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: Unique twistor--like Lorentz harmonic formulation for all N=1 supersymmetric extended objects (super-p-branes) moving in the space--time of arbitrary dimension D (admissible for given $p$) are suggested. The equations of motion are derived, explicit form of the \kappa-symmetry transformations is presented and the classical equivalence to the standard formulation is proved. The cases with minimal world--sheet dimensions $p=1,2$, namely of D=10 heterotic string and D=11 supermembrane, are considered in details. In particular, the explicit form of irreducible \kappa-symmetry transformations for D=11 supermembrane is derived.
