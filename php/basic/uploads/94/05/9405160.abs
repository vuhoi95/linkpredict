Title: Path Integral and Solutions of the Constraint Equations: The Case of  Reducible Gauge Theories
Authors: R. Ferraro and M. Henneaux and M. Puchin
Abstract: It is shown that the BRST path integral for reducible gauge theories, with appropriate boundary conditions on the ghosts, is a solution of the constraint equations. This is done by relating the BRST path integral to the kernel of the evolution operator projected on the physical subspace.
