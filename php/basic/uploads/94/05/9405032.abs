Title: Fermion Scattering off Dilatonic Black Holes
Authors: A. GHOSH and P. MITRA
Abstract: The scattering of massless fermions off magnetically charged dilatonic black holes is reconsidered and a violation of unitarity is found. Even for a single species of fermion it is possible for a particle to disappear into the black hole with its information content.
