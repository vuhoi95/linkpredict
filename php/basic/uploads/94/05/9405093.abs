Title: Determinant and Character of W-infinity algebra
Authors: H. Awata and M. Fukuma and Y. Matsuo and S. Odake
Abstract: We diagonalize the Hilbert space of some subclass of the quasifinite module of the \Winf algebra. States are classified according to their eigenvalues for infinitely many commuting charges and the Young diagrams. The parameter dependence of their norms is explicitly derived. The full character formulae of the degenerate representations are given as summation of the bilinear combinations of the Schur polynomials.
