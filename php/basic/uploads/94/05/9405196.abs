Title: Some Physical Aspects of Liouville String Dynamics
Authors: J. Ellis and N. Mavromatos and D. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We discuss some physical aspects of our Liouville approach to non-critical strings, including the emergence of a microscopic arrow of time, effective field theories as classical ``pointer'' states in theory space, $CPT$ violation and the possible apparent non-conservation of angular momentum. We also review the application of a phenomenological parametrization of this formalism to the neutral kaon system.
