Title: Integrable Hierarchies and Dispersionless Limit
Authors: Kanehisa Takasaki and Takashi Takebe
Abstract: Analogues of the KP and the Toda lattice hierarchy called dispersionless KP and Toda hierarchy are studied. Dressing operations in the dispersionless hierarchies are introduced as a canonical transformation, quantization of which is dressing operators of the ordinary KP and Toda hierarchy. An alternative construction of general solutions of the ordinary KP and Toda hierarchy is given as twistor construction which is quatization of the similar construction of solutions of dispersionless hierarchies. These results as well as those obtained in previous papers are presented with proofs and necessary technical details.
