Title: Hyperspherical Harmonics, Separation of Variables and the Bethe Ansatz
Authors: J. Harnad and P. Winternitz
Abstract: The relation between solutions to Helmholtz's equation on the sphere $S^{n-1}$ and the $[{\gr sl}(2)]^n$ Gaudin spin chain is clarified. The joint eigenfuctions of the Laplacian and a complete set of commuting second order operators suggested by the $R$--matrix approach to integrable systems, based on the loop algebra $\wt{sl}(2)_R$, are found in terms of homogeneous polynomials in the ambient space. The relation of this method of determining a basis of harmonic functions on $S^{n-1}$ to the Bethe ansatz approach to integrable systems is explained.
