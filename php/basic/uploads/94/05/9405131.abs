Title: Left Regular Representation of $sl_q(3)$: Reduction and Intertwiners
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Preeti Parashar
Abstract: Reduction of the left regular representation of quantum algebra $sl_q(3)$ is studied and ~$q$-difference intertwining operators are constructed. The irreducible representations correspond to the spaces of local sections of certain line bundles over the q-flag manifold.
