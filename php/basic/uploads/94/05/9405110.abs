Title: Poisson Structure Induced (Topological) Field Theories
Authors: Peter Schaller and Thomas Strobl
Abstract: A class of two dimensional field theories, based on (generically degenerate) Poisson structures and generalizing gravity-Yang-Mills systems, is presented. Locally, the solutions of the classical equations of motion are given. A general scheme for the quantization of the models in a Hamiltonian formulation is found.
