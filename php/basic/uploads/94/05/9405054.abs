Title: Algebraic and geometric aspects of generalized quantum dynamics
Authors: S. L. Adler and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: \noindent We briefly discuss some algebraic and geometric aspects of the generalized Poisson bracket and non--commutative phase space for generalized quantum dynamics, which are analogous to properties of the classical Poisson bracket and ordinary symplectic structure.
