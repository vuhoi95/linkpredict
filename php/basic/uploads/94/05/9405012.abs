Title: Eta-Invariants and Determinant Lines
Authors: Xianzhe Dai and Daniel S. Freed
Abstract: We study eta-invariants on odd dimensional manifolds with boundary. The dependence on boundary conditions is best summarized by viewing the (exponentiated) eta-invariant as an element of the (inverse) determinant line of the boundary. We prove a gluing law and a variation formula for this invariant. This yields a new, simpler proof of the holonomy formula for the determinant line bundle of a family of Dirac operators, also known as the ``global anomaly'' formula.
