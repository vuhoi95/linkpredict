Title: Dilaton Gravity in $2+Îµ$ Dimensions
Authors: S. Kojima and N. Sakai and Y. Tanii
Abstract: Quantum theory of dilaton gravity is studied in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. Divergences are computed and renormalized at one-loop order. The mixing between the Liouville field and the dilaton field eliminates $1/\epsilon$ singularity in the Liouville-dilaton propagator. This smooth behavior of the dilaton gravity theory in the $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ limit solves the oversubtraction problem which afflicted the higher orders of the Einstein gravity in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. As a nontrivial fixed point, we find a dilaton gravity action which can be transformed to a CGHS type action.
