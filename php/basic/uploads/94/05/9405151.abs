Title: Type B Topological Matter, Kodaira-Spencer Theory, and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Marino
Abstract: Perturbing usual type B topological matter with vector $(0,1)$-forms we find a topological theory which contains explicitly Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory. It is shown that, in genus zero, three-point correlation functions give the Yukawa couplings for a generic point in the moduli space of complex structures. This generalization of type B topological matter seems to be the correct framework to understand mirror symmetry in terms of two-dimensional topological field theories.
