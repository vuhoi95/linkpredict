Title: From N=2 Supergravity to Constrained Moduli Spaces
Authors: D. Anselmi and P. Fre' and L. Girardello and P. Soriani
Abstract: In this talk we review some results concerning a mechanism for reducing the moduli space of a topological field theory to a proper submanifold of the ordinary moduli space. Such mechanism is explicitly realized in the example of constrained topological gravity, obtained by topologically twisting the N=2 Liouville theory.
