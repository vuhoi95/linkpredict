Abstract: A new pairing theory for many-fermion systems is obtained via the Dirac supersymmetry framework recently introduced to describe Dirac particles in external potentials. It is shown that the standard Bogoliubov-Valatin canonical transformation treatment of the quasi-particle BCS singlet pairing mechanism naturally falls within this framework. Straightforward generalizations in which the fermions can be ascribed $ \nu$ {\it components} are shown to lead to enhanced gap energies and critical temperatures as in the case of cuprate superconductors without invoking a stronger electron-boson coupling. The new $T_{c}^{max}$ limit is $T_c^{max} = \nu T_c^{BCS}$, with $T_c^{BCS} \approx 40^0 K$.
