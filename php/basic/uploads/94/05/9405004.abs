Title: Singularity-Free Two Dimensional Cosmologies
Authors: R. Moessner and M. Trodden
Abstract: We present a class of theories of two dimensional gravity which admits homogeneous and isotropic solutions that are nonsingular and asymptotically approach a FRW matter dominated universe at late times. These models are generalizations of two dimensional dilaton gravity and both vacuum solutions and those including conformally coupled matter are investigated. In each case our construction leads to an inflationary stage driven by the gravitational sector. Our work comprises a simple example of the `Nonsingular Universe' constructions of ref. [1].
