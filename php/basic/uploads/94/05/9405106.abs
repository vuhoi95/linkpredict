Title: On the Genus Expansion in the Topological String Theory
Authors: T. Eguchi and Y. Yamada and S. -K. Yang
Abstract: A systematic formulation of the higher genus expansion in topological string theory is considered. We also develop a simple way of evaluating genus zero correlation functions. At higher genera we derive some interesting formulas for the free energy in the $A_1$ and $A_2$ models. We present some evidence that topological minimal models associated with Lie algebras other than the A-D-E type do not have a consistent higher genus expansion beyond genus one. We also present some new results on the $CP^1$ model at higher genera.
