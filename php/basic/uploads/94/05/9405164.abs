Title: Superparticle actions from superfields
Authors: R. Marnelius and Sh. M. Shvartsman
Abstract: Gauge invariant complex covariant actions for superparticles are derived from the field equations for the chiral superfields in a precise manner. The massive and massless cases in four dimensions are treated both free and in interaction with an external super Maxwell field. By means of a generalized BRST quantization these complex actions are related to real actions with second class constraints which are new in some cases.
