Title: Linear Differential Equations for a Fractional Spin Field
Authors: J. L. Cortes and M. S. Plyushchay
Abstract: The vector system of linear differential equations for a field with arbitrary fractional spin is proposed using infinite-dimensional half-bounded unitary representations of the $\overline{SL(2,R)}$ group. In the case of $(2j+1)$-dimensional nonunitary representations of that group, $0<2j\in Z$, they are transformed into equations for spin-$j$ fields. A local gauge symmetry associated to the vector system of equations is identified and the simplest gauge invariant field action, leading to these equations, is constructed.
