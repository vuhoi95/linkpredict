Title: Anomalous dimensions and ghost decoupling in a perturbative approach to  the generalized chiral Schwinger model
Authors: A. Bassetto and L. Griguolo
Abstract: A generalized chiral Schwinger model is studied by means of perturbative techniques. Explicit expressions are obtained, both for bosonic and fermionic propagators, and compared to the ones derived by means of functional techniques. In particular a consistent recipe is proposed to describe the ambiguity occurring in the regularization of the fermionic determinant. The role of the gauge fixing term, which is needed to develop perturbation theory and the behaviour of the spectrum as a function of the parameters are clarified together with ultraviolet and infrared properties of the model.
