Title: Aspects of Black Hole Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics in 2+1  Dimensions
Authors: S. Carlip and C. Teitelboim
Abstract: We discuss the quantum mechanics and thermodynamics of the (2+1)-dimensional black hole, using both minisuperspace methods and exact results from Chern-Simons theory. In particular, we evaluate the first quantum correction to the black hole entropy. We show that the dynamical variables of the black hole arise from the possibility of a deficit angle at the (Euclidean) horizon, and briefly speculate as to how they may provide a basis for a statistical picture of black hole thermodynamics.
