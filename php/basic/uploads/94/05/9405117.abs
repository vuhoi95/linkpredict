Title: Asymptotic level density in heterotic string theory and rotating black  holes
Authors: J. G. Russo and L. Susskind
Abstract: We calculate the density of states with given mass and spin in string theory and obtain asymptotic formulas. We also compute the tree-level gyromagnetic couplings for arbitrary physical states in the heterotic string theory. These results are then applied to study whether fundamental strings can consistently describe the microphysics of the black hole horizon in the case of a general classical solution characterized by mass, charge and angular momentum.
