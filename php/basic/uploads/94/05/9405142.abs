Title: A Quantum Analogue of the Boson-Fermion Correspondence
Authors: A. Hamid Bougourzi and Luc Vinet
Abstract: We review the classical boson-fermion correspondence in the context of the $\widehat{sl(2)}$ current algebra at level 2. This particular algebra is ideal to exhibit this correspondence because it can be realized either in terms of three real bosonic fields or in terms of one real and one complex fermionic fields. We also derive a fermionic realization of the quantum current algebra $U_q(\widehat{sl(2)})$ at level 2 and by comparing this realization with the existing bosonic one we extend the classical correspondence to the quantum case.
