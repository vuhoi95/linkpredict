Title: New Phenomenon of Nonlinear Regge Trajectory and Quantum Dual String  Theory
Authors: M. Chaichian and J. F. Gomes and R. Gonzalez Felipe
Abstract: The relation between the spin and the mass of an infinite number of particles in a $q$-deformed dual string theory is studied. For the deformation parameter $q$ a root of unity, in addition to the relation of such values of $q$ with the rational conformal field theory, the Fock space of each oscillator mode in the Fubini-Veneziano operator formulation becomes truncated. Thus, based on general physical grounds, the resulting spin-(mass)$^2$ relation is expected to be below the usual linear trajectory. For such specific values of $q$, we find that the linear Regge trajectory turns into a square-root trajectory as the mass increases.
