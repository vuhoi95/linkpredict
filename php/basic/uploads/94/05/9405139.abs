Abstract: Second quantization is revisited and creation and annihilation operators areshown to be related, on the same footing both to the algebra h(1), and to the superalgebra osp(1|2) that are shown to be both compatible with Bose and Fermi statistics. The two algebras are completely equivalent in the one-mode sector but, because of grading of osp(1|2), differ in the many-particle case. The same scheme is straightforwardly extended to the quantum case h_q(1) and osp_q(1|2).
