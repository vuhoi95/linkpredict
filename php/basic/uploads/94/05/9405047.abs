Title: Canonical Covariant Formulation of Green-Schwarz Superstring without  Second Class Constraints
Authors: Alvaro Restuccia and Jorge Stephany
Abstract: We describe a canonical covariant formulation of the Green-Schwarz Superstring which allows the construction of a new covariant action canonically equivalent to the Green-Schwarz action but subjected only to first class constraints. From this action the correct BRST operator for the quantization of the Green-Schwarz Superstring may be constructed. Also the gauge fixed action in the Light-Cone gauge may be reobtained. The action presented in this letter generalizes in a non-trivial form the action introduced by Kallosh for the Brink-Schwarz-Casalbuoni Superparticle.
