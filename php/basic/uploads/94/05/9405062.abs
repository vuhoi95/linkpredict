Title: Solitons in Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Model and the Collective Ground  State of One-Dimensional Delta-Function Gas
Authors: Hideaki Hiro-Oka and Hisakazu Minakata
Abstract: We examine one-dimensional Bose gas interacting with delta-function potential using the large-$N$ collective field theory. We show that in the case of attractive potential the uniform ground state is unstable to small perturbations and the instability is cured by formation of a collective ground state, \lq\lq bright soliton'' configuration in corresponding nonlinear Schr\"odinger field theory.
