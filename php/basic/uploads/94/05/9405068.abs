Title: Quenched Random Graphs
Authors: C. Bachas and C. de Calan and P. M. S. Petropoulos
Abstract: Spin models on quenched random graphs are related to many important optimization problems. We give a new derivation of their mean-field equations that elucidates the role of the natural order parameter in these models.
