Title: Generalized Gaussian Effective Potential: Low Dimensional Scalar Fields
Authors: P. Cea and L. Tedesco
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Gaussian effective potential for self-interacting scalar fields in one and two spatial dimensions. We compute the two-loop corrections and discuss the renormalization of the generalized Gaussian effective potential.
