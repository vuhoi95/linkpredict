Title: Anyons: Minimal and Extended Formulations
Authors: Jose L. Cortes and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: The minimal (reduced) and extended canonical formulations for (2+1)-dimensional fractional spin particles are considered. We investigate the relationship between them, clearing up the meaning of the coordinates for such particles, and analyse the related question of correlation between spin and momentum. The classical lagrangian corresponding to the extended canonical formulation is constructed, and its gauge symmetries are identified.
