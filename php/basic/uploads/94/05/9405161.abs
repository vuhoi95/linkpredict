Abstract: The structure and properties of possible $q$-Minkowski spaces is discussed, and the corresponding non-commutative differential calculi are developed in detail and compared with already existing proposals. This is done by stressing its covariance properties as described by appropriate reflection equations. Some isomorphisms among the space-time and derivative algebras are demonstrated, and their representations are described briefly. Finally, some physical consequences and open problems are discussed.
