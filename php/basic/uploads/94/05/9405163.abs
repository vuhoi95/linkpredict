Title: Thermodynamics of Relativistic Fermions with Chern-Simons Coupling
Authors: N. Bralic and D. Cabra and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the relativistic Quantum Field Theory of massive fermions in three space-time dimensions coupled to an Abelian Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field. We evaluate the specific heat at finite temperature and density and find that the variation with the statistical angle is consistent with the non-relativistic ideas on generalized statistics.
