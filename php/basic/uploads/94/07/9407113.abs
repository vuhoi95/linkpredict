Title: Integrable theories that are asymptotically CFT
Authors: Jonathan M. Evans and Timothy J. Hollowood
Abstract: A series of sigma models with torsion are analysed which generate their mass dynamically but whose ultra-violet fixed points are non-trivial conformal field theories -- in fact SU(2) WZW models at level $k$. In contrast to the more familiar situation of asymptotically free theories in which the fixed points are trivial, the sigma models considered here may be termed ``asymptotically CFT''. These theories have previously been conjectured to be quantum integrable; this is confirmed by postulating a factorizable S-matrix to describe their infra-red behaviour and then carrying out a stringent test of this proposal. The test involves coupling the theory to a conserved charge and evaluating the response of the free-energy both in perturbation theory to one loop and directly from the S-matrix via the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with a chemical potential at zero temperature. Comparison of these results provides convincing evidence in favour of the proposed S-matrix; it also yields the universal coefficients of the beta-function and allows for an evaluation of the mass gap (the ratio of the physical mass to the $\Lambda$-parameter) to leading order in $1/k$.
