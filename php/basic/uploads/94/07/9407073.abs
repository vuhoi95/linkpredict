Title: Oblique Confinement and Phase Transitions in Chern-Simons Gauge Theories
Authors: M. C. Diamantini and P. Sodano and C. A. Trugenberger
Abstract: We investigate non-perturbative features of a planar Chern-Simons gauge theory modeling the long distance physics of quantum Hall systems, including a finite gap M for excitations. By formulating the model on a lattice, we identify the relevant topological configurations and their interactions. For M bigger than a critical value, the model exhibits an oblique confinement phase, which we identify with Lauglin's incompressible quantum fluid. For M smaller than the critical value, we obtain a phase transition to a Coulomb phase or a confinement phase, depending on the value of the electromagnetic coupling.
