Authors: M. Kibler and C. Campigotto and Yu. F. Smirnov
Abstract: We report in this article three- and four-term recursion relations for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the quantum algebras $U_q(su_2)$ and $U_q(su_{1,1})$. These relations were obtained by exploiting the complementarity of three quantum algebras in a $q$-deformation of $sp(8, \gr)$.
