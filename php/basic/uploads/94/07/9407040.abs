Title: Strong Phase Correlations of Solitons of Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger  Equation
Authors: A. G. Litvak and V. A. Mironov and A. P. Protogenov
Abstract: We discuss the possibility to suppress the collapse in the nonlinear 2+1 D Schr\"odinger equation by using the gauge theory of strong phase correlations. It is shown that invariance relative to $q$-deformed Hopf algebra with deformation parameter $q$ being the fourth root of unity makes the values of the Chern-Simons term coefficient, $k=2$, and of the coupling constant, $g=1/2$, fixed; no collapsing solutions are present at those values.
