Title: Three-dimensional BF Theories and the Alexander-Conway Invariant of  Knots
Authors: A. S. Cattaneo and P. Cotta-Ramusino and M. Martellini
Abstract: We study 3-dimensional BF theories and define observables related to knots and links. The quantum expectation values of these observables give the coefficients of the Alexander-Conway polynomial.
