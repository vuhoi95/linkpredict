Title: Supersymmetric Field Theory from Supermatrix Models
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Faux and B. Ovrut
Abstract: We show that the continuum limit of one-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric matrix models can be described by a two-dimensional interacting field theory of a massless boson and two chiral fermions. We interpret this field theory as a two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric theory of two chiral superfields, in which one of the chiral superfields has a non-trivial vacuum expectation value.
