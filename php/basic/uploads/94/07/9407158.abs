Title: Constraints and Period Relations in Bosonic Strings at Genus-g
Authors: C. H. Oh and K. Singh
Abstract: We examine some of the implications of implementing the usual boundary conditions on the closed bosonic string in the hamiltonian framework. Using the KN formalism, it is shown that at the quantum level, the resulting constraints lead to relations among the periods of the basis 1-forms. These are compared with those of Riemanns' which arise from a different consideration.
