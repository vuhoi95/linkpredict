Title: Generalized q-Oscillators and their Hopf Structures
Authors: C. H. Oh and K. Singh
Abstract: We study the relationships among the various forms of the $q$ oscillator algebra and consider the conditions under which it supports a Hopf structure. We also present a generalization of this algebra together with its corresponding Hopf structure. Its multimode extensions are also considered.
