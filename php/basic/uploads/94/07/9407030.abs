Title: Radiative Corrections in Nonrelativistic Chern-Simons Theory
Authors: D. Caenepeel and M. Leblanc
Abstract: We present the one-loop scalar field effective potential for the $N=2$ supersymmetric nonrelativistic self-interacting matter fields coupled to an Abelian Chern-Simons gauge field and for its generalization when bosonic matter fields are coupled to non-Abelian Chern-Simons field. In both models, Gauss's law linearly relates the magnetic field to the matter field densities; hence, we also include radiative effects from the background gauge field. We compute the scalar field effective potentials in two gauge families, a gauge reminiscent of the $R_\xi$-gauge in the limit $\xi\rightarrow 0$ and in the Coulomb family gauges. We regularize the theory with operator regularization and a cutoff to demonstrate that the results are independent of the regularization scheme.
