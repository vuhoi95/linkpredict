Title: Towards Quantum Cosmology without Singularities
Authors: K. Behrndt and T. T. Burwick
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vanishing of cosmological singularities by quantization. Starting from a 5d Kaluza--Klein approach we quantize, as a first step, the non--spherical metric part and the dilaton field. These fields which are classically singular become smooth after quantization. In addition, we argue that the incorporation of non perturbative quantum corrections form a dilaton potential. Technically, the procedure corresponds to the quantization of 2d dilaton gravity and we discuss several models. From the 4d point of view this procedure is a semiclassical approach where only the dilaton and moduli matter fields are quantized.
