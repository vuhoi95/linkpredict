Title: Action-Angle Variables for Complex Projective Space and Semiclassical  Exactness
Authors: Phillial Oh and Myung-Ho Kim
Abstract: We construct the action-angle variables of a classical integrable model defined on complex projective phase space and calculate the quantum mechanical propagator in the coherent state path integral representation using the stationary phase approximation. We show that the resulting expression for the propagator coincides with the exact propagator which was obtained by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.
