Title: Thermal Versus Vacuum Magnetization in QED
Authors: Per Elmfors and Per Liljenberg and David Persson and Bo-Sture Skagerstam
Abstract: The magnetized relativistic Fermi and Bose gases are studied at finite temperature and density.In the case of the Fermi gas, the contribution to the magnetization from the vacuum becomes dominant for high magnetic fields, when the thermal contribution saturates. In the case of the charged Bose gas, the (paramagnetic) vacuum--magnetization becomes dominant when the gas changes from a diamagnetic to a paramagnetic behaviour. We furthermore find that the scalar--QED effective coupling constant for a weak non--zero external magnetic field is a decreasing function of the temperature.
