Title: Nonlinear interaction between electromagnetic fields at high temperature
Authors: Fernando T. Brandt and Josif Frenkel and John C. Taylor
Abstract: The electron-positron `box' diagram produces an effective action which is fourth order in the electromagnetic field. We examine the behaviour of this effective action at high-temperature (in analytically continued imaginary-time thermal perturbation theory). We argue that there is a finite, nonzero limit as $T\rightarrow \infty$ (where $T$ is the temperature). We calculate this limit in the nonrelativistic static case, and in the long-wavelength limit. We also briefly discuss the self-energy in 2-dimensional QED, which is similar in some respects.
