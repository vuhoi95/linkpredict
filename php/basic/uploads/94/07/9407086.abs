Title: Matrix models as solvable glass models
Authors: L. F. Cugliandolo and J. Kurchan and G. Parisi and F. Ritort
Abstract: We present a family of solvable models of interacting particles in high dimensionalities without quenched disorder. We show that the models have a glassy regime with aging effects. The interaction is controlled by a parameter $p$. For $p=2$ we obtain matrix models and for $p>2$ `tensor' models. We concentrate on the cases $p=2$ which we study analytically and numerically.
