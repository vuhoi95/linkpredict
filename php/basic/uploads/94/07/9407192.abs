Title: A Note on ODEs from Mirror Symmetry
Authors: A. Klemm and B. H. Lian and S. S. Roan and S. -T. Yau
Abstract: We give close formulas for the counting functions of rational curves on complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of special solutions of generalized hypergeometric differential systems. For the one modulus cases we derive a differential equation for the Mirror map, which can be viewed as a generalization of the Schwarzian equation. We also derive a nonlinear seventh order differential equation which directly governs the instanton corrected Yukawa coupling.
