Abstract: We consider the temporal evolution of strong correlated degrees of freedom in $2+1$~$D$ spin systems using the Wilson operator eigenvalues as variables. It is shown that the quantum-group diffusion equation at deformation parameter $q$ being the $k$-th root of unity has the polynomial solution of degree $k$.
