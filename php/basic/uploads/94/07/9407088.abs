Title: Black Objects in the Gauge Theory of P-Branes
Authors: B. Harms and Y. Leblanc
Abstract: Within the context of the recently formulated classical gauge theory of relativistic p-branes minimally coupled to general relativity in D-dimensional spacetimes, we obtain solutions of the field equations which describe black objects. Explicit solutions are found for two cases: D > p+1 (true p-branes) and D = p+1 (p-bags).
