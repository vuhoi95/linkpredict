Title: On the High-Temperature Behaviour of the Closed Superstring
Authors: S. Dusini and S. Zerbini
Abstract: The high-temperature expansion for closed superstring one-loop free energy is studied. The Laurent series representation is obtained and its sum is analytically continued in order to investigate the nature of the critical (Hagedorn) temperature. It is found that beyond this critical temperature the statistical sum contribution of the free energy is finite but has an imaginary part, signalling a possible metastability of the system.
