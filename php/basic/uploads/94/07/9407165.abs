Title: A Class of Quantum States with Classical-like Evolution
Authors: S. De Martino and S. De Siena and F. Illuminati
Abstract: In the framework of Nelson stochastic quantization we derive exact non-stationary states for a class of time-dependent potentials. The wave-packets follow a classical motion with constant dispersion. The new states thus define a possible extension of the harmonic-oscillator coherent states to more general potentials. As an explicit example we give a detailed treatement of a sestic oscillator potential.
