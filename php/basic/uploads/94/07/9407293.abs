Title: Non-leading Logarithms in Principal Value Resummation
Authors: L. Alvero and H. Contopanagos
Abstract: We apply the method of principal value resummation of large momentum-dependent radiative corrections to the calculation of the Drell Yan cross section. We sum all next-to-leading logarithms and provide numerical results for the resummed exponent and the corresponding hard scattering function.
