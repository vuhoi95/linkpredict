Title: Yang--Mills Configurations from 3D Riemann--Cartan Geometry
Authors: E. W. Mielke and Y. N. Obukhov and F. W. Hehl
Abstract: Recently, the {\it spacelike} part of the $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills equations has been identified with geometrical objects of a three--dimensional space of constant Riemann--Cartan curvature. We give a concise derivation of this Ashtekar type (``inverse Kaluza--Klein") {\it mapping} by employing a $(3+1)$--decomposition of {\it Clifford algebra}--valued torsion and curvature two--forms. In the subcase of a mapping to purely axial 3D torsion, the corresponding Lagrangian consists of the translational and Lorentz {\it Chern--Simons term} plus cosmological term and is therefore of purely topological origin.
