Title: Two-Parametric Quantum-Deformed Dual Amplitude
Authors: L. Jenkovszky and M. Kibler and A. Mishchenko
Abstract: From a 2-parametric deformation of the harmonic oscillator algebra we construct a 4-point dual amplitude with nonlinear trajectories. The earlier versions of the q-deformed dual models are reproduced as limiting cases of the present model.
