Title: On the quantum symmetry of rational field theories
Authors: J. Fuchs and A. Ganchev and P. Vecsernyes
Abstract: We describe the role of Rational Hopf Algebras as the symmetries of rational field theories and discuss their relation with algebraic field theory, braided monoidal categories and modular fusion rule algebras.
