Title: Calogero Models for Distinguishable Particles
Authors: Cyril FURTLEHNER and St√©phane OUVRY
Abstract: Motivated by topological bidimensional quantum models for distinguishable particles, and by Haldane's definition of mutual statistics for different species of particles, we propose a new class of one-dimensional $1/r_{ij}^2$ Calogero model with coupling constants $g_{ij}$ depending on the labels of the particles. We solve the groundstate problem, and show how to build some classes of excited states.
