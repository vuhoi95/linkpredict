Title: SL(2,R) Yang-Mills theory on a circle
Authors: I. Bengtsson and J. Hallin
Abstract: The kinematics of SL(2,R) Yang-Mills theory on a circle is considered, for reasons that are spelled out. The gauge transformations exhibit hyperbolic fixed points, and this results in a physical configuration space with a non-Hausdorff "network" topology. The ambiguity encountered in canonical quantization is then much more pronounced than in the compact case, and can not be resolved through the kind of appeal made to group theory in that case.
