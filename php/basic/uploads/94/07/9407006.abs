Title: Extended Geometry of Black Holes
Authors: K. Peeters and C. Schweigert and J. W. van Holten
Abstract: We reconsider space-time singularities in classical Einsteinian general relativity: with the help of several new co-ordinate systems we show that the Schwarzschild solution can be extended beyond the curvature singularity at r=0. The extension appears as an infinite covering of standard Kruskal space-time. While the two-dimensional reduction of this infinite sequence of Kruskal-Szekeres domains obtained by suppressing the angular degrees of freedom is still a topological manifold - albeit one for which the metric structure is singular on one-dimensional submanifolds - we obtain for the full four-dimensional geometry the more general structure of a stratified variety.
