Title: Polynomial identities of the Rogers--Ramanujan type
Authors: Omar Foda and Yas-Hiro Quano
Abstract: Presented are polynomial identities which imply generalizations of Euler and Rogers--Ramanujan identities. Both sides of the identities can be interpreted as generating functions of certain restricted partitions. We prove the identities by establishing a graphical one-to-one correspondence between those two kinds of restricted partitions.
