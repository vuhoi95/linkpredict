Title: The Bosonic Structure of Fermions
Authors: J. Ruan and R. J. Crewther
Abstract: We bosonize fermions by identifying their occupation numbers as the binary digits of a Bose occupation number. Unlike other schemes, our method allows infinitely many fermionic oscillators to be constructed from just one bosonic oscillator.
