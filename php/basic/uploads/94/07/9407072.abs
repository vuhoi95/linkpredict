Title: Static Solution of the General Relativistic Nonlinear $Ïƒ$-Model  Equation
Authors: Chul H. Lee and Joon Ha Kim and Hyun Kyu Lee
Abstract: The nonlinear $\sigma$-model is considered to be useful in describing hadrons (Skyrmions) in low energy hadron physics and the approximate behavior of the global texture. Here we investigate the properties of the static solution of the nonlinear $\sigma$-model equation coupled with gravity. As in the case where gravity is ignored, there is still no scale parameter that determines the size of the static solution and the winding number of the solution is $1/2$. The geometry of the spatial hyperspace in the asymptotic region of large $r$ is explicitly shown to be that of a flat space with some missing solid angle.
