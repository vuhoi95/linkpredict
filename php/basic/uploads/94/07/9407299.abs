Title: High energy Scattering in 2+1 QCD: A Dipole Picture
Authors: Miao Li and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: A dipole picture of high energy scattering is developed in the 2+1 dimensional QCD, following Mueller. A generalized integral equation for the dipole density with a given separation and center of mass position is derived, and meson-meson non-forward scattering amplitude is therefore calculated. We also calculate the amplitude due to two pomeron exchange, and the triple pomeron coupling. We compare the result obtained by this method to our previous result based on an effective action approach, and find the two results agree at the one pomeron exchange level.
