Title: On algebraic equations satisfied by hypergeometric correlators in WZW  models. II
Authors: Boris Feigin and Vadim Schechtman and Alexander Varchenko
Abstract: We give an explicit description of "bundles of conformal blocks" in Wess-Zumino-Witten models of Conformal field theory and prove that integral representations of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations constructed earlier by the second and third authors are in fact sections of these bundles.
