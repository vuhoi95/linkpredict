Title: Boundary Dynamics in Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Sumit R. Das and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the boundary dilaton gravity coupled to N massles scalars. We rederive the boundary conditions of [1] and [3] in a way which makes the requirement of reparametrization invariance and role of conformal anomaly explicit. We then study the semiclassical behaviour of the boundary in the N = 24 theory in the presence of an incoming matter wave with a constant energy flux spreaded over a finite interval. There is a critical value of the matter energy density below which the boundary is stable and all the matter is reflected back. For energy densities greater than this critical value there is a similar behaviour for small values of total energy thrown in. However, when the total energy exceeds another critical value, the boundary exibits a runaway behaviour and the spacetime devolopes singularities and horizons.
