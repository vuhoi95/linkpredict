Title: A queer reduction of degrees of freedom
Authors: L. V. Avdeev and M. V. Chizhov
Abstract: The classical dynamics of antisymmetric second-rank tensor matter fields is analyzed. The conformally invariant action for the tensor field leads to a positive-definite hamiltonian on the class of the solutions that are bounded at the time infinity (plane waves). Only the longitudinal waves contribute to the energy and momentum. The helicity proves to be equal to zero.
