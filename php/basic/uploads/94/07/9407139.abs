Title: The QCD Trace Anomaly as a Vacuum Effect (The vacuum is a medium is the  message!)
Authors: J. Grundberg and T. H. Hansson
Abstract: We use arguments taken from the electrodynamics of media to deduce the QCD trace anomaly from the expression for the vacuum energy in the presence of an external color magnetic field.
