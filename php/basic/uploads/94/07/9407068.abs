Title: A Note on Representations of N=2 SW-Algebras
Authors: R. Blumenhagen and R. Huebel
Abstract: We investigate the representation theory of some recently constructed N=2 super W-algebras with two generators. Except for the central charges in the unitary minimal series of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra we find no new rational models. However, from our results it is possible to arrange all known N=2 super W-algebras with two generators and vanishing self-coupling constant into four classes. For the algebras existing for c >= 3 which can be understood by the spectral flow of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra we find that the representations have quantized U(1) charge.
