Title: Energy associated with charged dilaton black holes
Authors: A. Chamorro and K. S. Virbhadra
Abstract: It is known that certain properties of charged dilaton black holes depend on a free parameter $\beta$ which controls the strength of the coupling of the dilaton to the Maxwell field. We obtain the energy associated with static spherically symmetric charged dilaton black holes for arbitrary value of the coupling parameter and find that the energy distribution depends on the value of $\beta$. With increasing radial distance, the energy in a sphere increases for $\beta = 0$ as well as for $\beta < 1$, decreases for $\beta > 1$, and remains constant for $\beta = 1$. However, the total energy turns out to be the same for all values of $\beta$.
