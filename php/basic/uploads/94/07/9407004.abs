Title: Gravitational Phenomena from Superstrings in Curved Spacetime
Authors: E. Kiritsis and C. Kounnas
Abstract: The four-dimensional superstring solutions define at low energy effective supergravity theories. A class of them extends successfully the validity of the standard model up to the string scale (${\cal O}(10^{17})~TeV$). We stress the importance of string corrections which are relevant for low energy (${\cal O}(1)~TeV$) predictions of gauge and Yukawa couplings as well as the spectrum of the supersymmetric particles. A class of exact string solutions are also presented, providing non trivial space-time backgrounds, from which we can draw some lessons concerning the regions of space-time where the notion of the effective field theory prescription make sense. We show that the string gravitational phenomena may induce during the cosmological evolution, transitions from one effective field theory prescription to a different one where the geometrical and topological data, as well as the relevant observable states are drastically different.
