Title: Higher algebras and mesonic spectrum in two-dimensional QCD
Authors: E. Abdalla and M. C. B. Abdalla
Abstract: We construct composite operators in two-dimensional bosonized QCD, which obey a $W_\infty$ algebra, and discuss their relation to analogous objects recently obtained in the fermionic language. A complex algebraic structure is unravelled, supporting the idea that the model is integrable. For singlets we find a mass spectrum obeying the Regge behavior.
