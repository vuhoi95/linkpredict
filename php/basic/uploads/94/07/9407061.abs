Title: BRST-Antibracket Cohomology in 2D Conformal Gravity
Authors: Friedemann Brandt and Walter Troost and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We present results of a computation of the BRST-antibracket cohomology in the space of local functionals of the fields and antifields for a class of 2d gravitational theories which are conformally invariant at the classical level. In particular all classical local action functionals, all candidate anomalies and all BRST--invariant functionals depending nontrivially on antifields are given and discussed for these models.
