Title: Ehlers--Harrison--Type Transformations in Dilaton--Axion Gravity
Authors: D. V. Gal'tsov and O. V. Kechkin
Abstract: The ten--parametric internal symmetry group is found in the $D=4$ Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion theory restricted to space--times admitting a Killing vector field. The group includes dilaton--axion $SL(2,R)$ duality and Harrison--type transformations which are similar to some target--space duality boosts, but act on a different set of variables. New symmetry is used to derive a seven--parametric family of rotating dilaton--axion Taub--NUT dyons.
