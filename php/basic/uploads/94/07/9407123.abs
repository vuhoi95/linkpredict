Title: Two Dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics as the Limit of Higher  Dimensional Theories
Authors: A. Ferrando and A. Jaramillo
Abstract: We define pure gauge $QCD$ on an infinite strip of width $L$. Techniques similar to those used in finite $TQCD$ allow us to relate $3D$-observables to pure $QCD_2$ behaviors. The non triviality of the $L \arrow 0$ limit is proven and the generalization to four dimensions described. The glueball spectrum of the theory in the small width limit is calculated and compared to that of the two dimensional theory.
