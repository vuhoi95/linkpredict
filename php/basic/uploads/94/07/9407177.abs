Title: Quantum Gravity and Equivariant Cohomology
Authors: R. Brooks and G. Lifschytz
Abstract: A procedure for obtaining correlation function densities and wavefunctionals for quantum gravity from the Donaldson polynomial invariants of topological quantum field theories, is given. We illustrate how our procedure may be applied to three and four dimensional quantum gravity. Detailed expressions, derived from \sbft{}, are given in the three dimensional case. A procedure for normalizing these wavefunctionals is proposed.
