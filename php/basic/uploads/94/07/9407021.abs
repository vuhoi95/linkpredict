Title: Global properties of static spherically symmetric charged dilaton  spacetimes with a Liouville potential
Authors: S. J. Poletti and D. L. Wiltshire
Abstract: We derive the global properties of static spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton system in the presence of an arbitrary exponential dilaton potential. We show that -- with the exception of a pure cosmological constant `potential' -- no asymptotically flat, asymptotically de Sitter or asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions exist in these models.
