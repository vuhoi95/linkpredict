Title: Schwinger-Dyson Equations in 2D Induced Gravity in Covariant Gauges
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov and Yu. I. Shil'nov
Abstract: We formulate the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the ladder approximation for 2D induced quantum gravity with fermions using covariant gauges of harmonic type. It is shown that these equations can be formulated consistently in a gauge of Landau type (for negative cosmological constant). A numerical analysis of the equations hints towards the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking, depending on the value of the coupling constant.
