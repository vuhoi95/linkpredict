Abstract: We reconsider the algebraic BRS renormalization of Witten's topological Yang-Mills field theory by making use of a vector supersymmetry Ward identity which improves the finiteness properties of the model. The vector supersymmetric structure is a common feature of several topological theories. The most general local counterterm is determined and is shown to be a trivial BRS-coboundary.
