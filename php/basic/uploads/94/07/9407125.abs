Title: The Invariant Fermion Correlator in the Schwinger Model on the Torus
Authors: James Steele and Jacobus Verbaarschot and Ismail Zahed
Abstract: We construct the gauge invariant fermion correlator in the Schwinger model on the torus. At zero temperature, this correlator falls off with a rate given by the Coulomb energy of an infinitely heavy charge. At high temperature, the screening mass approaches $\pi T/2$, and this in the presence of a mass gap. The fractional Matsubara frequency arises from the action of a pair of induced merons at high temperature that are localized over a range on the order of the meson Compton wavelength $1/m=\sqrt{\pi}/g$. We discuss the quenched approximation in this model, and comment on the possible relevance of some of these results to higher dimensions.
