Title: Integrability and duality in two-dimensional QCD
Authors: E. Abdalla and M. C. B. Abdalla
Abstract: We consider bosonized $QCD_2$, and prove that after rewritting the theory in terms of gauge invariant fields, there exists an integrability condition valid for the quantum theory as well. Furthermore, performing a duality type transformation we obtain an appropriate action for the description of the strong coupling limit, which is still integrable. We also prove that the model displays a complicated set of constraints, restricting the dynamics of part of the theory, but which are necessary to maintain the positive metric Hilbert space.
