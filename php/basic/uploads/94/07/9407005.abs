Title: A note on the index bundle over the moduli space of monopoles
Authors: John D. S. Jones and Michael K. Murray
Abstract: Donaldson has shown that the moduli space of monopoles $M_k$ is diffeomorphic to the space $\Rat_k$ of based rational maps from the two-sphere to itself. We use this diffeomorphism to give an explicit description of the bundle on $\Rat_k$ obtained by pushing out the index bundle from $M_k$. This gives an alternative and more explicit proof of some earlier results of Cohen and Jones.
