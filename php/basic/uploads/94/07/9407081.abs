Title: Conformal Properties of Primary Fields in a q-Deformed Theory
Authors: C. H. Oh and K. Singh
Abstract: We examine some of the standard features of primary fields in the framework of a $q$-deformed conformal field theory. By introducing a $q$-OPE between the energy momentum tensor and a primary field, we derive the $q$-analog of the conformal Ward identities for correlation functions of primary fields. We also obtain solutions to these identities for the two-point function.
