Title: Random Geometries and Real Space Renormalization Group
Authors: D. Johnston and J-P. Kownacki and A. Krzywicki
Abstract: A method of ``blocking'' triangulations that rests on the self-similarity feature of dynamically triangulated random manifolds is proposed. The method is used to define the renormalization group for random geometries. As an illustration, the idea is applied to pure euclidean quantum gravity in two dimensions. Generalisation to more complicated systems and to higher dimensionalities of space-time appears straightforward.
