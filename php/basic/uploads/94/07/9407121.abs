Title: Time Evolution of an Anharmonic Oscillator Interacting with a Squeezed  Bath
Authors: G. M. D'Ariano and M. Fortunato and P. Tombesi
Abstract: The evolution of a single mode of the electromagnetic field interacting with a squeezed bath in a Kerr medium is considered. The solution of the corresponding master equation is given numerically. It is argued that the creation of a superposition state (Schr\"odinger's cat) is better achieved in presence of a squeezed reservoir than of a thermal one.
