Title: Smooth Non-Abelian Bosonization
Authors: P. H. Damgaard and R. Sollacher
Abstract: We present an extension of ``smooth bosonization'' to the non-Abelian case. We construct an enlarged theory containing both bosonic and fermionic fields which exhibits a local chiral gauge symmetry. A gauge fixing function depending on one real parameter allows us to interpolate smoothly between a purely fermionic and a purely bosonic representation. The procedure is, in the special case of bosonization, complementary to the approach based on duality.
