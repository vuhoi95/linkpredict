Title: "TRIVIALITY" MADE EASY: the real (lambda Phi^4)_4 story
Authors: M. Consoli and P. M. Stevenson
Abstract: The real meaning of `triviality' of (lambda Phi^4)_4 theory is outlined. Assuming `triviality' leads to an effective potential that is just the classical potential plus the zero-point energy of the free-field fluctuations. This V_{eff} gives spontaneous symmetry breaking. Its proper renormalization has the consequence that all scattering amplitudes vanish, self-consistently validating the original assumption. Nevertheless, the theory is physically distinguishable from a free field theory; it has a symmetry-restoring phase transition at a finite critical temperature.
