Title: Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Particles and their Quantization
Authors: Dongsu Bak and R. Jackiw and So-Young Pi
Abstract: A many--body Schr\"odinger equation for non--Abelian Chern--Simons particles is obtained from both point--particle and field--theoretic pictures. We present a particle Lagrangian and a field theoretic Lagrange density, and discuss their properties. Both are quantized by the symplectic method of Hamiltonian reduction. An $N$--body Schr\"odinger equation for the particles is obtained from both starting points. It is shown that the resulting interaction between particles can be replaced by non--trivial boundary conditions. Also, the equation is compared with the one given in the literature.
