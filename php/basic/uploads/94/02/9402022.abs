Title: Gaudin Model, Bethe Ansatz and Critical Level
Authors: Boris Feigin and Edward Frenkel and Nikolai Reshetikhin
Abstract: We propose a new method of diagonalization of hamiltonians of the Gaudin model associated to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra, which is based on Wakimoto modules over affine algebras at the critical level. We construct eigenvectors of these hamiltonians by restricting certain invariant functionals on tensor products of Wakimoto modules. In conformal field theory language, the eigenvectors are given by certain bosonic correlation functions. Analogues of Bethe ansatz equations naturally appear as Kac-Kazhdan type equations on the existence of certain singular vectors in Wakimoto modules. We use this construction to expalain a connection between Gaudin's model and correlation functions of WZNW models.
