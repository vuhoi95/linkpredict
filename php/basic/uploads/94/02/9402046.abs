Title: Gravity and Electromagnetism in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: Giovanni Landi and Nguyen Ai Viet and Kameshwar C. Wali
Abstract: We present a unified description of gravity and electromagnetism in the framework of a $Z_2$ noncommutative differential calculus. It can be considered as a ``discrete version" of Kaluza-Klein theory, where the fifth continuous dimension is replaced by two discrete points. We derive an action which coincides with the dimensionally reduced one of the ordinary Kaluza-Klein theory.
