Title: Quasiclassical asymptotics of solutions to the KZ equations
Authors: Nicolai Reshetikhin and Alexander Varchenko
Abstract: The quasiclassical asymptotics of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system is studied. Solutions to this system in this limit are related naturally to Bethe vectors in the Gaudin model of spin chains.
