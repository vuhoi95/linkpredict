Title: Separation of variables for the quantum relativistic Toda lattices
Authors: V. B. Kuznetsov and A. V. Tsiganov
Abstract: We consider quantum analogs of the relativistic Toda lattices and give new $2\times 2$ $L$-operators for these models. Making use of the variable separation the spectral problem for the quantum integrals of motion is reduced to solving one-dimensional separation equations.
