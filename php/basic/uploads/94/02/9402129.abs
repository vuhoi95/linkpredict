Title: Schr√∂dinger Fields on the Plane with non-Abelian Chern-Simons  Interactions
Authors: Won Tae Kim and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: Physical content of the nonrelativistic quantum field theory with non-Abelian Chern-Simons interactions is clarified with the help of the equivalent first- quantized description which we derive in any physical gauge.
