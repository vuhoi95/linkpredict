Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov and A. Romeo and Yu. I. Shil'nov
Abstract: The Schwinger-Dyson equations in the ladder approximation for $2D$ induced gravity coupled to fermions on a flat background are obtained in conformal gauge. A numerical study of these equations shows the possiblity of chiral symmetry breaking in this theory.
