Title: Continuous Local Symmetry in Ising-type Models
Authors: S. Randjbar-Daemi and J. Strathdee
Abstract: A class of generalized Ising models is examined with a view to extracting a low energy sector comprising Dirac fermions coupled to Yang-Mills vectors. The main feature of this approach is a set of gap equations, covariant with respect to one of the $4$-dimensional crystallographic space groups.
