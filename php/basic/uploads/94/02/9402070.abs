Title: The Differential Calculus on Quantum Linear Groups
Authors: L. D. Faddeev and P. N. Pyatov
Abstract: The non-commutative differential calculus on the quantum groups $SL_q(N)$ is constructed. The quantum external algebra proposed contains the same number of generators as in the classical case. The exterior derivative defined in the constructive way obeys the modified version of the Leibnitz rules.
