Title: Differential Equations for Sine-Gordon Correlation Functions at the Free  Fermion Point
Authors: D. Bernard and A. Leclair
Abstract: We demonstrate that for the sine-Gordon theory at the free fermion point, the 2-point correlation functions of the fields $\exp (i\al \Phi )$ for $0< \al < 1$ can be parameterized in terms of a solution to a sinh-Gordon-like equation. This result is derived by summing over intermediate multiparticle states and using the form factors to express this as a Fredholm determinant. The proof of the differential equations relies on a $\Zmath_2$ graded multiplication law satisfied by the integral operators of the Fredholm determinant. Using this methodology, we give a new proof of the differential equations which govern the spin and disorder field correlators in the Ising model.
