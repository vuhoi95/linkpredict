Title: Conformally Invariant Cosmology Based on Riemann-Cartan Spacetime
Authors: Yuri V. Shtanov and Sergei A. Yushchenko
Abstract: Conformally invariant GUT-like model including gravity based on Riemann - Cartan space-time $U_4$ is considered. Cosmological scenario that follows from the model is discussed and standard quantum gravitational formalism in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner form is developed. General formalism is then illustrated on Bianchi-IX minisuperspace cosmological model. Wave functions of the universe in the de Sitter minisuperspace model with Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking boundary conditions are considered and corresponding probability distributions for the scalar field values are calculated.
