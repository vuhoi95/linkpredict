Title: Photon Radiation in a Heat Bath
Authors: P V Landshoff and J C Taylor
Abstract: We discuss the bremsstrahlung of photons into a heat bath, and calculate from first principles the energy radiated. Even to lowest order the spectrum of the radiation at low frequency is no more singular than at zero temperature. In addition to the obvious contributions, this spectrum includes terms associated with fluctuations. [Revised version has additional explanations]
