Title: Possible Evidences of Kaluza-Klein Particles in a Scalar Model with  Spherical Compactification
Authors: E. Elizalde and Yu. Kubyshin
Abstract: Possible experimental manifestations of the contribution of heavy Kaluza-Klein particles, within a simple scalar model in six dimensions with spherical compactification, are studied. The approach is based on the assumption that the inverse radius $L^{-1}$ of the space of extra dimensions is of the order of the scale of the supersymmetry breaking $M_{SUSY} \sim 1 \div 10$ TeV. The total cross section of the scattering of two light particles is calculated to one loop order and the effect of the Kaluza-Klein tower is shown to be noticeable for energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 1.4 L^{-1}$.
