Title: A SCHRÖdinger Equation for Mini Universes
Authors: Marco Cavaglià and Vittorio de Alfaro and Alexandre T. Filippov
Abstract: We discuss how to fix the gauge in the canonical treatment of Lagrangians, with finite number of degrees of freedom, endowed with time reparametrization invariance. The motion can then be described by an effective Hamiltonian acting on the gauge shell canonical space. The system is then suited for quantization. We apply this treatment to the case of a Robertson--Walker metric interacting with zero modes of bosonic fields and write a \S equation for the on--shell wave function.
