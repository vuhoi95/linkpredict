Abstract: The ``position'' and ``momentum'' operators for the q-deformed oscillator with q being a root of unity are proved to have discrete eigenvalues which are roots of deformed Hermite polynomials. The Fourier transform connecting the ``position'' and ``momentum'' representations is also found The phase space of this oscillator has a lattice structure, which is a non-uniformly distributed grid. Non-equidistant lattice structures also occur in the cases of the truncated harmonic oscillator and of the q-deformed parafermionic oscillator, while the parafermionic oscillator corresponds to a uniformly distributed grid.
