Title: Geometry of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg Orbifolds
Authors: Toshiya Kawai and Kenji Mohri
Abstract: Several aspects of (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds are investigated. Especially the elliptic genera are computed in general and, for a class of models recently invented by Distler and Kachru, they are compared with the ones from (0,2) sigma models. Our formalism gives an easy way to calculate the generation numbers for lots of Distler-Kachru models even if they are based on singular Calabi-Yau spaces. We also make some general remarks on the Born-Oppenheimer calculation of the ground states elucidating its mathematical meaning in the untwisted sector. For Distler-Kachru models based on non-singular Calabi-Yau spaces we show that there exist `residue' type formulas of the elliptic genera as well.
