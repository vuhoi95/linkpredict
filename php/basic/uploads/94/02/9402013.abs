Title: Mappings of Multimode Bose Algebra Preserving Number Operators
Authors: Miroslav Doresic and Stjepan Meljanac and Marijan Milekovic
Abstract: We define a class of deformed multimode oscillator algebras which possess number operators and can be mapped to multimode Bose algebra.We construct and discuss the states in the Fock space and the corresponding number operators.
