Title: Deterministic Quantum Mechanics
Authors: S. M. Roy and Virendra Singh
Abstract: Present quantum theory, which is statistical in nature, does not predict joint probability distribution of position and momentum because they are noncommuting. We propose a deterministic quantum theory which predicts a joint probability distribution such that the separate probability distributions for position and momentum agree with usual quantum theory. Unlike the Wigner distribution the suggested distribution is positive definite. The theory predicts a correlation between position and momentum in individual events.
