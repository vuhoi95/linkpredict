Title: The Semiclassical Limit of the Two Dimensional Quantum Yang-Mills Model
Authors: Christopher King and Ambar Sengupta
Abstract: We relate the semiclassical limit of the quantum Yang-Mills partition function on a compact oriented surface to the symplectic volume of the moduli space of flat connections, by using an explicit expression for the symplectic form. This gives an independent proof of some recent results of Witten and Forman.
