Title: Information Spreading in Interacting String Field Theory
Authors: D. A. Lowe and L. Susskind and J. Uglum
Abstract: The commutator of string fields is considered in the context of light cone string field theory. It is shown that the commutator is in general non--vanishing outside the string light cone. This could have profound implications for our understanding of the localization of information in quantum gravity.
