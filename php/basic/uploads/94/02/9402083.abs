Title: Non-critical superstrings: a comparison between continuum and discrete  approaches
Authors: A. Zadra and E. Abdalla
Abstract: We review the relation between the matrix model and Liouville approaches to two-dimensional gravity as elaborated by Moore, Seiberg and Staudacher. Then, based on the supersymmetric Liouville formulation and the discrete eigenvalue model proposed by Alvarez-Gaum\'e, Itoyama, Ma\~nes and Zadra, we extend the previous relation to the supersymmetric case. The minisuperspace approximation for the supersymmetric case is formulated, and the corresponding wave equation is found.
