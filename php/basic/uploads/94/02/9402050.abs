Title: Scaling Dimensions of Manifestly Generally Covariant Operators in  Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
Authors: Jun Nishimura and Shinya Tamura and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: Using (2+$\epsilon$)-dimensional quantum gravity recently formulated by Kawai, Kitazawa and Ninomiya, we calculate the scaling dimensions of manifestly generally covariant operators in two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to $(p,q)$ minimal conformal matter. Although the spectrum includes all the scaling dimensions of the scaling operators in the matrix model except the boundary operators, there are also many others which do not appear in the matrix model. We argue that the partial agreement of the scaling dimensions should be considered as accidental and that the operators considered give a new series of operators in two-dimensional quantum gravity.
