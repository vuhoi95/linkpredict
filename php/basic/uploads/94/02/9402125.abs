Title: String Thermalization at a Black Hole Horizon
Authors: A. Mezhlumian and A. Peet and L. Thorlacius
Abstract: Susskind has recently shown that a relativistic string approaching the event horizon of a black hole spreads in both the transverse and longitudinal directions in the reference frame of an outside observer. The transverse spreading can be described as a branching diffusion of wee string bits. This stochastic process provides a mechanism for thermalizing the quantum state of the string as it spreads across the stretched horizon.
