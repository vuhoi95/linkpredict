Title: Two-loop Correction to the Instanton Density for the Double Well  Potential
Authors: Christian F. WÃ¶hler and Edward Shuryak
Abstract: Feynman diagrams in the instanton background are used for the calculation of the tunneling amplitude, up to the two-loops order. Some mistakes made in the previous works are corrected. The same method is applied to the next-order corrections to the ground state wave function.
