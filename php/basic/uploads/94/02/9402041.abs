Title: On the Duistermaat-Heckman Integration Formula And Integrable Models
Authors: T. Karki and A. J. Niemi
Abstract: In this article we review the Duistermaat-Heckman integration formula and the ensuing equivariant cohomology structure, in the finite dimensional case. In particular, we discuss the connection between equivariant cohomology and classical integrability. We also explain how the integration formula is derived, and explore some possible new directions that could eventually yield novel integration formulas for nontrivial integrable models.
