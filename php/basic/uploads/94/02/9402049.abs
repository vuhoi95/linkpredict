Title: BPS Dyon in a Weak Electromagnetic Field: Equations of Motion and  Radiation Fields
Authors: Dongsu Bak and Choonkyu Lee
Abstract: Dynamics of a BPS dyon in a weak, constant, electromagnetic field is studied through a perturbative analysis of appropriate non-linear field equations. The full Lorentz force law for a BPS dyon is established. Also derived are the radiation fields accompanying the motion.
