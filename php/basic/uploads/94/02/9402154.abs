Abstract: A higher-derivative, interacting, scalar field theory in curved spacetime with the most general action of sigma-model type is studied. The one-loop counterterms of the general theory are found. The renormalization group equations corresponding to two different, multiplicatively renormalizable variants of the same are derived. The analysis of their asymptotic solutions shows that, depending on the sign of one of the coupling constants, we can construct an asymptotically free theory which is also asymptotically conformal invariant at strong (or small) curvature. The connection that can be established between one of the multiplicatively renormalizable variants of the theory and the effective theory of the conformal factor, aiming at the description of quantum gravity at large distances, is investigated.
