Title: The Rank four Heterotic Modular Invariant Partition Functions
Authors: T. Gannon and Q. Ho-Kim
Abstract: In this paper, we develop several general techniques to investigate modular invariants of conformal field theories whose algebras of the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors are different. As an application, we find all such ``heterotic'' WZNW physical invariants of (horizontal) rank four: there are exactly seven of these, two of which seem to be new. Previously, only those of rank $\le 3$ have been completely classified. We also find all physical modular invariants for $su(2)_{k_1}\times su(2)_{k_2}$, for $22>k_1>k_2$, and $k_1=28$, $k_2<22$, completing the classification of ref.{} \SUSU.
