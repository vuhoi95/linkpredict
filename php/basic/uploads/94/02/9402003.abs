Title: Running Coupling Constants, Newtonian Potential and non localities in  the Effective Action
Authors: D. A. R. Dalvit and F. D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We consider a quantum scalar field on an arbitrary gravitational background. We obtain the effective {\it in-in} equations for the gravitational fields using a covariant and non-local approximation for the effective action proposed by Vilkovisky and collaborators. {}From these equations, we compute the quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential. We find logarithmic corrections which we identify as the running of the gravitational constants. This running coincides with the renormalization group prediction only for minimal and conformal coupling.
