Title: The Real Test of ``Triviality'' on the Lattice
Authors: A. Agodi and G. Andronico and M. Consoli
Abstract: The generally accepted ``triviality'' of $\lambda\Phi^4$ theories does not forbid Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking but implies a trivially free shifted field which becomes effectively governed by a quadratic hamiltonian. As a consequence, one expects the one-loop potential to be exact . We present a lattice computation of the effective potential for massless $\lambda\Phi^4$ theory which nicely confirms the expectations based on ``triviality''. Our results imply that the magnitude of the Higgs boson mass, beyond perturbation theory, does not represent a measure of the observable interactions in the scalar sector of the standard model.
