Title: The question of anomalies in the Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter  fields
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: We study the Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter field by means of an effective Lagrangian obtained from the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism. We show that there is no rotational anomaly for any proper gauge we choose.
