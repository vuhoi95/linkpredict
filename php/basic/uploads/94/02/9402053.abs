Title: Scalar Kinks
Authors: H. J. de Vega and Luca Mezincescu and Rafael I. Nepomechie
Abstract: We determine the excitations and $S$ matrix of an integrable isotropic antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain of alternating spin 1/2 and spin 1. There are two types of gapless one-particle excitations: the usual spin 1/2 (``spinor'') kink, and a new spin 0 (``scalar'') kink. Remarkably, the scalar-spinor scattering is nontrivial, yet the spinor-spinor scattering is the same as if the scalar kinks were absent. Moreover, there is no scalar-scalar scattering.
