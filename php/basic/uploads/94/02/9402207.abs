Title: A New Perspective on Electroweak Strings
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and P. Olesen
Abstract: The vortex solution (Z-string) of the electroweak interactions can be interpreted as the 2-dimensional sphaleron at the top of a non-contractible sphere. The same holds for another type of solution, the W-string.
