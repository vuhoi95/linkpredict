Title: String Cosmology and the Dimension of Spacetime
Authors: Gerald B. Cleaver and Philip J. Rosenthal
Abstract: The implications of string theory for understanding the dimension of uncompactified spacetime are investigated. Using recent ideas in string cosmology, a new model is proposed to explain why three spatial dimensions grew large. Unlike the original work of Brandenberger and Vafa, this paradigm uses the theory of random walks. A computer model is developed to test the implications of this new approach. It is found that a four-dimensional spacetime can be explained by the proper choice of initial conditions.
