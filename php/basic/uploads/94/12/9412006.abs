Title: Gravity and Geometric Phases
Authors: A. Corichi and M. Pierri
Abstract: The behavior of a quantum test particle satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation in a certain class of 4 dimensional stationary space-times is examined. In a space-time of a spinning cosmic string, the wave function of a particle in a box is shown to acquire a geometric phase when the box is transported around a closed path surrounding the string. When interpreted as an Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase, the effect is shown to be related to the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
