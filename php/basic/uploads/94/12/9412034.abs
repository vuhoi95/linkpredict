Title: A Note On Intrinsic Regularization Method
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Yu Cai and Hong-Bo Teng
Abstract: There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergent graphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantum field theories. Whereupon we may establish a new method, the intrinsic regularization method, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this note, we present a proposal, the inserter proposal, to the method. The $\phi^4$ theory and QED at the one loop order are dealt with in some detail. Inserters in the standard model are given. Some applications to SUSY-models are also made at the one loop order.
