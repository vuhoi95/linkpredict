Title: On Electromagnetic Duality in Locally Supersymmetric N=2 Yang--Mills  Theory
Authors: A. Ceresole and R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara and A. Van Proeyen
Abstract: We consider duality transformations in N=2 Yang--Mills theory coupled to N=2 supergravity, in a manifestly symplectic and coordinate covariant setting. We give the essential of the geometrical framework which allows one to discuss stringy classical and quantum monodromies, the form of the spectrum of BPS saturated states and the Picard--Fuchs identities encoded in the special geometry of N=2 supergravity theories.
