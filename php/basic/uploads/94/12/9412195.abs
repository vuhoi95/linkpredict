Title: BRS symmetry from renormalization group flow
Authors: M. Bonini and M. D'Attanasio and G. Marchesini
Abstract: By using the exact renormalization group formulation we prove perturbatively the Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identities in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This results from two properties: {\it locality}, i.e. the ST identities are valid if their local part is valid; {\it solvability}, i.e. the local part of ST identities is valid if the couplings of the effective action with non-negative dimensions are properly chosen.
