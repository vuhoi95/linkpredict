Title: Thermal Decays in a Hot Fermi Gas
Authors: E. S. Fraga and C. A. A. De Carvalho
Abstract: We present a study of the decay of metastable states of a scalar field via thermal activation, in the presence of a finite density of fermions. The process we consider is the nucleation of ``{\it droplets}'' of true vacuum inside the false one. We analyze a one-dimensional system of interacting bosons and fermions, considering the latter at finite temperature and with a given chemical potential. As a consequence of a non-equilibrium formalism previously developed, we obtain time-dependent decay rates.
