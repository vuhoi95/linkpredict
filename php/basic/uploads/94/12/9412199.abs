Title: Affine and Yangian Symmetries in $SU(2)_1$ Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Andreas W. W. Ludwig and Kareljan Schoutens
Abstract: In these lectures, we study and compare two different formulations of $SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. The first, conventional, formulation employs the affine symmetry of the model; in this approach correlation functions are derived from the so-called Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The second formulation is based on an entirely different algebraic structure, the so-called Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. In this approach, the Hilbert space of the theory is obtained by repeated application of modes of the so-called spinon field, which has $SU(2)$ spin $j=\thalf$ and obeys fractional (semionic) statistics. We show how this new formulation, which can be generalized to many other rational conformal field theories, can be used to compute correlation functions and to obtain new expressions for the Virasoro and affine characters in the theory.
