Title: Differential Geometry on the Space of Connections via Graphs and  Projective Limits
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and Jerzy Lewandowski
Abstract: In a quantum mechanical treatment of gauge theories (including general relativity), one is led to consider a certain completion, $\agb$, of the space $\ag$ of gauge equivalent connections. This space serves as the quantum configuration space, or, as the space of all Euclidean histories over which one must integrate in the quantum theory. $\agb$ is a very large space and serves as a ``universal home'' for measures in theories in which the Wilson loop observables are well-defined. In this paper, $\agb$ is considered as the projective limit of a projective family of compact Hausdorff manifolds, labelled by graphs (which can be regarded as ``floating lattices'' in the physics terminology). Using this characterization, differential geometry is developed through algebraic methods. In particular, we are able to introduce the following notions on $\agb$: differential forms, exterior derivatives, volume forms, vector fields and Lie brackets between them, divergence of a vector field with respect to a volume form, Laplacians and associated heat kernels and heat kernel measures. Thus, although $\agb$ is very large, it is small enough to be mathematically interesting and physically useful. A key feature of this approach is that it does not require a background metric. The geometrical framework is therefore well-suited for diffeomorphism invariant theories such as quantum general relativity.
