Title: Planckian Scattering of Non-abelian Gauge Particles
Authors: Supriya Kar and Jnanadeva Maharana
Abstract: We present a systematic study of high energy scattering of non-abelian gauge particles in (3+1) dimensional Einstein gravity using semi-classical techniques of Verlinde and Verlinde. It is shown that the BRST gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills action in presence of quantum gravity at Planckian energy regime is maintained and the vertex operator is invariant under the BRST transformations. The presence of gravitational shock wave describing the gauge particles is discussed in the resulting (3+1) dimensional effective theory of Yang-Mills gravity.
