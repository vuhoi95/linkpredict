Title: One Spin Trace Formalism for $ B_K $
Authors: Weonjong Lee and Markus Klomfass
Abstract: It has been known for some time that there are two methods to calculate $ B_K $ with staggered fermions: one is the two spin trace formalism and the other is the one spin trace formalism. Until now, the two spin trace formalism has been exclusively used for weak matrix element calculations with staggered fermions. Here, the one spin trace formalism to calculate $ B_K $ with staggered fermions is explained. It is shown that the one spin trace operators require additional chiral partner operators in order to keep the continuum chiral behavior. The renormalization of the one spin trace operators is described and compared with the two spin trace formalism.
