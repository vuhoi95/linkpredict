Title: Interacting anyons and the Darwin Lagrangian
Authors: N. Banerjee and Subir Ghosh
Abstract: We propose a new model for interacting (electrically charged) anyons, where the 2+1-dimensional Darwin term is responsible for interactions. The Hamiltonian is comparable with the one used previously (in the RPA calculation).
