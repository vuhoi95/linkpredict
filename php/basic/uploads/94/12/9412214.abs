Title: To the problem of 1/Nc approximation in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model
Authors: D. Ebert and M. Nagy. M. K. Volkov
Abstract: In this article, the gap equation for the constituent quark mass in the U(2)*U(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for the 1/Nc approximation is investigated. It is shown that taking into account scalar isovector mesons plays an important role for the correct description of quark masses in this approximation. The role of the Ward identity in calculations of 1/Nc corrections to the meson vertex functions is shortly discussed.
