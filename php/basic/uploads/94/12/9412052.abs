Title: SU(2) $\times$ U(1) Gauge Gravity
Authors: H. Dehnen and E. Hitzer
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz-covariant Yang-Mills ``spin-gauge'' theory, where the function valued Pauli matrices play the role of a non-scalar Higgs-field. As symmetry group we choose $SU(2) \times U(1)$ of the 2-spinors describing particle/antiparticle states. After symmetry breaking a non-scalar Lorentz-covariant Higgs-field gravity appears, which can be interpreted within a classical limit as Einstein's metrical theory of gravity, where we restrict ourselves in a first step to its linearized version.
