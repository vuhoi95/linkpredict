Title: Complex-time path-integral formalism for quantum tunneling
Authors: Hideaki Aoyama and Toshiyuki Harano
Abstract: The complex-time formalism is developed in the framework of the path-integral formalism, to be used for analysis of the quantum tunneling phenomena. We show that subleading complex-time saddle-points do not account for the right WKB result. Instead, we develop a reduction formula, which enables us to construct Green functions from simple components of the potential, for which saddle-point method is applicable. This method leads us to the valid WKB result, which incorporates imaginary-time instantons and bounces, as well as the real-time boundary conditions.
