Title: The One-Loop Divergences of the Linear Gravity with the Torsion Terms
Authors: M. Yu. Kalmykov and P. I. Pronin
Abstract: We investigate the role of the torsion field at the quantum level in the affine-metric theory of gravity. One-loop counterterms are calculated in the theory with terms quadratic in the torsion field.
