Title: Spinon basis for higher level SU(2) WZW models
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Andreas Ludwig and Kareljan Schoutens
Abstract: We propose a spinon basis for the integrable highest weight modules of $\hsltw$ at levels $k\geq1$, and discuss the underlying Yangian symmetry. Evaluating the characters in this spinon basis provides new quasi-particle type expressions for the characters of these integrable modules, and explicitly exhibits the structure of an RSOS times a Yangian part, known \eg from $S$-matrix results. We briefly discuss generalizations to other groups and more general conformal field theories.
