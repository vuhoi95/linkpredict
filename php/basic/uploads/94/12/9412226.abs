Authors: Masao Jinzenji and Yi Sun
Abstract: Using the associativity relations of the topological Sigma Models with target spaces, $CP^3, CP^4$ and $Gr(2,4)$ , we derive recursion relations of their correlation and evaluate them up to certain order in the expansion over the instantons. The expansion coeffieients are regarded as the number of rational curves in $CP^3, CP^4$ and $Gr(2,4)$ which intersect various types of submanifolds corresponding to the choice of BRST invariant operators in the correlation functions.
