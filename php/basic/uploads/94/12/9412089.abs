Title: Discrete Gravity in One Dimension
Authors: Herbert W. Hamber and Ruth M. Williams
Abstract: A model for quantum gravity in one (time) dimension is discussed, based on Regge's discrete formulation of gravity. The nature of exact continuous lattice diffeomorphisms and the implications for a regularized gravitational measure are examined. After introducing a massless scalar field coupled to the edge lengths, the scalar functional integral is performed exactly on a finite lattice, and the ensuing change in the measure is determined. It is found that the renormalization of the cosmological constant due to the scalar field fluctuations vanishes identically in one dimension. A simple decimation renormalization group transformation is performed on the partition function and the results are compared with the exact solution. Finally the properties of the spectrum of the scalar Laplacian are compared with results obtained for a Poissonian distribution of edge lengths.
