Abstract: The lagrangian of the N=1, D=10 dual supergravity interacting with the Yang-Mills matter multiplet is constructed starting immediately from the equations of motion obtained from the Bianchi Identities in the superspace approach. The difference is established in comparison with the Gates-Nishino lagrangian at the fourth order level in fermionic fields.
