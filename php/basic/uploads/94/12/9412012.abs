Title: Highest Weight Representations of Quantum Current Algebras
Authors: Sergio Albeverio and Shao-Ming Fei
Abstract: We study the highest weight and continuous tensor product representations of q-deformed Lie algebras through the mappings of a manifold into a locally compact group. As an example the highest weight representation of the q-deformed algebra $sl_q(2,\Cb)$ is calculated in detail.
