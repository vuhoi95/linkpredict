Title: Sphalerons and Conformally Compactified Minkowski Spacetime
Authors: G. W. Gibbons and Alan R. Steif
Abstract: Solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations which describe exploding or imploding shells of gauge field and which may serve as approximations to the exploding sphaleron are discussed. The solutions are conformally related to $SO(2)\times SO(4)$ invariant Yang-Mills solutions. The behavior of fermions in the gauge field background and higher gauge groups are also considered.
