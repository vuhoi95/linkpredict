Title: Solitons, Tau-functions and Hamiltonian Reduction for Non-Abelian  Conformal Affine Toda Theories
Authors: L. A. Ferreira and J. L. Miramontes and J. Sanchez Guillen
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian reduction of the two-loop Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model (WZNW) based on an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra $\cgh$. The resulting reduced models, called {\em Generalized Non-Abelian Conformal Affine Toda (G-CAT)}, are conformally invariant and a wide class of them possesses soliton solutions; these models constitute non-abelian generalizations of the Conformal Affine Toda models. Their general solution is constructed by the Leznov-Saveliev method. Moreover, the dressing transformations leading to the solutions in the orbit of the vacuum are considered in detail, as well as the $\tau$-functions, which are defined for any integrable highest weight representation of $\cgh$, irrespectively of its particular realization. When the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the G-CAT model becomes a generalized Affine Toda model, whose soliton solutions are constructed. Their masses are obtained exploring the spontaneous breakdown of the conformal symmetry, and their relation to the fundamental particle masses is discussed.
