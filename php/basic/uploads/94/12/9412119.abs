Title: Solution of the Three--Anyon Problem
Authors: Stefan Mashkevich and Jan Myrheim and Kåre Olaussen and Ronald Rietman
Abstract: We solve, by separation of variables, the problem of three anyons with a harmonic oscillator potential. The anyonic symmetry conditions from cyclic permutations are separable in our coordinates. The conditions from two-particle transpositions are not separable, but can be expressed as reflection symmetry conditions on the wave function and its normal derivative on the boundary of a circle. Thus the problem becomes one-dimensional. We solve this problem numerically by discretization. $N$-point discretization with very small $N$ is often a good first approximation, on the other hand convergence as $N\to\infty$ is sometimes very slow.
