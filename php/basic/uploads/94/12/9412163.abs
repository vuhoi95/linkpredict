Title: Superconformal Sigma Models in Higher Than Two Dimensions
Authors: E. Sezgin and Y. Tanii
Abstract: Rigidly superconformal sigma models in higher than two dimensions are constructed. These models rely on the existence of conformal Killing spinors on the $p+1$ dimensional worldvolume $(p\le 5)$, and homothetic conformal Killing vectors in the $d$--dimensional target space. In the bosonic case, substituting into the action a particular form of the target space metric admitting such Killing vectors, we obtain an action with manifest worldvolume conformal symmetry, which describes the coupling of $d-1$ scalars to a conformally flat metric on the worldvolume. We also construct gauged sigma models with worldvolume conformal supersymmetry. The models considered here are generalizations of the singleton actions on $S^p\times S^1$, constructed sometime ago by Nicolai and these authors.
