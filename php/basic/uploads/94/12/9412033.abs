Title: Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds with discrete torsion
Authors: M. Kreuzer and H. Skarke
Abstract: We complete the classification of (2,2) vacua that can be constructed from Landau--Ginzburg models by abelian twists with arbitrary discrete torsions. Compared to the case without torsion the number of new spectra is surprisingly small. In contrast to a popular expectation mirror symmetry does not seem to be related to discrete torsion (at least not in the present compactification framework): The Berglund-H"ubsch construction naturally extends to orbifolds with torsion; for more general potentials, on the other hand, the new spectra neither have nor provide mirror partners in our class of models.
