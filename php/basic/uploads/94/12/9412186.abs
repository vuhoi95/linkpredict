Title: Explicit breaking of supersymmetry by non-perturbative effects
Authors: A. Casher and V. Elkonin and Y. Shamir
Abstract: Instanton effects in a family of completely massive Higgs models with N=1 supersymmetry are investigated. The models have $N_c=2$ and $N_f\ge 2$. In each model, we show that a certain gauge invariant correlation function depends in a non-trivial way on its coordinates, in spite of the fact that supersymmetry requires its constancy. This means that non-perturbative effects break supersymmetry explicitly in the one instanton sector. We also show that condensates arising in the point-like limit of the above correlation functions can in principle be used to induce the Electro-Weak scale.
