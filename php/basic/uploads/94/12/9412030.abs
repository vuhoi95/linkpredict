Title: Background Thermal Contributions in Testing the Unruh Effect
Authors: Sandro S. Costa and George E. A. Matsas
Abstract: We consider inertial and accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors moving in a background thermal bath and calculate their excitation rates. It is shown that for fast moving detectors such a thermal bath does not affect substantially the excitation probability. Our results are discussed in connection with a possible proposal of testing the Unruh effect in high energy particle accelerators.
