Title: Perturbative Metric of Charged Black Holes in Quadratic Gravity
Authors: M. Campanelli and C. O. Lousto and J. Audretsch
Abstract: We consider perturbative solutions to the classical field equations coming from a quadratic gravitational lagrangian in four dimensions. We study the charged, spherically symmetric black hole and explicitly give corrections up to third order (in the coupling constant $\beta$ multiplying the $R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ term) to the Reissner--Nordstr\"om hole metric. We consider the thermodynamics of such black holes, in particular, we compute explicitly its temperature and entropy--area relation which deviates from the usual $S=A/4$ expression.
