Title: Topological Strings from WZW Models
Authors: K. Landsteiner and W. Lerche and A. Sevrin
Abstract: We show that the BRST structure of the topological string is encoded in the ``small'' $N=4$ superconformal algebra, enabling us to obtain, in a non-trivial way, the string theory from hamiltonian reduction of $A(1|1)$. This leads to the important conclusion that not only ordinary string theories, but topological strings as well, can be obtained, or even defined, by hamiltonian reduction from WZW models. Using two different gradations, we find either the standard $N=2$ minimal models coupled to topological gravity, or an embedding of the bosonic string into the topological string. We also comment briefly on the generalization to super Lie algebras $A(n|n)$.
