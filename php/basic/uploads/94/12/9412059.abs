Title: On the classification of quantum Poincar√© groups
Authors: P. Podles and S. L. Woronowicz
Abstract: Using the general theory of [10] ( hep-th 9412058 ), quantum Poincar\'e groups (without dilatations) are described and investigated. The description contains a set of numerical parameters which satisfy certain polynomial equations. For most cases we solve them and give the classification of quantum Poincar\'e groups. Each of them corresponds to exactly one quantum Minkowski space. The Poincar\'e series of these objects are the same as in the classical case. We also classify possible $R$-matrices for the fundamental representation of the group.
