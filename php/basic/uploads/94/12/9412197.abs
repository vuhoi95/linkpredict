Title: The Solution of the d-Dimensional Twisted Group Lattices
Authors: O. Lechtenfeld and S. Samuel
Abstract: The general d-dimensional twisted group lattice is solved. The irreducible representations of the corresponding group are constructed by an explicit procedure. It is proven that they are complete. All matrix representation solutions to the quantum hyperplane equations are obtained.
