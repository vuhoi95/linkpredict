Title: Low--Energy Properties of (0,2) Compactifications
Authors: P. Mayr and S. Stieberger
Abstract: We investigate the low--energy properties of a Z_12 orbifold with continuous Wilson line moduli. They give rise to a (0,2) superstring compactification. Their Kaehler potentials and Yukawa couplings are calculated. We study the discrete symmetries of the model and their implications on the threshold corrections to the gauge couplings as well as for string unification.
