Title: The Refined Elliptic Genus and Coulomb Gas Formulations of $N=2$  Superconformal Coset Models
Authors: D. Nemeschansky and N. P. Warner
Abstract: We describe, in some detail, a number of different Coulomb gas formulations of $N=2$ superconformal coset models. We also give the mappings between these formulations. The ultimate purpose of this is to show how the Landau-Ginzburg structure of these models can be used to extract the $W$-generators, and to show how the computation of the elliptic genus can be refined so as to extract very detailed information about the characters of component parts of the model.
