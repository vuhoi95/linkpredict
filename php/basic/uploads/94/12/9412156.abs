Title: Quantal Overlapping Resonance Criterion in the Pullen Edmonds Model
Authors: S. Graffi and V. R. Manfredi and L. Salasnich
Abstract: In order to highlight the onset of chaos in the Pullen-Edmonds model a quantal analog of the resonance overlap criterion has been examined. A quite good agreement between analytical and numerical results is obtained.
