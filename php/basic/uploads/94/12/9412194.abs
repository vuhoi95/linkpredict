Title: The Yangian Deformation of the W-Algebras and and the  Calogero-Sutherland model
Authors: Denis Bernard and Kazuhiro Hikami and Miki Wadati
Abstract: The Yangian symmetry Y(su($n$)) of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser spin model is reconsidered. The Yangian generators are constructed from two non-commuting su($n$)-loop algebras. The latters generate an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra which is a deformation of the $W_\infty$-algebra. We show that this deformed $W_\infty$-algebra contains an infinite number of Yangian subalgebras with different deformation parameters.
