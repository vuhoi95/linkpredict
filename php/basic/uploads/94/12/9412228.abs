Title: Antibracket, Antifields and Gauge-Theory Quantization
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Jordi Paris and Stuart Samuel
Abstract: The antibracket formalism for gauge theories, at both the classical and quantum level, is reviewed. Gauge transformations and the associated gauge structure are analyzed in detail. The basic concepts involved in the antibracket formalism are elucidated. Gauge-fixing, quantum effects, and anomalies within the field-antifield formalism are developed. The concepts, issues and constructions are illustrated using eight gauge-theory models.
