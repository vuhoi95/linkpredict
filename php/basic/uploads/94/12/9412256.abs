Title: Parity Symmetry Restoration in Qed3 at High Temperature and Finite  Density
Authors: Martin Klein-Kreisler and Manuel Torres
Abstract: We investigate the properties of quantum electrodynamics $(QED_3)$ in two spatial dimensions at finite temperature and density. The static as well as the dynamical properties of the planar plasma are calculated using the real time formalism of quantum field theory. It is shown, that due to the presence of the parity breaking Chern-Simons term, the propagating modes of the photon consists of two longielliptic waves with different values for the masses. However, it is shown that both in the high temperature and high density limit the parity symmetry is restored; in this limit the propagating modes reduce to the longitudinal and transverse ones, both with the same mass.
