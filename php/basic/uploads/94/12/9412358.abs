Title: The Worldline Path Integral Approach to Feynman Graphs
Authors: M. G. Schmidt and C. Schubert
Abstract: The worldline path integral approach to the Bern-Kosower formalism is reviewed, which offers an alternative to Feynman diagram calculations in quantum field theory. Recent progress in constructing a multiloop generalization of this formalism is reported.
