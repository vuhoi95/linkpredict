Abstract: The dynamics of massive particles in the collinear high momentum regime is investigated. Methods hitherto exploiting large time asymptotic Hamiltonians in the Dirac picture for the treatment of infrared divergences are adapted to the collinear asymptotic dynamics. The essential role of time ordering of the dressing operators is brought out.
