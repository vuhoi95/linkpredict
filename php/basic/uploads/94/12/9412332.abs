Title: String no-scale supergravity
Authors: J. Lopez and D. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We explore the postulates of string no-scale supergravity in the context of free-fermionic string models. The requirements of vanishing vacuum energy, flat directions of the scalar potential, and stable no-scale mechanism impose strong restrictions on possible string no-scale models, which must possess only two or three moduli, and a constrained massless spectrum. The soft-supersymmetry-breaking parameters involving all twisted and untwisted fields are given explicitly. This class of models contain no free parameters, \ie, in principle all supersymmetric particle masses and interactions are completely determined. A computerized search for free-fermionic models with the desired properties yields a candidate $SU(5)\times U(1)$ model containing extra (\r{10},\rb{10}) matter representations that allow gauge coupling unification at the string scale. Our candidate model possesses a bening non-universal assignment of supersymmetry breaking scalar masses, which may have interesting low-energy experimental consequences.
