Title: Wess-Zumino Terms for Reducible Anomalous Gauge Theories
Authors: J. Gomis and J. M. Pons and F. Zamora
Abstract: Reducible off-shell anomalous gauge theories are studied in the framework of an extended Field-Antifield formalism by introducing new variables associated with the anomalous gauge degrees of freedom. The Wess-Zumino term for these theories is constructed and new gauge invariances appear. The quantum effects due to the extra variables are considered.
