Title: Field theory of anyons in the lowest Landau level
Authors: T. H. Hansson and J. M. Leinaas and S. Viefers
Abstract: We construct a field theory for anyons in the lowest Landau level starting from the $N$-particle description, and discuss the connection to the full field theory of anyons defined using a statistical gauge potential. The theory is transformed to free form, with the fields defined on the circle and satisfying modified commutation relations. The Fock space of the anyons is discussed, and the theory is related to that of edge excitations of an anyon droplet in a harmonic oscillator well.
