Title: Phase Transition for Gravitationally Collapsing Dust Shells in 2+1  Dimensions
Authors: Yoav Peleg and Alan Steif
Abstract: The collapse of thin dust shells in 2+1 dimensional gravity with and without a cosmological constant in analyzed. A critical value of the shell's mass as a function of its radius and position is derived. For $\Lambda < 0$, a naked singularity or black hole forms depending on whether the shell's mass is below or just above this value. The solution space is divided into four different regions by three critical surfaces. For $\Lambda < 0$, two surfaces separate regions of black hole solutions and solutions with naked singularities, while the other surface separates regions of open and closed spaces. Near the transition between black hole and naked singularity, we find ${\cal M} \sim c_{p}(p-p^*)^{\beta}$, where $\beta=1/2$ and ${\cal M}$ is a naturally defined order parameter. We find no phase transition in crossing from an open to closed space. The critical solutions are analogous to higher dimensional extremal black holes. All four phases coexist at one point in solution space correspondiong to the static extremal solution.
