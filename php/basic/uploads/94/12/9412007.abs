Title: Some Quantum Aspects of Complex Vector Fields with Chern-Simons Term
Authors: O. M. Del Cima and F. A. B. Rabelo de Carvalho
Abstract: Complex vector fields with Maxwell, Chern-Simons and Proca terms are minimally coupled to an Abelian gauge field. The consistency of the spectrum is analysed and 1-loop quantum corrections to the self-energy are explicitly computed and discussed. The incorporation of 2-loop contributions and the behaviour of tree-level scattering amplitudes in the limit of high center-of-mass energies are also commented.
