Title: Casimir Forces between Beads on Strings and Membranes
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and Pierre Sikivie and Youli Kanev
Abstract: We develop a general formalism to calculate the force between beads attached to a flat $d$-dimensional membrane due to the quantum fluctuations of the membrane. The interaction potential is derived as a function of $d$ and the membrane energy density, tension, stiffness and temperature. We find that the induced interactions turn off when $d$ exceeds a certain critical dimension. The potential is attractive in all cases where it is non-zero and at finite temperature falls off exponentially for large distances.
