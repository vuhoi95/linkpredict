Title: Lie group weight multiplicities from conformal field theory
Authors: T. Gannon and C. Jakovljevic and M. A. Walton
Abstract: Dominant weight multiplicities of simple Lie groups are expressed in terms of the modular matrices of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, and related objects. Symmetries of the modular matrices give rise to new relations among multiplicities. At least for some Lie groups, these new relations are strong enough to completely fix all multiplicities.
