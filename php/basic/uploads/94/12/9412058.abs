Title: On the structure of inhomogeneous quantum groups
Authors: P. Podles and S. L. Woronowicz
Abstract: We investigate inhomogeneous quantum groups G built from a quantum group H and translations. The corresponding commutation relations contain inhomogeneous terms. Under certain conditions (which are satisfied in our study of quantum Poincare groups [12]) we prove that our construction has correct `size', find the R-matrices and the analogues of Minkowski space for G.
