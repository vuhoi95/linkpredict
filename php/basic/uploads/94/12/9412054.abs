Title: Quantum Corrections to the Entropy for Higher Spin Fields in Hyperbolic  Space
Authors: M. Bordag and A. A. Bytsenko
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections to the free energy and to the entropy for fields with arbitrary spins in the space $S^1\otimes H^N$. For conformally invariant fields by means of a conformal transformation of the metric the results are valid in Rindler space with $D=N+1$ dimensions. We use the zeta regularization technique which yields an ultraviolet finite result for the entropy per unit area. The problem of the infinite area factor in the entropy which arises equally in Rindler space and in the black hole background is addressed in the light of a factor space $H^N/\Gamma$.
