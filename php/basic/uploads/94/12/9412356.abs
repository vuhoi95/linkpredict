Title: Two-loop three-point diagrams with irreducible numerators
Authors: Natalia I. Ussyukina and Andrei I. Davydychev
Abstract: We study the problem of calculating two-loop three-point diagrams with irreducible numerators (i.e. numerators which cannot be expressed in terms of the denominators). For the case of massless internal particles and arbitrary (off-shell) external momenta, exact results are obtained in terms of polylogarithms. We also consider the tensor decomposition of two-loop three-point diagrams, and show how it is connected with irreducible numerators.
