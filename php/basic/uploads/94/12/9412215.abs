Title: Random Walk Construction of Spinor Fields on Three Dimensional Lattice
Authors: Masako Asano and Chigak Itoi and Shin-Ichi Kojima
Abstract: Euclidean invariant Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons field theories are constructed in terms of a random walk with a spin factor on a three dimensional lattice. We exactly calculate the free energy and the correlation functions which allow us to obtain the critical diffusion constant and associated critical exponents. It is pointed out that these critical exponents do not satisfy the hyper-scaling relation but the scaling inequalities. We take the continuum limit of this theory on the basis of these analyses. We check the universality of obtained results on other lattice structure such as triclinic lattice and body centered lattice.
