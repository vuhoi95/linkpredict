Title: Dirac versus reduced phase space quantization
Authors: Mikhail S. Plyushchay and Alexander V. Razumov
Abstract: The relationship between the Dirac and reduced phase space quantizations is investigated for spin models belonging to the class of Hamiltonian systems having no gauge conditions. It is traced out that the two quantization methods may give similar, or essentially different physical results, and, moreover, it is shown that there is a class of constrained systems, which can be quantized only by the Dirac method. A possible interpretation of the gauge degrees of freedom is given.
