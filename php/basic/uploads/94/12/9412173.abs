Title: An Effective Action for Quasi-elastic Scatterings in QCD
Authors: B. K. Chung and Soonkeon Nam and Q-Han Park and H. J. Shin
Abstract: A new effective action for the high energy quark-quark scatterings is obtained by applying a scaling approximation to the QCD action. The propagators are shown to factorize into the transverse and the longitudinal parts so that the scattering amplitudes are given in terms of the products of two dimensional $S$-matrices. we show that our action provides a natural effective field theory for the Lipatov's theory of quark scatterings with quasi-elastic unitarity. The amplitude with quasi-elastic unitarity obtained from this action shows `Regge' behavior and is eikonalized.
