Title: Magnetic Moment and Perturbation Theory with Singular Magnetic Fields
Authors: Alain Comtet and Stefan Mashkevich and St√©phane Ouvry
Abstract: The spectrum of a charged particle coupled to Aharonov-Bohm/anyon gauge fields displays a nonanalytic behavior in the coupling constant. Within perturbation theory, this gives rise to certain singularities which can be handled by adding a repulsive contact term to the Hamiltonian. We discuss the case of smeared flux tubes with an arbitrary profile and show that the contact term can be interpreted as the coupling of a magnetic moment spinlike degree of freedom to the magnetic field inside the flux tube. We also clarify the ansatz for the redefinition of the wave function.
