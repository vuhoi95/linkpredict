Title: Signatures of Confinement in Axial Gauge QCD
Authors: F. Lenz and E. J. Moniz and M. Thies
Abstract: A comparative dynamical study of axial gauge QED and QCD is presented. Elementary excitations associated with particular field configurations are investigated. Gluonic excitations analogous to linearly polarized photons are shown to acquire infinite energy. Suppression of this class of excitations in QCD results from quantization of the chromelectric flux and is interpreted as a dual Meissner effect, i.e. as expulsion from the QCD vacuum of chromo-electric fields which are constant over significant distances. This interpretation is supported by a comparative evaluation of the interaction energy of static charges in the axial gauge representation of QED and QCD.
