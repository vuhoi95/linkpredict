Title: Finite particle creation in 1+1 dim. compact in space
Authors: D. J. Lamb and A. Z. Capri
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the massive particle creation as seen by a stationary observer in a $1+1$ dimensional spacetime compact in space. The Bogolubov transformation relating the annihilation and creation operators between two spacelike surfaces is calculated. The particle creation, as observed by a stationary observer who moves from the first spacelike surface to the second is then calculated, and shown to be finite, as is expected for a spacetime with finite spatial volume.
