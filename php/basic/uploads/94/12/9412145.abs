Title: Observables and Gauge Fixing in Spontaneously Broken Gauge Theories
Authors: Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Abstract: Gauge fixing and the observable fields for both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories with spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry are studied. We explicitly show that it is possible to globally fix the gauge in the broken sector and hence construct physical fields even in the non-abelian theory. We predict that any high temperature restoration of gauge symmetry will be accompanied by a confining transition.
