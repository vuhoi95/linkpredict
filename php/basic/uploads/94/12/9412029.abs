Authors: M. Khorrami and A. Shariati and M. Abolhassani and A. Aghamohammadi
Abstract: Contracting the $h$-deformation of $\SL(2,\Real)$, we construct a new deformation of two dimensional Poincar\'e algebra, the algebra of functions on its group and its differential structure. It is also shown that the Hopf algebra is triangular, and its universal R matrix is also constructed explicitly. Then, we find a deformation map for the universal enveloping algebra, and at the end, give the deformed mass shells and Lorentz transformation.
