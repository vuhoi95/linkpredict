Title: Manifest supersymmetry and the ADHM construction of instantons
Authors: A. Galperin and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We present the (0,4) superspace version of Witten's sigma model construction for ADHM instantons. We use the harmonic superspace formalism, which exploits the three complex structures common to both (0,4) supersymmetry and self-dual Yang-Mills theory. A novel feature of the superspace formulation is the manifest interplay between the ADHM construction and its twistor counterpart.
