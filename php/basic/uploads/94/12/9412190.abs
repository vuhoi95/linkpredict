Title: Separation of variables and the XXZ Gaudin magnet
Authors: E. G. Kalnins and V. B. Kuznetsov and Willard Miller, Jr
Abstract: In this work we generalise previous results connecting (rational) Gaudin magnet models and classical separation of variables. It is shown that the connection persists for the case of linear r-matrix algebra which corresponds to the trigonometric 4x4 r-matrix (of the XXZ type). We comment also on the corresponding problem for the elliptic (XYZ) r-matrix. A prescription for obtaining integrable systems associated with multiple poles of an L-operator is given.
