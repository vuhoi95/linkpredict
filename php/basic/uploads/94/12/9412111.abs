Title: On inserter regularization method
Authors: Han-Ying Guo and Yu Cai and Hong-Bo Teng
Abstract: There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergent graphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantum field theories. Whereupon we present a new method, the inserter regularization method, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this letter, we demonstrate this method with the $\phi^4$ theory and QED at the one loop order. Some applications to SUSY-models are also made at the one loop order, which shows that supersymmetry is preserved manifestly and consistently.
