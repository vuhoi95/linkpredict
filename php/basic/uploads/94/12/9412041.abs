Title: Finite particle creation in 3+1 de Sitter space
Authors: D. J. Lamb and A. Z. Capri and M. Kobayashi
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the particle creation as seen by a stationary observer in 3+1 de Sitter space. This particle creation is calculated using an observer dependent geometrically based definition of time which is used to quantize a field on two different spacelike surfaces. The Bogolubov transformation relating these two quantizations is then calculated and the resulting particle creation is shown to be finite.
