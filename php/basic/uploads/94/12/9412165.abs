Title: On the overlap formulation of chiral gauge theory
Authors: S. Randjbar-Daemi and J. Strathdee
Abstract: The overlap formula proposed by Narayanan and Neuberger in chiral gauge theories is examined. The free chiral and Dirac Green's functions are constructed in this formalism. Four dimensional anomalies are calculated and the usual anomaly cancellation for one standard family of quarks and leptons is verified.
