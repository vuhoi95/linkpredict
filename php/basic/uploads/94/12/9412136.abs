Title: Relativistically Covariant Symmetry in QED
Authors: Zhong Tang and David Finkelstein
Abstract: We construct a relativistically covariant symmetry of QED. Previous local and nonlocal symmetries are special cases. This generalized symmetry need not be nilpotent, but nilpotency can be arranged with an auxiliary field and a certain condition. The Noether charge generating the symmetry transformation is obtained, and it imposes a constraint on the physical states.
