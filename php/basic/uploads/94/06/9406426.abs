Title: On the Ward Identities at Finite Temperature
Authors: Ashok Das and Marcelo Hott
Abstract: We show both in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions that, contrary to the recent suggestions, the contribution of the fermion loop to the polarization tensor is manifestly transverse at finite temperature. Some subtleties associated with the Ward identities at finite temperature are also pointed out.
