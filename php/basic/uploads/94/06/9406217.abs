Title: Matter couplings in partially broken extended supersymmetry
Authors: J. Bagger and A. Galperin
Abstract: We use nonlinear realizations to describe the spontaneous breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetry to $N=1$ in four dimensions. We identify the Goldstone multiplet with an $N=1$ chiral superfield, and show that chiral $N=1$ matter is consistent with the partially broken $N=2$ supersymmetry. We find that the chiral matter can be in any representation of the gauge group; no mirror particles are required. We present the Goldstone action and the general couplings to $N=1$ matter to the first nontrivial order in the scale of symmetry breaking.
