Title: A New Duality Symmetry in String Theory
Authors: E. Kiritsis and N. Obers
Abstract: We consider the conformal gauging of non-abelian groups. In such cases there are inequivalent ways of gauging (generalizing the axial and vector cases for abelian groups) corresponding to external automorphisms of the group. Different $\s$-models obtained this way correspond to the same conformal field theory. We use the method of quotients to formulate this equivalence as a new duality symmetry.
