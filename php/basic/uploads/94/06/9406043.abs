Title: A Fresh Look at Generalized Veneziano Amplitudes
Authors: D. B. Fairlie and J. Nuyts
Abstract: The dual resonance model, which was a precursor of string theory was based upon the idea that two-particle scattering amplitudes should be expressible equivalently as a sum of contributions of an infinite number of $s$ channel poles each corresponding to a finite number of particles with definite spin, or as a similar sum of $t$ channel poles. The famous example of Veneziano \cite{ven} satisfies all these requirements, and is additionally ghost free.We recall other trajectories which provide solutions to the duality constraints, e.g. the general Mobi\"us trajectories and the logarithmic trajectories, which were thought to be lacking this last feature. We however demonstrate, partly empirically, the existence of a regime within a particular deformation of the Veneziano amplitude for logarithmic trajectories for which the amplitude remains ghost free.
