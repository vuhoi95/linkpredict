Title: Taub--NUT Dyons in Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: Starting with the Taub--NUT solution to Einstein's equations, together with a constant dilaton, a dyonic Taub--NUT solution of low energy heterotic string theory with non--trivial dilaton, axion and $U(1)$ gauge fields is constructed by employing $O(1,1)$ transformations. The electromagnetic dual of this solution is constructed, using $SL(2,\rline)$ transformations. By an appropriate change to scaled variables, the extremal limit of the dual solution is shown to correspond to the low energy limit of an exact conformal field theory presented previously.
