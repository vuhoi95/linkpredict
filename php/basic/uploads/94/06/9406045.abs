Title: On the Elliptic Genus and Mirror Symmetry
Authors: P. Berglund and M. Henningson
Abstract: The elliptic genus for arbitrary two dimensional $N=2$ Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds is computed. This is used to search for possible mirror pairs of such models. An important aspect of this work is that there is no restriction to theories for which the conformal anomaly is $\hat c\in\ZZ$, nor are the results only valid at the conformal fixed point.
