Title: Gaussian approximation of the (2+1) dimensional Thirring model in the  functional Schr√∂dinger picture
Authors: S. J. Hyun and G. H. Lee and J. H. Yee
Abstract: The (2+1)-dimensional Thirring model is studied by using the Gaussian approximation method in the functional Schr\"odinger picture. Although the dynamical symmetry breaking does not occur in the large N limit, it does occur in the Gaussian approximation which includes the higher order contributions in 1/N.
