Title: The Supersymmetric Two Boson Hierarchies
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and A. Das
Abstract: We construct the most general supersymmetric two boson system that is integrable. We obtain the Lax operator and the nonstandard Lax representation for this system. We show that, under appropriate redefinition of variables, this reduces to the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation without any arbitrary parameter which is known to be integrable. We show that this supersymmetric system has three local Hamiltonian structures just like the bosonic counterpart and we show how the supersymmetric KdV equation can be embedded into this system.
