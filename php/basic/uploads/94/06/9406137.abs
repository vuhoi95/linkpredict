Title: Lattice Poincare as a quantum deformed algebra
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Henri Ruegg and Philippe Zaugg
Abstract: We propose a definition of a Poincar\'e algebra for a two dimensional space--time with one discretized dimension. This algebra has the structure of a Hopf algebra. We use the link between Onsager's uniformization of the Ising model and the dispersion relation of a free particle in this space--time, together with the rapidity representation of the quantum deformation of the Poincar\'e enveloping algebra.
