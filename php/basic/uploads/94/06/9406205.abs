Title: Bicovariant differential calculus on quantum groups from Poisson Lie  structures
Authors: I. Ya. Aref'eva and G. E. Arutyunov and P. B. Medvedev
Abstract: The aim of this lecture is to give a pedagogical explanation of the notion of a Poisson Lie structure on the external algebra of a Poisson Lie group which was introduced in our previous papers. Using this notion as a guide we construct quantum external algebras on $SL_q(N)$ with proper (classical) dimension.
