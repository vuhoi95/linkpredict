Title: A note on the path integral for systems with primary and secondary  second class constraints
Authors: M. Henneaux and S. Slavnov
Abstract: It is shown that the phase space path integral for a system with arbitrary second class constraints (primary, secondary ...) can be rewritten as a configuration space path integral of the exponent of the Lagrangian action with some local measure.
