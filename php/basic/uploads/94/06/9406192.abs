Title: Collective Field Theory of the Fractional Quantum Hall Edge State and  the Calogero-Sutherland Model
Authors: S. Iso and S. J. Rey
Abstract: \noindent Using hydrodynamic collective field theory approach we show that one-particle density matrix of the $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edge state interpolates between chiral Luttinger liquid behavior $\langle \psi^{\dagger}(r) \psi(0) \rangle \sim r^{-m} $ and Calogero-Sutherland model behavior $\langle \psi^{\dagger}(r) \psi(0) \rangle \sim r^{-(m+1/m)/2} $ as the droplet width is varied continuously. Low-energy excitations are described by $c=1$ conformal field theory of a compact boson of radius $\sqrt m$. The result suggests complementary relation between the two-dimensional quantum Hall droplet and the one-dimensional Calogero-Sutherland model.
