Title: Invariants of 3-Manifolds Derived From Finite Dimensional Hopf Algebras
Authors: Louis H. Kauffman and David E. Radford
Abstract: This paper studies invariants of 3-manifolds derived from certain fin ite dimensional Hopf algebras. The invariants are based on right integrals for these algebras. It is shown that the resulting class of invariants is distinct from the class of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.
