Title: Supersymmetry and Fredholm modules over quantized spaces
Authors: D. Borthwick and S. Klimek and A. Lesniewski and M. Rinaldi
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to apply the framework of non- commutative differential geometry to quantum deformations of a class of Kahler manifolds. For the examples of the Cartan domains of type I and flat space, we construct Fredholm modules over the quantized manifolds using the supercharges which arise in the quantization of supersymmetric generalizations of the manifolds. We compute the explicit formula for the Chern character on generators of the Toeplitz C^* -algebra.
