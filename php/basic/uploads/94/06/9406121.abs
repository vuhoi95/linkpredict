Title: Equivariant Localization, Spin Systems and Topological Quantum Theory on  Riemann Surfaces
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Richard J. Szabo
Abstract: We study equivariant localization formulas for phase space path integrals when the phase space is a multiply connected compact Riemann surface. We consider the Hamiltonian systems to which the localization formulas are applicable and show that the localized partition function for such systems is a topological invariant which represents the non-trivial homology classes of the phase space. We explicitly construct the coherent states in the canonical quantum theory and show that the Hilbert space is finite dimensional with the wavefunctions carrying a projective representation of the discrete homology group of the phase space. The corresponding coherent state path integral then describes the quantum dynamics of a novel spin system given by the quantization of a non-symmetric coadjoint Lie group orbit. We also briefly discuss the geometric structure of these quantum systems.
