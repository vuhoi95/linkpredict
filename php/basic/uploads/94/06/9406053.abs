Title: Off equilibrium dynamics and aging in unfrustrated systems
Authors: L. F. Cugliandolo and J. Kurchan and G. Parisi
Abstract: We analyse the Langevin dynamics of the random walk, the scalar field, the X-Y model and the spinoidal decomposition. We study the deviations from the equilibrium dynamics theorems (FDT and homogeneity), the asymptotic behaviour of the systems and the aging phenomena. We compare the results with the dynamical behaviour of (random) spin-glass mean-field models.
