Title: Quantum integrability of nonultralocal models through Baxterisation of  quantised braided algebra
Authors: Ladislav Hlavaty and Anjan Kundu
Abstract: A scheme suitable for describing quantum nonultralocal models including supersymmetric ones is proposed. Braided algebras are generalised to be used through Baxterisation for constructing braided quantum Yang--Baxter equations. Supersymmetric and some known nonultralocal models are derived in the framework of the present approach. As further applications of this scheme construction of new quantum integrable nonultralocal models like mKdV and anyonic supersymmetric models including deformed anyonic super algebra are outlined.
