Title: Goldstone Theorem in the Gaussian Functional Approximation to the Scalar  $φ^{4}$ Theory
Authors: V. Dmitrašinović and J. R. Shepard and J. A. McNeil
Abstract: We verify the Goldstone theorem in the Gaussian functional approximation to the $\phi^{4}$ theory with internal O(2) symmetry. We do so by reformulating the Gaussian approximation in terms of Schwinger-Dyson equations from which an explicit demonstration of the Goldstone theorem follows directly.
