Title: The equality of 3-manifold invariants
Authors: John W. Barrett and Bruce W. Westbury
Abstract: The invariants of 3-manifolds defined by Kuperberg for involutory Hopf algebras and those defined by the authors for spherical Hopf algebras are the same for Hopf algebras on which they are both defined.
