Title: Highest Weight $U_q[sl(n)]$ Modules and Invariant Integrable n-State  Models with Periodic Boundary Conditions"
Authors: A. Zapletal and M. Karowski
Abstract: The weights are computed for the Bethe vectors of an RSOS type model with periodic boundary conditions obeying $U_q[sl(n)]$ ($q=\exp(i\pi/r)$) invariance. They are shown to be highest weight vectors. The q-dimensions of the corresponding irreducible representations are obtained.
