Title: Quantum Dynamics in Regions of Quaternionic Curvature
Authors: S. P. Brumby and G. C. Joshi
Abstract: The complex unit appearing in the equations of quantum mechanics is generalised to a quaternionic structure on spacetime, leading to the consideration of complex quantum mechanical particles whose dynamical behaviour is governed by inhomogeneous Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. Mixing of hyper-complex components of wavefunctions occurs through their interaction with potentials dissipative into the extra quaternionic degrees of freedom. An interferometric experiment is analysed to illustrate the effect.
