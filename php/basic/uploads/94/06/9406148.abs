Title: A radiating dyon solution
Authors: A. Chamorro and K. S. Virbhadra
Abstract: We give a non-static exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations (with null fluid), which is a non-static magnetic charge generalization to the Bonnor-Vaidya solution and describes the gravitational and electromagnetic fields of a nonrotating massive radiating dyon. In addition, using the energy-momentum pseudotensors of Einstein and Landau and Lifshitz we obtain the energy, momentum, and power output of the radiating dyon and find that both prescriptions give the same result.
