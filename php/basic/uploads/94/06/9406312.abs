Title: A Variational Approach to the Spinless Relativistic Coulomb Problem
Authors: Wolfgang Lucha and Franz F. SCHÃ–berl
Abstract: By application of a straightforward variational procedure we derive a simple, analytic upper bound on the ground-state energy eigenvalue of a semirelativistic Hamiltonian for (one or two) spinless particles which experience some Coulomb-type interaction.
