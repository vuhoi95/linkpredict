Title: Summing Over World-Sheet Boundaries
Authors: Michael B. Green and Joe Polchinski
Abstract: The moduli associated with boundaries in a Riemann surface are parametrized by the positions and strengths of electric charges. This suggests a method for summing over orientable Riemann surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the embedding coordinates. A light-cone parameterization of such boundaries is also discussed.
