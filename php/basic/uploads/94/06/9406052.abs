Title: Superspace formulation of the Chern character of a theta-summable  Fredholm module
Authors: A. Lesniewski and K. Osterwalder
Abstract: We apply the concepts of superanalysis to present an intrinsically supersymmetric formulation of the Chern character in entire cyclic cohomology. We show that the cocycle condition is closely related to the invariance under supertranslations. Using the formalism of superfields, we find a path integral representation of the index of the generalized Dirac operator.
