Title: Instanton Effects in Matrix Models and String Effective Lagrangians
Authors: R. Brustein and M. Faux and B. Ovrut
Abstract: We perform an explicit calculation of the lowest order effects of single eigenvalue instantons on the continuous sector of the collective field theory derived from a $d=1$ bosonic matrix model. These effects consist of certain induced operators whose exact form we exhibit.
