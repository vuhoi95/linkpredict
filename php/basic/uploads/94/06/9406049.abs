Abstract: The phenomenon of mass inflation is shown to occur for a rotating black hole. We demonstrate this feature in $(2+1)$ dimensions by extending the charged spinning BTZ black hole to Vaidya form. We find that the mass function diverges in a manner quantitatively similar to its static counterparts in $(3+1)$, $(2+1)$ and $(1+1)$ dimensions.
