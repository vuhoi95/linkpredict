Title: Replica Field Theory for Deterministic Models (II): A Non-Random Spin  Glass with Glassy Behavior
Authors: Enzo Marinari and Giorgio Parisi and Felix Ritort
Abstract: We introduce and study a model which admits a complex landscape without containing quenched disorder. Continuing our previous investigation we introduce a disordered model which allows us to reconstruct all the main features of the original phase diagram, including a low $T$ spin glass phase and a complex dynamical behavior.
