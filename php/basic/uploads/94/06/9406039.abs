Title: Axial Anomaly in the Presence of the Aharonov-Bohm Gauge Field
Authors: P. Giacconi and S. Ouvry and R. Soldati
Abstract: We investigate on the plane the axial anomaly for euclidean Dirac fermions in the presence of a background Aharonov--Bohm gauge potential. The non perturbative analysis depends on the self--adjoint extensions of the Dirac operator and the result is shown to be influenced by the actual way of understanding the local axial current. The role of the quantum mechanical parameters involved in the expression for the axial anomaly is discussed. A derivation of the effective action by means of the stereographic projection is also considered.
