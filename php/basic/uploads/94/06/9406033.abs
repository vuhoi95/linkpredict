Title: Parity Violation in the Three Dimensional Thirring Model
Authors: G. L. Rossini and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We discuss parity violation in the 3-dimensional (N flavour) Thirring model. We find that the ground state fermion current in a background gauge field does not posses a well defined parity transformation. We also investigate the connection between parity violation and fermion mass generation, proving that radiative corrections force the fermions to be massive.
