Title: Deformed Algebras from Inverse Schwinger Method
Authors: K. H. Cho and S. U. Park
Abstract: We consider a problem which may be viewed as an inverse one to the Schwinger realization of Lie algebra, and suggest a procedure of deforming the so-obtained algebra. We illustrate the method through a few simple examples extending Schwinger's $su(1,1)$ construction. As results, various q-deformed algebras are (re-)produced as well as their undeformed counterparts. Some extensions of the method are pointed out briefly.
