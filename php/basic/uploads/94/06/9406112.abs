Title: Large Parabosons versus supersymmetry in Jahn-Teller Systems
Authors: Edward D. Savage and G E Stedman
Abstract: The applications of parabosons by Schmutz (1980) and of supersymmetry by Jarvis {\em et al.} (1984) in Jahn-Teller systems are compared and contrasted. Although a parasupersymmetric Jahn-Teller system has not yet been identified, the method of Schmutz is used here to show that the $E \times \epsilon $ supersymmetric Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian can be written in terms of paraboson operators.
