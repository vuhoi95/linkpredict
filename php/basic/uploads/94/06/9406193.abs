Title: A Theory for the Conformal Factor in Quantum $R^2$ Gravity
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: A new theory for the conformal factor in R$^2$-gravity is developed. The infrared phase of this theory, which follows from the one-loop renormalization group equations for the whole quantum R$^2$-gravity theory is described. The one-loop effective potential for the conformal factor is found explicitly and a mechanism for inducing Einstein gravity at the minimum of the effective potential for the conformal factor is suggested. A comparison with the effective theory of the conformal factor induced by the conformal anomaly, and also aiming to describe quantum gravity at large distances, is done.
