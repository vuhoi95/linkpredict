Title: N = 2 Super $W_{\infty}$ Algebra and its Nonlinear Realization Through  Super KP Formulation
Authors: Sasanka Ghosh and Samir K. Paul
Abstract: A nonlinear realization of super $W_{\infty}$ algebra is shown to exist through a consistent superLax formulation of super KP hierarchy. The reduction of the superLax operator gives rise to the Lax operators for $N=2$ generalized super KdV hierarchies, proposed by Inami and Kanno. The Lax equations are shown to be Hamiltonian and the associated Poisson bracket algebra among the superfields, consequently, gives rise to a realization of nonlinear super $W_{\infty}$ algebra.
