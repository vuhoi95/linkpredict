Title: The Nonlinear Multiplet Revisited
Authors: Byungbae Kim and Ulf Lindström and Martin Roček
Abstract: Using a reformulation of the nonlinear multiplet as a gauge multiplet, we discuss its dynamics. We show that the nonlinear ``duality'' that appears to relate the model to a conventional $\sigma$-model introduces a new sector into the theory.
