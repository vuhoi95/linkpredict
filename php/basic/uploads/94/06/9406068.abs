Title: Equivariant Morse theory and quantum integrability
Authors: A. J. Niemi and K. Palo
Abstract: We investigate an equivariant generalization of Morse theory for a general class of integrable models. In particular, we derive equivariant versions of the classical Poincar\'e-Hopf and Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorems and present the corresponding path integral generalizations. Our approach is based on equivariant cohomology and localization techniques, and is closely related to the formalism developed by Matthai and Quillen in their approach to Gaussian shaped Thom forms.
