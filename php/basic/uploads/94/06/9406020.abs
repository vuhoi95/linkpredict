Title: Spinon Bases, Yangian Symmetry and Fermionic Representations of Virasoro  Characters in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: P. Bouwknegt and A. W. W. Ludwig and K. Schoutens
Abstract: We study the description of the $SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory in terms of the modes of the spin-1/2 affine primary field $\phi^\alpha$. These are shown to satisfy generalized `canonical commutation relations', which we use to construct a basis of Hilbert space in terms of representations of the Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. Using this description, we explicitly derive so-called `fermionic representations' of the Virasoro characters, which were first conjectured by Kedem et al.~\cite{kedem}. We point out that similar results are expected for a wide class of rational conformal field theories.
