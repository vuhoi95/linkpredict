Title: Discrete Quantum Field Theories and the Intersection Form
Authors: Danny Birmingham and Mark Rakowski
Abstract: It is shown that the standard mod-$p$ valued intersection form can be used to define Boltzmann weights of subdivision invariant lattice models with gauge group $Z_{p}$. In particular, we discuss a four dimensional model which is based upon the assignment of field variables to the $2$-simplices of the simplicial complex. The action is taken to be the intersection form defined on the second cohomology group of the complex, with coefficients in $Z_{p}$. Subdivision invariance of the theory follows when the coupling constant is quantized and the field configurations are restricted to those satisfying a mod-$p$ flatness condition. We present an explicit computation of the partition function for the manifold $\pm CP^{2}$, demonstrating non-triviality.
