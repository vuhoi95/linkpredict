Title: Entropy for dilatonic black hole
Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: The area formula for entropy is extended to the case of a dilatonic black hole. The entropy of a scalar field in the background of such a black hole is calculated semiclassically. The area and cutoff dependences are normal {\it except in the extremal case}, where the area is zero but the entropy nonzero.
