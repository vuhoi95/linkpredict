Title: Observations on the Topological Structure in 2d Gravity Coupled to  Minimal Matter
Authors: P. M. Llatas and S. Roy
Abstract: By using a bosonization we uncover the topological gravity structure of Labastida, Pernici and Witten in ordinary $2d$ gravity coupled to $(p,q)$ minimal models. We study the cohomology class associated with the fermionic charge of the topological gravity which is shown to be isomorphic to that of the total $BRST$ charge. One of the ground ring generators of $c_M <1$ string theory is found to be in the equivariant cohomology of this fermionic charge.
