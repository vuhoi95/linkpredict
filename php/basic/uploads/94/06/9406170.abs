Title: From geometric quantization to Moyal quantization
Authors: Jose M. Gracia-Bondia and Joseph C. Varilly
Abstract: We show how the Moyal product of phase-space functions, and the Weyl correspondence between symbols and operator kernels, may be obtained directly using the procedures of geometric quantization, applied to the symplectic groupoid constructed by ``doubling'' the phase space.
