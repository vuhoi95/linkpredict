Title: Casimir effect for a $D$-dimensional sphere
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Kimball A. Milton
Abstract: The Casimir force on a $D$-dimensional sphere due to the confinement of a massless scalar field is computed as a function of $D$, where $D$ is a continuous variable that ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. The dependence of the force on the dimension is obtained using a simple and straightforward Green's function technique. We find that the Casimir force vanishes as $D\to +\infty$ ($D$ non-even integer) and also vanishes when $D$ is a negative even integer. The force has simple poles at positive even integer values of $D$.
