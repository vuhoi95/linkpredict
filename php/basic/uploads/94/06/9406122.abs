Authors: V. G. Bagrov and I. L. Buchbinder and I. L. Shapiro
Abstract: We construct the theoretical base for the search of the possible experimental manifestations of the torsion field at low energies. The weakrelativistic approximation to the Dirac equation in an external torsion field is considered. For the sake of generality we introduce the external electromagnetic field in parallel. The generalized (due to torsion dependent terms) Pauly equation contains new terms which have the different structure if compared with standard electromagnetic ones. Just the same takes place for the weakrelativistic equations for spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particle in an external torsion and electromagnetic field. It is given the brief description of the possible experiments.
