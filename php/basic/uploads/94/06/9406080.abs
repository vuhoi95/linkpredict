Title: Canonical Coherent States for the Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator
Authors: V. Aldaya and J. Guerrero
Abstract: In this paper we construct manifestly covariant relativistic coherent states on the entire complex plane which reproduce others previously introduced on a given $SL(2,R)$ representation, once a change of variables $z\in C\rightarrow z_D \in $ unit disk is performed. We also introduce higher-order, relativistic creation and annihilation operators, $\C,\Cc$, with canonical commutation relation $[\C,\Cc]=1$ rather than the covariant one $[\Z,\Zc]\approx$ Energy and naturally associated with the $SL(2,R)$ group. The canonical (relativistic) coherent states are then defined as eigenstates of $\C$. Finally, we construct a canonical, minimal representation in configuration space by mean of eigenstates of a canonical position operator.
