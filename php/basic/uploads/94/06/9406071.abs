Title: Chiral fermion action with (8,0) worldsheet supersymmetry
Authors: E. Ivanov and E. Sokatchev
Abstract: We propose an action describing chiral fermions with an arbitrary gauge group and with manifest $(8,0)$ worldsheet supersymmetry. The form of the action is inspired by and adapted for completing the twistor-like formulation of the $D=10$ heterotic superstring.
