Title: Gauge parameter dependence in gauge theories (revised: subsection 2.3)
Authors: E. Kraus and K. Sibold
Abstract: Dependence on the gauge parameters is an important issue in gauge theories: physical quantities have to be independent. Extending BRS transformations by variation of the gauge parameter into a Grassmann variable one can control gauge parameter dependence algebraically. As application we discuss the anomaly coefficient in the Slavnov-Taylor identity, $S$-matrix elements, the vector two-point-function and the coefficients of renormalization group and Callan-Symanzik equation.
