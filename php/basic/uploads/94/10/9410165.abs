Title: KDV and NLS Equations as Tri-Hamiltonian Systems
Authors: J. C. Brunelli and Ashok Das
Abstract: We show that the KdV and the NLS equations are tri-Hamiltonian systems. We obtain the third Hamiltonian structure for these systems and prove Jacobi identity through the method of prolongation. The compatibility of the Hamiltonian structures is verified directly through prolongation as well as through the shifting of the variables. We comment on the properties of the recursion operator as well as the connection with the two boson hierarchy.
