Title: Continuum Annulus Amplitude from the Two-Matrix Model
Authors: M. Anazawa and A. Ishikawa and H. Itoyama
Abstract: An explicit expression for continuum annulus amplitudes having boundary lengths $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ is obtained from the two-matrix model for the case of the unitary series; $(p,q) = (m + 1, m)$. In the limit of vanishing cosmological constant, we find an integral representation of these amplitudes which is reproduced, for the cases of the $m = 2~(c=0)$ and the $m \rightarrow \infty~(c=1)$, by a continuum approach consisting of quantum mechanics of loops and a matter system integrated over the modular parameter of the annulus. We comment on a possible relation to the unconventional branch of the Liouville gravity.
