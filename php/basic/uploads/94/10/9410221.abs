Title: All Around the Spinless Salpeter Equation
Authors: Wolfgang Lucha and Franz F. SCHÃ–berl
Abstract: We review some important topics related to the semirelativistic description of bound states by the spinless Salpeter equation: the special case of the Coulomb interaction, numerical approximation methods, and a way to avoid the problematic square-root operator of the relativistic kinetic energy.
