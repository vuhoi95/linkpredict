Title: Diffeomorphism Cohomology in Beltrami Parametrization II : The 1-Forms
Authors: G. Bandelloni and S. Lazzarini
Abstract: We study the 1-form diffeomorphism cohomologies within a local conformal Lagrangian Field Theory model built on a two dimensional Riemann surface with no boundary. We consider the case of scalar matter fields and the complex structure is parametrized by Beltrami differential. The analysis is first performed at the Classical level, and then we improve the quantum extension, introducing the current in the Lagrangian dynamics, coupled to external source fields. We show that the anomalies which spoil the current conservations take origin from the holomorphy region of the external fields, and only the differential spin 1 and 2 currents (as well their c.c) could be anomalous.
