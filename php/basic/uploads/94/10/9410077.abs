Title: Conformal Characters and Theta Series
Authors: Wolfgang Eholzer and Nils-Peter Skoruppa
Abstract: We describe the construction of vector valued modular forms transforming under a given congruence representation of the modular group SL(2,Z) in terms of theta series. We apply this general setup to obtain closed and easily computable formulas for conformal characters of rational models of W-algebras.
