Title: Wilson loops, $q \bar{q}$ and $3 q$ potentials, Bethe--Salpeter equation
Authors: N. Brambilla and G. M. Prosperi
Abstract: The derivation of the $ q \bar q $ and the $ 3q $ potential for two dynamical quarks in a Wilson--loop context is reviewed. Some improvements are introduced. Only the usual assumptions in the evaluation of the Wilson loop integrals and expansions in the quark velocities are required for the result. It is shown that under the same assumptions it is possible to obtain the relativistic flux--tube lagrangian and a $ q \bar{q}$ Bethe--Salpeter equation with a confining kernel for spinless quarks.
