Title: Horizon Condition Holds Pointwise on Finite Lattice with Free Boundary  Conditions
Authors: M. Schaden and D. Zwanziger
Abstract: It is proven that the "horizon condition", which was found to characterize the fundamental modular region in continuum theory and the thermodynamic limit of gauge theory on a periodic lattice, holds for every (transverse) configuration on a finite lattice with free boundary conditions.
