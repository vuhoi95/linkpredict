Title: c=1 discrete states correlators via W$_{1+\infty}$ constraints
Authors: Amihay Hanany and Yaron Oz
Abstract: The discrete states of $c=1$ string theory at the self-dual radius are associated with modes of $W_{1+\infty}$ currents and their genus zero correlators are computed. An analogy to a recent suggestion based on the integrable structure of the theory is found. An iterative method for deriving the dependence of the currents on the full space of couplings is presented and applied. The dilaton equation of the theory is derived.
