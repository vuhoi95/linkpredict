Title: Extended Axial Model
Authors: R. Amorim and J. Barcelos-Neto
Abstract: We study an extension of the axial model where local gauge symmetries are taken into account. The anomaly of the axial current is calculated by the Fujikawa formalism and the model is also solved. Besides the well known features of the particular models (axial and Schwinger) it was obtained an effective interaction of scalar and gauge fields via a topological current.
