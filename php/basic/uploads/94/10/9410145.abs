Title: Polynomial deformations of $osp(1/2)$ and generalized parabosons
Authors: J. Van der Jeugt and R. Jagannathan
Abstract: We consider the algebra $R$ generated by three elements $A,B,H$ subject to three relations $[H,A]=A$, $[H,B]=-B$ and $\{A,B\}=f(H)$. When $f(H)=H$ this coincides with the Lie superalgebra $osp(1/2)$; when $f$ is a polynomial we speak of polynomial deformations of $osp(1/2)$. Irreducible representations of $R$ are described, and in the case $\deg(f)\leq 2$ we obtain a complete classification, showing some similarities but also some interesting differences with the usual $osp(1/2)$ representations. The relation with deformed oscillator algebras is discussed, leading to the interpretation of $R$ as a generalized paraboson algebra.
