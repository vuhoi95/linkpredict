Title: On Bogoliubov Transformation of Scalar Wave Functions in De Sitter Space
Authors: Haru-Tada Sato and Hisao Suzuki
Abstract: We discuss the Bogoliubov transformation of the scalar wave functions caused by the change of coordinates in 4 dimensional de Sitter space. It is shown that the exact Bogoliubov coefficients can be obtained from the global coordinates to the static coordinates where there exist manifest horizon. We consider two type of global coordinates. In one global coordinates, it is shown that the Bogoliubov transformation to the static coordinates can be expressed by the discontinuous integral of Weber and Schafheitlin. The positive and negative energy states in the global coordinates degenerate in the static coordinates. In the other global coordinates, we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients by using the analytic continuation of the hypergeometric functions in two variables.
