Title: $h$-Deformation as a Contraction of $q$-Deformation
Authors: A. Aghamohammadi and M. Khorrami and A. Shariati
Abstract: We show that $h$-deformation can be obtained, by a singular limit of a similarity transformation, from $q$-deformation; to be specefic, we obtain $\GL_h(2)$, its differential structure, its inhomogenous extension, and $\Uh{\sl(2)}$ from their $q$-deformed counterparts.
