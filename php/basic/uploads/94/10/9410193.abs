Title: Integrable Spin Chains Associated to $\widehat{sl_q(n)}$ and  $\widehat{sl_{p,q}(n)}$
Authors: J. Abad and M. Rios
Abstract: The Hoft structure of the central extension of the $U_q \left( \widehat{sl\left( n \right) }\right)$ algebra is considered. The intertwine matrix induces new integrable spin chain models. We show the relation of these models and the biparametric spin chain $\widehat{sl_{p,q} \left( n \right)}$ models. The cases $n=2$ are $n=3$ are discussed and for $n=2$ we obtain the model of Dasgupta and Chowdhury . The case $n=3$ is solved with nested Bethe ansatz method and it is showed the dependence of the Bethe equations in the second parameter introduced
