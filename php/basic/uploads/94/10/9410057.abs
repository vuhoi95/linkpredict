Title: Bogomol'nyi equations for solitons in Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge  theories with the magnetic moment interaction term
Authors: Taejin Lee and Hyunsoo Min
Abstract: Without assuming rotational invariance, we derive Bogomol'nyi equations for the solitons in the abelian Chern-Simons gauge theories with the anomalous magnetic moment interaction. We also evaluate the number of zero modes around a static soliton configuration.
