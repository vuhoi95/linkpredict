Title: Causality in Local Quantum Field Theory
Authors: L. Maiani and M. Testa
Abstract: The problem of causality is analyzed in the context of Local Quantum Field Theory. Contrary to recent claims, it is shown that apparent noncausal behaviour is due to a lack of the notion of sharp localizability for a relativistic quantum system. (Replaced corrupted file)
