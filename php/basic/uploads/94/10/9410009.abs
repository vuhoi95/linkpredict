Title: Tricritical Behavior of Two-Dimensional Scalar Field Theories
Authors: M. Asorey and J. G. Esteve and F. Falceto and J. Salas
Abstract: We compute by Monte Carlo numerical simulations the critical exponents of two-dimensional scalar field theories at the $\lambda\phi^6$ tricritical point. The results are in agreement with the Zamolodchikov conjecture based on conformal invariance.
