Title: The Fully Frustrated Hypercubic Model is Glassy and Aging at Large $D$
Authors: Enzo Marinari and Giorgio Parisi and Felix Ritort
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of the fully frustrated hypercubic cell in the infinite dimensional mean-field limit. In the Ising case the system undergoes a glass transition, well described by the random orthogonal model. Under the glass temperature aging effects show clearly. In the $XY$ case there is no sign of a phase transition, and the system is always a paramagnet.
