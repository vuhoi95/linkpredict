Title: Finite W Algebras and Intermediate Statistics
Authors: F. Barbarin and E. Ragoucy and P. Sorba
Abstract: New realizations of finite W algebras are constructed by relaxing the usual constraint conditions. Then, finite W algebras are recognized in the Heisenberg quantization recently proposed by Leinaas and Myrheim, for a system of two identical particles in d dimensions. As the anyonic parameter is directly associated to the W-algebra involved in the d=1 case, it is natural to consider that the W-algebra framework is well-adapted for a possible generalization of the anyon statistics.
