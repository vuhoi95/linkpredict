Title: Duality Versus Supersymmetry and Compactification
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and R. Kallosh and T. Ort√≠n
Abstract: We study the interplay between T-duality, compactification and supersymmetry. We prove that when the original configuration has unbroken space-time supersymmetries, the dual configuration also does if a special condition is met: the Killing spinors of the original configuration have to be independent on the coordinate which corresponds to the isometry direction of the bosonic fields used for duality. Examples of ``losers" (T-duals are not supersymmetric) and ``winners" (T-duals are supersymmetric) are given.
