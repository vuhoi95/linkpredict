Title: Partons and Black Holes
Authors: L. Susskind and P. Griffin
Abstract: A light-front renormalization group analysis is applied to study matter which falls into massive black holes, and the related problem of matter with transplankian energies. One finds that the rate of matter spreading over the black hole's horizon unexpectedly saturates the causality bound. This is related to the transverse growth behavior of transplankian particles as their longitudinal momentum increases. This growth behavior suggests a natural mechanism to impliment 'tHooft's scenario that the universe is an image of data stored on a 2 + 1 dimensional hologram-like projection.
