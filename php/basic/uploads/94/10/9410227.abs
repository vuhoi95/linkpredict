Title: Distance Formula for Grassmann Manifold --Applied to Anandan--Aharonov  Type Uncertainty Relation--
Authors: Minoru Hirayama and Takeshi Hamada and Jin Chen
Abstract: The time-energy uncertainty relation of Anandan-Aharonov is generalized to a relation involving a set of quantum state vectors. This is achieved by obtaining an explicit formula for the distance between two finitely separated points in the Grassmann manifold.
