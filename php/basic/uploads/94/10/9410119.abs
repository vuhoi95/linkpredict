Title: Comment on "Obstructions to the Existence of Static Cosmic Strings in an  Abelian Higgs Model"
Authors: Chanju Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: There has been considerable interest in the possible cosmic string configurations and Y. Yang has recently derived intriguing obstructions to the existence of cylindrically symmetric solutions in the Bogomol'nyi critical phase of the Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs system. In this comment, we would like to mention some earlier results and recent progress which were not reflected there but are important in connection with the obstructions he claimed. Some of his obstructions are not consistent with the ealier results. Also, we give a new condition stronger than those found before.
