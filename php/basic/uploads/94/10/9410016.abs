Title: Non-Abelian Black Holes and Catastrophe Theory II: Charged Type
Authors: T. Tachizawa and K. Maeda and T. Torii
Abstract: We reanalyze the gravitating monopole and its black hole solutions in the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system and we discuss their stabilities from the point of view of catastrophe theory. Although these non-trivial solutions exhibit fine and complicated structures, we find that stability is systematically understood via a swallow tail catastrophe. The Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m trivial solution becomes unstable from the point where the non-trivial monopole black hole appears. We also find that, within a very small parameter range, the specific heat of a monopole black hole changes its sign .
