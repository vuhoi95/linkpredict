Title: Strings Near a Rindler Or Black Hole Horizon
Authors: David A. Lowe and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Orbifold techniques are used to study bosonic, type II and heterotic strings in Rindler space at integer multiples N of the Rindler temperature, and near a black hole horizon at integer multiples of the Hawking temperature, extending earlier results of Dabholkar. It is argued that a Hagedorn transition occurs nears the horizon for all N>1.
