Title: Linear connections on the quantum plane
Authors: Michel Dubois-Violette and John Madore and Thierry Masson and Jihad Mourad
Abstract: A general definition has been proposed recently of a linear connection and a metric in noncommutative geometry. It is shown that to within normalization there is a unique linear connection on the quantum plane and there is no metric.
