Title: Chiral Perturbation Theory in the Framework of Non-Commutative Geometry
Authors: F. Ardalan and K. Kaviani
Abstract: We consider the non-commutative generalization of the chiral perturbation theory. The resultant coupling constants are severely restricted by the model and in good agreement with the data. When applied to the Skyrme model, our scheme reproduces the non-Skyrme term with the right coefficient. We comment on a similar treatment of the linear $\sigma $-model.
