Title: A note on graded Yang-Baxter solutions as braid-monoid invariants
Authors: M. J. Martins and P. B. Ramos
Abstract: We construct two $Osp(n|2m)$ solutions of the graded Yang-Baxter equation by using the algebraic braid-monoid approach. The factorizable S-matrix interpretation of these solutions is also discussed.
