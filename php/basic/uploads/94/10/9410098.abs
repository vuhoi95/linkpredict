Title: The Partition Function for an Anyon-Like Oscillator
Authors: H. Boschi-Filho and C. Farina and A. de Souza Dutra
Abstract: We compute the partition function of an anyon-like harmonic oscillator. The well known results for both the bosonic and fermionic oscillators are then reobtained as particular cases as ours. The technique we employ is a non-relativistic version of the Green function method used in the computation of one-loop effective actions of quantum field theory.
