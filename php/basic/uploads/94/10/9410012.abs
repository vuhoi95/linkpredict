Title: The Collective Field Theory of a Singular Supersymmetric Matrix Model
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch and Jo√£o P. Rodrigues
Abstract: The supersymmetric collective field theory with the potential $v'(x)=\omega x-{\eta\over x}$ is studied, motivated by the matrix model proposed by Jevicki and Yoneya to describe two dimensional string theory in a black hole background. Consistency with supersymmetry enforces a two band solution. A supersymmetric classical configuration is found, and interpreted in terms of the density of zeros of certain Laguerre polynomials. The spectrum of the model is then studied and is seen to correspond to a massless scalar and a majorana fermion. The $x$ space eigenfunctions are constructed and expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. Higher order interactions are also discussed.
