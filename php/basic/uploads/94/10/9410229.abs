Title: Electrically and Magnetically Charged States and Particles in the  2+1-Dimensional Z_N-Higgs Gauge Model
Authors: Joao C A Barata and Florian Nill
Abstract: Electrically as well as magnetically charged states are constructed in the 2+1-dimensional Euclidean Z_N-Higgs lattice gauge model, the former following ideas of Fredenhagen and Marcu and the latter using duality transformations on the algebra of observables. The existence of electrically and of magnetically charged particles is also established. With this work we prepare the ground for the constructive study of anyonic statistics of multiparticle scattering states of electrically and magnetically charged particles in this model (work in progress).
