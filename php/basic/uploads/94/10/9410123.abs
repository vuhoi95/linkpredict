Title: A New Action Principle for Witten's Topological Field Theory
Authors: R. Gianvittorio and A. Restuccia and J. Stephany
Abstract: In this letter a new gauge invariant, metric independent action is introduced from which Witten's Topological Quantum Field Theory may be obtained after gauge fixing using standard BRST techniques. In our model the BRST algebra of transformations, under which the effective action is invariant, close off-shell in distintion with what occurs in the one proposed by Labastida and Pernici. Our approach provides the geometrical principle for the quantum theory. We also compare our results with an alternative formulation presented by Baulieu and Singer.
