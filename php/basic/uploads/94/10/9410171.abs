Title: On Solutions of Tetrahedron Equations based on Korepanov Mechanism
Authors: M. Horibe and K. Shigemoto
Abstract: We have examined solutions of tetrahedron equations from the elliptic free fermion model by using Korepanov mechanism based on tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebras. As a byproduct, we have found a new integrable 2-dim. lattice model. We have also studied the relation between tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebras and tetrahedron equations.
