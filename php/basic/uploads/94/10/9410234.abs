Title: Dynamic Monte Carlo Measurement of Critical Exponents
Authors: Z. B. Li and L. Schuelke and B. Zheng
Abstract: Based on the scaling relation for the dynamics at the early time, a new method is proposed to measure both the static and dynamic critical exponents. The method is applied to the two dimensional Ising model. The results are in good agreement with the existing results. Since the measurement is carried out in the initial stage of the relaxation process starting from independent initial configurations, our method is efficient.
