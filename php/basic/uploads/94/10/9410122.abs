Title: Successive Superalgebraic Truncations from the Four-Dimensional Maximal  Supergravity
Authors: Chang-Ho Kim and Young-Jai Park and Kee Yong Kim and Yongduk Kim
Abstract: We study the four-dimensional {\it N}=8 maximal supergravity in the context of Lie superalgebra SU(8/1). All possible successive superalgebraic truncations from four-dimensional {\it N}=8 theory to {\it N}=7, 6, $\cdots$, 1 supergravity theories are systematically realized as sub-superalgebra chains of SU(8/1) by using the Kac-Dynkin weight techniques.
