Title: Symmetries, superselection rules, and decoherence
Authors: D. Giulini and C. Kiefer and H. D. Zeh
Abstract: We discuss the applicability of the programme of decoherence -- emergence of approximate classical behaviour through interaction with the environment -- to cases where it was suggested that the presence of symmetries would lead to exact superselection rules. For this discussion it is useful to make a distinction between pure symmetries and redundancies, which results from an investigation into the constraint equations of the corresponding theories. We discuss, in particular, superpositions of states with different charges, as well as with different masses, and suggest how the corresponding interference terms, although they exist in principle, become inaccessible through decoherence.
