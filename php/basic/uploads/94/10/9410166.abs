Title: Collective Hamiltonians with Kac-Moody Algebraic Conditions
Authors: Jean Avan and Antal Jevicki
Abstract: We describe the general framework for constructing collective--theory Hamiltonians whose hermicity requirements imply a Kac--Moody algebra of constraints on the associated Jacobian. We give explicit examples for the algebras $sl(2)_k$ and $sl(3)_k$. The reduction to $W_n$--constraints, relevant to $n$-matrix models, is described for the Jacobians.
