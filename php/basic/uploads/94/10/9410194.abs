Title: Induced Topology on the Hoop Group
Authors: J. Rasmussen and M. Weis
Abstract: A new topology is proposed on the space of holonomy equivalence classes of loops, induced by the topology of the space $\Sigma$ in which the loops are embedded. The possible role for the new topology in the context of the work by Ashtekar et al. is discussed.
