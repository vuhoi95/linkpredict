Title: Causal quantum mechanics treating position and momentum symmetrically
Authors: S. M. Roy and V. Singh
Abstract: De Broglie and Bohm formulated a causal quantum mechanics with a phase space density whose integral over momentum reproduces the position probability density of usual statistical quantum theory. We propose a causal quantum theory with a joint probability distribution such that the separate probability distributions for position and momentum agree with usual quantum theory. Unlike the Wigner distribution the suggested distribution is positive definite and obeys the Liouville condition.
