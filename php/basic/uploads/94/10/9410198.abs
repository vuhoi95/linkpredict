Title: Point Interactions from Flux Conservation
Authors: Luis J. Boya and E. C. G. Sudarshan
Abstract: We show that the physical requirement of flux conservation can substitute for the usual matching conditions in point interactions. The study covers an arbitrary superposition of $\delta$ and $\delta'$ potentials on the real line and can be easily applied to higher dimensions. Our procedure can be seen as a physical interpretation of the deficiency index of some symmetric, but not self-adjoint operators.
