Title: Vector-Chiral Equivalence in Null Gauged WZNW Theory
Authors: F. Ardalan and A. M. Ghezelbash
Abstract: We consider the standard vector and chiral gauged WZNW models by their gauged maximal null subgroups and show that they can be mapped to each other by a special transformation. We give an explicit expression for the map in the case of the classical Lie groups $ A_N $, $ B_N $, $ C_N $, $ D_N $, and note its connection with the duality map for the Riemmanian globally symmetric spaces.
