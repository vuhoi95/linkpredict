Title: Integrable Difference Analogue of the Logistic Equation and BÃ¤cklund  Transformation of the KP Hierarchy
Authors: Noriko Saitoh and Satoru Saito and Akinobu Shimizu
Abstract: A difference analogue of the logistic equation, which preserves integrability, is derived from Hirota's bilinear difference equation. The integrability of the map is shown to result from the large symmetry associated with the B\"acklund transformation of the KP hierarchy. We introduce a scheme which interpolates between this map and the standard logistic map and enables us to study integrable and nonintegrable systems on an equal basis. In particular we study the behavior of Julia set at the point where the nonintegrable map passes to the integrable map.
