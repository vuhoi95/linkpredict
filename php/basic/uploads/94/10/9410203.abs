Title: Proposal for a Simple Model of Dynamical SUSY Breaking
Authors: K. Intriligator and N. Seiberg and S. H. Shenker
Abstract: We discuss supersymmetric $SU(2)$ gauge theory with a single matter field in the $I=3/2$ representation. This theory has a moduli space of exactly degenerate vacua. Classically it is the complex plane with an orbifold singularity at the origin. There seem to be two possible candidates for the quantum theory at the origin. In both the global chiral symmetry is unbroken. The first is interacting quarks and gluons at a non-trivial infrared fixed point -- a non-Abelian Coulomb phase. The second, which we consider more likely, is a confining phase where the singularity is simply smoothed out. If this second, more likely, possibility is realized, supersymmetry will dynamically break when a tree level superpotential is added. This would be the simplest known gauge theory which dynamically breaks supersymmetry.
