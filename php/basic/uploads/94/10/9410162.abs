Title: Regularisation, the BV method, and the antibracket cohomology
Authors: Walter Troost and Antoine Van Proeyen
Abstract: We review the Lagrangian Batalin--Vilkovisky method for gauge theories. This includes gauge fixing, quantisation and regularisation. We emphasize the role of cohomology of the antibracket operation. Our main example is $d=2$ gravity, for which we also discuss the solutions for the cohomology in the space of local integrals. This leads to the most general form for the action, for anomalies and for background charges.
