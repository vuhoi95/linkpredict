Title: Thermodynamics of Two Dimensional Black Holes
Authors: Alok Kumar and Koushik Ray
Abstract: Thermodynamic relations for a class of 2D black holes are obtained corresponding to observations made from finite spatial distances. We also study the thermodynamics of the charged version of the Jackiw-Teitelboim black holes found recently by Lowe and Strominger. Our results corroborate, in appropriate limits, to those obtained previously by other methods. We also analyze the stability of these black holes thermodynamically.
