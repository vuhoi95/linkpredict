Title: The Canonical Partition Function for Quons
Authors: J. W. Goodison and D. J. Toms
Abstract: We calculate the canonical partition function $Z_N$ for a system of $N$ free particles obeying so-called `quon' statistics where $q$ is real and satisfies $|q|<1$ by using simple counting arguments. We observe that this system is afflicted by the Gibbs paradox and that $Z_N$ is independent of $q$. We demonstrate that such a system of particles obeys the ideal gas law and that the internal energy $U$ ( and hence the specific heat capacity $C_V$ ) is identical to that of a system of $N$ free particles obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.
