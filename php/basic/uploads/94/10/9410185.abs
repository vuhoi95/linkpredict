Title: Phase space properties of charged fields in theories of local  observables
Authors: D. Buchholz and C. D'Antoni
Abstract: Within the setting of algebraic quantum field theory a relation between phase-space properties of observables and charged fields is established. These properties are expressed in terms of compactness and nuclearity conditions which are the basis for the characterization of theories with physically reasonable causal and thermal features. Relevant concepts and results of phase space analysis in algebraic quantum field theory are reviewed and the underlying ideas are outlined.
