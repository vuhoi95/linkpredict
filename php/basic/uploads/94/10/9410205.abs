Title: S-Dual Gaugino Condensation and Supersymmetry Breaking
Authors: Z. Lalak and A. Niemeyer and H. P. Nilles
Abstract: The principle of S-duality is used to incorporate gaugino condensates into effective supergravity (superstring) Lagrangians. We discuss two implementations of S-duality which differ in the way the coupling constant is transformed. Both solve the problem of the runaway dilaton and lead to satisfactory supersymmetry breaking in models with a {\em single} gaugino condensate. The breakdown of supersymmetry is intimately related to a nontrivial transformation of the condensate under T-duality.
