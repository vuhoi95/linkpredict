Title: Galois Modular Invariants of WZW Models
Authors: J. Fuchs and A. N. Schellekens and C. Schweigert
Abstract: The set of modular invariants that can be obtained from Galois transformations is investigated systematically for WZW models. It is shown that a large subset of Galois modular invariants coincides with simple current invariants. For algebras of type B and D infinite series of previously unknown exceptional automorphism invariants are found.
