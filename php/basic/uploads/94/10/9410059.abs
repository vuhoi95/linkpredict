Title: Bosonization approach to the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model
Authors: S. Fujimoto and N. Kawakami
Abstract: The one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by using bosonization techniques and conformal field theory. In the half-filled band, the charge and spin gaps open for the anti-ferromagnetic Kondo coupling. Away from half-filling, the paramagnetic metallic state is characterized by the fixed point of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the {\it large} Fermi surface in accordance with known results. It is suggested that as the electron density approaches half-filling, both of spin and charge susceptibilities may show a divergence property.
