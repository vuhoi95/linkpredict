Title: String Theory and ALE Instantons
Authors: M. Bianchi and F. Fucito and G. C. Rossi and M. Martellini
Abstract: We show that the classical equations of motion of the low-energy effective field theory describing the massless modes of the heterotic (or type I) string admit two classes of supersymmetric self--dual backgrounds. The first class, which was already considered in the literature, consists of solutions with a (conformally) flat metric coupled to axionic instantons. The second includes Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) gravitational instantonic backgrounds coupled to gauge instantons through the so--called ``standard embedding''.
