Abstract: We present a new formulation of the tensionless string ($T= 0$) where the space-time conformal symmetry is manifest. Using a Hamiltonian BRST scheme we quantize this {\em Conformal String} and find that it has critical dimension $D=2$. This is in keeping with our classical result that the model describes massless particles in this dimension. It is also consistent with our previous results which indicate that quantized conformally symmetric tensionless strings describe a topological phase away {}from $D=2$. We reach our result by demanding nilpotency of the BRST charge and consistency with the Jacobi identities. The derivation is presented in two different ways: in operator language and using mode expansions. Careful attention is payed to regularization, a crucial ingredient in our calculations.
