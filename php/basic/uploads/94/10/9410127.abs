Title: Supersymmetry and Solitons: N=2 and N=0
Authors: Zvonimir Hlousek and Donald Spector
Abstract: This talk summarizes our recent work establishing an algebraic, model-independent basis for the existence of \B bounds and \B equations for topologically non-trivial solitons and instantons. Our arguments use supersymmetry in an essential way to understand both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories. Our arguments are constructive and work in nearly any number of dimensions. Presented at and to appear in the proceedings of the XX^{th} International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Osaka, July 1994.
