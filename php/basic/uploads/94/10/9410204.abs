Title: Functional determinants and effective actions:Corrigenda
Authors: J. S. Dowker and J. S. Apps
Abstract: Some calculational errors in expressions derived previously by the first author for the effective action, or equivalently for the functional determinant, on sectors of a spherical cap are corrected. The formula for the change in the effective action under Weyl rescalings in the three dimensional case is also amended.
