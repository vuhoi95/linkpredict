Title: Ultra-Multiplets: A New Representation of Rigid 2D, N = 8 Supersymmetry
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and L. Rana
Abstract: By utilizing a new procedure (the RADIO method) for deriving on-shell 2D, 2N-extended multiplets from off-shell 2D, N-extended multiplets, we derive a new on-shell 2D, N = 8 representation; the ultra-multiplet. By twisting with respect to parity, we show that many variant versions of this supermultiplet also exist.
