Abstract: We present a derivation of abelian and non-abelian bosonization in a path integral setting by expressing the generating functional for current-current correlation functions as a product of a $G/G$-coset model, which is dynamically trivial, and a bosonic part which contains the dynamics. A BRST symmetry can be identified which leads to smooth bosonization in both the abelian and non-abelian cases.
