Title: Shock Waves and the Vacuum Structure of Gauge Theories
Authors: M. Martellini and A. Sagnotti and M. Zeni
Abstract: In Yang-Mills theory massless point sources lead naturally to shock-wave configurations. Their magnetic counterparts endow the vacuum of the four-dimensional compact abelian model with a Coulomb-gas behaviour whose physical implications are briefly discussed.
