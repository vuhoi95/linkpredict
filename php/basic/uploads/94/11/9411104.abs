Title: Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in N = 4 supergravity with matter.
Authors: V. A. Tsokur and Yu. M. Zinoviev
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in $N=4$ supergravity interacting with vector multiplets. We start with the ordinary version of such model with the scalar field geometry $SU(1,1)/U(1)\otimes SO(6,m)/SO(6)\otimes SO(m)$. Then we construct a dual version of this theory with the same scalar field geometry, which corresponds to the interaction of arbitrary number of vector multiplets with the hidden sector, admitting spontaneous supersymmetry breaking without a cosmological term. We show that supersymmetry breaking is still possible in the presence of matter fields.
