Title: Spin generalization of the Calogero-Moser system and the Matrix KP  equation
Authors: I. Krichever and O. Babelon and E. Billey and M. Talon
Abstract: The complete solutions of the spin generalization of the elliptic Calogero Moser systems are constructed. They are expressed in terms of Riemann theta-functions. The analoguous constructions for the trigonometric and rational cases are also presented.
