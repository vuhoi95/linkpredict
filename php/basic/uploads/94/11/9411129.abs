Title: Shock Wave Mixing in Einstein and Dilaton Gravity
Authors: Saurya Das and Parthasarathi Majumdar
Abstract: We consider possible mixing of electromagnetic and gravitational shock waves, in the Planckian energy scattering of point particles in Minkowski space. By boosting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solution to the velocity of light, it is shown that no mixing of shock waves takes place for arbitrary finite charge carried by the black hole. However, a similar boosting procedure for a charged black hole solution in dilaton gravity yields some mixing : the wave function of even a neutral test particle, acquires a small additional phase factor depending on the dilatonic black hole charge. Possible implications for poles in the amplitudes for the dilaton gravity case are discussed.
