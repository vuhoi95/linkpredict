Title: Finite-Dimensional Representations of the Quantum Superalgebra  U$_{q}$[gl(2/2)]: II. Nontypical representations at generic $q$
Authors: Nguyen Anh Ky and N. Stoilova
Abstract: The construction approach proposed in the previous paper Ref. 1 allows us there and in the present paper to construct at generic deformation parameter $q$ all finite--dimensional representations of the quantum Lie superalgebra $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$. The finite--dimensional $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$-modules $W^{q}$ constructed in Ref. 1 are either irreducible or indecomposible. If a module $W^{q}$ is indecomposible, i.e. when the condition (4.41) in Ref. 1 does not hold, there exists an invariant maximal submodule of $W^{q}$, to say $I_{k}^{q}$, such that the factor-representation in the factor-module $W^{q}/I_{k}^{q}$ is irreducible and called nontypical. Here, in this paper, indecomposible representations and nontypical finite--dimensional representations of the quantum Lie superalgebra $U_{q}[gl(2/2)]$ are considered and classified as their module structures are analized and the matrix elements of all nontypical representations are written down explicitly.
