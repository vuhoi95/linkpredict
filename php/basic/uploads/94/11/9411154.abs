Title: N=1 Super-$Ï„_{3}$QED from Atiyah-Ward Space-Time
Authors: M. A. De Andrade and O. M. Del Cima
Abstract: In this letter, we present the action for the massive super-{\QED}. A pair of chiral and a pair of anti-chiral superfields with opposite U(1)-charges are required. We also carry out a dimensional reduction {\it{\`a la}} Scherk from (2+2) to (1+2) dimensions, and we show that, after suitable truncations are performed, the supersymmetric extension of the ${\tau}_{3}$QED$_{1+2}$ naturally comes out.
