Title: Supersonic String Model for Witten Vortices
Authors: Brandon Carter and Patrick Peter
Abstract: A new cosmic string model specified by two independent mass parameters is introduced for the purpose of providing a realistic representation of the macroscopic dynamical behaviour of Witten type (superconducting) vortex defects of the vacuum. Unlike the self dual single mass parameter models previously used for this purpose, the new model successfully represents the effect of current saturation and the feature that wiggle propagation remains supersonic even in the weak current limit.
