Title: Finite Energy Instantons in the O(3) Non-Linear Sigma Model
Authors: Peter G. Tinyakov and Emil Mottola and Salman Habib
Abstract: We consider winding number transitions in the two dimensional O(3) non-linear sigma model, modified by a suitable conformal symmetry breaking term. We discuss the general properties of the relevant instanton solutions which dominate the transition amplitudes at finite energy, and find the solutions numerically. The Euclidean period of the solution increases with energy, contrary to the behavior found in the abelian Higgs model or simple one dimensional systems. This indicates that there is a sharp crossover from instanton dominated tunneling to sphaleron dominated thermal activation at a certain critical temperature in this model. We argue that the electroweak theory in four dimensions should exhibit a similar behavior.
