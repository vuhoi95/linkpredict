Title: Dynamical fermion mass generation by strong gauge interaction shielded  by a scalar field
Authors: Christoph Frick and Jiri Jersak
Abstract: The strongly coupled lattice gauge models with confined fermion and scalar matter fields, which in a certain phase break dynamically a global chiral symmetry, are reconsidered from the point of view of the existence of heavy fermions. If these models are interpreted as describing a new strong force beyond the standard model, such heavy fermions can arise as neutral bound states of the fundamental fermion and scalar. The discussed mechanism could be considered as an alternative to the Higgs mechanism.
