Title: Linear connections on matrix geometries
Authors: J. Madore and T. Masson and J. Mourad
Abstract: A general definition of a linear connection in noncommutative geometry has been recently proposed. Two examples are given of linear connections in noncommutative geometries which are based on matrix algebras. They both possess a unique metric connection.
