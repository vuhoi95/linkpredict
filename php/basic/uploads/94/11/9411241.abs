Abstract: The type-I quantum superalgebras are known to admit non-trivial one-parameter families of inequivalent finite dimensional irreps, even for generic $q$. We apply the recently developed technique to construct new solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation associated with the one-parameter family of irreps of $U_q(gl(m|n))$, thus obtaining R-matrices which depend not only on a spectral parameter but in addition on further continuous parameters. These extra parameters enter the Yang-Baxter equation in a similar way to the spectral parameter but in a non-additive form.
