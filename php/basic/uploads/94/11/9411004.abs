Title: Conformal blocks on elliptic curves and the  Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov--Bernard equations
Authors: Giovanni Felder and Christian Wieczerkowski
Abstract: We give an explicit description of the vector bundle of WZW conformal blocks on elliptic curves with marked points as subbundle of a vector bundle of Weyl group invariant vector valued theta functions on a Cartan subalgebra. We give a partly conjectural characterization of this subbundle in terms of certain vanishing conditions on affine hyperplanes. In some cases, explicit calculation are possible and confirm the conjecture. The Friedan--Shenker flat connection is calculated, and it is shown that horizontal sections are solutions of Bernard's generalization of the Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation.
