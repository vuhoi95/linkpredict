Title: Linearizing $W_{2,4}$ and $WB_2$ Algebras
Authors: S. Bellucci and S. Krivonos and A. Sorin
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the $W_3$ and $W_3^{(2)}$ algebras can be considered as subalgebras in some linear conformal algebras. In this paper we show that the nonlinear algebras $W_{2,4}$ and $WB_2$ as well as Zamolodchikov's spin $5/2$ superalgebra also can be embedded as subalgebras into some linear conformal algebras with a finite set of currents. These linear algebras give rise to new realizations of the nonlinear algebras which could be suitable in the construction of $W$-string theories.
