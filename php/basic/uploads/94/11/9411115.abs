Abstract: The $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ Poincar{\'e} superalgebra written in Hopf superalgebra form is transformed to the basis with classical Lorentz subalgebra generators. We show that in such a basis the $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ Poincare superalgebra can be written as graded bicrossproduct. We show that the $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ superalgebra acts covariantly on $\kappa$-deformed chiral superspace.
