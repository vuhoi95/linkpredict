Title: The Pressure of Hot $g^2 Ï†^4$ Theory at order $g^5$
Authors: Rajesh Parwani and Harvendra Singh
Abstract: The order $g^5$ contribution to the pressure of massless $g^2 \phi^4$ theory at nonzero temperature is obtained explicitly. Lower order contributions are reconsidered and two issues leading to the optimal choice of rearranged Lagrangian for such calculations are clarified.
