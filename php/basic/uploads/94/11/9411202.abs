Title: Conserved currents and gauge invariance in Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Friedemann Brandt and Marc Henneaux
Abstract: It is shown that in the absence of free abelian gauge fields, the conserved currents of (classical) Yang-Mills gauge models coupled to matter fields can be always redefined so as to be gauge invariant. This is a direct consequence of the general analysis of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition for Yang-Mills theory that we have provided recently.
