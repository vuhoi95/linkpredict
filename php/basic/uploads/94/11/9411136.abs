Title: Solitons in the Calogero-Sutherland Collective-Field Model
Authors: I. AndriÄ‡ and V. Bardek and L. Jonke
Abstract: In the Bogomol'nyi limit of the Calogero-Sutherland collective-field model we find static-soliton solutions. The solutions of the equations of motion are moving solitons, having no static limit for $\l>1$. They describe holes and lumps, depending on the value of the statistical parametar $\l$.
