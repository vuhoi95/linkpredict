Title: Action and Hamiltonian for eternal black holes
Authors: Valeri Frolov and Erik A. Martinez
Abstract: We present the Hamiltonian, quasilocal energy, and angular momentum for a spacetime region spatially bounded by two timelike surfaces. The results are applied to the particular case of a spacetime representing an eternal black hole. It is shown that in the case when the boundaries are located in two different wedges of the Kruskal diagram, the Hamiltonian is of the form $H = H_+ - H_-$, where $H_+$ and $H_-$ are the Hamiltonian functions for the right and left wedges respectively. The application of the obtained results to the thermofield dynamics description of quantum effects in black holes is briefly discussed.
