Title: Quantum inconsistency of W3-gravity models associated with magical  Jordan algebras
Authors: S. A. Lyakhovich and A. A. Sharapov
Abstract: It is shown that the Sugawara-type construction for W3-algebra associated with the four magical Jordan algebras leads to the anomalous theory of W3-gravity.
