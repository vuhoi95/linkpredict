Abstract: We propose the action of d=4 Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spinning particle with arbitrary fixed quantum numbers. Regardless of the spin value, the configuration space of the model is a direct product of d=4 AdS space and two-dimensional sphere corresponds to spinning degrees of freedom. The model is an AdS counterpart of the massive spinning particle in the Minkowski space proposed earlier. Being AdS-invariant, the model possesses two gauge symmetries implying identical conservation law for AdS-counterparts of mass and spin. Two equivalent forms of the action functional, minimal and manifestly covariant, are given.
