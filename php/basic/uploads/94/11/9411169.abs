Title: Quantum mass corrections for affine Toda solitons
Authors: N. J. MacKay and G. M. T. Watts
Abstract: We calculate the first quantum corrections to the masses of solitons in imaginary-coupling affine Toda theories using the semi-classical method of Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu. The theories divide naturally into those based on the simply-laced, the twisted and the untwisted non-simply-laced algebras. We find that the classical relationships between soliton and particle masses found by Olive {\em et al.\ }persist for the first two classes, but do not appear to do so naively for the third.
