Title: Entropy for extremal Reissner- Nordstr√∏m black holes
Authors: Amit Ghosh and P. Mitra
Abstract: We reinterpret recent work on extremal Reissner- Nordstr\o m black holes to argue that the mass is a measure of the gravitational entropy. We also find that the entropy of scalar fields in this background has a stronger divergence than usual.
