Title: On chiral Hubbard model and the chiral Kondo lattice model
Authors: D. F. Wang and C. Gruber
Abstract: The integrability of the one dimensional chiral Hubbard model is discussed in the limit of strong interaction, U=+\infty. The system is shown to be integrable in sense of existence of an infinite number of constants of motion. The system is related to a chiral Kondo lattice model at strong interaction J=+\infty
