Title: Transition density of diffusion on Sierpinski gasket and extension of  Flory's formula
Authors: Tetsuya Hattori and Hideo Nakajima
Abstract: Some problems related to the transition density u(t,x) of the diffusion on the Sierpinski gasket are considerd, based on recent rigorous results and detailed numerical calculations. The main contents are an extension of Flory's formula for the end-to-end distance exponent of self-avoiding walks on the fractal spaces, and an evidence of the oscillatory behavior of u(t,x) on the Sierpinski gasket.
