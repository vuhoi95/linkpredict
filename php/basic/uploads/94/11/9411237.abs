Title: Discrete spectral shift in an anisotropic universe
Authors: D. J. Lamb and A. Z. Capri and M. Kobayashi
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the particle creation as seen by a stationary observer in an anisotropic universe. By using an observer and geometry dependent time to quantise a massive scalar field we show that a discrete energy spectrum shift occurs. The length scale associated with the geometry provides the energy scale by which the spectrum is shifted. The $\beta(p,q)$ coefficient for the Bogolubov transformation calculated is proportional to a series of delta functions whose argument contains $p$ and $q$ and half multiples of the root of the curvature.
