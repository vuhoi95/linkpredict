Title: The generalized chiral Schwinger model on the two-sphere
Authors: A. Bassetto and L. Griguolo
Abstract: A family of theories which interpolate between vector and chiral Schwinger models is studied on the two--sphere $S^{2}$. The conflict between the loss of gauge invariance and global geometrical properties is solved by introducing a fixed background connection. In this way the generalized Dirac--Weyl operator can be globally defined on $S^{2}$. The generating functional of the Green functions is obtained by taking carefully into account the contribution of gauge fields with non--trivial topological charge and of the related zero--modes of the Dirac determinant. In the decompactification limit, the Green functions of the flat case are recovered; in particular the fermionic condensate in the vacuum vanishes, at variance with its behaviour in the vector Schwinger model.
