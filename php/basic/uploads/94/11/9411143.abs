Title: The String Calculation of QCD Wilson Loops on Arbitrary Surfaces
Authors: Stephen G. Naculich and Harold A. Riggs
Abstract: Compact string expressions are found for non-intersecting Wilson loops in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on any surface (orientable or nonorientable) as a weighted sum over covers of the surface. All terms from the coupled chiral sectors of the 1/N expansion of the Wilson loop expectation values are included.
