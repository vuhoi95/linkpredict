Authors: S. A. Frolov and A. A. Slavnov and C. Sochichiu
Abstract: Canonical quantization of the Wess-Zumino (WZ) model including chiral interaction with gauge field is considered for the case of a degenerate action. The two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills model and the four-dimensional SU(3) chiral gauge model proposed in the paper \cite{fss} are studied in details. Gauge invariance of the quantum theory is established at the formal level.
