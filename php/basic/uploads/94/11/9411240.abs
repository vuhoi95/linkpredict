Title: Integrable Systems with Pairwise Interactions and Functional Equations
Authors: H. W. Braden and V. M. Buchstaber
Abstract: A new ansatz is presented for a Lax pair describing systems of particles on the line interacting via (possibly nonsymmetric) pairwise forces. Particular cases of this yield the known Lax pairs for the Calogero-Moser and Toda systems, as well as their relativistic generalisations. The ansatz leads to a system of functional equations. Several new functional equations are described and the general analytic solution to some of these is given. New integrable systems are described.
