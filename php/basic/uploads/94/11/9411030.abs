Title: Local critical behaviour at aperiodic surface extended perturbation in  the Ising quantum chain
Authors: Dragi Karevski and Gábor Palágyi and Loïc Turban
Abstract: The surface critical behaviour of the semi--infinite one--dimensional quantum Ising model in a transverse field is studied in the presence of an aperiodic surface extended modulation. The perturbed couplings are distributed according to a generalized Fredholm sequence, leading to a marginal perturbation and varying surface exponents. The surface magnetic exponents are calculated exactly whereas the expression of the surface energy density exponent is conjectured from a finite--size scaling study. The system displays surface order at the bulk critical point, above a critical value of the modulation amplitude. It may be considered as a discrete realization of the Hilhorst--van Leeuwen model.
