Title: The heat kernel for deformed spheres
Authors: N. Shtykov and D. V. Vassilevich
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for a Laplace operator acting on deformed spheres. We calculate the coefficients of the heat kernel expansion on two- and three-dimensional deformed spheres as functions of deformation parameters. We find that under some deformation the conformal anomaly for free scalar fields on $R^4\times \tilde S^2$ and $R^6\times \tilde S^2$ is canceled.
