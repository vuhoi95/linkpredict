Title: Effect of Self-Interaction on Charged Black Hole Radiance
Authors: Per Kraus and Frank Wilczek
Abstract: We extend our previous analysis of the modification of the spectrum of black hole radiance due to the simplest and probably most quantitatively important back-reaction effect, that is self-gravitational interaction, to the case of charged holes. As anticipated, the corrections are small for low-energy radiation when the hole is well away from extremality, butbecome qualitatively important near extremality. A notable result is that radiation which could leave the hole with mass and charge characteristic of a naked singularity, predicted in the usual approximation of fixed space-time geometry, is here suppressed. We discuss the nature of our approximations, and show how they work in a simpler electromagnetic analogue problem.
