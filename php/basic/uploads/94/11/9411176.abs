Title: Toda Soliton Mass Corrections and the Particle--Soliton Duality  Conjecture
Authors: Gustav W. Delius and Marc Grisaru
Abstract: We compute quantum corrections to soliton masses in affine Toda theories with imaginary exponentials based on the nonsimply-laced Lie algebras $c_n^{(1)}$. We find that the soliton mass ratios renormalize nontrivially, in the same manner as those of the fundamental particles of the theories with real exponentials based on the nonsimply-laced algebras $b_n^{(1)}$. This gives evidence that the conjectured relation between solitons in one Toda theory and fundamental particles in a dual Toda theory holds also at the quantum level. This duality can be seen as a toy model for S-duality.
