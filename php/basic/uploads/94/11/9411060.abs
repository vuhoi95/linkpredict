Title: More on the exponential bound of four dimensional simplicial quantum  gravity
Authors: B. Bruegmann and E. Marinari
Abstract: A crucial requirement for the standard interpretation of Monte Carlo simulations of simplicial quantum gravity is the existence of an exponential bound that makes the partition function well-defined. We present numerical data favoring the existence of an exponential bound, and we argue that the more limited data sets on which recently opposing claims were based are also consistent with the existence of an exponential bound.
