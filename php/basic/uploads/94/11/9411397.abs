Title: Supersymmetric Models with a Gauge Singlet and Non-Universal Soft Terms  from Orbifold String Theory
Authors: Ph. Brax and U. Ellwanger and C. A. Savoy
Abstract: The particle spectrum of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with a gauge singlet is studied. Soft supersymmetry breaking terms are explicitly chosen to be non-universal according to orbifold string theory. they depend on modular weights of chiral fields and on an angle $\theta$ specifying the supersymmetry breaking sector. Imposing radiative weak symmetry breaking and requiring that standard model Yukawa couplings should be allowed yield constraints on modular weights and almost specifies the angle $\theta$. We then perform a numerical anlysis of the low energy spectrum. It turns out that the spectrum is very constrained, revealing salient features such as light Higgses and neutralinos. The latter turns out to be essentially gaugino-like.
