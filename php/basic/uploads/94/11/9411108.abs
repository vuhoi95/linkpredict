Title: A construction of lattice chiral gauge theories
Authors: Rajamani Narayanan and Herbert Neuberger
Abstract: Path integration over Euclidean chiral fermions is replaced by the quantum mechanics of an auxiliary system of non--interacting fermions. Our construction avoids the no--go theorem and faithfully maintains all the known important features of chiral fermions, including the violation of some perturbative conservation laws by gauge field configurations of non--trivial topology.
