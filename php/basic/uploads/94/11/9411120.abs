Title: Chern-Simons Quantum Field Representation of Planar Ferromagnets
Authors: L. Martina and O. K. Pashaev and G. Soliani
Abstract: We represent the two - dimensional planar classical continuous Heisenberg spin model as a constrained Chern-Simons gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger system. The hamiltonian structure of the model is studied, allowing the quantization of the theory by the gauge invariant approach. A preliminary study of the quantum states is displayed and several physical consequences in terms of anyons are discussed.
