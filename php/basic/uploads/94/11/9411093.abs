Title: The Calogero Model and the Virasoro Symmetry
Authors: E. Bergshoeff and M. Vasiliev
Abstract: We construct new realizations of the Virasoro algebra inspired by the Calogero model. The Virasoro algebra we find acts as a kind of spectrum-generating algebra of the Calogero model. We furthermore present the superextension of these results and introduce a class of higher-spin extensions of the Virasoro algebra which are of the $W_\infty$ - type.
