Title: Non-Critical Bosonic String Corrections to the Black Hole Entropy
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We calculate the quantum corrections to the entropy of a very large black hole, coming from the theory of a $D$-dimensional, non-critical bosonic string. We show that, for $D >2$, as a result of modular invariance the entropy is ultraviolet finite, although it diverges in the infrared (while for $D=2$ the entropy contains both ultraviolet and infrared divergences). The issue of modular invariance in field theory, in connection with black-hole entropy, is also investigated.
