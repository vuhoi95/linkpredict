Title: On a Residue Representation of Deformation, Koszul and Chiral Rings
Authors: P. Berglund and T. Hubsch
Abstract: A residue-theoretic representation is given for massless matter fields in (quotients) of (weighted) \CY\ complete intersection models and the corresponding chiral operators in \LGO{s}. The well known polynomial deformations are thus generalized and the universal but somewhat abstract Koszul computations acquire a concrete realization and a general but more heuristic reinterpretation. A direct correspondence with a BRST-type analysis of constrained systems also emerges naturally.
