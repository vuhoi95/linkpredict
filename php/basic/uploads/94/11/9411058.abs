Title: Computing the BRST Operator Used in Quantization of Gauge Theories
Authors: A. Burnel and H. Caprasse and A. Dresse
Abstract: It is shown that for a large class of non-holonomic quantum mechanical systems one can make the computation of BRST charge fully algorithmic. Two computer algebra programs written in the language of {\tt REDUCE} are described. They are able to realize the complex calculations needed to determine the charge for general nonlinear algebras. Some interesting specific solutions are discussed.
