Title: Gamma Ray Bursts, Neutron Star Quakes, and the Casimir Effect
Authors: C. Carlson and T. Goldman and J. Perez-Mercader
Abstract: We propose that the dynamic Casimir effect is a mechanism that converts the energy of neutron starquakes into $\gamma$--rays. This mechanism efficiently produces photons from electromagnetic Casimir energy released by the rapid motion of a dielectric medium into a vacuum. Estimates based on the cutoff energy of the gamma ray bursts and the volume involved in a starquake indicate that the total gamma ray energy emission is consonant with observational requirements.
