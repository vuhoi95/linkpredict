Title: $XXZ$ model as effective Hamiltonian for generalized Hubbard models with  broken $Î·$-symmetry
Authors: G. Albertini and V. E. Korepin and A. Schadschneider
Abstract: We consider the limit of strong Coulomb attraction for generalized Hubbard models with $\eta$-symmetry. In this limit these models are equivalent to the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg quantum spin chain. In order to study the behaviour of the superconducting phase in the electronic model under perturbations which break the $\eta$-symmetry we investigate the ground state of the ferromagnetic non-critical $XXZ$-chain in the sector with fixed magnetization. It turns out to be a large bound state of $N$ magnons. We find that the perturbations considered here lead to the disappearance of the off-diagonal longe-range order.
