Title: The phase diagram of an Ising model on a polymerized random surface
Authors: T. Jonsson and J. F. Wheater
Abstract: We construct a random surface model with a string susceptibility exponent one quarter by taking an Ising model on a random surface and introducing an additional degree of freedom which amounts to allowing certain outgrowths on the surfaces. Fine tuning the Ising temperature and the weight factor for outgrowths we find a triple point where the susceptibility exponent is one quarter. At this point magnetized and nonmagnetized gravity phases meet a branched polymer phase.
