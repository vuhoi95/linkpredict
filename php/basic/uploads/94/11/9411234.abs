Title: Spin-Flavor Structure of Large N Baryons
Authors: Roger Dashen and Elizabeth Jenkins and Aneesh V. Manohar
Abstract: The spin-flavor structure of large N baryons is described in the 1/N expansion of QCD using quark operators. The complete set of quark operator identities is obtained, and used to derive an operator reduction rule which simplifies the 1/N expansion. The operator reduction rule is applied to the axial currents, masses, magnetic moments and hyperon non-leptonic decay amplitudes in the $SU(3)$ limit, to first order in $SU(3)$ breaking, and without assuming $SU(3)$ symmetry. The connection between the Skyrme and quark representations is discussed. An explicit formula is given for the quark model operators in terms of the Skyrme model operators to all orders in $1/\N$ for the two flavor case.
