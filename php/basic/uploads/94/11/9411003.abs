Title: Lessons of Quantum 2D Dilaton Gravity
Authors: S. P. de Alwis and D. A. MacIntire
Abstract: Based on the analysis of two dimensional dilaton gravity we argue that the semiclassical equations of black hole formation and evaporation should not be interpreted in terms of expectation values of operators in the exact quantum theory, but rather as WKB trajectories. Thus at the semiclassical level it does not seem possible to formulate a notion of {\it quantum mechanical} information loss.
