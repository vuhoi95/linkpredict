Title: On the physical contents of q-deformed Minkowski spaces
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and P. P. Kulish and F. Rodenas
Abstract: Some physical aspects of $q$-deformed spacetimes are discussed. It is pointed out that, under certain standard assumptions relating deformation and quantization, the classical limit (Poisson bracket description) of the dynamics is bound to contain unusual features. At the same time, it is argued that the formulation of an associated $q$-deformed field theory is fraught with serious difficulties.
