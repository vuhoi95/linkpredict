Title: Renormalization group and logarithmic corrections to scaling relations  in conformal sector of 4D gravity
Authors: I. Antoniadis and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We study the effective theory of the conformal factor near its infrared stable fixed point.The renormalization group equations for the effective coupling constants are found and their solutions near the critical point are obtained, providing the logarithmic corrections to scaling relations.Some cosmological applications of the running of coupling constants are briefly discussed.
