Title: Space-Time Geometry of Three-Dimensional Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: V. Radovanović and Dj. Šijački
Abstract: It is shown that the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in $3$-dimensional Riemann-Cartan space-time can be completely reformulated as a gravity-like theory in terms of gauge invariant variables. The resulting Yang-Mills induced equations are found, and it is demonstrated that they can be derived from a torsion-square type of action.
