Title: Note on W3 Realizations of the Bosonic String
Authors: Fiorenzo Bastianelli and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: In order to investigate to what extent string theories are different vacua of a general string theory (the ``universal string"), we discuss realizations of the bosonic string as particular background of certain types of $W$-strings. Our discussions include linearized $W_3^{lin}$, non-critical $W_3$, linearized $W_3^{(2)lin}$ and critical $W_3^{(2)}$ realizations of the bosonic string.
