Title: Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order: Meissner Effect and Flux Quantization
Authors: H. T. Nieh and Gang Su and Bao-Heng Zhao
Abstract: There has been a proof by Sewell that the hypothesis of off-diagonal long-range order in the reduced density matrix $\rho _2$ implies the Meissner effect. We present in this note an elementary and straightforward proof that not only the Meissner effect but also the property of magnetic flux quantization follows from the hypothesis. It is explicitly shown that the two phenomena are closely related, and phase coherence is the origin for both.
