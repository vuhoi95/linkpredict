Title: Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in N=3 supergravity with matter
Authors: V. A. Tsokur and Yu. M. Zinoviev
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking without a cosmological term in $N=3$ supergravity with matter vector multiplets, scalar fields geometry being $SU(3,m)/SU(3)\otimes SU(m)\otimes U(1)$. At first, we consider the case of minimal coupling with different possible gaugings (compact as well as non-compact). Then we show that there exist dual version of such a theory (with the same scalar field geometry), which turns out to be the generalization of the $N=3$ hidden sector, constructed some time ago by one of us, to the case of arbitrary number of vector multiplets. We demonstrate that spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is still possible in the presence of matter multiplets.
