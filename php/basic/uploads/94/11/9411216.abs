Title: Higher Derivative Four-Fermion Model in Curved Spacetime
Authors: E. Elizalde and S. Leseduarte and S. D. Odintsov
Abstract: We discuss the phase structure of a higher derivative four-fermion model in four dimensions in curved spacetime in frames of the $\frac{1}{N_c}$-expansion. First, we evaluate in our model the effective potential of two composite scalars in the linear curvature approximation using a local momentum representation in curved spacetime for the higher-derivative propagator which naturally appears. The symmetry breaking phenomenon and phase transition induced by curvature are numerically investigated. A numerical study of the dynamically generated fermionic mass, which depends on the coupling constants and on the curvature, is also presented.
