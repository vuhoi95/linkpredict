Title: Protective Measurements
Authors: Yakir Aharonov and Lev Vaidman
Abstract: Protective measurements yield properties of the quantum state of a single quantum system without affecting the quantum state. A protective measurement involves adiabatic coupling to the measuring device together with a procedure to protect the state from changing. For nondegenerate energy eigenstates the protection is provided by the system itself. In this case it is actually possible to measure the Schr\"odinger wave via measurements on a single system. This fact provides an argument in favor of associating physical reality with a quantum state of a single system, challenging the usual ensemble interpretation. We also believe that the complete description of a quantum system requires a two-state vector formalism involving (in addition to the usual one)a future quantum state evolving backwards in time. Protective measurements testing the two-state vector reality are constructed.
