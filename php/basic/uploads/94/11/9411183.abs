Title: HyperKÃ¤hler quotients and N=4 gauge theories in D=2
Authors: M. Billo' and P. Fre'
Abstract: We consider certain N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories in D=2 coupled to quaternionic matter multiplets in a minimal way. These theories admit as effective theories sigma-models on non-trivial HyperK\"ahler manifolds obtained as HyperK\"ahler quotients. The example of ALE manifolds is discussed. (Based on a talk given by P. Fr\'e at the F. Gursey Memorial Conference, Istanbul, June 1994).
