Title: Comparative Quantizations of (2+1)-Dimensional Gravity
Authors: S. Carlip and J. E. Nelson
Abstract: We compare three approaches to the quantization of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant: reduced phase space quantization with the York time slicing, quantization of the algebra of holonomies, and quantization of the space of classical solutions. The relationships among these quantum theories allow us to define and interpret time-dependent operators in the ``frozen time'' holonomy formulation.
