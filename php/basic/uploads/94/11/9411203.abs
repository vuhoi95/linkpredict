Title: ADE functional dilogarithm identities and integrable models
Authors: F. Gliozzi and R. Tateo
Abstract: We describe a new infinite family of multi-parameter functional equations for the Rogers dilogarithm, generalizing Abel's and Euler's formulas. They are suggested by the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach to the Renormalization Group flow of 2D integrable, ADE-related quantum field theories. The known sum rules for the central charge of critical fixed points can be obtained as special cases of these. We conjecture that similar functional identities can be constructed for any rational integrable quantum field theory with factorized S-matrix and support it with extensive numerical checks.
