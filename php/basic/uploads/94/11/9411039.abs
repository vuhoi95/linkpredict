Title: R-Matrix Formulation of the Quantum Inhomogeneous Groups Iso_qr(N) and  Isp_qr(N)
Authors: Paolo Aschieri and Leonardo Castellani
Abstract: The quantum commutations $RTT=TTR$ and the orthogonal (symplectic) conditions for the inhomogeneous multiparametric $q$-groups of the $B_n,C_n,D_n$ type are found in terms of the $R$-matrix of $B_{n+1},C_{n+1},D_{n+1}$. A consistent Hopf structure on these inhomogeneous $q$-groups is constructed by means of a projection from $B_{n+1},C_{n+1},D_{n+1}$. Real forms are discussed: in particular we obtain the $q$-groups $ISO_{q,r}(n+1,n-1)$, including the quantum Poincar\'e group.
