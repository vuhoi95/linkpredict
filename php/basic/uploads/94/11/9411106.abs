Title: Representations of $SO(5)_{q}$ and Non-Minimal $q$-Deformation
Authors: B. Abdesselam and D. Arnaudon and A. Chakrabarti
Abstract: Representations of $SO(5)_{q}$ can be constructed on bases such that either the Chevalley triplet $(e_{1},\;f_{1},\;h_{1})$ or $(e_{2},\;f_{2},\;h_{2})$ has the standard $SU(2)_{q}$ matrix elements. The other triplet in each cases has a more complicated action. The $q$-deformation of such representations present striking differences. In one case a {\bf non-minimal} deformation is found to be essential. This is explained and illustrated below. Broader interests of a parallel use of the two bases are pointed out.
