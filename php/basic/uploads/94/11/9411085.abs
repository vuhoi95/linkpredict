Title: Temperley-Lieb Words as Valence-Bond Ground States
Authors: Peter F Arndt and Thomas Heinzel and C M Yung
Abstract: Based on the Temperley--Lieb algebra we define a class of one-dimensional Hamiltonians with nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions. Using the regular representation we give ground states of this model as words of the algebra. Two point correlation functions can be computed employing the Temperley--Lieb relations. Choosing a spin-1/2 representation of the algebra we obtain a generalization of the (q-deformed) Majumdar--Ghosh model. The ground states become valence-bond states.
