Title: Massive particle creation in a static 1+1 dimensional spacetime
Authors: D. J. Lamb and A. Z. Capri and S. M. Roy
Abstract: We show explicitly that there is particle creation in a static spacetime. This is done by studying the field in a coordinate system based on a physical principle which has recently been proposed. There the field is quantized by decomposing it into positive and negative frequency modes on a particular spacelike surface. This decomposition depends explicitly on the surface where the decomposition is performed, so that an observer who travels from one surface to another will observe particle production due to the different vacuum state.
