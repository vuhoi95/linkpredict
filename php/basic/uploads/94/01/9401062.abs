Title: Generalized Two-Dimensional QCD
Authors: Michael R. Douglas and Keke Li and Matthias Staudacher
Abstract: We study two-dimensional gauge theories with fundamental fermions and a general first order gauge-field Lagrangian. For the case of U(1) we show how standard bosonization of the Schwinger model generalizes to give mesons interacting through a general Landau-Ginzburg potential. We then show how for a subclass of SU(N) theories, 't Hooft's solution of large N two-dimensional QCD can be generalized in a consistent and natural manner. We finally point out the possible relevance of studying these theories to the string formulation of two-dimensional QCD as well as to understanding QCD in higher dimensions.
