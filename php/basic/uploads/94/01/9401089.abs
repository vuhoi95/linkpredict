Title: Decoupling of Translational and Rotational Modes for a Quantum Soliton
Authors: A. Dubikovsky and K. Sveshnikov
Abstract: A set of integral relations for rotational and translational zero modes in the vicinity of the soliton solution are derived from the particle-like properties of the latter and verified for a number of models (solitons in 1+1-dimensions, skyrmeons in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions, non-abelian monopoles). It is shown, that by consistent quantization within the framework of collective coordinates these relations ensure the correct diagonal expressions for the kinetic and centrifugal terms in the Hamiltonian in the lowest orders of the perturbation expansion. The connection between these properties and virial relations is also determined.
