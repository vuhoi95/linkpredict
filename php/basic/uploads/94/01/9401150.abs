Title: Differential Calculus and Discrete Structures
Authors: A. Dimakis and F. M"uller-Hoissen
Abstract: There is a deformation of the ordinary differential calculus which leads from the continuum to a lattice (and induces a corresponding deformation of physical theories). We recall some of its features and relate it to a general framework of differential calculus on discrete sets. This framework generalizes the usual (lattice) discretization.
