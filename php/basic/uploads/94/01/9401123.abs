Title: Schwinger's Method for the Massive Casimir Effect
Authors: M. V. Cougo-Pinto and C. Farina and A. J. Segui-Santonja
Abstract: We apply to the massive scalar field a method recently proposed by Schwinger to calculate the Casimir effect. The method is applied with two different regularization schemes: the Schwinger original one by means of Poisson formula and another one by means of analytical continuation.
