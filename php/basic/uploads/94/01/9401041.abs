Title: Gauge Interactions and Bosonized Fermion Liquids
Authors: H. -J. Kwon and A. Houghton and J. B. Marston
Abstract: We investigate fermion liquids interacting with longitudinal and transverse abelian gauge fields via bosonization. In two spatial dimensions we obtain the fermion propagator for the specific case of a Coulomb plus Chern-Simons gauge action. We discuss the relevance of this result to the Halperin-Lee-Read theory of the $\nu =1/2$ Landau level and demonstrate how Kohn's theorem is satisfied.
