Title: Wilson Loops and Black Holes in 2+1 Dimensions
Authors: Cenalo Vaz and Louis Witten
Abstract: In 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons gravity, Wilson loops in the three dimensional Anti de Sitter group, $SO(2,2)$, reproduce the spinning black hole of Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) by naturally duplicating the necessary identification of points of a four dimensional globally $SO(2,2)$ invariant space in which the hole appears as an embedding.
