Title: Conformal symmetry of the coupled Chern-Simons and gauged nonlinear  Schr√∂dinger equations
Authors: C. Duval and P. A. Horvathy and L. Palla
Abstract: The non-relativistic conformal symmetry found by Jackiw and Pi for the coupled Chern-Simons and gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in the plane is derived in a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein framework.
