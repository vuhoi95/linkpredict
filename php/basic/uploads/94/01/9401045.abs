Title: A Lower Estimate for the Modified Steiner Functional
Authors: G. K. Savvidy and R. Schneider
Abstract: We prove inequality (1) for the modified Steiner functional A(M), which extends the notion of the integral of mean curvature for convex surfaces.We also establish an exression for A(M) in terms of an integral over all hyperplanes intersecting the polyhedralral surface M.
