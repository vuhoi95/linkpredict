Title: Spin Content of the Quantum Soliton
Authors: A. Dubikovsky and K. Sveshnikov
Abstract: The classical soliton solution, quantized by means of suitable translational and rotational collective coordinates, is embedded into the one-particle irreductible representation of the Poincare group corresponding to a definite spin. It is shown, that within the conventional quasiclassical expansion such embedding leads to a set of nontrivial consistency conditions imposed on the classical solution. The validity of these relations is considered for a number of soliton models in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions.
