Title: Quantum Field Theory with Null-Fronted Metrics
Authors: Orit Levin and Asher Peres
Abstract: There is a large class of classical null-fronted metrics in which a free scalar field has an infinite number of conservation laws. In particular, if the scalar field is quantized, the number of particles is conserved. However, with more general null-fronted metrics, field quantization cannot be interpreted in terms of particle creation and annihilation operators, and the physical meaning of the theory becomes obscure.
