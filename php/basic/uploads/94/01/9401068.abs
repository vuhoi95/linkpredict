Title: Diffeomorphisms of the Klein Bottle and Projective Plane
Authors: J. S. Apps and J. S. Dowker
Abstract: We calculate the Riemann curvature tensor and sectional curvature for the Lie group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the Klein bottle and projective plane. In particular, we investigate the sign of the sectional curvature, and find a possible disagreement with a theorem of Lukatskii. We suggest an amendment to this theorem.
