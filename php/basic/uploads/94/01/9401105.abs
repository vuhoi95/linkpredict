Title: Bosonization as Duality
Authors: C. P. Burgess and F. Quevedo
Abstract: We show that bosonization in two dimensions can be derived as a special case of the duality transformations that have recently been used to good effect in string theory. This allows the construction of the bosonic counterpart of any fermionic theory simply by `following your nose' using the standard duality transformation rules. We work through the bosonization of the Dirac fermion, the massive and massless Thirring models, and a fermion on a cylindrical spacetime as illustrative examples.
