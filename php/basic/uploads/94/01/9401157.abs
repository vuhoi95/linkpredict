Title: Theory of Loops and Strings with Matter in the Adjoint Representation
Authors: Jnanadeva Maharana and Lambodhar P. Singh
Abstract: We have presented canonical and path integral formulations of a theory of loops and closed strings with the matter field quanta transforming in the adjoint representation of the SU(N) gauge group. The physical processes arising out of the interactions of loops and closed strings are discussed.
