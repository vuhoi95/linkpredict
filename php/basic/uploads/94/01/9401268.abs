Title: Effectively Semi-Relativistic Hamiltonians of Nonrelativistic Form
Authors: Wolfgang Lucha and Franz F. Sch√∂berl and Michael Moser
Abstract: We construct effective Hamiltonians which despite their apparently nonrelativistic form incorporate relativistic effects by involving parameters which depend on the relevant momentum. For some potentials the corresponding energy eigenvalues may be determined analytically. Applied to two-particle bound states, it turns out that in this way a nonrelativistic treatment may indeed be able to simulate relativistic effects. Within the framework of hadron spectroscopy, this lucky circumstance may be an explanation for the sometimes extremely good predictions of nonrelativistic potential models even in relativistic regions.
