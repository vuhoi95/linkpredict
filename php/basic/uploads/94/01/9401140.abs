Title: Symmetries of the Chern-Simons Theory in the Axial Gauge, Manifold with  Boundary
Authors: S. Emery and O. Piguet
Abstract: The field equations of the Chern-Simons theory quantized in the axial gauge are shown to be completely determined by supersymmetry Ward identities which express the invariance of the theory under the topological supersymmetry of Delduc, Gieres and Sorella together with the usual Slavnov identity without requiring any action principle.
