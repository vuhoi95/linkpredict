Title: Elliptic Calogero-Moser system from two dimensional current algebra
Authors: Alexander Gorsky and Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We show that elliptic Calogero-Moser system and its Lax operator found by Krichever can be obtained by Hamiltonian reduction from the integrable Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle to the central extension of the algebra of SL(N,C) currents.Elliptic deformation of Yang-Mills theory is presented.
