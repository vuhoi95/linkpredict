Title: Anomalies and Wess-Zumino Terms in an Extended, Regularized  Field-Antifield Formalism
Authors: Joaquim Gomis and Jordi Par√≠s
Abstract: Quantization of anomalous gauge theories with closed, irreducible gauge algebra within the extended Field-Antifield formalism is further pursued. Using a Pauli-Villars (PV) regularization of the generating functional at one loop level, an alternative form for the anomaly is found which involves only the regulator. The analysis of this expression allows to conclude that recently found ghost number one cocycles with nontrivial antifield dependence can not appear in PV regularization. Afterwards, the extended Field-Antifield formalism is further completed by incorporating quantum effects of the extra variables, i.e., by explicitly taking into account the regularization of the extra sector. In this context, invariant PV regulators are constructed from non-invariant ones, leading to an alternative interpretation of the Wess-Zumino action as the local counterterm relating invariant and non-invariant regularizations. Finally, application of the above ideas to the bosonic string reproduces the well-known Liouville action and the shift $(26-D)\rightarrow(25-D)$ at one loop.
