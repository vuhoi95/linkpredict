Title: A consistent derivation of the quark--antiquark and three quark  potentials in a Wilson loop context
Authors: N. Brambilla and P. Consoli and G. M. Prosperi
Abstract: In this paper we give a new derivation of the quark-antiquark potential in the Wilson loop context. This makes more explicit the approximations involved and enables an immediate extension to the three-quark case. In the $q\overline{q}$ case we find the same semirelativistic potential obtained in preceding papers but for a question of ordering. In the $3q$ case we find a spin dependent potential identical to that already derived in the literature from the ad hoc and non correct assumption of scalar confinement. Furthermore we obtain the correct form of the spin independent potential up to the $1/m^2$ order.
