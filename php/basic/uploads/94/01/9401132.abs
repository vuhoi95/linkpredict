Abstract: A consistent procedure of canonical quantization of pseudoclassical model for spin one relativistic particle is considered. Two approaches to treat the quantization for the massless case are discussed, the limit of the massive case and independent quantization of a modified action. Quantum mechanics constructed for the massive case proves to be equivalent to the Proca theory and for massless case to the Maxwell theory. Results obtained are compared with ones for the case of spinning (spin one half) particle.
