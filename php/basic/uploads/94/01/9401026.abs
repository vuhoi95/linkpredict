Title: Phase Structure of Four Dimensional Simplicial Quantum Gravity
Authors: S. Catterall and J. Kogut and R. Renken
Abstract: We present the results of a high statistics Monte Carlo study of a model for four dimensional euclidean quantum gravity based on summing over triangulations. We show evidence for two phases; in one there is a logarithmic scaling on the mean linear extent with volume, whilst the other exhibits power law behaviour with exponent 1/2. We are able to extract a finite size scaling exponent governing the growth of the susceptibility peak
