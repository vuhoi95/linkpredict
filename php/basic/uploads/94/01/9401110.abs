Title: Diffeomorphisms Versus Non Abelian Gauge Transformations: An Example of  1+1 Dimensional Gravity
Authors: P. Schaller and T. Strobl
Abstract: We investigate the phase space of a typical model of 1+1 dimensional gravity (Jackiw-Teitelboim model with cylindrical topology) using its reformulation as a non abelian gauge theory based on the sl(2,R) algebra. Modifying the conventional approach we argue that one should take the universal covering of SL(2,R) rather than PSL(2,R) as the gauge group of the theory. We discuss the consequences for the quantization of the model and find that the spectrum of the Dirac observables is sensible to this modification. Our analysis further provides an example for a gravity theory where the standard Hamiltonian formulation identifies gravitationally inequivalent solutions.
