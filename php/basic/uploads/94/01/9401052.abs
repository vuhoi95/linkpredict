Authors: N. N. Nikolaev and B. G. Zakharov and V. R. Zoller
Abstract: The colour dipole cross section is the principal quantity in the lightcone $s$-channel description of the diffractive scattering. Recently we have shown that the dipole cross section satisfies the generalized BFKL equation. In this paper we discuss properties and solutions of our generalized BFKL equation with allowance for the finite gluon correlation radius $R_{c}$. The latter is introduced in a gauge invariant manner. We present estimates of the intercept of the pomeron and find the asymptotic form of the dipole cross section.
