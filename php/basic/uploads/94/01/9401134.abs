Title: High energy scattering in 2+1 QCD
Authors: Miao Li and Chung-I Tan
Abstract: High energy scattering in 2+1 QCD is studied using the recent approach of Verlinde and Verlinde. We calculate the color singlet part of the quark-quark scattering exactly within this approach, and discuss some physical implication of this result. We also demonstrate, by two independent methods, that reggeization fails for the color singlet channel. We briefly comment on the problem in 3+1 QCD.
