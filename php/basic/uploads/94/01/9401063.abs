Title: Ordering, symbols, and finite-dimensional approximations of path  integrals
Authors: T. Kashiwa and S. Sakoda and S. V. Zenkin
Abstract: We derive general form of finite-dimensional approximations of path integrals for both bosonic and fermionic canonical systems in terms of symbols of operators determined by operator ordering. We argue that for a system with a given quantum Hamiltonian such approximations are independent of the type of symbols up to terms of $O(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is infinitesimal time interval determining the accuracy of the approximations. A new class of such approximations is found for both c-number and Grassmannian dynamical variables. The actions determined by the approximations are non-local and have no classical continuum limit except the cases of $pq$- and $qp$-ordeeing. As an explicit example the fermionic oscillator is considered in detail.
