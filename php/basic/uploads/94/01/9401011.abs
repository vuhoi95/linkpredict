Abstract: We investigate chaotic inflation models with two scalar fields, such that one field (the inflaton) rolls while the other is trapped in a false vacuum state. The false vacuum becomes unstable when the inflaton field falls below some critical value, and a first or second order transition to the true vacuum ensues. Particular attention is paid to Linde's second-order `Hybrid Inflation'; with the false vacuum dominating, inflation differs from the usual true vacuum case both in its cosmology and in its relation to particle physics. The spectral index of the adiabatic density perturbation can be very close to 1, or it can be around ten percent higher. The energy scale at the end of inflation can be anywhere between $10^{16}$\,GeV and $10^{11}$\,GeV, though reheating is prompt so the reheat temperature can't be far below $10^{11}\,$GeV. Topological defects are almost inevitably produced at the end of inflation, and if the inflationary energy scale is near its upper limit they can have significant effects. Because false vacuum inflation occurs with the inflaton field far below the Planck scale, it is easier to implement in the context of supergravity than standard chaotic inflation. That the inflaton mass is small compared with the inflationary Hubble parameter is still a problem for generic supergravity theories, but remarkably this can be avoided in a natural way for a class of supergravity models which follow from orbifold compactification of superstrings. This opens up the prospect of a truly realistic, superstring
