Title: When q=0, The Forced Harmonic Oscillator Isn't
Authors: J. W. Goodison and D. J. Toms
Abstract: We consider the forced harmonic oscillator quantized according to infinite statistics ( a special case of the `quon' algebra proposed by Greenberg ). We show that in order for the statistics to be consistently evolved the forcing term must be identically zero for all time. Hence only the free harmonic oscillator may be quantized according to infinite statistics.
