Title: A Study of Fermions Coupled to Gauge and Gravitational Fields on a  Cylinder
Authors: R. P. Lano and V. G. J. Rodgers
Abstract: Fermions on a cylinder coupled to gravity and gauge fields are examined by studying the geometric action associated with the symmetries of such a system. The gauge coupling constant is shown to be constrained and the effect of gravity on the masses is discussed. Furthermore, we introduce a new gravitational theory which couples to the fermions by promoting the coadjoint vector of the diffeomorphism sector to a dynamical variable. This system, together with the gauge sector is shown to be equivalent to a one dimensional system.
