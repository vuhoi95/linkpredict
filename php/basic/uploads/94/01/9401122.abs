Title: Abelian Chern-Simons field theory and anyon equation on a cylinder
Authors: Kyung-Hyun Cho and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: We present the anyon equation on a cylinder and in an infinite potential wall from the abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to non-relativistic matter field by obtaining the effective hamiltonian through the canonical transformation method used for the theory on a plane and on a torus. We also give the periodic property of the theory on the cylinder.
