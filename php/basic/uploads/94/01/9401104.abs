Title: Exact renormalization group equation and decoupling in quantum field  theory
Authors: L. Girardello and A. Zaffaroni
Abstract: New proves of decoupling of massive fields in several quantum field theories are derived in the effective Lagrangian approach based on Wilson renormalization group. In the most interesting case of gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the approach, combined with the quantum action principle, leads to a rather simple proof to all orders.
