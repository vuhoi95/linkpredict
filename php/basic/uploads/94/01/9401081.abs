Title: Black Hole Evaporation and Quantum Gravity
Authors: K. Schoutens and E. Verlinde and H. Verlinde
Abstract: In this note we consider some consequences of quantum gravity on the process of black hole evaporation. In particular, we will explain the suggestion by 't Hooft that quantum gravitational interactions effectively exclude simultaneous measurements of the Hawking radiation and of the matter falling into the black hole. The complementarity of these measurements is supported by the fact that the commutators between the corresponding observables can be shown to grow uncontrollably large. The only assumption that is needed to obtain this result is that the creation and annihilation modes of the in-falling and out-going matter act in the same Hilbert space. We further illustrate this phenomenon in the context of two-dimensional dilaton gravity.
