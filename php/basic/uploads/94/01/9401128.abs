Title: Generalized Statistics and Dynamics in Curved Spacetime
Authors: V. Bardek and S. Meljanac and A. Perica
Abstract: We consider the generalized momentum-depending quon algebra in a dynamically evolving curved spacetime and perform a type of analysis similar to that of J.W.Goodison and D.J.Toms. We find that, at least in principle, all kinds of statistics may occur in some regions, i.e. phases in momentum space, depending on Bogoliubov coefficients determined by a specific dynamical model.
