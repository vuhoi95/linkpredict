Title: Area-preserving structure of 2d-gravity
Authors: D. R. Karakhanyan and R. P. Manvelyan and R. L. Mkrtchyan
Abstract: The effective action for 2d-gravity with manifest area-preserving invariance is obtained in the flat and in the general gravitational background. The cocyclic properties of the last action are proved, and generalizations on higher dimensions are discussed.
