Title: A Left-Right Symmetric Model a la Connes-Lott
Authors: Bruno Iochum and Thomas Schucker
Abstract: We present a left-right symmetric model with gauge group $U(@)_L\times U(@)_R$ in the Connes-Lott non-commutative frame work. Its gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously, parity remains unbroken.
