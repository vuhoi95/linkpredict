Title: Vortices in Bogomol'nyi Limit of Einstein Maxwell Higgs Theory with or  without External Sources
Authors: Chanju Kim and Yoonbai Kim
Abstract: The Abelian Higgs model with or without external particles is considered in curved space. Using the dual transformation, we rewrite the model in terms of dual gauge fields and derive the Bogomol'nyi-type bound. We examine cylindrically symmetric solutions to Einstein equations and the first-order Bogomol'nyi equations, and find vortex solutions and vortex-particle composites which lie on the spatial manifold with global geometry described by a cylinder asymptotically or a two sphere in addition to the well-known cone.
