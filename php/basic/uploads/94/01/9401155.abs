Title: Physical States in Canonically Quantized Supergravity
Authors: Sean M. Carroll and Daniel Z. Freedman and Miguel E. Ortiz and Don N. Page
Abstract: We discuss the canonical quantization of $N=1$ supergravity in the functional Schrodinger representation. Although the form of the supersymmetry constraints suggests that there are solutions of definite order $n$ in the fermion fields, we show that there are no such states for any finite $n$. For $n=0$, a simple scaling argument definitively excludes the purely bosonic states discussed by D'Eath. For $n>0$, the argument is based on a mode expansion of the gravitino field on the quantization 3-surface. It is thus suggested that physical states in supergravity have infinite Grassmann number. This is confirmed for the free spin-3/2 field, for which we find that states satisfying the gauge constraints contain an infinite product of fermion mode operators.
