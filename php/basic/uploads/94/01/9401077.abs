Authors: Tatsuhiro Nakajima and Hirofumi Yamada
Abstract: Basic representations of A_{2l}^(2) and D_{l+1}^(2) are studied. The weight vectors are represented in terms of Schur's $Q$-functions. The method to get the polynomial solutions to the reduced BKP hierarchies is shown to be equivalent to a certain rule in Maya game.
