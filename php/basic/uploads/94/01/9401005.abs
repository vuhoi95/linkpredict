Title: Q-Exact Actions for BF Theories
Authors: R. Brooks and C. Lucchesi
Abstract: The actions for all classical (and consequently quantum) $BF$ theories on $n$-manifolds is proven to be given by anti-commutators of hermitian, nilpotent, scalar fermionic charges with Grassmann-odd functionals. In order to show this, the space of fields in the theory must be enlarged to include ``mass terms'' for new, non-dynamical, Grassmann-odd fields. The implications of this result on observables are examined.
