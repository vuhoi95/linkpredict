Title: Comments on SUSY inflation models on the brane
Authors: Lu-Yun Lee and Kingman Cheung and Chia-Min Lin
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of inflation models on the brane where the dominant part of the inflaton scalar potential does not depend on the inflaton field value during inflation. In particular, we consider supernatural inflation, its hilltop version, A-term inflation, and supersymmetric (SUSY) D- and F-term hybrid inflation on the brane. We show that the parameter space can be broadened, the inflation scale generally can be lowered, and still possible to have the spectral index $n_s=0.96$.
