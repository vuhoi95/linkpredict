Title: Quasideterminant solutions of an integrable chiral model in two  dimensions
Authors: Bushra Haider and M Hassan
Abstract: The Darboux transformation is used to obtain multisoliton solutions of the chiral model in two dimensions. The matrix solutions of the principal chiral model and its Lax pair are expressed in terms of quasideterminants. The iteration of the Darboux transformation gives the quasideterminant multisoliton solutions of the model. It has been shown that the quasideterminant multisoliton solution of the chiral model is the same as obtained by Zakharov and Mikhailov using the dressing method based on the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem.
