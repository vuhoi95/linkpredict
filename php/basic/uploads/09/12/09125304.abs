Title: A Quintom scenario with mixed kinetic terms
Authors: Emmanuel N. Saridakis and Joel M. Weller
Abstract: We examine an extension of the quintom scenario of dark energy, in which a canonical scalar field and a phantom field are coupled through a kinetic interaction. We perform a phase space analysis and show that the kinetic coupling gives rise to novel cosmological behaviour. In particular, we obtain both quintessence-like and phantom-like late-time solutions, as well as solutions that cross the phantom divide during the evolution of the universe.
