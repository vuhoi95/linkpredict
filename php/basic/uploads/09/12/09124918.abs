Abstract: We attack the long-standing problem of finding the AdS dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD, the N=2 super Yang Mills theory with gauge group SU(N_c) and N_f = 2 N_c fundamental hyper multiplets. The theory admits a Veneziano expansion of large N_c and large N_f, with N_f/N_c and lambda = g^2 N_c kept fixed. The topological structure of large N diagrams motivates a general conjecture: the flavor-singlet sector of a gauge theory in the Veneziano limit is dual to a closed string theory; single closed string states correspond to "generalized single-trace" operators, where adjoint letters and flavor-contracted fundamental/antifundamental pairs are stringed together in a closed chain. We look for the string dual of N = 2 superconformal QCD from two fronts. From the bottom-up, we perform a systematic analysis of the protected spectrum using superconformal representation theory. We also evaluate the one-loop dilation operator in the scalar sector, finding a novel spin chain. From the top-down, we consider the decoupling limit of known brane constructions. In both approaches, more insight is gained by viewing the theory as the degenerate limit of the N = 2 Z_2 orbifold of N = 4 SYM, as one of the two gauge couplings is tuned to zero. A consistent picture emerges. We conclude that the string dual is a sub-critical background with seven "geometric" dimensions, containing both an AdS_5 and an S^1 factor. The supergravity approximation is never entirely valid, even for large lambda, indeed the field theory has an exponential degeneracy of exactly protected states with higher spin, which must be dual to a sector of light string states.
