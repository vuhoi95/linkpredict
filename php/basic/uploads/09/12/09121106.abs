Title: Geometric modular action for disjoint intervals and boundary conformal  field theory
Authors: Roberto Longo and Pierre Martinetti and Karl-Henning Rehren
Abstract: In suitable states, the modular group of local algebras associated with unions of disjoint intervals in chiral conformal quantum field theory acts geometrically. We translate this result into the setting of boundary conformal QFT and interpret it as a relation between temperature and acceleration. We also discuss aspects ("mixing" and "charge splitting") of geometric modular action for unions of disjoint intervals in the vacuum state.
