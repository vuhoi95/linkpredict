Title: Quantum Wall Crossing in N=2 Gauge Theories
Authors: Tudor Dimofte and Sergei Gukov and Yan Soibelman
Abstract: We study refined and motivic wall-crossing formulas in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with SU(2) gauge group and N_f < 4 matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. Such gauge theories provide an excellent testing ground for the conjecture that "refined = motivic."
