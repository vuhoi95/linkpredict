Title: Hypermoduli Stabilization, Flux Attractors, and Generating Functions
Authors: Finn Larsen and Ross O'Connell and Daniel Robbins
Abstract: We study stabilization of hypermoduli with emphasis on the effects of generalized fluxes. We find a class of no-scale vacua described by ISD conditions even in the presence of geometric flux. The associated flux attractor equations can be integrated by a generating function with the property that the hypermoduli are determined by a simple extremization principle. We work out several orbifold examples where all vector moduli and many hypermoduli are stabilized, with VEVs given explicitly in terms of fluxes.
