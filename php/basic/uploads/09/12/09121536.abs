Authors: K. Karami and M. S. Khaledian and F. Felegary and Z. Azarmi
Abstract: We study the correspondence between the tachyon, K-essence and dilaton scalar field models with the interacting new agegraphic dark energy model in the non-flat FRW universe. We reconstruct the potentials and the dynamics for these scalar field models, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe.
