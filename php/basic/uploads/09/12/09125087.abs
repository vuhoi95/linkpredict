Title: Kappa-deformed Snyder spacetime
Authors: S. Meljanac and D. Meljanac and A. Samsarov and M. Stojic
Abstract: We present Lie-algebraic deformations of Minkowski space with undeformed Poincare algebra. These deformations interpolate between Snyder and kappa-Minkowski space. We find realizations of noncommutative coordinates in terms of commutative coordinates and derivatives. Deformed Leibniz rule, the coproduct structure and star product are found. Special cases, particularly Snyder and kappa-Minkowski in Maggiore-type realizations are discussed. Our construction leads to a new class of deformed special relativity theories.
