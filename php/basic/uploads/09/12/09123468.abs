Title: Poisson Structures of Calogero-Moser and Ruijsenaars-Schneider Models
Authors: InÃªs Aniceto and Jean Avan and Antal Jevicki
Abstract: We examine the Hamiltonian structures of some Calogero-Moser and Ruijsenaars-Schneider N-body integrable models. We propose explicit formulations of the bihamiltonian structures for the discrete models, and field-theoretical realizations of these structures. We discuss the relevance of these realizations as collective-field theory for the discrete models.
