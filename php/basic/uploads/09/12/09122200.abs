Title: Nonabelian N=2 Superstrings
Authors: A. P. Isaev and E. A. Ivanov
Abstract: The Green-Schwarz covariant N=2 superstring action can be consistently deduced as the action of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) sigma model defined on the direct product of two N=1, D=10 Poincar\'e supertranslation groups. Generalizing this result, we construct new WZW sigma models on the supergroups with a nonabelian even part and interpret them as models of superstrings moving on the supergroup manifolds. We show that these models are completely integrable and in some special cases possess fermionic kappa-symmetry.
