Title: Non-abelian D=11 Supermembrane
Authors: M. P. Garcia del Moral and A. Restuccia
Abstract: We obtain a U(M) action for supermembranes with central charges in the Light Cone Gauge (LCG). The theory realizes all of the symmetries and constraints of the supermembrane together with the invariance under a U(M) gauge group with M arbitrary. The worldvolume action has (LCG) N=8 supersymmetry and it corresponds to M parallel supermembranes minimally immersed on the target M9xT2 (MIM2). In order to ensure the invariance under the symmetries and to close the corresponding algebra, a star-product determined by the central charge condition is introduced. It is constructed with a nonconstant symplectic two-form where curvature terms are also present. The theory is in the strongly coupled gauge-gravity regime. At low energies, the theory enters in a decoupling limit and it is described by an ordinary N=8 SYM in the IR phase for any number of M2-branes.
