Abstract: We discuss the cosmological reconstruction in modified Gauss-Bonnet and F(R) gravities. Two alternative representations of the action (with and without auxiliary scalar) are considered. The approximate description of deceleration-acceleration transition cosmologies is reconstructed. It is shown that cosmological solution containing Big Bang and Big Rip singularities may be reconstructed only using the representation with the auxiliary field. The analytical description of the deceleration-acceleration transition cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity is demonstrated to be impossible at sufficiently general conditions.
