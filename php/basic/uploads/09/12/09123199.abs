Abstract: We explore the integrability of five-dimensional minimal supergravity in the presence of three commuting Killing vectors. We argue that to see the integrability structure of the theory one necessarily has to perform an Ehlers reduction to two dimensions. A direct dimensional reduction to two dimensions does not allow us to see the integrability of the theory in an easy way. This situation is in contrast with vacuum five-dimensional gravity. We derive the Belinski-Zakharov (BZ) Lax pair for minimal supergravity based on a symmetric 7x7 coset representative matrix for the coset G2/(SL(2,R) x SL(2,R)). We elucidate the relationship between our BZ Lax pair and the group theoretic Lax pair previously known in the literature. The BZ Lax pair allows us to generalize the well-known BZ dressing method to five-dimensional minimal supergravity. We show that the action of the three-dimensional hidden symmetry transformations on the BZ dressing method is simply the group action on the BZ vectors. As an illustration of our formalism, we obtain the doubly spinning five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole by applying solitonic transformations on the Schwarzschild black hole. We also derive the Cvetic-Youm black hole by applying solitonic transformations on the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.
