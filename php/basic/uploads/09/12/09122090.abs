Title: Holography and wormholes in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Kostas Skenderis and Balt C. van Rees
Abstract: We provide a holographic interpretation of a class of three-dimensional wormhole spacetimes. These spacetimes have multiple asymptotic regions which are separated from each other by horizons. Each such region is isometric to the BTZ black hole and there is non-trivial spacetime topology hidden behind the horizons. We show that application of the real-time gauge/gravity duality results in a complete holographic description of these spacetimes with the dual state capturing the non-trivial topology behind the horizons. We also show that these spacetimes are in correspondence with trivalent graphs and provide an explicit metric description with all physical parameters appearing in the metric.
