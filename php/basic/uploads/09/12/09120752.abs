Title: Baryon charge from embedding topology and a continuous meson spectrum in  a new holographic gauge theory
Authors: Mark Van Raamsdonk and Kevin Whyte
Abstract: We study a new holographic gauge theory based on probe D4-branes in the background dual to D4-branes on a circle with antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions. Field theory configurations with baryons correspond to smooth embeddings of the probe D4-branes with nontrivial winding around an S^4 in the geometry. As a consequence, physics of baryons and nuclei can be studied reliably in this model using the abelian Born-Infeld action. However, surprisingly, we find that the meson spectrum is not discrete. This is related to a curious result that the action governing small fluctuations of the gauge field on the probe brane is the five-dimensional Maxwell action in Minkowski space despite the non-trivial embedding of the probe brane in the curved background geometry.
