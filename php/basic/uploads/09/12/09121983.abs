Title: Effect of Coulomb interaction on the gap in monolayer and bilayer  graphene
Authors: Andreas Sinner and Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We study effects of a repulsive Coulomb interaction on the spectral gap in monolayer and bilayer graphene in the vicinity of the charge neutrality point by employing the functional renormalization-group technique. In both cases Coulomb interaction supports the gap once it is open. For monolayer graphene we correctly reproduce results obtained previously by several authors, e.g., an apparent logarithmic divergence of the Fermi velocity and the gap as well as a fixed point corresponding to a quantum phase transition at infinitely large Coulomb interaction. On the other hand, we show that the gap introduces an additional length scale at which renormalization flow of diverging quantities saturates. An analogous analysis is also performed for bilayer graphene with similar results. We find an additional fixed point in the gapless regime with linear spectrum corresponding to the vanishing electronic band mass. This fixed point is unstable with respect to gap fluctuations and can not be reached as soon as the gap is opened. This preserves the quadratic scaling of the spectrum and finite electronic band mass.
