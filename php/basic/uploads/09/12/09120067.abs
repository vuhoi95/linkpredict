Title: Noether Symmetry Approach in multiple scalar fields Scenario
Authors: Yi Zhang and Yun-gui Gong and Zong-Hong Zhu
Abstract: In this Letter, we find suitable potentials in the multiple scalar fields scenario by using the Noether symmetry approach. We discussed three models with multiple scalar fields: N-quintessence with positive kinetic terms, N-phantom with negative kinetic terms and N-quintom with both positive and negative kinetic terms. In the N-quintessence case, the exponential potential which could be derived from several theoretic models is obtained from the Noether conditions. In the N-phantom case, the potential $\frac{V_{0}}{2}(1-\cos(\sqrt{\frac{3N}{2}}\frac{\phi}{m_{pl}}))$, which could be derived from the Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson model, is chosen as the Noether conditions required. In the N-quintom case, we derive a relation $DV'_{\phi q}=-\tilde{D}V'_{\phi p}$ between the potential forms for the quintessence-like fields and the phantom-like fields by using the Noether symmetry.
