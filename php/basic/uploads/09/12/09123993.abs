Abstract: We find wide class of exact solutions of Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory coupled to an external source, in terms of doubly periodic Jacobi elliptic functions. The obtained solutions include localized solitons, trigonometric solutions, pure cnoidal waves, and singular solutions in certain parameter range. Furthermore, it is observed that these solutions exist over a nonzero background.
