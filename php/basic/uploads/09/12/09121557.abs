Title: Gauge coupling flux thresholds, exotic matter and the unification scale  in F-SU(5) GUT
Authors: G. K. Leontaris and N. D. Tracas
Abstract: We explore the gauge coupling relations and the unification scale in F-theory SU(5) GUT broken down to the Standard Model by an internal U(1)Y gauge flux. We consider variants with exotic matter representations which may appear in these constructions and investigate their role in the effective field theory model. We make a detailed investigation on the conditions imposed on the extraneous matter to raise the unification scale and make the color triplets heavy in order to avoid fast proton decay. We also discuss in brief the implications on the gaugino masses.
