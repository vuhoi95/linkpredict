Title: Results in Kalb-Ramond field localization and resonances on deformed  branes
Authors: W. T. Cruz and M. O. Tahim and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We make an analysis about several aspects of localization of the Kalb-Ramond gauge field in a specific four dimensional AdS membrane embedded in a five dimensional space-time. The membrane is generated from a deformation of the $\lambda \phi^4$ potential and belongs to a new class of defect solutions. In this context we find resonance structures in the analysis of massive modes. The study of deformed defects is important because they contain internal structures and these may have implications to the way the background space-time is constructed and the way its curvature behaves. The main objective here is to observe the contributions of the deformation procedure to the resonances and the well known field localization methods.
