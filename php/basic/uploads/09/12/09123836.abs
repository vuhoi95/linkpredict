Title: N=(0,2) Deformation of the N=(2,2) Wess-Zumino Model in Two Dimensions
Authors: M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We construct a simple N=(0,2) deformation of the two-dimensional Wess-Zumino model. In addition to superpotential, it includes a "twisted" superpotential. Supersymmetry may or may not be spontaneously broken at the classical level. In the latter case an extra right-handed fermion field \zeta_R involved in the N=(0,2) deformation plays the role of Goldstino.
