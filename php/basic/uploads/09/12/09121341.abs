Abstract: We present a simple two-field model of inflation and show how to embed it in string theory as a straightforward generalization of axion monodromy models. Phenomenologically, the predictions are equivalent to those of chaotic inflation, and in particular include observably large tensor modes. The whole high-scale large-field inflationary dynamics takes place within a region of field space that is parametrically subplanckian in diameter, hence improving our ability to control quantum corrections and achieve slow-roll inflation.
