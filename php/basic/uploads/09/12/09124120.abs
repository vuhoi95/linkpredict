Title: Worldline Approach to QFT on Manifolds with Boundary
Authors: F. Bastianelli and O. Corradini and P. A. G. Pisani and C. Schubert
Abstract: We use the image charge method to compute the trace of the heat kernel for a scalar field on a flat manifold with boundary, representing the trace by means of a worldline path integral and obtain useful non-iterative master formulae for n insertions of the scalar potential. We discuss possible extensions of the method.
