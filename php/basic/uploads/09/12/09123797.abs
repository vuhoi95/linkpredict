Title: Implications of the CDMS result on Dark Matter and LHC physics
Authors: M. Kadastik and K. Kannike and A. Racioppi and M. Raidal
Abstract: The requirements of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and correct thermal relic density of Dark Matter (DM) predict large spin-independent direct detection cross section in scalar DM models based on underlying SO(10) non-supersymmetric GUT. Interpreting the CDMS signal events as DM recoil on nuclei, we study implications of this assumption on EWSB, Higgs boson mass and direct production of scalar DM at LHC experiments. We show that this interpretation indicates relatively light DM, M_DM ~ O(100) GeV, with large pair production cross section at LHC in correlation with the spin-independent direct DM detection cross section. The next-to-lightest dark scalar S_NL is predicted to be long-lived, providing distinctive experimental signatures of displaced vertex of two leptons or jets plus missing transverse energy.
