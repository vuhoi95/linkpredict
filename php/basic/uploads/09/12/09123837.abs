Title: Fsusy and Field Theoretical Construction
Authors: M. B. Sedra and J. Zerouaoui
Abstract: Following our previous work on fractional spin symmetries (FSS) \cite{6, 7}, we consider here the construction of field theoretical models that are invariant under the $D=2(1/3,1/3)$ supersymmetric algebra.
