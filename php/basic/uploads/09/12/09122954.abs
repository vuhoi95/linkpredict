Title: A note on the velocity of holographic long-lived mesons
Authors: Jonathan P. Shock and Javier Tarrio
Abstract: We study fluctuations of a U(1) gauge field on the worldvolume of Nf probe D7-branes in the background of Nc black D3-branes with a finite baryon density. The choice of mode corresponds to vector mesons in the dual gauge theory whose mass and lifetime can be determined by a study of the quasinormal modes. The speed of propagation of these holographic mesons at large momenta is studied from the dispersion relations of the quasinormal modes of the system.
