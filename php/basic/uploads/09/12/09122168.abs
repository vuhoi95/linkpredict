Title: Flux dualization in broken SU(2)
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: An SU(2) gauge theory is broken to U(1) by an adjoint scalar to produce magnetic monopoles. At a lower scale, this U(1) is further broken by a fundamental scalar to produce tubes of magnetic flux. We dualize the resulting theory to write an effective theory in terms of the macroscopic string variables. The monopoles are attached to the ends of the strings, and the flux is confined in the tubes.
