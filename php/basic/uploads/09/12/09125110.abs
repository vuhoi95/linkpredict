Title: Non-nilpotent complex geometry of nilmanifolds and heterotic  supersymmetry
Authors: Luis Ugarte and Raquel Villacampa
Abstract: We classify non-nilpotent complex structures on 6-nilmanifolds and their associated invariant balanced metrics. As an application we find a large family of solutions of the heterotic supersymmetry equations with non-zero flux, non-flat instanton and constant dilaton satisfying the anomaly cancellation condition with respect to the Chern connection.
