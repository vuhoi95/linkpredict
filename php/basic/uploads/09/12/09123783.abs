Title: The distribution of Omega_k from the scale-factor cutoff measure
Authors: Andrea De Simone and Michael P. Salem
Abstract: Our universe may be contained in one among a diverging number of bubbles that nucleate within an eternally inflating multiverse. A promising measure to regulate the diverging spacetime volume of such a multiverse is the scale-factor cutoff, one feature of which is bubbles are not rewarded for having a longer duration of slow-roll inflation. Thus, depending on the landscape distribution of the number of e-folds of inflation among bubbles like ours, we might hope to measure spacetime curvature. We study a recently proposed cartoon model of inflation in the landscape and find a reasonable chance (about ten percent) that the curvature in our universe is well above the value expected from cosmic variance. Anthropic selection does not strongly select for curvature as small as is observed (relative somewhat larger values), meaning the observational bound on curvature can be used to rule out landscape models that typically give too little inflation.
