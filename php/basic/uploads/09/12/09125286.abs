Title: Axially symmetric solutions in f(R)-gravity
Authors: Salvatore Capozziello and Mariafelicia De Laurentis and Arturo Stabile
Abstract: Axially symmetric solutions for f (R)-gravity can be derived starting from exact spherically sym- metric solutions achieved by Noether symmetries. The method takes advantage of a complex coordi- nate transformation previously developed by Newman and Janis in General Relativity. An example is worked out to show the general validity of the approach. The physical properties of the solution are also considered.
