Title: Eliminating the chiral anomaly via symplectic embedding approach
Authors: A. C. R. Mendes and C. Neves and W. Oliveira
Abstract: The quantization of the chiral Schwinger model $(\chi QED_{2})$ with one-parameter class Faddeevian regularization is hampered by the chiral anomaly, i.e., the Gauss law commutator exhibits Faddeev's anomaly. To overcome this kind of problem, we propose to eliminate this anomaly by embedding the theory through a new gauge-invariant formalism based on the enlargement of the phase space with the introduction of Wess-Zumino(WZ) fields and the symplectic approach. This process opens up a possibility to formulate different, but dynamically equivalent, gauge invariant versions for the model and also gives a geometrical interpretation to the arbitrariness presents on the BFFT and iterative conversion methods. Further, we observe that the elimination of the chiral anomaly imposes a condition on the chiral parameters present on the original model and on the WZ sector.
