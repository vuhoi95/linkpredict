Title: A covariant and gauge invariant formulation of the cosmological  "backreaction"
Authors: M. Gasperini and G. Marozzi and G. Veneziano
Abstract: Using our recent proposal for defining gauge invariant averages we give a general-covariant formulation of the so-called cosmological "backreaction". Our effective covariant equations allow us to describe in explicitly gauge invariant form the way classical or quantum inhomogeneities affect the average evolution of our Universe.
