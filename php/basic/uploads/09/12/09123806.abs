Title: Odderon in baryon-baryon scattering from the AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Emil Avsar and Yoshitaka Hatta and Toshihiro Matsuo
Abstract: Based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we present a holographic description of various C-odd exchanges in high energy baryon-baryon and baryon-antibaryon scattering, and calculate their respective contributions to the difference in the total cross sections. We predict that, due to the warp factor of AdS_5, the total cross section in pp collisions is larger than in p\bar{p} collisions at asymptotically high energies.
