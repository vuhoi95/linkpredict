Title: Note on a NAHE Variation

Abstract: We present a variation of the NAHE-basis for free fermionic heterotic string models. By rotating some of the boundary conditions of the NAHE periodic/anti-periodic fermions {y^m, \bar{y}^m, w^m, \bar{w}^m,}, for m = 1 to 6, associated with the six compact dimensions of a bosonic lattice/orbifold model, we show an additional method for enhancing the standard NAHE gauge group of SO(10) back to E6. This rotation transforms (SO(10) {\otimes} SO(6)^3)_obs {\otimes} (E_8)_hid into (E_6 {\otimes} U(1)^5)_obs {\otimes} SO(22)_hid. When SO(10) is enhanced to E_6 in this manner, the i^{th} MSSM matter generation in the SO(10) 16_i rep, originating in the twisted basis vector b_i, recombines with both its associated untwisted MSSM Higgs in a 10_i rep and an untwisted non-Abelian singlet {\phi}_i, to form a 27_i rep of E_6. Beginning instead with the E6 model, the inverse transformation of the fermion boundary conditions corresponds to partial GUT breaking via boundary rotation. Correspondence between free fermionic models with Z_2 {\otimes} Z_2 twist (especially of the NAHE class) and orbifold models with a similar twist has received further attention recently. Our NAHE variation also involves a Z_2 {\otimes} Z_2 twist and offers additional understanding regarding the free fermion/orbifold correspondence. Further, models based on this NAHE variation offer some different phenomenological features compared to NAHE-based models. In particular, the more compact Z2 {\otimes} Z2 twist of the NAHE variation offers a range of mirror models not possible from NAHE-based models. Examples of such models are presented.
