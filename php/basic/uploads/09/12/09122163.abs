Title: Eight-vertex model and Painlev√© VI equation. II. Eigenvector results
Authors: Vladimir V. Mangazeev and Vladimir V. Bazhanov
Abstract: We study a special anisotropic XYZ-model on a periodic chain of an odd length and conjecture exact expressions for certain components of the ground state eigenvectors. The results are written in terms of tau-functions associated with Picard's elliptic solutions of the Painlev\'e VI equation. Connections with other problems related to the eight-vertex model are briefly discussed.
