Title: Boundary Conditions for Interacting Membranes
Authors: David S. Berman and Malcolm J. Perry and Ergin Sezgin and Daniel C. Thompson
Abstract: We investigate supersymmetric boundary conditions in both the Bagger-Lambert and the ABJM theories of interacting membranes. We find boundary conditions associated to the fivebrane, the ninebrane and the M-theory wave. For the ABJM theory we are able to understand the enhancement of supersymmetry to produce the (4,4) supersymmetry of the self-dual string. We also include supersymmetric boundary conditions on the gauge fields that cancel the classical gauge anomaly of the Chern-Simons terms.
