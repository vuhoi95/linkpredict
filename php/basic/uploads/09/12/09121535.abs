Title: Positive curvature can mimic a quantum
Authors: J. M. Isidro and J. L. G. Santander and P. Fernandez de Cordoba
Abstract: We elaborate on the existing idea that quantum mechanics is an emergent phenomenon, in the form of a coarse-grained description of some underlying deterministic theory. We apply the Ricci flow as a technical tool to implement dissipation, or information loss, in the passage from an underlying deterministic theory to its emergent quantum counterpart. A key ingedient in this construction is the fact that the space of physically inequivalent quantum states (either pure or mixed) has positive Ricci curvature. This leads us to an interesting thermodynamical analogy of emergent quantum mechanics.
