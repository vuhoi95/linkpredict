Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged black hole solutions of (4+1)-dimensional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory that, for sufficiently low temperature, develop vector hair. Via gauge-gravity duality, these solutions describe a strongly-coupled conformal field theory at finite temperature and density that undergoes a phase transition to a superfluid state with spontaneously broken rotational symmetry (a p-wave superfluid state). The bulk theory has a single free parameter, the ratio of the five-dimensional gravitational constant to the Yang-Mills coupling, which we denote as alpha. Previous analyses have shown that in the so-called probe limit, where alpha goes to zero and hence the gauge fields are ignored in Einstein's equation, the transition to the superfluid state is second order. We construct fully back-reacted solutions, where alpha is finite and the gauge fields are included in Einstein's equation, and find that for values of alpha above a critical value alpha_c = 0.365 +- 0.001, the transition becomes first order.
