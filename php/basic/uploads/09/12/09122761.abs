Title: Comment on "The extremal black hole bomb"
Authors: Shahar Hod and Oded Hod
Abstract: Recently, we have provided an analytical treatment of the phenomena known as the 'black-hole bomb' (arXiv:0910.0734). In particular, we have determined analytically the unstable growing resonances of a massive scalar field in the rotating Kerr black hole spacetime. It was later claimed by J. G. Rosa (arXiv:0912.1780) that the analytic procedure may fail for some values of the field's mass. This claim was based on the concern that some of the Gamma functions that are involved in the analysis may develop poles. In this comment we show by explicit calculations that the Gamma functions which are used are all well behaved near the peak of the black-hole resonances. This fact supports the validity of our previous analytical treatment. We further comment on the regime of validity of some of the approximations used by Rosa.
