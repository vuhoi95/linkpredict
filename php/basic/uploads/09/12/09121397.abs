Title: Multi-Field Inflation from String Theory
Authors: Per Berglund and Guoqin Ren
Abstract: We construct a multi-field inflationary model consisting of multiple K\"ahler moduli derived from type IIB string compactification in the large volume limit. The model consists of both heavy and light fields, with the former being frozen during the inflationary period and the latter acting as the inflaton(s). We study the evolution of all the fields during and after inflation until the preheating era when all the fields oscillate around their vacuum expectation values. Our numerical analysis shows that the curvature perturbations have an almost scale invariant power spectrum with $n_s \simeq 0.96$.
