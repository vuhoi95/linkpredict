Title: Reference Frames and the Physical Gravito-Electromagnetic Analogy
Authors: L. Filipe O. Costa and Carlos A. R. Herdeiro
Abstract: The similarities between linearized gravity and electromagnetism are known since the early days of General Relativity. Using an exact approach based on tidal tensors, we show that such analogy holds only on very special conditions and depends crucially on the reference frame. This places restrictions on the validity of the "gravito-electromagnetic" equations commonly found in the literature.
