Title: On domain wall boundary conditions for the XXZ spin Hamiltonian
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert and Nicolai Reshetikhin
Abstract: In this note, we derive the spectrum of the infinite quantum XXZ spin chain with domain wall boundary conditions. The eigenstates are constructed as limits of Bethe states for the finite XXZ spin chain with quantum sl(2) invariant boundary conditions.
