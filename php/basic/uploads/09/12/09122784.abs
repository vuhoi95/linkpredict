Title: Deformations of Lifshitz holography
Authors: Miranda C. N. Cheng and Sean A. Hartnoll and Cynthia A. Keeler
Abstract: The simplest gravity duals for quantum critical theories with z=2 `Lifshitz' scale invariance admit a marginally relevant deformation. Generic black holes in the bulk describe the field theory with a dynamically generated momentum scale Lambda as well as finite temperature T. We describe the thermodynamics of these black holes in the quantum critical regime where T >> Lambda^2. The deformation changes the asymptotics of the spacetime mildly and leads to intricate UV sensitivities of the theory which we control perturbatively in Lambda^2/T.
