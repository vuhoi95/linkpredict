Title: Geometric Finiteness, Holography and Quasinormal Modes for the Warped  AdS_3 Black Hole
Authors: Kumar S. Gupta and E. Harikumar and Siddhartha Sen and M. Sivakumar
Abstract: We show that there exists a precise kinematical notion of holography for the Euclidean warped $AdS_3$ black hole. This follows from the fact that the Euclidean warped $AdS_3$ black hole spacetime is a geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold. For such manifolds a theorem of Sullivan provides a one-to-one correspondence between the hyperbolic structure in the bulk and the conformal structure of its boundary. Using this theorem we obtain the holographic quasinormal modes for the warped $AdS_3$ black hole.
