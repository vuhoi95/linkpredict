Title: Three-charge 2J black ring
Authors: Dmitri V. Gal'tsov and Nikolai G. Scherbluk
Abstract: Using recently proposed new solution generating technique, we construct the charged version of Pomeranski-Senkov doubly rotating black ring in the $U(1)^3$ five-dimensional supergravity. For arbitrary values of charges the solution is unbalanced, but the Dirac-Misner string is removed when two of the charges are set to zero. In this particular case our solution can be uplifted to some solution of six-dimensional vacuum gravity.
