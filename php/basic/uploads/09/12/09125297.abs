Title: New cosmological constraints on primordial black holes
Authors: B. J. Carr and Kazunori Kohri and Yuuiti Sendouda and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: We update the constraints on the fraction of the Universe going into primordial black holes in the mass range 10^9--10^17 g associated with the effects of their evaporations on big bang nucleosynthesis and the extragalactic photon background. We include for the first time all the effects of quark and gluon emission by black holes on these constraints and account for the latest observational developments. We then discuss the other constraints in this mass range and show that these are weaker than the nucleosynthesis and photon background limits, apart from a small range 10^13--10^14 g, where the damping of cosmic microwave background anisotropies dominates. Finally we review the gravitational and astrophysical effects of nonevaporating primordial black holes, updating constraints over the broader mass range 1--10^50 g.
