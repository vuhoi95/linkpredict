Title: The Cardy-Verlinde formula and entropy of the charged rotating BTZ black  hole
Authors: M. R. Setare and Mubasher Jamil
Abstract: In this paper we show that the entropy of black hole horizon in charged rotating BTZ space-time can be described by the Cardy-Verlinde formula, which is supposed to be an entropy formula of conformal field theory in any dimension.
