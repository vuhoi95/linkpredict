Title: Lorentz Covariant k-Minkowski Spacetime
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Michal Godlinski and Gherardo Piacitelli
Abstract: In recent years, different views on the interpretation of Lorentz covariance of non commuting coordinates were discussed. Here, by a general procedure, we construct the minimal canonical central covariantisation of the k-Minkowski spacetime. We then show that, though the usual k-Minkowski spacetime is covariant under deformed (or twisted) Lorentz action, the resulting framework is equivalent to taking a non covariant restriction of the covariantised model. We conclude with some general comments on the approach of deformed covariance.
