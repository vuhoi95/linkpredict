Title: Conformal Invariance in Einstein-Cartan-Weyl space
Authors: Tae Yoon Moon and Joohan Lee and Phillial Oh
Abstract: We consider conformally invariant form of the actions in Einstein, Weyl, Einstein-Cartan and Einstein-Cartan-Weyl space in general dimensions($>2$) and investigate the relations among them. In Weyl space, the observational consistency condition for the vector field determining non-metricity of the connection can be obtained from the equation of motion. In Einstein-Cartan space a similar role is played by the vector part of the torsion tensor. We consider the case where the trace part of the torsion is the Kalb-Ramond type of field. In this case, we express conformally invariant action in terms of two scalar fields of conformal weight -1, which can be cast into some interesting form. We discuss some applications of the result.
