Abstract: Within the conjectured duality between N=4 super Yang-Mills and Anti-deSitter string theory, the BFKL Pomeron of the gauge theory corresponds to the graviton mode of the dual string. As a first step towards analyzing multigraviton exchange, we investigate R-current six-point functions within the supergravity approximation. We compute the analogue of diffractive scattering, and we analyze the triple Regge limit. In the supergravity approximation the triple graviton vertex is found to vanish.
