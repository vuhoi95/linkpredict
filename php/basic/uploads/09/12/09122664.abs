Title: Competing mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking in a generalized  Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Christian Boehmer and Michael Thies
Abstract: Chiral symmetry of the 2-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model is broken explicitly by a bare mass term as well as a splitting of scalar and pseudo-scalar coupling constants. The vacuum and light hadrons - mesons and baryons which become massless in the chiral limit - are explored analytically in leading order of the derivative expansion by means of a double sine-Gordon equation. Depending on the parameters, this model features new phenomena as compared to previously investigated 4-fermion models: spontaneous breaking of parity, a non-trivial chiral vacuum angle, twisted kink-like baryons whose baryon number reflects the vacuum angle, crystals with alternating baryons, and appearance of a false vacuum.
