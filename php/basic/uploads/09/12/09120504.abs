Title: On AGT conjecture
Authors: V. A. Fateev and A. V. Litvinov
Abstract: In these notes we consider relation between conformal blocks and the Nekrasov partition function of certain $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theories proposed recently by Alday, Gaiotto and Tachikawa. We concentrate on $\mathcal{N}=2^{*}$ theory, which is the simplest example of AGT relation.
