Abstract: In this work we have shown that it is possible to construct non-Abelian field theories employing, in a systematic way, the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic formalism. This approach follows two steps. In the first step, the original Abelian fields are modified in order to introduce the non-Abelian algebra. After that, the Faddeev-Jackiw method is implemented and the gauge symmetry relative to some non-Abelian symmetry group, is introduced through the zero-mode of the symplectic matrix. We construct the SU(2) and SU(2)xU(1) Yang-Mills theories having as starting point the U(1) Maxwell electromagnetic theory.
