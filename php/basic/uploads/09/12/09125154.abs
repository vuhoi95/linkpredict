Title: Asymptotic Chern-Simons formulation of spacelike stretched AdS gravity
Authors: M. Blagojević and B. Cvetković
Abstract: We show that the asymptotic structures of topologically massive gravity in the spacelike stretched AdS sector and an $SL(2,R)\times U(1)$ Chern-Simons gauge theory can be identified by adopting a natural correspondence between their fields and coupling constants.
