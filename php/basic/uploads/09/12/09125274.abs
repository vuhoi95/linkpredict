Title: Meson spectra in a gluon condensate background
Authors: Yumi Ko and Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We study the spectra of light mesons as well as the dissociation of a quarkonium and monopole-anti monopole bound state in a gluon condensate background. In order to describe the confining phase we introduce an IR cutoff in two ways, namely the hard wall and the braneless approaches. We find that the meson spectra strongly depend on the gluon condensate in the braneless approach, while they do not in the hard wall model. The latter result appears to be a more probable feature of QCD.
