Title: Stringy Neutralino Dark Matter in Light of CDMSII
Authors: James A. Maxin and Van E. Mayes and D. V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: Recently, the CDMS experiment has reported the possible first direct-detection of dark matter. We update the direct-detection constraints for neutralino dark matter arising in a realistic string model constructed from intersecting D6-branes taking into account the recent data from the CDMS collaboration. We find that there are well-defined regions of the supersymmetry parameter space where neutralino dark matter satisfying the CDMS and all other experimental limits may be obtained. This results in a set of distinct superpartner and Higgs spectra which may be tested at LHC.
