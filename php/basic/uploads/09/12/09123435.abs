Title: A simple way to take into account back reaction on pair creation
Authors: Emil T. Akhmedov and Philipp Burda
Abstract: We propose a simple and systematic way of accounting for the back reaction on the background field due to the pair creation in the four--dimensional scalar QED. This method is straightforwardly generalizable to the gravity backgrounds. In the case of QED with the instantly switched on constant electric field background we obtain a remarkably simple formula for its decay rate.
