Title: Thermodynamics of a field theory with infrared fixed point from  gauge/gravity duality
Authors: J. Alanen and K. Kajantie
Abstract: We use gauge/gravity duality to study the thermodynamics of a field theory with asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet and a fixed point in the infrared. We find a high temperature quark-gluon phase and a low T conformal unparticle phase. The phase transition between the phases is of first order or continuous, depending on the ratio of the radii of asymptotic AdS5 spaces at T=0 and T=infinity. This is a prediction from a model of gauge/gravity duality, not yet verified on the field theory side.
