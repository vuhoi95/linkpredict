Title: Problematic aspect of extra dimensions
Authors: Maxim Eingorn and Alexander Zhuk
Abstract: We show that in multidimensional Kaluza-Klein models the formula of the perihelion shift is $D\pi m'^2c^2r_g^2/[2(D-2)M^2]$ where $D$ is a total number of spatial dimensions. This expression demonstrates good agreement with experimental data only in the case of ordinary three-dimensional $(D=3)$ space. This result does not depend on the size of the extra dimensions. Therefore, considered multidimensional Kaluza-Klein models face a severe problem.
