Title: Kerr-Schild Method and Geodesic Structure in Codimension-2 Brane Black  Holes
Authors: Bertha Cuadros-Melgar and Susana Aguilar and Nelson Zamorano
Abstract: We consider the black hole solutions of five-dimensional gravity with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on a 2-brane of codimension-2. Applying the Kerr-Schild method we derive additional solutions which include charge and angular momentum. To improve our understanding of this geometry we study the geodesic structure of such spacetimes.
