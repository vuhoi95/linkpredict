Title: Curvaton reheating in logamediate inflationary model
Authors: Cuauhtemoc Campuzano and Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera and Efrain Rojas and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: In a logamediate inflationary universe model we introduce the curvaton field in order to bring this inflationary model to an end. In this approach we determine the reheating temperature. We also outline some interesting constraints on the parameters that describe our models. Thus, we give the parameter space in this scenario.
