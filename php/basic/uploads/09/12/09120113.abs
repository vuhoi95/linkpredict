Title: Renormalization Of High-Energy Lorentz Violating QED
Authors: Damiano Anselmi and Martina Taiuti
Abstract: We study a QED extension that is unitary, CPT invariant and super-renormalizable, but violates Lorentz symmetry at high energies, and contains higher-dimension operators (LVQED). Divergent diagrams are only one- and two-loop. We compute the one-loop renormalizations at high and low energies and analyse the relation between them. It emerges that the power-like divergences of the low-energy theory are multiplied by arbitrary constants, inherited by the high-energy theory, and therefore can be set to zero at no cost, bypassing the hierarchy problem.
