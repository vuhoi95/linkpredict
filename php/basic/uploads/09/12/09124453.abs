Title: Dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with superheavy quarks and 2+1  composite Higgs model
Authors: Michio Hashimoto and V. A. Miransky
Abstract: Recently, a new class of models describing the quark mass hierarchy has been introduced. In this class, while the t quark plays a minor role in electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), it is crucial in providing the quark mass hierarchy. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a particular model in this class, in which the b' and t' quarks of the fourth family are mostly responsible for dynamical EWSB. The low energy effective theory in this model is derived. It has a clear signature, a 2 + 1 structure of composite Higgs doublets: two nearly degenerate \Phi_{b'} and \Phi_{t'}, and a heavier top-Higgs resonance \Phi_t \sim \bar{t}_{R}(t,b)_L. The properties of these composites are described in detail, and it is shown that the model satisfies the electroweak precision data constraints. The signatures of these composites at the Large Hadron Collider are briefly discussed.
