Title: Quantum attractors of generalized Gauss-Bonnet dark energy
Authors: M. Alimohammadi and N. Agharafiei
Abstract: The influences of quantum effects on the structure of the phase-space of generalized Gauss-Bonnet theory, introduced by the Lagrangian F(R,G), have been studied. G is the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and the quantum effects are described via the account of conformal anomaly. It has been shown that the quantum effects change many aspects of the attractors of F(R,G) gravity models in the R-H plane, including the location of the attractors, the number of them and their stability properties. These variations are not, in general, from the type of small perturbations, but instead, it can induce the great, so not ignorable, variations which have root in the "singular perturbation" nature of this effect. In other words, one can not ignore the quantum corrections and must be always considered. The influences of the perfect barotropic fluids on this problem have been studied, and it has been shown that this kind of matters do not alter the quantum effects. It has been shown that the classical contribution of the coupled-quintessence model, which is responsible for inducing the quantum effects, is of this type, that is a perfect barotropic fluid, and therefore can not change our results.
