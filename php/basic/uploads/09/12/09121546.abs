Title: Encoding simplicial quantum geometry in group field theories
Authors: Daniele Oriti and Tamer Tlas
Abstract: We show that a new symmetry requirement on the GFT field, in the context of an extended GFT formalism, involving both Lie algebra and group elements, leads, in 3d, to Feynman amplitudes with a simplicial path integral form based on the Regge action, to a proper relation between the discrete connection and the triad vectors appearing in it, and to a much more satisfactory and transparent encoding of simplicial geometry already at the level of the GFT action.
