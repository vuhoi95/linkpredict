Title: Exploring Fermionic T-duality
Authors: Ilya Bakhmatov and David S. Berman
Abstract: The fermionic T-duality transformation developed by Berkovits and Maldacena is applied to D-brane and the pp-wave solutions of type IIB supergravity. The pp-wave is found to be self-dual under the combination of dualities. We explore the consequences of applying the transformation and discuss various properties of the new transformed solutions.
