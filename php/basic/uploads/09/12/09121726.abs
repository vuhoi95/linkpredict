Abstract: With the rotation of charge in a circular path current-loop is generated. This results in the production of magnetic fields in a charged body. This self (internal) magnetic field is treated here with five different radii of electron. Closed loop line integral of magnetic induction vector or the integral form of the Ampere's circuital law is expressed in terms intrinsic properties of electron.
