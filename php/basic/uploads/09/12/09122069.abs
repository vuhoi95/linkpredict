Title: Complex Correspondence Principle
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Daniel W. Hook and Peter N. Meisinger and Qing-hai Wang
Abstract: Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are two very different theories, but the correspondence principle states that quantum particles behave classically in the limit of high quantum number. In recent years much research has been done on extending both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics into the complex domain. This letter shows that these complex extensions continue to exhibit a correspondence, and that this correspondence becomes more pronounced in the complex domain. The association between complex quantum mechanics and complex classical mechanics is subtle and demonstrating this relationship prequires the use of asymptotics beyond all orders.
