Title: Worldsheet Matter Superfields on Half-Shell
Authors: Tristan Hubsch and Ivailo E. Petrov
Abstract: In this paper we discuss some of the effects of using "unidexterous" worldsheet superfields, which satisfy worldsheet differential constraints and so are partly on-shell, i.e., on half-shell. Most notably, this results in a stratification of the field space that reminds of "brane-world" geometries. Linear dependence on such superfields provides a worldsheet generalization of the super-Zeeman effect. In turn, non-linear dependence yields additional left-right asymmetric dynamical constraints on the propagating fields, again in a stratified fashion.
