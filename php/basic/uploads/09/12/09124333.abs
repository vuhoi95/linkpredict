Title: Nonforward Compton scattering in AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Jian-Hua Gao and Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: We study the nonforward Compton scattering in particular the deeply virtual Compton scattering from AdS/CFT. We first calculate the contributions from the s-channel and u-channel supergravity diagrams as well as the four point interaction diagram which correspond to the Compton scatterings on a dilaton target in CFT. Furthermore, we study the Compton scattering on a dilatino target. Assuming that protons can be identified as supergravity modes of dilatino, we compare the calculated DVCS cross section to the low-energy experimental data from the H1 and ZEUS collaborations and find good agreement. We also discuss the t-channel graviton exchange contribution and show that it should be dominant in the high-energy limit.
