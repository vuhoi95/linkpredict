Title: Rotating a Curvaton Brane in a Warped Throat
Authors: Jun Zhang and Yi-Fu Cai and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: In this paper we study a curvaton model obtained by considering a probe anti-D3-brane with angular motion at the bottom of a KS throat with approximate isometries. We calculate the spectrum of curvature perturbations and the non-Gaussianities of this model. Specifically, we consider the limit of relativistic rotation of the curvaton brane which leads to a small sound speed, and thus it can be viewed as an implementation of the DBI-curvaton mechanism. We find that the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant while the non-Gaussianity of local type is sizable and that of equilateral type is usually large and negative. Moreover, we study both the theoretical and observational constraints on this model, and find that there exists a sizable allowed region for the phase space of this model.
