Title: Quantum Criticality and Holographic Superconductors in M-theory
Authors: Jerome Gauntlett and Julian Sonner and Toby Wiseman
Abstract: We present a consistent Kaluza-Klein truncation of D=11 supergravity on an arbitrary seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space (SE_7) to a D=4 theory containing a metric, a gauge-field, a complex scalar field and a real scalar field. We use this D=4 theory to construct various black hole solutions that describe the thermodynamics of the d=3 CFTs dual to skew-whiffed AdS_4 X SE_7 solutions. We show that these CFTs have a rich phase diagram, including holographic superconductivity with, generically, broken parity and time reversal invariance. At zero temperature the superconducting solutions are charged domain walls with a universal emergent conformal symmetry in the far infrared.
