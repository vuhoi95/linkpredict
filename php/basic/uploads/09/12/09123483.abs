Title: Power-law solutions for TeVeS
Authors: C. E. Magalhaes Batista and W. Zimdahl
Abstract: The dynamics of TeVeS in a homogeneous and isotropic universe is shown to be equivalent to the dynamics of an interacting two-component system, consisting of a scalar field and a "fluid", related to the matter part, with explicitly given coupling term. Scaling solutions (solutions with a constant ratio of the energy densities of both components) in the "Einstein frame" are found which are exponentially expanding or contracting with no remaining freedom for Bekenstein's $F$ function. In the "physical frame" these solutions are of the power-law type. An equivalent General Relativity (GR) picture of the dynamics suggests that it is the scalar field which plays the role of dark matter, while the "matter" has to mimic (phantom-type) dark energy.
