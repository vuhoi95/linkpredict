Title: T-duality and Differential K-Theory
Authors: Alexander Kahle and Alessandro Valentino
Abstract: We give a precise formulation of T-duality for Ramond-Ramond fields. This gives a canonical isomorphism between the "geometrically invariant" subgroups of the twisted differential K-theory of certain principal torus bundles. Our result combines topological T-duality with the Buscher rules found in physics.
