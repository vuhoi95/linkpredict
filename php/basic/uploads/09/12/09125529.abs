Abstract: We obtain a general class of polynomials for which the Schrodinger operator has a discrete spectrum. This class includes all the scalar potentials in membrane, 5-brane, p-branes, multiple M2 branes, BLG and ABJM theories. We provide a proof of the discreteness of the spectrum of the associated Schrodinger operators. This a a first step in order to analyze BLG and ABJM supersymmetric theories from a non-perturbative point of view.
