Abstract: We investigate the propagation of a space-like flavour current in a strongly coupled N = 2 super Yang-Mills plasma using the D3-D7 brane model at finite temperature. The partonic contribution to the plasma structure functions is obtained from the imaginary part of the retarded current-current commutator. At high temperatures we find a non-vanishing result, for a high energy current, indicating absorption of the flavour current by the quark constituents of the plasma. At low temperatures there is no quark contribution to the plasma structure functions.
