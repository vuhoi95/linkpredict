Title: On massive gravitons in 2+1 dimensions
Authors: Eric Bergshoeff and Olaf Hohm and Paul Townsend
Abstract: The Fierz-Pauli (FP) free field theory for massive spin 2 particles can be extended, in a spacetime of (1+2) dimensions (3D), to a generally covariant parity-preserving interacting field theory, in at least two ways. One is "new massive gravity" (NMG), with an action that involves curvature-squared terms. Another is 3D "bigravity", which involves non-linear couplings of the FP tensor field to 3D Einstein-Hilbert gravity. We review the proof of the linearized equivalence of both "massive 3D gravity" theories to FP theory, and we comment on their similarities and differences.
