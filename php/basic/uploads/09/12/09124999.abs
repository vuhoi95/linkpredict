Title: Chiral random matrix theory for two-color QCD at high density
Authors: Takuya Kanazawa and Tilo Wettig and Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: We identify a non-Hermitian chiral random matrix theory that corresponds to two-color QCD at high density. We show that the partition function of the random matrix theory coincides with the partition function of the finite-volume effective theory at high density, and that the Leutwyler-Smilga-type spectral sum rules of the random matrix theory are identical to those derived from the effective theory. The microscopic Dirac spectrum of the theory is governed by the BCS gap, rather than the conventional chiral condensate. We also show that with a different choice of a parameter the random matrix theory yields the effective partition function at low density.
