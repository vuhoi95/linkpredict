Title: Generalized Lifshitz-Kosevich scaling at quantum criticality from the  holographic correspondence
Authors: Sean A. Hartnoll and Diego M. Hofman
Abstract: We characterize quantum oscillations in the magnetic susceptibility of a quantum critical non-Fermi liquid. The computation is performed in a strongly interacting regime using the nonperturbative holographic correspondence. The temperature dependence of the amplitude of the oscillations is shown to depend on a critical exponent nu. For general nu the temperature scaling is distinct from the textbook Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. At the `marginal' value nu = 1/2, the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula is recovered despite strong interactions. As a by-product of our analysis we present a formalism for computing the amplitude of quantum oscillations for general fermionic theories very efficiently.
