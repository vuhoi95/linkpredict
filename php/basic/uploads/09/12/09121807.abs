Title: Magnetic Branes in Brans-Dicke-Maxwell Theory
Authors: A. Sheykhi and E. Ebrahimi
Abstract: We present a new class of magnetic brane solutions in $(n+1)$-dimensional Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory in the presence of a quadratic potential for the scalar field. These solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter. Our strategy for constructing these solutions is applying a conformal transformation to the corresponding solutions in dilaton gravity. This class of solutions represents a spacetime with a longitudinal magnetic field generated by a static brane. They have no curvature singularity and no horizons but have a conic geometry with a deficit angle $\delta$. We generalize this class of solutions to the case of spinning magnetic brane with all rotation parameters. We also use the counterterm method and calculate the conserved quantities of the solutions.
