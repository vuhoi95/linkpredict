Abstract: We reveal the center vortex content of SU(2) calorons and ensembles of them. We use Laplacian Center Gauge as well as Maximal Center Gauges to show that the vortex in a single caloron consists of two parts. The first one connects the constituent dyons of the caloron (which are monopoles in Laplacian Abelian Gauge) and extends in time. The second part is predominantly spatial, encloses one of the dyons and can be related to the twist in the caloron gauge field. This part depends strongly on the caloron holonomy and degenerates to a plane when the holonomy is maximally nontrivial, i.e. when the asymptotic Polyakov loop is traceless. Correspondingly, we find the spatial vortices in caloron ensembles to percolate in this case. This finding fits perfectly in the confinement scenario of vortices and shows that calorons are suitable to facilitate the vortex confinement mechanism.
