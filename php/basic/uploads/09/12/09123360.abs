Title: The Complex Langevin method: When can it be trusted?
Authors: Gert Aarts and Erhard Seiler and Ion-Olimpiu Stamatescu
Abstract: We analyze to what extent the complex Langevin method, which is in principle capable of solving the so-called sign problems, can be considered as reliable. We give a formal derivation of the correctness and then point out various mathematical loopholes. The detailed study of some simple examples leads to practical suggestions about the application of the method.
