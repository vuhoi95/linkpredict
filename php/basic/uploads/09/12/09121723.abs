Title: Integrability and the AdS(3)/CFT(2) correspondence
Authors: A. Babichenko and B. Stefanski and K. Zarembo
Abstract: We investigate the AdS(3)/CFT(2) correspondence for theories with 16 supercharges using the integrability approach. We construct Green-Schwarz actions for Type IIB strings on AdS(3)xS(3)xM(4) where M(4)=T(4) or S(3)xS(1) using the coset approach. These actions are based on a Z(4) automorphism of the super-coset D(2,1;alpha)xD(2,1;alpha)/SO(1,2)xSO(3)xSO(3). The equations of motion admit a representation in terms of a Lax connection, showing that the system is classically integrable. We present the finite gap equations for these actions. When alpha=0,1/2,1 we propose a set of quantum Bethe equations valid at all values of the coupling. The AdS(3)/CFT(2) duals contain novel massless modes whose role remains to be explored.
