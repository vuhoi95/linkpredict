Title: Transformation optics that mimics the system outside a Schwarzschild  black hole
Authors: Huanyang Chen and Rong-Xin Miao and Miao Li
Abstract: We applied the transformation optics to mimic a black hole of Schwarzschild form. Similar properties of photon sphere were also found numerically for the metamaterial black hole. Several reduced versions of the black hole systems were proposed for easier implementations.
