Title: On I-even Singlet Glueballs in the Klebanov-Strassler Theory
Authors: Ivan Gordeli and Dmitry Melnikov
Abstract: In this note we study vector fluctuations over the Klebanov-Strassler type IIB supergravity solution that are even under the I-conjugation. We are interested only in the states invariant under the global SU(2)x SU(2) symmetry. Apart from the glueball dual to the R-current there is one more 1++ state, which is a member of a massive vector multiplet containing also a scalar 0++. Combined with previous results, our analysis allows to complete the list of low energy singlet supermultiplets in the Klebanov-Strassler theory.
