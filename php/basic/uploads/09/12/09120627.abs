Title: Asymptotic Bethe equations for open boundaries in planar AdS/CFT
Authors: D. H. Correa and C. A. S. Young
Abstract: We solve, by means of a nested coordinate Bethe ansatz, the open-boundaries scattering theory describing the excitations of a free open string propagating in $AdS_5\times S^5$, carrying large angular momentum $J=J_{56}$, and ending on a maximal giant graviton whose angular momentum is in the same plane. We thus obtain the all-loop Bethe equations describing the spectrum, for $J$ finite but large, of the energies of such strings, or equivalently, on the gauge side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the anomalous dimensions of certain operators built using the epsilon tensor of SU(N). We also give the Bethe equations for strings ending on a probe D7-brane, corresponding to meson-like operators in an $\mathcal N=2$ gauge theory with fundamental matter.
