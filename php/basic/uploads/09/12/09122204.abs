Title: Nonabelian N=2 Superstrings: Hamiltonian Structure
Authors: A. P. Isaev and E. A. Ivanov
Abstract: We examine the Hamiltonian structure of nonabelian N=2 superstrings models which are the supergroup manifold extensions of N=2 Green-Schwarz superstring. We find the Kac-Moody and Virasoro type superalgebras of the relevant constraints and present elements of the corresponding quantum theory. A comparison with the type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring moving in a general curved 10-d supergravity background is also given. We find that nonabelian superstrings (for d=10) present a particular case of this general system corresponding to a special choices of the background.
