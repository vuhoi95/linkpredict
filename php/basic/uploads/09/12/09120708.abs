Title: Circular Symmetry in Topologically Massive Gravity
Authors: S. Deser and J. Franklin
Abstract: We re-derive, compactly, a TMG decoupling theorem: source-free TMG separates into its Einstein and Cotton sectors for spaces with a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector, here concretely for circular symmetry. We can then generalize it to include matter, which is necessarily null.
