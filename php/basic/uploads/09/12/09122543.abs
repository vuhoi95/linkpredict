Title: The Simplicity of Perfect Atoms: Degeneracies in Supersymmetric Hydrogen
Authors: Tomas Rube and Jay G. Wacker
Abstract: Supersymmetric QED hydrogen-like bound states are remarkably similar to non-supersymmetric hydrogen, including an accidental degeneracy of the fine structure and which is broken by the Lamb shift. This article classifies the states, calculates the leading order spectrum, and illustrates the results in several limits. The relation to other non-relativistic bound states is explored.
