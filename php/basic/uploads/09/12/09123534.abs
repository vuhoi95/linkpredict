Title: Multi-Parton Scattering Amplitudes via On-Shell Methods
Authors: Carola F. Berger and Darren Forde
Abstract: We present an overview of recent developments, based on on-shell techniques, in the calculation of multi-parton scattering amplitudes at one loop that are relevant for phenomenological studies at hadron colliders. These new on-shell methods make efficient use of the physical properties of the hard scattering, such as unitarity and factorization.
