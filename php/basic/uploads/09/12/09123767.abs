Title: On the interplay between screening and confinement from interacting  electromagnetic and torsion fields
Authors: Patricio Gaete and José A. Helaÿel-Neto
Abstract: Features of screening and confinement are studied for the coupling of axial torsion fields with photons in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. To this end we compute the static quantum potential. Our discussion is carried out using the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism which is alternative to the Wilson loop approach. Our results show that, in the case of a constant electric field strength expectation value, the static potential remains Coulombic, while in the case of a constant magnetic field strength expectation value the potential energy is the sum of a Yukawa and a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static probe charges.
