Abstract: We consider extensions of the standard model based on open strings ending on D-branes, in which gauge bosons and their associated gauginos exist as strings attached to stacks of D-branes, and chiral matter exists as strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. Under the assumptions that the fundamental string scale is in the TeV range and the theory is weakly coupled, we study models of supersymmetry for which signals of annihilating neutralino dark matter are observable. In particular, we construct a model with a supersymmetric R-symmetry violating (but R-parity conserving) effective Lagrangian that allows for the s-wave annihilation of neutralinos, once gauginos acquire mass through an unspecified mechanism. The model yields bino-like neutralinos (with the measured relic abundance) that annihilate to a gamma-gamma final state with a substantial branching fraction (~ 10%) that is orders of magnitude larger than in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. A very bright gamma-ray spectral line could be observed by gamma-ray telescopes.
