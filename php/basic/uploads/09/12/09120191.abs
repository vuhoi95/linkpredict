Title: Scattering vector mesons in D4/D8 model
Authors: C. A. Ballon Bayona and Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga and Marcus A. C. Torres
Abstract: We review in this proceedings some recent results for vector meson form factors obtained using the holographic D4-D8 brane model. The D4-D8 brane model, proposed by Sakai and Sugimoto, is a holographic dual of a semi-realistic strongly coupled large N_c QCD since it breaks supersymmetry and incorporates chiral symmetry breaking. We analyze the vector meson wave functions and Regge trajectories as well.
