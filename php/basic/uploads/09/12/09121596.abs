Title: D7-Brane Moduli vs. F-Theory Cycles in Elliptically Fibred Threefolds
Authors: Andreas P. Braun and Sebastian Gerigk and Arthur Hebecker and Hagen Triendl
Abstract: We study the space of geometric and open string moduli of type IIB compactifications from the perspective of complex structure deformations of F-theory. In order to find a correspondence, we work in the weak coupling limit and for simplicity focus on compactifications to 6 dimensions. Starting from the topology of D7-branes and O7-planes, we construct the 3-cycles of the F-theory threefold. We achieve complete agreement between the degrees of freedom of the Weierstrass model and the complex structure deformations of the elliptic Calabi-Yau. All relevant quantities are expressed in terms of the topology of the base space, allowing us to formulate our results for general base spaces.
