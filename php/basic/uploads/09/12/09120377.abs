Title: Interaction of Relativistic Bosons with Localized Sources on Riemannian  Surfaces
Authors: Çağlar Doğan and O. Teoman Turgut
Abstract: We study the interaction of mutually non-interacting Klein-Gordon particles with localized sources on stochastically complete Riemannian surfaces. This asymptotically free theory requires regularization and coupling constant renormalization. Renormalization is performed non-perturbatively using the orthofermion algebra technique and the principal operator $\Phi$ is found. The principal operator is then used to obtain the bound state spectrum, in terms of binding energies to single Dirac-delta function centers. The heat kernel method allows us to generalize this procedure to compact and Cartan-Hadamard type Riemannian manifolds. We make use of upper and lower bounds on the heat kernel to constrain the ground state energy from below thus confirming that our neglect of pair creation is justified for certain ranges of parameters in the problem.
