Abstract: In this contribution we review some recent results about the emergence of 2D integrable systems in 3D Lattice Gauge Theories near the deconfinement transition. We focus on some concrete examples involving the flux tube thickness, the ratio of k-string tensions and Polyakov loops correlators in various models.
