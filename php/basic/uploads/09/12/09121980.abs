Title: On algebraic structures in supersymmetric principal chiral model
Authors: Bushra Haider and M. Hassan
Abstract: Using the Poisson current algebra of the supersymmetric principal chiral model, we develop the algebraic canonical structure of the model by evaluating the fundamental Poisson bracket of the Lax matrices that fits into the rs matrix formalism of non-ultralocal integrable models. The fundamental Poisson bracket has been used to compute the Poisson bracket algebra of the monodromy matrix that gives the conserved quantities in involution.
