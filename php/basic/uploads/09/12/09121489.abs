Title: Particle mixing, flavor condensate and dark energy
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Antonio Capolupo and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: The mixing of neutrinos and quarks generate a vacuum condensate that, at the present epoch, behaves as a cosmological constant. The value of the dark energy is constrained today by the very small breaking of the Lorentz invariance.
