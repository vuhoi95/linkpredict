Title: Froggatt-Nielsen models from E8 in F-theory GUTs
Authors: Emilian Dudas and Eran Palti
Abstract: This paper studies F-theory SU(5) GUT models where the three generations of the standard model come from three different curves. All the matter is taken to come from curves intersecting at a point of enhanced E8 gauge symmetry. Giving a vev to some of the GUT singlets naturally implements a Froggatt-Nielsen approach to flavour structure. A scan is performed over all possible models and the results are filtered using phenomenological constraints. We find a unique model that fits observations of quark and lepton masses and mixing well. This model suffers from two drawbacks: R-parity must be imposed by hand and there is a doublet-triplet splitting problem.
