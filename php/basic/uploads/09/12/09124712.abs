Title: Multi-scalar tachyon potential on non-BPS domain walls
Authors: F. A. Brito and H. S. Jesuino
Abstract: We have considered the multi-scalar and multi-tachyon fields living on a 3d domain wall embedded in a 5d dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The effective action for such a domain wall can be found by integrating out the normal modes as vibrating modes around the domain wall solution of a truncated 5d supergravity action. The multi-scalar tachyon potential are good enough to modeling assisted inflation scenario with multi-tachyon fields. The tachyon condensation are also briefly addressed.
