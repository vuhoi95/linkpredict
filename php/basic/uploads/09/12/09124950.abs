Title: Crossing the Phantom Divide in Extended Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Gravity
Authors: Koichi Hirano and Zen Komiya
Abstract: We propose a phantom crossing Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) model. In our model, the effective equation of state of the DGP gravity crosses the phantom divide line. We demonstrate crossing of the phantom divide does not occur within the framework of the original DGP model or the DGP model developed by Dvali and Turner. By extending their model, we construct a model that realizes crossing of the phantom divide. We find that the smaller the value of the new introduced parameter $\beta$ is, the older epoch crossing of the phantom divide occurs in. Our model can account for late-time acceleration of the universe without dark energy. We investigate and show the property of Phantom crossing DGP model.
