Title: Constraints on the quantum gravity scale from kappa - Minkowski  spacetime
Authors: A. Borowiec and Kumar S. Gupta and S. Meljanac and A. Pachol
Abstract: We compare two versions of deformed dispersion relations (energy vs momenta and momenta vs energy) and the corresponding time delay up to the second order accuracy in the quantum gravity scale (deformation parameter). A general framework describing modified dispersion relations and time delay with respect to different noncommutative kappa -Minkowski spacetime realizations is firstly proposed here and it covers all the cases introduced in the literature. It is shown that some of the realizations provide certain bounds on quadratic corrections, i.e. on quantum gravity scale, but it is not excluded in our framework that quantum gravity scale is the Planck scale. We also show how the coefficients in the dispersion relations can be obtained through a multiparameter fit of the gamma ray burst (GRB) data.
