Title: 1D Lieb-Liniger Bose Gas as Non-Relativistic Limit of the Sinh-Gordon  Model
Authors: M. Kormos and G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni
Abstract: The repulsive Lieb-Liniger model can be obtained as the non-relativistic limit of the Sinh-Gordon model: all physical quantities of the latter model (S-matrix, Lagrangian and operators) can be put in correspondence with those of the former. We use this mapping, together with the Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz equations and the exact form factors of the Sinh-Gordon model, to set up a compact and general formalism for computing the expectation values of the Lieb-Liniger model both at zero and finite temperature. The computation of one-point correlators is thoroughly detailed and, when possible, compared with known results in the literature.
