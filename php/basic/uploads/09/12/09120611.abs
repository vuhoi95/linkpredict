Title: BRST Lagrangian construction for spin-2 field in Einstein space
Authors: I. L. Buchbinder and V. A. Krykhtin and P. M. Lavrov
Abstract: We explore a new possibility of BRST construction in higher spin field theory to obtain a consistent Lagrangian for massive spin-2 field in Einstein space. Such approach automatically leads to gauge invariant Lagrangian with suitable auxiliary and Stuckelberg fields. It is proved that in this case a propagation of spin-2 field is hyperbolic and causal. Also we extend notion of partial masslessness for spin-2 field in the background under consideration.
