Title: Introduction to Quantum Integrability
Authors: Anastasia Doikou and Stefano Evangelisti and Giovanni Feverati and Nikos Karaiskos
Abstract: In this article we review the basic concepts regarding quantum integrability. Special emphasis is given on the algebraic content of integrable models. The associated algebras are essentially described by the Yang-Baxter and boundary Yang-Baxter equations depending on the choice of boundary conditions. The relation between the aforementioned equations and the braid group is briefly discussed. A short review on quantum groups as well as the quantum inverse scattering method (algebraic Bethe ansatz) is also presented.
