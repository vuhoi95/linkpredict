Title: Scalar Casimir Energies for Separable Coordinate Systems: Application to  Semi-transparent Planes in an Annulus
Authors: J. Wagner and K. A. Milton and K. Kirsten
Abstract: We derive a simplified general expression for the two-body scalar Casimir energy in generalized separable coordinate systems. We apply this technique to the case of radial semi-transparent planes in the annular region between two concentric Dirichlet cylinders. This situation is explored both analytically and numerically.
