Title: A Spin Chain for the Symmetric Product CFT_2
Authors: Ari Pakman and Leonardo Rastelli and Shlomo S. Razamat
Abstract: We consider "gauge invariant" operators in Sym^N T^4, the symmetric product orbifold of N copies of the 2d supersymmetric sigma model with T^4 target. We discuss a spin chain representation for single-cycle operators and study their two point functions at large N. We perform systematic calculations at the orbifold point ("tree level"), where non-trivial mixing is already present, and some sample calculations to first order in the blow-up mode of the orbifold ("one loop").
