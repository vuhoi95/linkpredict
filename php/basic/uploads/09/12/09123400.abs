Title: On the local structure of Lorentzian Einstein manifolds with parallel  distribution of null lines
Authors: Anton S. Galaev and Thomas Leistner
Abstract: We study transformations of coordinates on a Lorentzian Einstein manifold with a parallel distribution of null lines and show that the general Walker coordinates can be simplified. In these coordinates, the full Lorentzian Einstein equation is reduced to equations on a family of Einstein Riemannian metrics.
