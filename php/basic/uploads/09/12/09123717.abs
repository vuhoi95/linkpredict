Title: A New Mechanism of Quark Energy Loss
Authors: Jorge Casalderrey-Solana and Daniel Fernandez and David Mateos
Abstract: We show that a heavy quark moving sufficiently fast through a quark-gluon plasma may lose energy by Cherenkov-radiating mesons. We demonstrate that this takes place in all strongly coupled, large-Nc plasmas with a gravity dual. The energy loss is exactly calculable in these models despite being an O(1/Nc)-effect. We discuss phenomenological implications for heavy-ion collision experiments.
