Title: Cylindrically-Symmetric Solutions in Conformal Gravity
Authors: Y. Brihaye and Y. Verbin
Abstract: Cylindrically-symmetric solutions in Conformal Gravity are investigated and several new solutions are presented and discussed. Among them, a family of vacuum solutions, generalizations of the Melvin solution and cosmic strings of the Abelian Higgs model. The Melvin-like solutions have finite energy per unit length, while the string-like solutions do not.
