Title: Torsion Effects in Braneworld Scenarios
Authors: J. M. Hoff da Silva and R. da Rocha
Abstract: We present gravitational aspects of braneworld models endowed with torsion terms both in the bulk and on the brane. In order to investigate a conceivable and measurable gravitational effect, arising genuinely from bulk torsion terms, we analyze the variation in the black hole area by the presence of torsion. Furthermore, we extend the well known results about consistency conditions in a framework that incorporates brane torsion terms. It is shown, in a rough estimate, that the resulting effects are generally suppressed by the internal space volume. This formalism provides manageable models and their possible ramifications into some aspects of gravity in this context, and cognizable corrections and physical effects as well.
