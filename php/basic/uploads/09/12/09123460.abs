Abstract: In arXiv:0908.2463 we computed the four-loop correction to a function depending on the 't Hooft coupling(s) that appears in the magnon dispersion relation of the spin chains derived from single trace operators in N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theories. In this paper we give detailed descriptions of this calculation and the computation of the four-loop wrapping corrections for a length four operator in the 20 of SU(4), the R-symmetry group for these theories. Here, we give all relevant Feynman diagrams and loop integrals explicitly, and also demonstrate the cancellation of double poles in the logarithm of the renormalization constant.
