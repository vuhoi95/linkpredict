Abstract: For the general renormalizable N=1 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory, regularized by higher covariant derivatives, a two-loop beta-function is calculated. It is shown that all integrals, needed for obtaining this function, can be easily calculated, because they are integrals of total derivatives.
