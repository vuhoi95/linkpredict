Title: A bijection between paths for the M(p,2p+1) minimal model Virasoro  characters
Authors: Olivier Blondeau-Fournier and Pierre Mathieu and Trevor Welsh
Abstract: The states in the irreducible modules of the minimal models can be represented by infinite lattice paths arising from consideration of the corresponding RSOS statistical models. For the M(p,2p+1) models, a completely different path representation has been found recently, this one on a half-integer lattice; it has no known underlying statistical-model interpretation. The correctness of this alternative representation has not yet been demonstrated, even at the level of the generating functions, since the resulting fermionic characters differ from the known ones. This gap is filled here, with the presentation of two versions of a bijection between the two path representations of the M(p,2p+1) states. In addition, a half-lattice path representation for the M(p+1,2p+1) models is stated, and other generalisations suggested.
