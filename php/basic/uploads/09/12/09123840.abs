Title: Small Mass Expansion of Functional Determinants on the Generalized Cone
Authors: Guglielmo Fucci and Klaus Kirsten
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small mass expansion for the functional determinant of a scalar Laplacian defined on the bounded, generalized cone. In the framework of zeta function regularization, we obtain an expression for the functional determinant valid in any dimension for both Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions in terms of the spectral zeta function of the base manifold. Moreover, as a particular case, we specify the base to be a $d$-dimensional sphere and present explicit results for $d=2,3,4,5$.
