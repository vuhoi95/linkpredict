Title: Monopole-based quantization: a programme
Authors: J. F. Carinena and J. M. Gracia-Bondia and Fedele Lizzi and Giuseppe Marmo and Patrizia Vitale
Abstract: We describe a programme to quantize a particle in the field of a (three dimensional) magnetic monopole using a Weyl system. We propose using the mapping of position and momenta as operators on a quaternionic Hilbert module following the work of Emch and Jadczyk.
