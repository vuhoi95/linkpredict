Title: F-Theory GUT Vacua on Compact Calabi-Yau Fourfolds
Authors: Thomas W. Grimm and Sven Krause and Timo Weigand
Abstract: We present compact three-generation F-theory GUT models meeting in particular the constraints of D3-tadpole cancellation and D-term supersymmetry. To this end we explicitly construct elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds as complete intersections in a toric ambient space. Toric methods enable us to control the singular geometry of the SU(5) GUT model. The GUT brane wraps a non-generic del Pezzo surface admitting GUT symmetry breaking via hypercharge flux. It is contractible to a curve and we demonstrate the existence of a consistent decoupling limit. We compute the Euler characteristic of the singular Calabi-Yau fourfold to show that our three-generation flux solutions obtained via the spectral cover construction are consistent with D3-tadpole cancellation.
