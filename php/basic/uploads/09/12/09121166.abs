Title: Exact Quantization of a Superparticle in AdS_5 x S^5
Authors: Tetsuo Horigane and Yoichi Kazama
Abstract: As a step toward deeper understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence, exact quantization of a Brink-Schwarz superparticle in the AdS_5 x S^5 background with Ramond-Ramond (RR) flux is performed from the first principle in the phase space formulation. It includes the construction of the quantum Noether charges for the psu(2,2|4) superconformal symmetry and by solving the superconformal primary conditions we obtain the complete physical spectrum of the system with the explicit wave functions. The spectrum agrees precisely with the supergravity results, including all the Kaluza-Klein excitations. Our method and the result are expected to shed light on the eventual quantization of a superstring in this important background.
