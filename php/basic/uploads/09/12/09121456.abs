Title: Large N reduction on group manifolds
Authors: Hikaru Kawai and Shinji Shimasaki and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We show that the large N reduction holds on group manifolds. Large N field theories defined on group manifolds are equivalent to some corresponding matrix models. For instance, gauge theories on S^3 can be regularized in a gauge invariant and SO(4) invariant manner.
