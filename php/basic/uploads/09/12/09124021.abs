Title: Resonances on deformed thick branes
Authors: W. T. Cruz and A. R. Gomes and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: In this work we investigate the issue of gravity and fermion localization and resonances in $(4,1)$-branes constructed with one scalar field coupled with gravity in deformed models. Such models give solutions for the scalar field that is the usual kink solution in the extra dimension for a parameter $p=1$ and deformations with a two-kink profile for odd $p>1$. Gravity is localized and resonant modes are found for small values of $p$. The coupling between the scalar field and spinors is a necessary condition for fermions to be localized on such branes. After performing a chiral decomposition of the five-dimensional spinor we found resonances with both chiralities for all odd $p$'s. The correspondence between the spectra for left and right chirality is guaranteed and Dirac fermions are realized on the brane. The increasing of $p$ characterizes the formation of branes with internal structure that turns the gravitational interaction more effective for fermions aside the brane, increasing their lifetime. The influence of the internal structure of the branes and the presence of resonances for gravity and fermionic modes is addressed.
