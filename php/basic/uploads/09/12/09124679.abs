Abstract: Type IIB supergravity admits Janus and multi-Janus solutions with eight unbroken supersymmetries that are locally asymptotic to AdS_3 x S^3 x M_4 (where M_4 is either T^4 or K_3). These solutions are dual to two or more CFTs defined on half-planes which share a common line interface. Their geometry consists of an AdS_2 x S^2 x M_4 fibration over a simply connected Riemann surface Sigma with boundary. In the present paper, we show that regular exact solutions exist also for surfaces Sigma which are not simply connected. Specifically, we construct in detail solutions for which Sigma has the topology of an annulus. This construction is generalized to produce solutions for any surface Sigma with the topology of an open string worldsheet with g holes.
