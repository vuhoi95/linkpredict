Title: Light-like mesons and deep inelastic scattering in finite-temperature  AdS/CFT with flavor
Authors: E. Iancu and A. H. Mueller
Abstract: We use the holographic dual of a finite-temperature, strongly-coupled, gauge theory with a small number of flavors of massive fundamental quarks to study meson excitations and deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in the low-temperature phase, where the mesons are stable. We show that a high-energy flavor current with nearly light-like kinematics disappears into the plasma by resonantly producing mesons in highly excited states. This mechanism generates the same DIS structure functions as in the high temperature phase, where mesons are unstable and the current disappears through medium-induced parton branching. To establish this picture, we derive analytic results for the meson spectrum, which are exact in the case of light-like mesons and which corroborate and complete previous, mostly numerical, studies in the literature. We find that the meson levels are very finely spaced near the light-cone, so that the current can always decay, without a fine-tuning of its kinematics.
