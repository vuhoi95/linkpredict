Title: Holographic Hadrons in a Confining Finite Density Medium
Authors: Yunseok Seo and Jonathan P. Shock and Sang-Jin Sin and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We study a sector of the hadron spectrum in the presence of finite baryon density. We use a non-supersymmetric gravity dual to a confining guage theory which exhibits a running dilaton. The interaction of mesons with the finite density medium is encoded in the dual theory by a force balancing between flavor D7-branes and a baryon vertex provided by a wrapped D5-brane. When the current quark mass m_q is sufficiently large, the meson mass reduces, exhibiting an interesting spectral flow as we increase the baryon density while it has a more complicated behaviour for very small m_q.
