Title: The Perfect Atom: Bound States of Supersymmetric Quantum Electrodynamics
Authors: Christopher P. Herzog and Thomas Klose
Abstract: We study hydrogen-like atoms in N=1 supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics with an electronic and a muonic family. These atoms are bound states of an anti-muon and an electron or their superpartners. The exchange of a photino converts different bound states into each other. We determine the energy eigenstates and calculate the spectrum to fourth order in the fine structure constant. A difference between these perfect atoms and non-supersymmetric ones is the absence of hyperfine structure. We organize the eigenstates into super multiplets of the underlying symmetry algebra.
