Title: Resizing the Conformal Window: A beta function Ansatz
Authors: Oleg Antipin and Kimmo Tuominen
Abstract: We propose an ansatz for the nonperturbative beta function of a generic non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with or without fermions in an arbitrary representation of the gauge group. While our construction is similar to the recently proposed Ryttov-Sannino all order beta function, the essential difference is that it allows for the existence of an unstable ultraviolet fixed point in addition to the predicted Bank-Zaks -like infrared stable fixed point. Our beta function preserves all of the tested features with respect to the non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We predict the conformal window identifying the lower end of it as a merger of the infrared and ultraviolet fixed points.
