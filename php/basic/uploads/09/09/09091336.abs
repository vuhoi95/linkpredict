Title: Expectation Values in the Lieb-Liniger Bose Gas
Authors: M. Kormos and G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni
Abstract: Taking advantage of an exact mapping between a relativistic integrable model and the Lieb-Liniger model we present a novel method to compute expectation values in the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas both at zero and finite temperature. These quantities, relevant in the physics of one-dimensional ultracold Bose gases, are expressed by a series that has a remarkable behavior of convergence. Among other results, we show the computation of the three-body expectation value at finite temperature, a quantity that rules the recombination rate of the Bose gas.
