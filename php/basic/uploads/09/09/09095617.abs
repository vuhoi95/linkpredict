Title: AdS boundary conditions and the Topologically Massive Gravity/CFT  correspondence
Authors: Kostas Skenderis and Marika Taylor and Balt C. van Rees
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence provides a new perspective on recurrent questions in General Relativity such as the allowed boundary conditions at infinity and the definition of gravitational conserved charges. Here we review the main insights obtained in this direction over the last decade and apply the new techniques to Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that this theory is dual to a non-unitary CFT for any value of its parameter mu and becomes a Logarithmic CFT at mu = 1.
