Title: Chirality in unified theories of gravity
Authors: F. Nesti and R. Percacci
Abstract: We show how to obtain a single chiral family of an SO(10) GUT, starting from a Majorana-Weyl representation of a unifying ("GraviGUT") group SO(3,11), which contains the gravitational Lorentz group SO(3,1). An action is proposed, which reduces to the correct fermionic GUT action in the broken phase.
