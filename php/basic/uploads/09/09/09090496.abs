Title: Large non-Gaussianities with Intermediate Shapes from Quasi-Single Field  Inflation
Authors: Xingang Chen and Yi Wang
Abstract: We study the slow-roll inflation models, where the inflaton slow-rolls along a trajectory whose orthogonal directions are lifted by potentials with masses of order the Hubble parameter. In these models large non-Gaussianities can be generated through the transformation from the isocurvature modes to the curvature mode, once the inflaton trajectory turns. We find large bispectra with one-parameter family of novel shapes, interpolating between the equilateral and local shape. According to the in-in formalism, the shapes of these non-Gaussianities are different from a simple projection from the isocurvature non-Gaussian correlation functions.
