Authors: Hajime Aoki and Yoshiko Hirayama and Satoshi Iso
Abstract: We construct a topological charge of gauge field configurations on a fuzzy S^2xS^2 by using a Dirac operator satisfying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. The topological charge defined on the fuzzy S^2xS^2 can be interpreted as a noncommutative (or matrix) generalization of the 2nd Chern character on S^2xS^2. We further calculate the number of chiral zero modes of the Dirac operator in topologically nontrivial gauge configurations. Generalizations of our formulation to fuzzy (S^2)^k are also discussed.
