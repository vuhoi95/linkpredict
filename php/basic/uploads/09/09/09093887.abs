Abstract: A soft-wall anti-de Sitter/QCD model with a modified five-dimensional metric at the infrared region is constructed to obtain a nontrivial dilaton solution, which incorporates the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement. By taking the pion mass and decay constant as two input mass scales, the resulting predictions for the resonance states of pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons agree remarkably with the experimentally confirmed resonance states. The effects of the quartic interaction term are investigated by taking an appropriate sign and magnitude for maintaining the stability of the bulk scalar potential. It is shown that such a simply modified soft-wall anti-de Sitter/QCD model can lead to a consistent prediction for the mass spectra of resonance states in the pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons; the agreement with the experimental data is found to be better than 10% for the excited meson states. The resulting pion form factor also agrees well with the experimental data.
