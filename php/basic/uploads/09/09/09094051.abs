Abstract: We study properties of strongly coupled CFT's with non-zero background electric charge in 1+1 dimensions by studying the dual gravity theory - which is a charged BTZ black hole. Correlators of operators dual to scalars, gauge fields and fermions are studied at both T=0 and $T\neq 0$. In the $T=0$ case we are also able to compare with analytical results based on $ AdS_2$ and find reasonable agreement. In particular the correlation between log periodicity and the presence of finite spectral density of gapless modes is seen. The real part of the conductivity (given by the current-current correlator) also vanishes as $\omega \rightarrow 0$ as expected. The fermion Green's function shows quasiparticle peaks with approximately linear dispersion but the detailed structure is neither Fermi liquid nor Luttinger liquid and bears some similarity to a "Fermi-Luttinger" liquid. This is expected since there is a background charge and the theory is not Lorentz or scale invariant. A boundary action that produces the observed non-Luttinger-liquid like behavior ($k$-independent non-analyticity at $\omega=0$) in the Greens function is discussed.
