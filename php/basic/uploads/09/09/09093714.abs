Title: Large N solution of generalized Gross-Neveu model with two coupling  constants
Authors: Christian Boehmer and Michael Thies
Abstract: The Gross-Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions is generalized to the case of different scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants. This enables us to interpolate smoothly between the standard massless Gross-Neveu models with either discrete or continuous chiral symmetry. We present the solution of the generalized model in the large N limit including the vacuum, fermion-antifermion scattering and bound states, solitonic baryons with fractional baryon number and the full phase diagram at finite temperature and chemical potential.
