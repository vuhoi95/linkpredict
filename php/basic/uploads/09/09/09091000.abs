Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Biswajit Chakraborty and Subir Ghosh and Pradip Mukherjee and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: In this review article we discuss some of the applications of noncommutative geometry in physics that are of recent interest, such as noncommutative many-body systems, noncommutative extension of Special Theory of Relativity kinematics, twisted gauge theories and noncommutative gravity.
