Title: Fermion Mass Hierarchy in Lifshitz Type Gauge Theory
Authors: Kunio Kaneta and Yoshiharu Kawamura
Abstract: We study the origin of fermion mass hierarchy and flavor mixing in a Lifshitz type extension of the standard model including an extra scalar field. We show that the hierarchical structure can originate from renormalizable interactions. In contrast to the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, the higher the dimension of associated operators, the heavier the fermion masses. Tiny masses for left-handed neutrinos are obtained without introducing right-handed neutrinos.
