Title: Crossing the phantom divide with k-essence in brane-worlds
Authors: Luis P. Chimento and Monica Forte and Martin G. Richarte
Abstract: We study a flat 3-brane in presence of a linear $k$ field with nonzero cosmological constant $\Lambda_{4}$. In this model the crossing of the phantom divide (PD) occurs when the $k$-essence energy density becomes negative. We show that in the high energy regime the effective equation of state has a resemblance of a modified Chaplygin gas while in the low energy regime it becomes linear. We find a scale factor that begins from a singularity and evolves to a de Sitter stable stage while other solutions have a super-accelerated regime and end with a big rip. We use the energy conditions to show when the effective equation of state of the brane-universe crosses the PD.
