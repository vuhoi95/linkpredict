Title: Quantum complex scalar fields and noncommutativity
Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Everton M. C. Abreu
Abstract: In this work we analyze complex scalar fields using a new framework where the object of noncommutativity $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ represents independent degrees of freedom. In a first quantized formalism, $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and its canonical momentum $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ are seen as operators living in some Hilbert space. This structure is compatible with the minimal canonical extension of the Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts (DFR) algebra and is invariant under an extended Poincar\'e group of symmetry. In a second quantized formalism perspective, we present an explicit form for the extended Poincar\'e generators and the same algebra is generated via generalized Heisenberg relations. We also introduce a source term and construct the general solution for the complex scalar fields using the Green's function technique.
