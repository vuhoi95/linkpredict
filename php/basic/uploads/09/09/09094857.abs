Title: Holographic Superconductor for a Lifshitz fixed point
Authors: Sang-Jin Sin and Shan-Shan Xu and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We consider the gravity dual of strongly coupled system at a Lifshitz-fixed point and finite temperature, which was constructed in a recent work arXiv:0909.0263. We construct an Abelian Higgs model in that background and calculate condensation and conductivity using holographic techniques. We find that condensation happens and DC conductivity blows up when temperature turns below a critical value.
