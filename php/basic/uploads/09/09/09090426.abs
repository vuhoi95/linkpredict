Title: On asymptotic structure at null infinity in five dimensions
Authors: Kentaro Tanabe and Norihiro Tanahashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic structure of null infinity in five dimensional space-time. Since it is known that the conformal infinity is not useful for odd higher dimensions, we shall employ the coordinate based method like the Bondi coordinate firstly introduced in four dimensions. Then we define the null infinity and identify the asymptotic symmetry. We also derive the Bondi mass expression and show its conservation law.
