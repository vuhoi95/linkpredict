Title: Symmetries of asymptotically flat 4 dimensional spacetimes at null  infinity revisited
Authors: Glenn Barnich and Cedric Troessaert
Abstract: It is argued that the symmetry algebra of asymptotically flat spacetimes at null infinity in 4 dimensions should be taken as the semi-direct sum of supertranslations with infinitesimal local conformal transformations and not, as usually done, with the Lorentz algebra. As a consequence, two dimensional conformal field theory techniques will play as fundamental a role in this context of direct physical interest as they do in three dimensional anti-de Sitter gravity.
