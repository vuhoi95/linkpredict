Title: A renormalisable non-anticommutative SU(N)xU(1) gauge theory in  components
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and R. Purdy
Abstract: We discuss the non-anticommutative (N=1/2) supersymmetric SU(N)\otimes U(1) gauge theory including a superpotential. We show how recent proposals for obtaining a renormalisable version of the theory may be implemented in the component formalism at the one-loop level.
