Title: Why not a di-NUT? or Gravitational duality and rotating solutions
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Fran√ßois Dehouck
Abstract: We study how gravitational duality acts on rotating solutions, using the Kerr-NUT black hole as an example. After properly reconsidering how to take into account both electric (i.e. mass-like) and magnetic (i.e. NUT-like) sources in the equations of general relativity, we propose a set of definitions for the dual Lorentz charges. We then show that the Kerr-NUT solution has non-trivial such charges. Further, we clarify in which respect Kerr's source can be seen as a mass M with a dipole of NUT charges.
