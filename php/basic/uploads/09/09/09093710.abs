Title: Euclidean-Minkowskian duality of Wilson-loop correlation functions
Authors: M. Giordano and E. Meggiolaro
Abstract: We discuss the analyticity properties of the Wilson--loop correlation functions relevant to the problem of soft high-energy scattering, directly at the level of the functional integral, in a genuinely nonperturbative way.
