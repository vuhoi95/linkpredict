Title: Gravity duals of 2d supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Daniel Arean and Eduardo Conde and Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We find new supergravity solutions generated by D5-branes wrapping a four-cycle and preserving four and two supersymmetries. We first consider the configuration in which the fivebranes wrap a four-cycle in a Calabi-Yau threefold, which preserves four supersymmetries and is a gravity dual to the Coulomb branch of two-dimensional gauge theories with N=(2,2) supersymmetry. We also study the case of fivebranes wrapping a co-associative four-cycle in a manifold of G_2-holonomy, which provides a gravity dual of N=(1,1) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions. We also discuss the addition of unquenched fundamental matter fields to these backgrounds and find the corresponding gravity solutions with flavor brane sources.
