Title: Quasilocal equilibrium condition for black ring
Authors: Dumitru Astefanesei and Maria J. Rodriguez and Stefan Theisen
Abstract: We use the conservation of the renormalized boundary stress-energy tensor to obtain the equilibrium condition for a general (thin or fat) black ring solution. We also investigate the role of the spatial stress in the thermodynamics of deformation within the quasilocal formalism of Brown and York and discuss the relation with other methods. In particular, we discuss the quantum statistical relation for the unbalanced black ring solution.
