Title: On the superintegrability of the rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
Authors: V. Ayadi and L. Feher
Abstract: The rational and hyperbolic Ruijsenaars-Schneider models and their non-relativistic limits are maximally superintegrable since they admit action variables with globally well-defined canonical conjugates. In the case of the rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider model we present an alternative proof of the superintegrability by explicitly exhibiting extra conserved quantities relying on a generalization of the construction of Wojciechowski for the rational Calogero model.
