Title: Multi-Calorons Revisited
Authors: Atsushi Nakamula and Jun Sakaguchi
Abstract: Analytic Nahm data is re-examined for SU(2) calorons, or periodic instantons, of instanton charge 2. The Nahm equations are solved analytically in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and the possible matching conditions are classified. The dimensions of framed moduli space for charge 2 caloron is enumerated and the maximal parameter, which is 16 for charge 2, case is identified. The monopole and instanton limits are also considered. It is found that the Nahm data which does not correspond to the standard monopoles plays significant role for calorons.
