Title: Soliton creation during a Bose-Einstein condensation
Authors: Bogdan Damski and Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: We use stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation to study dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensation. We show that cooling into a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can create solitons with density given by the cooling rate and by the critical exponents of the transition. Thus, counting solitons left in its wake should allow one to determine the critical exponents z and nu for a BEC phase transition. The same information can be extracted from two-point correlation functions.
