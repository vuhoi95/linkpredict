Title: New exactly solvable relativistic models with anomalous interaction
Authors: Elena Ferraro and Antonino Messina and A. G. Nikitin
Abstract: A special class of Dirac-Pauli equations with time-like vector potentials of external field is investigated. A new exactly solvable relativistic model describing anomalous interaction of a neutral Dirac fermion with a cylindrically symmetric external e.m. field is presented. The related external field is a superposition of the electric field generated by a charged infinite filament and the magnetic field generated by a straight line current. In non-relativistic approximation the considered model is reduced to the integrable Pron'ko-Stroganov model.
