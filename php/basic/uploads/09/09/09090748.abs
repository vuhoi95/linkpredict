Title: Wilson Loops in string duals of Walking and Flavored Systems
Authors: Carlos Nunez and Maurizio Piai and Antonio Rago
Abstract: We consider the VEV of Wilson loop operators by studying the behavior of string probes in solutions of Type IIB string theory generated by Nc D5 branes wrapped on an internal manifold. In particular, we focus on solutions to the background equations that are dual to field theories with a walking gauge coupling as well as for flavored systems. We present in detail our walking solution and emphasize various general aspects of the procedure to study Wilson loops using string duals. We discuss the special features that the strings show when probing the region associated with the walking of the field theory coupling.
