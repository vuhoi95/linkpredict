Title: Bianchi I model in terms of nonstandard loop quantum cosmology:  Classical dynamics
Authors: Piotr Dzierzak and Wlodzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: The cosmological singularities of the Bianchi I universe are analyzed in the setting of loop geometry underlying the loop quantum cosmology. We solve the Hamiltonian constraint of the theory and find the Lie algebra of elementary observables. Physical compound observables are defined in terms of elementary ones. Modification of classical theory by holonomy around a loop removes the singularities. However, our model has a free parameter that cannot be determined within our method. Testing the model by the data of observational cosmology may be possible after quantization of our modified classical theory.
