Title: Cosmological evolution of scalar fields and gravitino dark matter in  gauge mediation at low reheating temperatures
Authors: Andrea Ferrantelli and John McDonald
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of the supersymmetry-breaking scalar field and the production of dark matter gravitinos via its decay in a gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model with metastable vacuum. We find that the scalar field amplitude and gravitino density are extremely sensitive to the parameters of the hidden sector. For the case of an O'Raifeartaigh sector, we show that the observed dark matter density can be explained by gravitinos even for low reheating temperatures T_{R} < 10 GeV. Such low reheating temperatures may be implied by detection of the NLSP at the LHC if its thermal freeze-out density is in conflict with BBN.
