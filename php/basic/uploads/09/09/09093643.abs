Title: Three-dimensional topological field theory and symplectic algebraic  geometry II
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Lev Rozansky
Abstract: Motivated by the path integral analysis of boundary conditions in a 3-dimensional topological sigma-model, we suggest a definition of the 2-category associated with a holomorphic symplectic manifold X and study its properties. The simplest objects of this 2-category are holomorphic lagrangian submanifolds of X. We pay special attention to the case when X is the total space of the cotangent bundle of a complex manifold U or a deformation thereof. In the latter case the endomorphism category of the zero section is a monoidal category which is an A-infinity deformation of the 2-periodic derived category of U.
