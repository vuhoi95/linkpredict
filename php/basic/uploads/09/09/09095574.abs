Title: Kowalevski's analysis of the swinging Atwood's machine
Authors: Olivier Babelon and Michel Talon and Michel Capdequi Peyran√®re
Abstract: We study the Kowalevski expansions near singularities of the swinging Atwood's machine. We show that there is a infinite number of mass ratios $M/m$ where such expansions exist with the maximal number of arbitrary constants. These expansions are of the so--called weak Painlev\'e type. However, in view of these expansions, it is not possible to distinguish between integrable and non integrable cases.
