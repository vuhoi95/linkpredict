Title: Wilson Loops in Gravity Duals of Lifshitz-like Theories
Authors: Peter Koroteev and A. V. Zayakin
Abstract: We calculate Wilson loops on boundaries of Lifshitz-like dual backgrounds with different scaling parameters, assuming existence of a field theory dual to string theory in the bulk. We consider scaling parameters to be variable quantities which are subject to cosmological evolution. It is observed that there are discontinuities in the classical string action at some values of the scaling parameters.
