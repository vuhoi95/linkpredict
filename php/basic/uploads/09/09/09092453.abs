Title: Toda Theories, Matrix Models, Topological Strings, and N=2 Gauge Systems
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Cumrun Vafa
Abstract: We consider the topological string partition function, including the Nekrasov deformation, for type IIB geometries with an A_{n-1} singularity over a Riemann surface. These models realize the N=2 SU(n) superconformal gauge systems recently studied by Gaiotto and collaborators. Employing large N dualities we show why the partition function of topological strings in these backgrounds is captured by the chiral blocks of A_{n-1} Toda systems and derive the dictionary recently proposed by Alday, Gaiotto and Tachikawa. For the case of genus zero Riemann surfaces, we show how these systems can also be realized by Penner-like matrix models with logarithmic potentials. The Seiberg-Witten curve can be understood as the spectral curve of these matrix models which arises holographically at large N. In this context the Nekrasov deformation maps to the beta-ensemble of generalized matrix models, that in turn maps to the Toda system with general background charge. We also point out the notion of a double holography for this system, when both n and N are large.
