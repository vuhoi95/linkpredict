Title: Four-derivative interactions in asymptotically safe gravity
Authors: Dario Benedetti and Pedro F. Machado and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: We summarize recent progress in understanding the role of higher-derivative terms in the asymptotic safety scenario of gravity. Extending previous computations based on the functional renormalization group approach by including a Weyl-squared term in the ansatz for the effective action, further evidence for the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point is found. The fixed point also persists upon including a minimally coupled free scalar field, providing an explicit example of perturbative counterterms being non-hazardous for asymptotic safety.
