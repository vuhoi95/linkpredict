Title: On the energy transported by exact plane gravitational-wave solutions
Authors: Yuri N. Obukhov and J. G. Pereira and Guillermo F. Rubilar
Abstract: The energy and momentum transported by exact plane gravitational-wave solutions of Einstein equations are computed using the teleparallel equivalent formulation of Einstein's theory. It is shown that these waves transport neither energy nor momentum. A comparison with the usual linear plane gravitational-waves solution of the linearized Einstein equation is presented.
