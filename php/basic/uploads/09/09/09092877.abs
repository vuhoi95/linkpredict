Title: WIMPless Dark Matter
Authors: Jonathan L. Feng and Jason Kumar
Abstract: We describe the scenario of WIMPless dark matter. In this scenario of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, a dark matter candidate in the hidden sector is found to naturally have approximately the right relic density to explain astronomical dark matter observations, but with a wide range of possible masses.
