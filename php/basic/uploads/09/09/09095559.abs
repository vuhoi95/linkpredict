Title: On the fermion spectrum of spontaneously generated fuzzy extra  dimensions with fluxes
Authors: Athanasios Chatzistavrakidis and Harold Steinacker and George Zoupanos
Abstract: We consider certain vacua of four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theory with the same field content as the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, resulting from potentials which break the N=4 supersymmetry as well as its global SO(6) symmetry down to SO(3) x SO(3). We show that the theory behaves at intermediate scales as Yang-Mills theory on M^4 x S^2 x S^2, where the extra dimensions are fuzzy spheres with magnetic fluxes. We determine in particular the structure of the zero modes due to the fluxes, which leads to low-energy mirror models.
