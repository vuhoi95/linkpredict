Title: Morita Equivalence of Noncommutative Supertori
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Hoil Kim and Hiroaki Nakajima
Abstract: In this paper we study the extension of Morita equivalence of noncommutative tori to the supersymmetric case. The structure of the symmetry group yielding Morita equivalence appears to be intact but its parameter field becomes supersymmetrized having both body and soul parts. Our result is mainly in the two dimensional case in which noncommutative supertori have been constructed recently: The group $SO(2,2,V_{\Z}^0)$, where $V_{\Z}^0$ denotes Grassmann even number whose body part belongs to ${\Z}$, yields Morita equivalent noncommutative supertori in two dimensions.
