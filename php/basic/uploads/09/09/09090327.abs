Title: Realization of symmetry in the ERG approach to quantum field theory
Authors: Yuji Igarashi and Katsumi Itoh and Hidenori Sonoda
Abstract: We review the use of the exact renormalization group for realization of symmetry in renormalizable field theories. The review consists of three parts. In part I (sects. 2,3,4), we start with the perturbative construction of a renormalizable field theory as a solution of the exact renormalization group (ERG) differential equation. We show how to characterize renormalizability by an appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for a large momentum cutoff. Renormalized parameters are introduced to control the asymptotic behavior. In part II (sects. 5--9), we introduce two formalisms to incorporate symmetry: one by imposing the Ward-Takahashi identity, and another by imposing the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity via sources that generate symmetry transformations. We apply the two formalisms to concrete models such as QED, YM theories, and the Wess-Zumino model in four dimensions, and the O(N) non-linear sigma model in two dimensions. We end this part with calculations of the abelian axial and chiral anomalies. In part III (sects. 10,11), we overview the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism adapted to the Wilson action of a bare theory with a UV cutoff. We provide a few appendices to give details and extensions that can be omitted for the understanding of the main text. The last appendix is a quick summary for the reader's convenience.
