Title: Chaplygin gas and effective description of inhomogeneous universe models  in general relativity
Authors: Xavier Roy and Thomas Buchert
Abstract: In the framework of spatially averaged inhomogeneous cosmologies in classical general relativity, effective Einstein equations govern the dynamics of averaged scalar variables in a scale--dependent way. A particular cosmology may be characterized by a cosmic equation of state, closing the hierarchy of effective equations. In this context a natural candidate is provided by the Chaplygin gas, standing for a unified description of dark energy and dark matter. In this paper, we suppose that the inhomogeneous properties of matter and geometry obey the Chaplygin equation of state. The most extreme interpretation assumes that both dark energy and dark matter are not included as additional sources, but are both manifestations of spatial geometrical properties. This feature is an important conceptual difference in comparison with the standard approach of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe filled with dust and another fundamental field characterized by the Chaplygin equation of state. We finally discuss the consequences of the resulting scenario for effective cosmological parameters in order to establish the framework of a future confrontation with observations, and we note that the standard Chaplygin gas may not be ruled out by them.
