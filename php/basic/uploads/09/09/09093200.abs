Title: Form factors in the presence of integrable defects
Authors: Zoltan Bajnok and Omar el Deeb
Abstract: Form factor axioms are derived in two dimensional integrable defect theories for matrix elements of operators localized both in the bulk and on the defect. The form factors of bulk operators are expressed in terms of the bulk form factors and the transmission factor. The structure of the form factors of defect operators is established in general, and explicitly calculated in particular, for the free boson and for some operator of the Lee-Yang model. Fusion method is also presented to generate boundary form factor solutions for a fused boundary from the known unfused ones.
