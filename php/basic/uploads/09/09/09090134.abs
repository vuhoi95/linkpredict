Title: Geodetic Precession in Squashed Kaluza-Klein Black Hole Spacetimes
Authors: Ken Matsuno and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: We investigate the geodetic precession effect of a parallely transported spin-vector along a circular geodesic in the five-dimensional squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole spacetime. Then we derive the higher-dimensional correction of the precession angle to the general relativity. We find that the correction is proportional to the square of (size of extra dimension)/(gravitational radius of central object).
