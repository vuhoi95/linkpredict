Title: Born-Infeld Black-Body Radiation
Authors: Maryam Hajirahimi and Amir H. Fatollahi
Abstract: The problem of black-body radiation is considered in the Born-Infeld theory of electrodynamics. In particular, at 2-loop order the deviation from the Planck expression due to the self-interaction of photons is calculated. It is seen that the system of interacting photons of the theory, opposed to its non-Abelian counterpart, has higher internal energy at this order of perturbation. Possible implications of the result on the evolution of very hight temperature systems, including various stellar media and the early universe, are briefly discussed.
