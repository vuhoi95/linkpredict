Title: Dynamical Vacuum Selection in String Theory
Authors: David Kutasov and Oleg Lunin and Jock McOrist and Andrew B. Royston
Abstract: We study a system of D-branes localized near an intersection of Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes, that is known to exhibit a landscape of supersymmetric and (metastable) supersymmetry breaking vacua. We show that early universe cosmology drives it to a particular long-lived supersymmetry breaking ground state.
