Title: Z(2) monopoles in SU(n) Yang-Mills-Higgs theories
Authors: Marco A. C. Kneipp and Paulo J. Liebgott
Abstract: Z(n) monopoles are important for the understanding of Goddard-Nuyts-Olive duality when the scalar field is not in the adjoint representation. We analyze the Z(2) monopole solutions in a SU(n) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory spontaneously broken to Spin(n)/Z(2) by a scalar in the n x n representation. We construct a Z(2) monopole asymptotic form for each of the weights of the defining representation of the algebra dual to so(n).
