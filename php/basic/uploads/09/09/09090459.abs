Title: New variables for 1+1 dimensional gravity
Authors: Rodolfo Gambini and Jorge Pullin and Saeed Rastgoo
Abstract: We show that the canonical formulation of a generic action for 1+1-dimensional models of gravity coupled to matter admits a description in terms of Ashtekar-type variables. This includes the CGHS model and spherically symmetric reductions of 3+1 gravity as particular cases. This opens the possibility of discussing models of black hole evaporation using loop representation techniques and verifying which paradigm emerges for the possible elimination of the black hole singularity and the issue of information loss.
