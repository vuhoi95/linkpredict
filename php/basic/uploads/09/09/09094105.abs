Title: Dual unified SU(5)
Authors: Steven Abel and Valentin V. Khoze
Abstract: Despite the compelling simplicity of minimal supersymmetric unification, the proton does not decay as predicted. A possible explanation is that real unification takes place in a theory which is an electric dual of the MSSM GUT with messengers, which has Landau poles below the GUT scale. As was recently pointed out, unification predictions would be transmitted across such a duality, but proton decay would be negligible. In this paper we present electric Seiberg-duals for the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT (plus messengers) that realise this idea, one particularly nice example being an asymptotically free SU(11)xSp(1)^3 model. We also discuss how gauge-mediated metastable supersymmetry breaking can be incorporated into an overall unified picture.
