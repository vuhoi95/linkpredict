Title: Oscillating phantom in $F(R)$ gravity
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Chao-Qiang Geng
Abstract: We investigate the oscillating effective equation of state (EoS) of the universe around the phantom divide in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity. We illustrate the behavior of $F(R)$ with realizing multiple crossings of the phantom divide.
