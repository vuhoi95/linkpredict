Title: Lifshitz Black Hole in Three Dimensions
Authors: E. Ay√≥n-Beato and A. Garbarz and G. Giribet and M. Hassaine
Abstract: We show that three-dimensional massive gravity admits Lifshitz metrics with generic values of the dynamical exponent z as exact solutions. At the point z=3, exact black hole solutions which are asymptotically Lifshitz arise. These spacetimes are three-dimensional analogues of those that were recently proposed as gravity duals for scale invariant fixed points.
