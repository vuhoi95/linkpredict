Title: Maximally supersymmetric solutions of D=4 N=2 gauged supergravity
Authors: Kiril Hristov and Hugo Looyestijn and Stefan Vandoren
Abstract: We determine and analyze maximally supersymmetric configurations in four-dimensional gauged N=2 supergravity, preserving eight supercharges. These models include arbitrary electric gaugings in the vector- and hypermultiplet sectors. We present several examples of such solutions and connect some of them to vacuum solutions of flux compactifications in string theory.
