Title: Two-parameter quantum vertex representations via finite groups and the  McKay correspondence
Authors: Naihuan Jing and Honglian Zhang
Abstract: We introduce two-parameter quantum toroidal algebras of simply laced types and provide their group theoretic realization using finite subgroups of $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ via McKay correspondence. In particular our construction contains a realization of the vertex representation of the two-parameter quantum affine algebras of $ADE$ types.
