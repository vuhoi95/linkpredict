Title: Dual Superconformal Invariance, Momentum Twistors and Grassmannians
Authors: Lionel Mason and David Skinner
Abstract: Dual superconformal invariance has recently emerged as a hidden symmetry of planar scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This symmetry can be made manifest by expressing amplitudes in terms of `momentum twistors', as opposed to the usual twistors that make the ordinary superconformal properties manifest. The relation between momentum twistors and on-shell momenta is algebraic, so the translation procedure does not rely on any choice of space-time signature. We show that tree amplitudes and box coefficients are succinctly generated by integration of holomorphic delta-functions in momentum twistors over cycles in a Grassmannian. This is analogous to, although distinct from, recent results obtained by Arkani-Hamed et al. in ordinary twistor space. We also make contact with Hodges' polyhedral representation of NMHV amplitudes in momentum twistor space.
