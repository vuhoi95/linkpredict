Title: Compact baby skyrmions
Authors: C. Adam and P. Klimas and J. Sanchez-Guillen and A. Wereszczynski
Abstract: For the baby Skyrme model with a specific potential, compacton solutions, i.e., configurations with a compact support and parabolic approach to the vacuum, are derived. Specifically, in the non-topological sector, we find spinning Q-balls and Q-shells, as well as peakons. Moreover, we obtain compact baby skyrmions with non-trivial topological charge. All these solutions may form stable multi-soliton configurations provided they are sufficiently separated.
