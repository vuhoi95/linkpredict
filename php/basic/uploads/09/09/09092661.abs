Title: Conformal Invariance in (2+1)-Dimensional Stochastic Systems
Authors: L. Moriconi and M. Moriconi
Abstract: Stochastic partial differential equations can be used to model second order thermodynamical phase transitions, as well as a number of critical out-of-equilibrium phenomena. In (2+1) dimensions, many of these systems are conjectured (and some are indeed proved) to be described by conformal field theories. We advance, in the framework of the Martin-Siggia-Rose field theoretical formalism of stochastic dynamics, a general solution of the translation Ward identities, which yields a putative conformal energy-momentum tensor. Even though the computation of energy-momentum correlators is obstructed, in principle, by dimensional reduction issues, these are bypassed by the addition of replicated fields to the original (2+1)-dimensional model. The method is illustrated with an application to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) model of surface growth. The consistency of the approach is checked by means of a straightforward perturbative analysis of the KPZ ultraviolet region, leading, as expected, to its $c=1$ conformal fixed point.
