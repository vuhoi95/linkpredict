Title: The minimal B-L model naturally realized at TeV scale
Authors: Satoshi Iso and Nobuchika Okada and Yuta Orikasa
Abstract: In a previous paper, we have proposed the minimal B-L extended standard model as a phenomenologically viable model that realizes the Coleman-Weinberg-type breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Assuming the classical conformal invariance and stability up to the Planck scale, we will show in this paper that the model naturally predicts TeV scale B-L breaking as well as a light standard-model singlet Higgs boson and light right-handed neutrinos around the same energy scale. We also study phenomenology and detectability of the model at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC).
