Title: Matrix Model and beta-deformed N=4 SYM
Authors: G. C. Rossi and M. Siccardi and Ya. S. Stanev and K. Yoshida
Abstract: This work is the result of the ideas developed by Ken Yoshida about the possibility of extending the range of applications of the matrix model approach to the computation of the holomorphic superpotential of the beta-deformed N=4 super Yang-Mills theory both in the presence of a mass term and in the massless limit. Our formulae, while agreeing with all the existing results we can compare with, are valid also in the case of spontaneously broken gauge symmetry. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Ken, an unforgettable friend for all of us and a great scientist.
