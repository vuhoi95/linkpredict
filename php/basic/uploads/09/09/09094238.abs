Title: 2+1 Quantum Gravity with Barbero-Immirzi like parameter on Toric Spatial  Foliation
Authors: Rudranil Basu and Samir K Paul
Abstract: We consider gravity in 2+1 space-time dimensions, with negative cosmological constant and a `Barbero-Immirzi' (B-I) like parameter, when the space-time topology is of the form $ T^2 \times \mathbbm{R}$. The phase space structure, both in covariant and canonical framework is analyzed. Full quantization of the theory in the 'constrain first' approach reveals a finite dimensional physical Hilbert space. An explicit construction of wave functions is presented. The dimension of the Hilbert space is found to depend on the `Barbero-Immirzi' like parameter in an interesting fashion. Comparative study of this parameter in light of some of the recent findings in literarure for similar theories is presented.
