Title: Brane Embeddings in AdS_4 x CP^3
Authors: B. Chandrasekhar and Binata Panda
Abstract: We construct D-brane embeddings in AdS_4 x CP^3 by studying the consistency conditions following from the pull back of target space equations of motion. We explicitly discuss the supersymmetry preserved by these embeddings by analyzing the compatibility of kappa symmetry projections with the target space Killing spinors in each case. The embeddings correspond to AdS/dCFT dualities involving a CFT with a defect. We also comment on the defect CFT.
