Title: Induced vacuum current and magnetic field in the background of a cosmic  string
Authors: Yu. A. Sitenko and N. D. Vlasii
Abstract: Vacuum polarization effects in the cosmic string background are considered. We find that a current is induced in the vacuum of the quantized massive scalar field and that the current circulates around the string which is generalized to a $(d-2)$-brane in locally flat $(d+1)$-dimensional space-time. As a consequence of the Maxwell equation, a magnetic field strength is also induced in the vacuum and is directed along the cosmic string. The dependence of the current and the field strength on the string flux and tension is comprehensively analyzed. Both the current and the field strength are holomorphic functions of the space dimension, decreasing exponentially with the distance from the string. In the case of $d=3$ we show that, due to the vacuum polarization, the cosmic string is enclosed in a tube of the magnetic flux lines if the mass of the quantized field is less than the inverse of the transverse size of the string core.
