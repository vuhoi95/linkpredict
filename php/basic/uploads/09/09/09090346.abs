Title: Bogomolny equations and conformal transformations in curved space
Authors: P. -M. Zhang and P. A. Horv√°thy
Abstract: The coupling of the Higgs field through the Ricci tensor, put forward by Balakrishna and Wali, is derived using a conformal rescaling of the metric. Earlier results on "Bogomolny-type" equations in curved space, by Comtet, and others, are recovered. The procedure can be generalized to any static background metric.
