Title: Analogue Models for Emergent Gravity
Authors: Stefano Liberati and Florian Girelli and Lorenzo Sindoni
Abstract: Gravity stands out among the fundamental interactions because of its apparent incompatibility with having a quantum description. Moreover, thermodynamic aspects of gravitation theory appears as puzzling features of some classical solutions such as black holes. These and other aspects of gravitational theories have recently lead to the proposal that gravity might not be a fundamental interaction but rather an emergent phenomenon, a sort of hydrodynamic limit of some more fundamental theory. In order to further explore this possibility we shall here discuss two systems where such emergence of a gravitational dynamics is observed. We shall consider first the case of a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate and then a more abstract model based on scalar fields living on a Riemannian manifold. This will allow us to put in evidence the general issues related to emergent gravity scenarios with a particular attention to the role and nature of Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance.
