Title: Naturally Light Hidden Photons in LARGE Volume String Compactifications
Authors: Mark Goodsell and Joerg Jaeckel and Javier Redondo and Andreas Ringwald
Abstract: Extra "hidden" U(1) gauge factors are a generic feature of string theory that is of particular phenomenological interest. They can kinetically mix with the Standard Model photon and are thereby accessible to a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological observations and laboratory experiments. In this paper we investigate the masses and the kinetic mixing of hidden U(1)s in LARGE volume compactifications of string theory. We find that in these scenarios the hidden photons can be naturally light and that their kinetic mixing with the ordinary electromagnetic photon can be of a size interesting for near future experiments and observations.
