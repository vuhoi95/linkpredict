Title: Solitons in Five Dimensional Minimal Supergravity: Local Charge, Exotic  Ergoregions, and Violations of the BPS Bound
Authors: Geoffrey Comp√®re and Keith Copsey and Sophie de Buyl and Robert B. Mann
Abstract: We describe a number of striking features of a class of smooth solitons in gauged and ungauged minimal supergravity in five dimensions. The solitons are globally asymptotically flat or asymptotically AdS without any Kaluza-Klein directions but contain a minimal sphere formed when a cycle pinches off in the interior of the spacetime. The solutions carry a local magnetic charge and many have rather unusual ergosurfaces. Perhaps most strikingly, many of the solitons have more electric charge or, in the asymptotically AdS case, more electric charge and angular momentum than is allowed by the usual BPS bound. We comment on, but do not resolve, the new puzzle this raises for AdS/CFT.
