Title: Charged Kaluza-Klein double-black holes in five dimensions
Authors: Cristian Stelea and Kristin Schleich and Donald Witt
Abstract: Using a solution generating technique based on the symmetries of the dimensionally reduced Lagrangian we derive an exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton field equations in five dimensions describing a system of two general non-extremally charged static Kaluza-Klein black holes with spherical horizons. We investigate some of its thermodynamic properties and we also show how to recover various known solutions in particular cases.
