Title: Noncommutative Relativistic U(N) Chern-Simons Solitons
Authors: Ee Chang-Young and Kyoungtae Kimm and Daeho Lee and Youngone Lee
Abstract: We investigate BPS soliton solutions of U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to a scalar field in noncommutative plane. With a scalar field in the fundamental representation, we show that the BPS equation becomes that of abelian Chern-Simons theory in the unitary gauge. We also find a class of particular solutions for the BPS equation with scalar field in the adjoint representation.
