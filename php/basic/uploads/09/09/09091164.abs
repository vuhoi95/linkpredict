Title: Universal Algebras of Hurwitz Numbers
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov and S. Natanzon
Abstract: Infinite-dimensional universal Cardy-Frobenius algebra is constructed, which unifies all particular algebras of closed and open Hurwitz numbers and is closely related to the algebra of differential operators, familiar from the theory of Generalized Kontsevich Model.
