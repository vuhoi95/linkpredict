Title: Lie algebraic deformations of Minkowski space with Poincare algebra
Authors: S. Meljanac and D. Meljanac and A. Samsarov and M. Stojic
Abstract: We present Lie-algebraic deformations of Minkowski space with undeformed Poincar\'{e} algebra. These deformations interpolate between Snyder and $\kappa$-Minkowski space. We find realizations of noncommutative coordinates in terms of commutative coordinates and derivatives. Invariants and tensors with respect to Lorentz algebra are discussed. A general mapping from $\kappa$-deformed Snyder to Snyder space is constructed. Deformed Leibniz rule, the coproduct structure and star product are found. Special cases, particularly Snyder and $\kappa$-Minkowski in Maggiore-type realizations are discussed.
