Title: M5-brane Solution in ABJM Theory and Three-algebra
Authors: Seiji Terashima and Futoshi Yagi
Abstract: We construct a new classical solution in the ABJM theory corresponding to M5-branes with a non-zero self-dual three form flux. This is an M-theory lift of the D4-brane solution expressed as a non-commutative plane in the three dimensional super Yang-Mills theory. We discuss that our solution is closely related with the three-algebra. We show that the corresponding configuration of the M5-brane satisfies the equations of motion in the single M5-brane action. We find the agreement between the tension of the M5-brane solution in the ABJM action and the one computed from the single M5-brane action.
