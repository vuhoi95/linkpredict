Title: Study on Noncommutative Representations of Galilean Generators
Authors: Sarmistha Kumar and Saurav Samanta
Abstract: The representations of Galilean generators are constructed on a space where both position and momentum coordinates are noncommutating operators. A dynamical model invariant under noncommutative phase space transformations is constructed. The Dirac brackets of this model reproduce the original noncommutative algebra. Also, the generators in terms of noncommutative phase space variables are abstracted from this model in a consistent manner. Finally, the role of Jacobi identities is emphasised to produce the noncommuting structure that occurs when an electron is subjected to a constant magnetic field and Berry curvature.
