Title: An elementary proof of the non-renormalization theorem for the  Wess-Zumino model
Authors: Hidenori Sonoda and Kayhan Ulker
Abstract: Using the exact renormalization group (ERG) differential equation, we give an elementary proof of the non-renormalization theorem for the Wess-Zumino model. We introduce auxiliary fields to linearize the supersymmetry transformation, but we do not rely on the superfield techniques. We give sufficient background material on the Wilson action and the ERG formalism to make the paper self-contained.
