Title: Particle Kinematics in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Dario Capasso and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We study the deformed kinematics of point particles in the Horava theory of gravity. This is achieved by considering particles as the optical limit of fields with a generalized Klein-Gordon action. We derive the deformed geodesic equation and study in detail the cases of flat and spherically symmetric (Schwarzschild-like) spacetimes. As the theory is not invariant under local Lorenz transformations, deviations from standard kinematics become evident even for flat manifolds, supporting superluminal as well as massive luminal particles. These deviations from standard behavior could be used for experimental tests of this modified theory of gravity.
