Title: Particle spectrum of the 3-state Potts field theory: a numerical study
Authors: Luca Lepori and Gabor Zsolt Toth and Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: The three-state Potts field theory in two dimensions with thermal and magnetic perturbations provides the simplest model of confinement allowing for both mesons and baryons, as well as for an extended phase with deconfined quarks. We study numerically the evolution of the mass spectrum of this model over its whole parameter range, obtaining a pattern of confinement, particle decay and phase transitions which confirms recent predictions.
