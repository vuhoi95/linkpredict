Title: On condensation of charged scalars in D=3 dimensions
Authors: Patricio Gaete and José A. Helaÿel-Neto
Abstract: By using the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables formalism, we study the impact of condensates on physical observables for a three-dimensional Higgs-like model. As a result, for the case of a physical mass term like $m_H^2 \phi ^ * \phi$, we recover a screening potential. Interestingly enough, in the case of a "wrong-sign" mass term $- m_H^2 \phi ^ * \phi$, unexpected features are found. It is shown that the interaction energy is the sum of an effective-Bessel and a linear potential, leading to the confinement of static charges. However, when a Chern-Simons term is included, the surprising result is that the theory describes an exactly screening phase.
