Title: Hydrodynamic Long-Time tails From Anti de Sitter Space
Authors: Simon Caron-Huot and Omid Saremi
Abstract: For generic field theories at finite temperature, a power-law falloff of correlation functions of conserved currents at long times is a prediction of non-linear hydrodynamics. We demonstrate, through a one-loop computation in Einstein gravity in Anti de Sitter space, that this effect is reproduced by the dynamics of black hole horizons. The result is in agreement with the gauge-gravity correspondence.
