Title: Defect lines, dualities, and generalised orbifolds
Authors: Jürg Fröhlich and Jürgen Fuchs and Ingo Runkel and Christoph Schweigert
Abstract: Defects are a useful tool in the study of quantum field theories. This is illustrated in the example of two-dimensional conformal field theories. We describe how defect lines and their junction points appear in the description of symmetries and order-disorder dualities, as well as in the orbifold construction and a generalisation thereof that covers exceptional modular invariants.
