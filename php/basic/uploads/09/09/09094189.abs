Title: The Phase Diagram for Wess-Zumino Models
Authors: Franziska Synatschke and Holger Gies and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is an important issue for applications of supersymmetry in particle physics. The functional renormalization group equations allow for a nonperturbative approach that leaves supersymmetry intact. Therefore they offer a promising tool to investigate dynamical supersymmetry breaking. Here we will employ this method to derive the phase diagram and a surprisingly rich RG fixed-point structure with corresponding critical exponents for the $\mathcal N=1$ Wess-Zumino model in two dimensions.
