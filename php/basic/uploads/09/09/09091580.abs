Title: M2-branes and AdS/CFT
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Giuseppe Torri
Abstract: These notes provide a brief introduction to the ABJM theory, the level k U(N) x U(N) superconformal Chern-Simons matter theory which has been conjectured to describe N coincident M2-branes. We discuss its dual formulation in terms of M-theory on AdS_4 x S^7/Z_k and review some of the evidence in favor of the conjecture. We end with a brief discussion of the important role played by the monopole operators.
