Title: Braided Statistics from Abelian Twist in $Îº$-Minkowski Spacetime
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Youngone Lee and Chaiho Rim
Abstract: $\kappa$-deformed commutation relation between quantum operators is constructed via abelian twist deformation in $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. The commutation relation is written in terms of universal $R$-matrix satisfying braided statistics. The equal-time commutator function turns out to vanish in this framework.
