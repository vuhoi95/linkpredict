Title: Black funnels and droplets from the AdS C-metrics
Authors: Veronika E. Hubeny and Donald Marolf and Mukund Rangamani
Abstract: We recently argued that the dynamics of strongly coupled field theories in black hole backgrounds is related via the AdS/CFT correspondence to two new classes of AdS black hole solutions: black funnels, and black droplets suspended above a second disconnected horizon. The funnel solutions are dual to black holes coupling strongly to a field theory plasma. In contrast, the droplet solutions describe black holes coupling only weakly. We continue our investigation of these solutions and construct a wide variety of examples from the AdS C-metric in four bulk spacetime dimensions. The solutions we find are dual to field theories on spatially compact universes with Killing horizons.
