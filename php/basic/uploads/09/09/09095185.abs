Title: Non-supersymmetric extremal multicenter black holes with superpotentials
Authors: Pietro Galli and Jan Perz
Abstract: Using the superpotential approach we generalize Denef's method of deriving and solving first-order equations describing multicenter extremal black holes in four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity to allow non-supersymmetric solutions. We illustrate the general results with an explicit example of the stu model.
