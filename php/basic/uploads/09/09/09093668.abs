Title: Infinitely many shape invariant discrete quantum mechanical systems and  new exceptional orthogonal polynomials related to the Wilson and Askey-Wilson  polynomials
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: Two sets of infinitely many exceptional orthogonal polynomials related to the Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials are presented. They are derived as the eigenfunctions of shape invariant and thus exactly solvable quantum mechanical Hamiltonians, which are deformations of those for the Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials in terms of a degree \ell (\ell=1,2,...) eigenpolynomial. These polynomials are exceptional in the sense that they start from degree \ell\ge1 and thus not constrained by any generalisation of Bochner's theorem.
