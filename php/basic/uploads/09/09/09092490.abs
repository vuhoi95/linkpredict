Title: Dynamical evolution of scalar perturbation in Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz  black-hole spacetimes
Authors: Chikun Ding and Songbai Chen and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of a massless scalar perturbation in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black-hole spacetimes with the coupling constants $\lambda={1/3}$, $\lambda={1/2}$ and $\lambda=3$, respectively. Our calculation shows that, for the three cases, the scalar perturbations decay without any oscillation in which the decay rate imprints the parameter of the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black hole. The results are quite different from those in the Schwarzschild AdS black hole and can help us understand more about the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
