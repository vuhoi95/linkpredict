Title: Light Moduli in Almost No-Scale Models
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Jan Moller and Jonas Schmidt
Abstract: We discuss the stabilization of the compact dimension for a class of five-dimensional orbifold supergravity models. Supersymmetry is broken by the superpotential on a boundary. Classically, the size $L$ of the fifth dimension is undetermined, with or without supersymmetry breaking, and the effective potential is of no-scale type. The size $L$ is fixed by quantum corrections to the K\"ahler potential, the Casimir energy and Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms localized at the boundaries. For an FI scale of order $M_\mathrm{GUT}$, as in heterotic string compactifications with anomalous $\U1$ symmetries, one obtains $L \sim 1/M_\mathrm{GUT}$. A small mass is predicted for the scalar fluctuation associated with the fifth dimension, $m_{\rho} \lesssim m_{3/2}/(L M)$.
