Title: Quark electric dipole moment induced by magnetic field

Abstract: We show numerically that quarks develop an electric dipole moment in the direction of a sufficiently intense magnetic field due to local fluctuations of topological charge. This anomalous CP-odd effect is a spin analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in QCD.
