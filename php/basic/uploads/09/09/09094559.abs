Title: Exact Results for Wilson Loops in Superconformal Chern-Simons Theories  with Matter
Authors: Anton Kapustin and Brian Willett and Itamar Yaakov
Abstract: We use localization techniques to compute the expectation values of supersymmetric Wilson loops in Chern-Simons theories with matter. We find the path-integral reduces to a non-Gaussian matrix model. The Wilson loops we consider preserve a single complex supersymmetry, and exist in any N=2 theory, though the localization requires superconformal symmetry. We present explicit results for the cases of pure Chern-Simons theory with gauge group U(N), showing agreement with the known results, and ABJM, showing agreement with perturbative calculations. Our method applies to other theories, such as Gaiotto-Witten theories, BLG, and their variants.
