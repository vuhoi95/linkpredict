Title: Liouville/Toda central charges from M5-branes
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Francesco Benini and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We show that the central charge of the Liouville and ADE Toda theories can be reproduced by equivariantly integrating the anomaly eight-form of the corresponding six-dimensional N=(0,2) theories, which describe the low-energy dynamics of M5-branes.
