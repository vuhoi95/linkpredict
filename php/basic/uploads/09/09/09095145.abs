Title: New self-dual solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in Euclidean  Schwarzschild space
Authors: Ricardo A. Mosna and Gustavo Marques Tavares
Abstract: We present a systematic study of spherically symmetric self-dual solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on Euclidean Schwarzschild space. All the previously known solutions are recovered and a new one-parameter family of instantons is obtained. The newly found solutions have continuous actions and interpolate between the classic Charap and Duff instantons. We examine the physical properties of this family and show that it consists of dyons of unit (magnetic and electric) charge.
