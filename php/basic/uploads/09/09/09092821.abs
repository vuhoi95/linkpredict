Title: Emergent universe from the Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Puxun Wu and Hongwei Yu
Abstract: We study the stability of the Einstein static universe in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity and a generalized version of it formulated by Sotiriou, Visser and Weifurtner. We find that, for the HL cosmology, there exists a stable Einstein static state if the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is negative. The universe can stay at this stable state eternally and thus the big bang singularity can be avoided. However, in this case, the Universe can not exit to an inflationary era. For the Sotiriou, Visser and Weifurtner HL cosmology, if the cosmic scale factor satisfies certain conditions initially, the Universe can stay at the stable state past eternally and may undergo a series of infinite, nonsingular oscillations. Once the parameter of the equation of state $w$ approaches a critical value, the stable critical point coincides with the unstable one, and the Universe enters an inflationary era. Therefore, the big bang singularity can be avoided and a subsequent inflation can occur naturally.
