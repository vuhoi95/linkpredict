Title: Interacting agegraphic quintessence dark energy in non-flat universe
Authors: A. Sheykhi and A. Bagheri and M. M. Yazdanpanah
Abstract: We suggest a correspondence between interacting agegraphic dark energy models and the quintessence scalar field in a non-flat universe. We demonstrate that the agegraphic evolution of the universe can be described completely by a single quintessence scalar field. Then, we reconstruct the potential of the interacting agegraphic quintessence dark energy as well as the dynamics of the scalar field according to the evolution of the agegraphic dark energy.
