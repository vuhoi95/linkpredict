Abstract: We study the size dependence of the dynamical symmetry breaking in the four-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the presence of boundaries reduces the chiral breaking region, and this effect is strengthened for a larger number of compactified dimensions. A critical value for the length of the compactified dimensions exists, below which the dynamical symmetry breaking is not possible. Considering finite temperature and chemical potential, the chiral phase structure for the system with compactified dimensions is obtained. A gradual decreasing of the chiral breaking region with increasing of chemical potential is found. Also, at fixed chemical potential, the decreasing of the size of the system changes the order of the chiral phase transition.
