Title: Kerr Black Holes as Particle Accelerators to Arbitrarily High Energy
Authors: Máximo Bañados and Joseph Silk and Stephen M. West
Abstract: We show that intermediate mass black holes conjectured to be the early precursors of supermassive black holes and surrounded by relic cold dark matter density spikes can act as particle accelerators with collisions, in principle, at arbitrarily high centre of mass energies in the case of Kerr black holes. While the ejecta from such interactions will be highly redshifted, we may anticipate the possibility of a unique probe of Planck-scale physics.
