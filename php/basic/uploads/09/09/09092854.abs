Abstract: We study CPT- and Lorentz-odd electrodynamics described by the Standard Model Extension. Its radiation is confined to the geometry of hollow conductor waveguide, open along $z$. In a special class of reference frames, with vanishing both 0-th and $z$ components of the background field, $(k_{\rm AF})^\mu$, we realize a number of {\em huge and macroscopically detectable} effects on the confined waves spectra, compared to standard results. Particularly, if $(k_{\rm AF})^\mu$ points along $x$ (or $y$) direction only transverse electric modes, with $E_z=0$, should be observed propagating throughout the guide, while all the transverse magnetic, $B_z=0$, are absent. Such a strong mode suppression makes waveguides quite suitable to probe these symmetry violations using a simple and easily reproducible apparatus.
