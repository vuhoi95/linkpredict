Title: Quantum Yang-Mills Condensate Dark Energy Models
Authors: W. Zhao and Y. Zhang and M. L. Tong
Abstract: We review the quantum Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) dark energy models. As the effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian is completely determined by the quantum field theory, there is no adjustable parameter in the model except the energy scale. In this model, the equation-of-state (EOS) of the YMC dark energy, $w_y > -1$ and $w_y < -1$, can both be naturally realized. By studying the evolution of various components in the model, we find that, in the early stage of the universe, dark energy tracked the evolution of the radiation, i.e. $w_y \to 1/3$. However, in the late stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state with $w_y = -1$, and the universe transits from matter-dominated into dark energy dominated stage only at recently $z \sim 0.3$. These characters are independent of the choice of the initial condition, and the cosmic coincidence problem is avoided in the models. We also find that, if the possible interaction between YMC and dust matter is considered, the late time attractor solution may exist. In this case, the EOS of YMC must evolve from $w_y>0$ into $w_y < -1$, which is slightly suggested by the observations. At the same time, the total EOS in the attractor solution is $w_{tot} = -1$, the universe being the de Sitter expansion in the late stage, and the cosmic big rip is naturally avoided. These features are all independent of the interacting forms.
