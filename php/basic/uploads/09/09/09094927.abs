Title: Constraints on Lorentz invariance violation from gamma-ray burst  GRB090510
Authors: Zhi Xiao and Bo-Qiang Ma
Abstract: We obtain modified dispersion relations by requiring the vanishing of determinant of inverse of modified photon propagators in Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory. Inspired by these dispersion relations, we give a more general dispersion relation with less assumption and apply it to the recent observed gamma-ray burst GRB090510 to extract various constraints on LIV parameters. We find that the constraint on quantum gravity mass is slightly larger than the Planck mass but is consistent with the other recent observations, so the corresponding LIV coefficient $\xi_1$ has reached the natural order ($o(1)$) as one expects. From our analysis, the linear LIV corrections to photon group velocity might be not excluded yet.
