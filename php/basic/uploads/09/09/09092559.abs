Title: A (Running) Bolt for New Reasons
Authors: Iosif Bena and Stefano Giusto and Clement Ruef and Nicholas P. Warner
Abstract: We construct a four-parameter family of smooth, horizonless, stationary solutions of ungauged five-dimensional supergravity by using the four-dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild metric as a base space and "magnetizing" its bolt. We then generalize this to a five-parameter family based upon the Euclidean Kerr-Taub-Bolt. These "running Bolt" solutions are necessarily non-static. They also have the same charges and mass as a non-extremal black hole with a classically-large horizon area. Moreover, in a certain regime their mass can decrease as their charges increase. The existence of these solutions supports the idea that the singularities of non-extremal black holes are resolved by low-mass modes that correct the singularity of the classical black hole solution on large (horizon-sized) scales.
