Title: An analytic Lifshitz black hole
Authors: Koushik Balasubramanian and John McGreevy
Abstract: A Lifshitz point is described by a quantum field theory with anisotropic scale invariance (but not Galilean invariance). In arXiv:0808.1725, gravity duals were conjectured for such theories. We construct analytically a black hole which asymptotes to a vacuum Lifshitz solution; this black hole solves the equations of motion of some simple (but somewhat strange) extensions of the models of arXiv:0808.1725. We study its thermodynamics and scalar response functions. The scalar wave equation turns out to be exactly solvable. Interestingly, the Green's functions do not exhibit the ultralocal behavior seen previously in the free Lifshitz scalar theory.
