Title: Phase-space analysis of Horava-Lifshitz cosmology
Authors: Genly Leon and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We perform a detailed phase-space analysis of Horava-Lifshitz cosmology, with and without the detailed-balance condition. Under detailed-balance we find that the universe can reach a bouncing-oscillatory state at late times, in which dark-energy, behaving as a simple cosmological constant, is dominant. In the case where the detailed-balance condition is relaxed, we find that the universe reaches an eternally expanding, dark-energy-dominated solution, with the oscillatory state preserving also a small probability. Although this analysis indicates that Horava-Lifshitz cosmology can be compatible with observations, it does not enlighten the discussion about its possible conceptual and theoretical problems.
