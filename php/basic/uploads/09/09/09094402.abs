Title: Moduli spaces of noncommutative instantons: gauging away noncommutative  parameters
Authors: Simon Brain and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: Using the theory of noncommutative geometry in a braided monoidal category, we improve upon a previous construction of noncommutative families of instantons of arbitrary charge on the deformed sphere S^4_\theta. We formulate a notion of noncommutative parameter spaces for families of instantons and we explore what it means for such families to be gauge equivalent, as well as showing how to remove gauge parameters using a noncommutative quotient construction. Although the parameter spaces are a priori noncommutative, we show that one may always recover a classical parameter space by making an appropriate choice of gauge transformation.
