Title: Dirac Gauginos and Kinetic Mixing
Authors: K. Benakli and M. D. Goodsell
Abstract: We present formulae for the calculation of Dirac gaugino masses at leading order in the supersymmetry breaking scale using the methods of analytic continuation in superspace and demonstrate a link with kinetic mixing, even for non-abelian gauginos. We illustrate the result through examples in field and string theory. We discuss the possibility that the singlet superfield that gives the U(1) gaugino a Dirac mass may be a modulus, and some consequences of the D-term coupling to the scalar component. We give examples of possible effects in colliders and astroparticle experiments if the modulus scalar constitutes decaying dark matter.
