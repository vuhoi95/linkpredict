Title: Canonical supergravity with Barbero-Immirzi parameter
Authors: Sandipan Sengupta and Romesh K. Kaul
Abstract: A canonical formulation of the N=1 supergravity theory containing the topological Nieh-Yan term in its Lagrangian density is developed. The constraints are analysed without choosing any gauge. In the time gauge, the theory is shown to be described in terms of real SU(2) variables.
