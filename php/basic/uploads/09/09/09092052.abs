Title: On non-conformal limit of the AGT relations
Authors: A. Marshakov and A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: The Seiberg-Witten prepotentials for N=2 SUSY gauge theories with N_f<2N_c fundamental multiplets are obtained from conformal N_f=2N_c theory by decoupling 2N_c-N_f multiplets of heavy matter. This procedure can be lifted to the level of Nekrasov functions with arbitrary background parameters epsilon_1 and epsilon_2. The AGT relations imply that similar limit exists for conformal blocks (or, for generic N_c>2, for the blocks in conformal theories with W_{N_c} chiral algebra). We consider the limit of the four-point function explicitly in the Virasoro case of N_c=2, by bringing the dimensions of external states to infinity. The calculation is performed entirely in terms of representation theory for the Virasoro algebra and reproduces the answers conjectured in arXiv:0908.0307 with the help of the brane-compactification analysis and computer simulations. In this limit, the conformal block involving four external primaries, corresponding to the theory with vanishing beta-function, turns either into a 2-point or 3-point function, with certain coherent rather than primary external states.
