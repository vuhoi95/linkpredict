Abstract: Under the hypotheses of analyticity, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with the requirement that the interaction vertices contain at most two spatiotemporal derivatives of the fields, we investigate the consistent selfinteractions that can be added to a collection of massless tensor fields with the mixed symmetry (3,1) and respectively (2,2). The computations are done with the help of the deformation theory based on a cohomological approach, in the context of the antifield-BRST formalism. Our result is that no selfinteractions that deform the original gauge transformations emerge. In the case of the collection of (2,2) tensor fields it is possible to add a sum of cosmological terms to the free Lagrangian.
