Title: The k-Minkowski Spacetime: Trace, Classical Limit and uncertainty  Relations
Authors: Ludwik Dabrowski and Gherardo Piacitelli
Abstract: Starting from a discussion of the concrete representations of the coordinates of the k-Minkowski spacetime (in 1+1 dimensions, for simplicity), we explicitly compute the associated Weyl operators as functions of a pair of Schroedinger operators. This allows for explicitly computing the trace of a quantised function of spacetime. Moreover, we show that in the classical (i.e. large scale) limit the origin of space is a topologically isolated point, so that the resulting classical spacetime is disconnected. Finally we show that there exist states with arbitrarily sharp simultaneous localisation in all the coordinates; in other words, an arbitrarily high energy density can be transferred to spacetime by means of localisation alone, which amounts to say that the model is not stable under localisation.
