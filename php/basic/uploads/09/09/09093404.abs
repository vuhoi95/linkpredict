Title: New relations for correlation functions in Navier-Stokes turbulence
Authors: Gregory Falkovich and Itzhak Fouxon and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider the steady-state statistics of turbulence sustained by a large-scale force. The Kolmogorov flux relation (4/5-law) is shown to be a particular case of the general relation on the current-density correlation function. Using that, we derive an analog of the flux relation for compressible turbulence and a new exact relation for incompressible turbulence.
