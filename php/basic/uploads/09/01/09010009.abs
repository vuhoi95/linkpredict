Title: A note on dual giant gravitons in $AdS_{4}\times \mathbb{CP}^{3}$
Authors: A. Hamilton and J. Murugan and A. Prinsloo and M. Strydom
Abstract: We study some of the properties of dual giant gravitons - D2-branes wrapped on an $S^{2}\subset AdS_{4}$ - in type IIA string theory on $AdS_{4}\times \mathbb{CP}^{3}$. In particular we confirm that the spectrum of small fluctuations about the giant is both real and independent of the size of the graviton. We also extend previously developed techniques for attaching open strings to giants to this D2-brane giant and focus on two particular limits of the resulting string sigma model: In the pp-wave limit we quantize the string and compute the spectrum of bosonic excitations while in the semiclassical limit, we read off the fast string Polyakov action and comment on the comparison to the Landau-Lifshitz action for the dual open spin chain.
