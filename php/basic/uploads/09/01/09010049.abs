Title: Scalar Field theory in $Îº$-Minkowski spacetime from twist
Authors: Hyeong-Chan Kim and Youngone Lee and Chaiho Rim and Jae Hyung Yee
Abstract: Using the twist deformation of $U(igl(4,R))$, the linear part of the diffeomorphism, we define a scalar function and construct a free scalar field theory in four-dimensional $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. The action in momentum space turns out to differ only in integration measure from the commutative theory.
