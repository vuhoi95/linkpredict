Title: Momentum signatures for Schwinger pair production in short laser pulses  with a sub-cycle structure

Abstract: We investigate electron-positron pair production from vacuum for short laser pulses with sub-cycle structure, in the nonperturbative regime (Schwinger pair production). We use the non-equilibrium quantum kinetic approach, and show that the momentum spectrum of the created electron-positron pairs is extremely sensitive to the sub-cycle dynamics -- depending on the laser frequency $\omega$, the pulse length $\tau$, and the carrier phase $\phi$ -- and shows several distinctive new signatures. This observation could help not only in the design of laser pulses to optimize the experimental signature of Schwinger pair production, but also ultimately lead to new probes of light pulses at extremely short time scales.
