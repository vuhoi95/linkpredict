Title: Can quantum mechanics be an emergent phenomenon?
Authors: Massimo Blasone and Petr Jizba and Fabio Scardigli
Abstract: We raise the issue whether conventional quantum mechanics, which is not a hidden variable theory in the usual Jauch-Piron's sense, might nevertheless be a hidden variable theory in the sense recently conjectured by G. 't Hooft in his pre-quantization scheme. We find that quantum mechanics might indeed have a fully deterministic underpinning by showing that Born's rule naturally emerges (i.e., it is not postulated) when 't Hooft's Hamiltonian for be-ables is combined with the Koopmann - von Neumann operatorial formulation of classical physics.
