Title: Nonpropagation of massive mode on AdS2 in topologically massive gravity
Authors: Yong-Wan Kim and Yun Soo Myung and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: Making use of Achucarro-Ortiz (AO) type of dimensional reduction, we study the topologically massive gravity with a negative cosmological constant on AdS2 spacetimes. For a constant dilaton, this two-dimensional model also admits three AdS2 vacuum solutions, which are related to two AdS3 and warped AdS3 backgrounds with an identification upon uplifting three dimensions. We carry out the perturbation analysis around these backgrounds to find what is a physically propagating field. However, it turns out that there is no propagating massive mode on AdS2 background, in contrast to the Kaluza-Klein (KK) type of dimensional reduction. We note that two dimensionally reduced actions are different and thus, the non-equivalence of their on-shell amplitudes is obtained.
