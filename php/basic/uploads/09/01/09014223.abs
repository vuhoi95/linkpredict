Title: Triangular invariants, three-point functions and particle stability on  the de Sitter universe
Authors: Jacques Bros and Henri Epstein and Michel Gaudin and Ugo Moschella and Vincent Pasquier
Abstract: We study a class of three-point functions on the de Sitter universe and on the asymptotic cone. A blending of geometrical ideas and analytic methods is used to compute some remarkable integrals, on the basis of a generalized star-triangle identity living on the cone and on the complex de Sitter manifold. We discuss an application of the general results to the study of the stability of scalar particles on the Sitter universe.
