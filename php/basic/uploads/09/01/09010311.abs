Title: Extremal Kerr black hole/CFT correspondence in the five dimensional  Gödel universe
Authors: Jun-Jin Peng and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: We extend the method of Kerr/CFT correspondence recently proposed in arXiv:0809.4266 [hep-th] to the extremal (charged) Kerr black hole embedded in the five-dimensional G\"{o}del universe. With the aid of the central charges in the Virasoro algebra and the Frolov-Thorne temperatures, together with the use of the Cardy formula, we have obtained the microscopic entropies that precisely agree with the ones macroscopically calculated by Bekenstein-Hawking area law.
