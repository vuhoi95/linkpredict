Title: Confinement, Turbulence and Diffraction Catastrophes
Authors: Jean-Paul Blaizot and Maciej A. Nowak
Abstract: Many features of large N_c transition that occurs in the spectral density of Wilson loops as a function of loop area (observed recently in numerical simulations of Yang-Mills theory by Narayanan and Neuberger) can be captured by a simple Burgers equation used to model turbulence. Spectral shock waves that precede this asymptotic limit exhibit universal scaling with N_c, with indices that can be related to Berry indices for diffraction catastrophes.
