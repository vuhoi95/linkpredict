Title: Pion masses in quasiconformal gauge field theories
Authors: Dennis D. Dietrich and Matti Jarvinen
Abstract: We study modifications to Weinberg-like sum rules in quasiconformal gauge field theories. Beyond the two Weinberg sum rules and the oblique S parameter we study the pion mass and the X parameter. Especially, we evaluate the pion mass for walking technicolour theories, in particular also minimal walking technicolour, and find contributions of the order of up to several hundred GeV.
