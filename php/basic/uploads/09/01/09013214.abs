Title: On a Classification of Irreducible Almost-Commutative Geometries V
Authors: Jan-Hendrik Jureit and Christoph A. Stephan
Abstract: We extend a classification of irreducible, almost-commutative geometries whose spectral action is dynamically non-degenerate, to internal algebras that have six simple summands. We find essentially four particle models: An extension of the standard model by a new species of fermions with vectorlike coupling to the gauge group and gauge invariant masses, two versions of the electro-strong model and a variety of the electro-strong model with Higgs mechanism.
