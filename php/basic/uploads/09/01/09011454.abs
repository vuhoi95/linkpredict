Title: Rigorous Definition of Quantum Field Operators in Noncommutative Quantum  Field Theory
Authors: M. N. Mnatsakanova and Yu. S. Vernov
Abstract: The space, on which quantum field operators are given, is constructed in any theory, in which the usual product between test functions is substituted by the $\star$-product (the Moyal-type product). The important example of such a theory is noncommutative quantum field theory (NC QFT). This construction is the key point in the derivation of the Wightman reconstruction theorem.
