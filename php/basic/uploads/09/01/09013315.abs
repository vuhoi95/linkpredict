Title: Coherent states in noncommutative quantum mechanics
Authors: J Ben Geloun and F G Scholtz
Abstract: Gazeau-Klauder coherent states in noncommutative quantum mechanics are considered. We find that these states share similar properties to those of ordinary canonical coherent states in the sense that they saturate the related position uncertainty relation, obey a Poisson distribution and possess a flat geometry. Using the natural isometry between the quantum Hilbert space of Hilbert Schmidt operators and the tensor product of the classical configuration space and its dual, we reveal the inherent vector feature of these states.
