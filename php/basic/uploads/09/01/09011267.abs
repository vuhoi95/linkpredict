Title: Compactons versus Solitons
Authors: Paulo E. G. Assis and Andreas Fring
Abstract: We investigate whether the recently proposed PT-symmetric extensions of generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations admit genuine soliton solutions besides compacton solitary waves. For models which admit stable compactons having a width which is independent of their amplitude and those which possess unstable compacton solutions the Painleve test fails, such that no soliton solutions can be found. The Painleve test is passed for models allowing for compacton solutions whose width is determined by their amplitude. Consequently these models admit soliton solutions in addition to compactons and are integrable.
