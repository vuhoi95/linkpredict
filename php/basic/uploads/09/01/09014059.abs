Title: No cross-interactions among different tensor fields with the mixed  symmetry (3,1) intermediated by a vector field

Abstract: Under the hypotheses of analyticity in the coupling constant, locality, Lorentz covariance, and Poincare invariance of the deformations, combined with the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field, the consistent interactions between a collection of free massless tensor gauge fields with the mixed symmetry of a two-column Young diagram of the type (3,1) and one Abelian vector field, respectively a $p$-form gauge field, are addressed. The main result is that a single mixed symmetry tensor field from the collection gets coupled to the vector field/$p$-form. Our final result resembles to the well known fact from General Relativity according to which there is one graviton in a given world.
