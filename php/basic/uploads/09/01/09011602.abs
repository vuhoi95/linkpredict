Abstract: We introduce a Kazhdan--Lusztig-dual quantum group for (1,p) Virasoro logarithmic minimal models as the Lusztig limit of the quantum sl(2) at pth root of unity and show that this limit is a Hopf algebra. We calculate tensor products of irreducible and projective representations of the quantum group and show that these tensor products coincide with the fusion of irreducible and logarithmic modules in the (1,p) Virasoro logarithmic minimal models.
