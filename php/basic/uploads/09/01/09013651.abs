Abstract: Cross-couplings between a massless spin-two field (described in the free limit by the Pauli-Fierz action) and an Abelian three-form gauge field in D=11 are investigated in the framework of the deformation theory based on local BRST cohomology. These consistent interactions are obtained on the grounds of smoothness in the coupling constant, locality, Lorentz covariance, Poincare invariance, and the presence of at most two derivatives in the interacting Lagrangian. Our results confirm the uniqueness of the eleven-dimensional interactions between a graviton and a three-form prescribed by General Relativity.
