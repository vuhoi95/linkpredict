Title: N=2 world-sheet approach to D-branes on generalized Kaehler geometries:  II. Dualities
Authors: Alexander Sevrin and Wieland Staessens and Alexander Wijns
Abstract: Following the general formalism reviewed in 0810.5355 [hep-th] we present several examples of possible D3-brane configurations on four-dimensional generalized Kaehler geometries. We will discuss T-duality transformations in N = 2 boundary superspace and apply the duality transformations to the constructed D3-branes. The duality transformations lead to a systematic method to construct coisotropic branes, even on target spaces that are not hyper-Kaehler.
