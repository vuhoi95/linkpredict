Title: Four loop reciprocity of twist two operators in N=4 SYM
Authors: M. Beccaria and V. Forini
Abstract: The four loop universal anomalous dimension of twist-2 operators in N=4 SYM has been recently conjectured. In this paper, we prove that it obeys a generalized Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity, previously known to hold at the three loop level.
