Title: The long wavelength limit of hard thermal loop effective actions
Authors: F T Brandt and J Frenkel and J C Taylor
Abstract: We derive a closed form expression for the long wavelength limit of the effective action for hard thermal loops in an external gravitational field. It is a function of the metric, independent of time derivatives. It is compared and contrasted with the static limit, and with the corresponding limits in an external Yang-Mills field.
