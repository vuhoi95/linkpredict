Title: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Twisted Noncommutative Quantum Theories
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and T. R. Govindarajan and S. Vaidya
Abstract: We analyse aspects of symmetry breaking for Moyal spacetimes within a quantisation scheme which preserves the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry. Towards this purpose, we develop the LSZ approach for Moyal spacetimes. The latter gives a formula for scattering amplitudes on these spacetimes which can be obtained from the corresponding ones on the commutative spacetime. This formula applies in the presence of spontaneous breakdown of symmetries as well.We also derive Goldstone's theorem on Moyal spacetime. The formalism developed here can be directly applied to the twisted standard model.
