Title: Multiflavor QCD* on R_3 x S_1: Studying Transition From Abelian to  Non-Abelian Confinement
Authors: M. Shifman and M. Unsal
Abstract: The center-stabilized multiflavor QCD* theories formulated on R_3 x S_1 exhibit both Abelian and non-Abelian confinement as a function of the S_1 radius, similar to the Seiberg-Witten theory as a function of the mass deformation parameter. For sufficiently small number of flavors and small r(S_1), we show occurence of a mass gap in gauge fluctuations, and linear confinement. This is a regime of confinement without continuous chiral symmetry breaking (\chi SB). Unlike one-flavor theories where there is no phase transition in r(S_1), the multiflavor theories possess a single phase transition associated with breaking of the continuous chiral symmetry. We conjecture that the scale of the \chi SB is parametrically tied up with the scale of Abelian to non-Abelian confinement transition.
