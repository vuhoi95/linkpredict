Title: A Derivation of an Off-Shell N = (2,2) Supergravity Chiral Projection  Operator
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Akin Morrison
Abstract: Utilizing the known off-shell formulation of 2D, N = (2,2) supergravity, containing a finite number of auxiliary fields, there is shown to exist a simple form for a 'chiral projection operator' and an explicit expression for it is given.
