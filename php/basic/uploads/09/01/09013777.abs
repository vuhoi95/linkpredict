Title: Electroweak Precision Observables and the Unhiggs
Authors: Adam Falkowski and Manuel Perez-Victoria
Abstract: We compute one-loop corrections to the S and T parameters in the Unhiggs scenario. In that scenario, the Standard Model Higgs is replaced by a non-local object, called the Unhiggs, whose spectral function displays a continuum above the mass gap. The Unhiggs propagator has effectively the same UV properties as the Standard Model Higgs propagator, which implies that loop corrections to the electroweak precision observables are finite and calculable. We show that the Unhiggs is consistent with electroweak precision tests when its mass gap is at the weak scale; in fact, it then mimics a light SM Higgs boson. We also argue that the Unhiggs, while being perfectly visible to electroweak precision observables, is invisible to detection at LEP.
