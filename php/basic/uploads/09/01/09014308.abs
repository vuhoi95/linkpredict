Title: Signatures of Noncommutative Geometry in Muon Decay for Nonsymmetric  Gravity
Authors: Dinesh Singh and Nader Mobed and Pierre-Philippe Ouimet
Abstract: It is shown how to identify potential signatures of noncommutative geometry within the decay spectrum of a muon in orbit near the event horizon of a microscopic Schwarzschild black hole. This possibility follows from a re-interpretation of J.W. Moffat's nonsymmetric theory of gravity, first published in Phys. Rev. D 19, 3554 (1979), where the antisymmetric part of the metric tensor manifests the hypothesized noncommutative geometric structure throughout the manifold. It is further shown that for a given sign convention, the predicted signatures counteract the effects of curvature-induced muon stabilization predicted by D. Singh and N. Mobed in Phys. Rev. D 79, 024026 (2009). While it is unclear whether evidence for noncommutative geometry may be found at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) anytime soon, this approach at least provides a useful direction for future quantum gravity research based on the ideas presented here.
