Title: On black holes in heterotic braneworlds
Authors: Ruth Gregory and Armalivia Leksono and Bina Mistry
Abstract: We explore the problem of braneworld black holes in the heterotic braneworld scenario of Lukas, Ovrut, Stelle and Waldram (LOSW). We show that black string solutions are unstable, and demonstrate some unusual asymptotics in the linearized metric. We also solve the fully coupled brane and bulk Einstein equations, finding an exact, though singular, solution which corresponds to a brane black hole in which the branes spike apart at the Schwarzschild radius.
