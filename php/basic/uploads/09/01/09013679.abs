Title: A linear realization of the BRST symmetry
Authors: Matthieu Tissier and Nicolas Wschebor
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a model which is equivalent to the Yang-Mills theory at long distances but for which all symmetries are realized linearly. On top of the gauge and Fadeev-Popov ghosts fields, the model presents several massive fields, all of which can be merged in a unique vector field with support in a curved superspace. The equivalence of this model with the gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theory is shown to result from the decoupling of these extra massive modes at small momenta. Most of the symmetries of Yang-Mills theory, including the famous BRST symmetry, can be interpreted in this way as isometries of the superspace.
