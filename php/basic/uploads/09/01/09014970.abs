Abstract: The recent classification scheme of so-called adinkraic off-shell supermultiplets of N-extended worldline supersymmetry without central charges finds a combinatorial explosion. Completing our earlier efforts, we now complete the constructive proof that all of these trillions or more of supermultiplets have a superfield representation. While different as superfields and supermultiplets, these are still super-differentially related to a much more modest number of minimal supermultiplets, which we construct herein.
