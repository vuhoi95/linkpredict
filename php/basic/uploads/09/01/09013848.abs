Title: Higher Derivative Corrections to Shear Viscosity from Graviton's  Effective Coupling
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta
Abstract: The shear viscosity coefficient of strongly coupled boundary gauge theory plasma depends on the horizon value of the effective coupling of transverse graviton moving in black hole background. The proof for the above statement is based on the canonical form of graviton's action. But in presence of generic higher derivative terms in the bulk Lagrangian the action is no longer canonical. We give a procedure to find an effective action for graviton (to first order in coefficient of higher derivative term) in canonical form in presence of any arbitrary higher derivative terms in the bulk. From that effective action we find the effective coupling constant for transverse graviton which in general depends on the radial coordinate $r$. We also argue that horizon value of this effective coupling is related to the shear viscosity coefficient of the boundary fluid in higher derivative gravity. We explicitly check this procedure for two specific examples: (1) four derivative action and (2) eight derivative action ($Weyl^4$ term). For both cases we show that our results for shear viscosity coefficient (up to first order in coefficient of higher derivative term) completely agree with the existing results in the literature.
