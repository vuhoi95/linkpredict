Title: Superstring-inspired supergravity as the universal source of inflation  and quintessence
Authors: S. James Gates Jr. and Sergei V. Ketov
Abstract: We prove (in superspace) the equivalence between the higher-derivative N=1 supergravity, defined by a holomorphic function F of the chiral scalar curvature superfield, and the standard theory of a chiral scalar superfield with a chiral superpotential W, coupled to the (minimal) Poincare supergravity in four spacetime dimensions. The relation between the holomorphic functions F and W is found. It can be used as the technical framework for the possible scenario unifying the early Universe inflation and the present Universe acceleration. We speculate on the possible origin of our model as the effective supergravity generated by quantum superstrings, with a dilaton-axion field as the leading field component of the chiral superfield.
