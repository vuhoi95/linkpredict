Title: Spacetime Singularities in String and its Low Dimensional Effective  Theory
Authors: Preet Sharma and Andreas Tziolas and Anzhong Wang and Zhong Chao Wu
Abstract: Spacetime singularities are studied in both the $D+d$-dimensional string theory and its $D$-dimensional effective theory, obtained by the Kaluza-Klein compactification. It is found that spacetime singularities in the low dimensional effective theory may or may not remain after lifted to the $D+d$-dimensional string theory, depending on particular solutions. It is also found that there exist cases in which spacetime singularities appearing in high/low dimensional spacetimes do not necessarily happen on the same surfaces.
