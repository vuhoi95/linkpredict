Title: Covariant Galileon
Authors: C. Deffayet and G. Esposito-Farese and A. Vikman
Abstract: We consider the recently introduced "galileon" field in a dynamical spacetime. When the galileon is assumed to be minimally coupled to the metric, we underline that both field equations of the galileon and the metric involve up to third-order derivatives. We show that a unique nonminimal coupling of the galileon to curvature eliminates all higher derivatives in all field equations, hence yielding second-order equations, without any extra propagating degree of freedom. The resulting theory breaks the generalized "Galilean" invariance of the original model.
