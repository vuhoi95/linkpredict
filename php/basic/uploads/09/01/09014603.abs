Title: Description of the Heterotic String Solutions in U(N) SQCD
Authors: P. A. Bolokhov and M. Shifman and A. Yung
Abstract: We continue the study of heterotic non-Abelian BPS-saturated flux tubes (strings). Previously, such solutions were obtained [1] in a particular U(2) gauge theory: N=2 supersymmetric QCD deformed by superpotential terms of a special type breaking N=2 supersymmetry down to N=1. Here we generalize the previous results to U(N) gauge theories. As was suggested by Edalati and Tong [2], the string world sheet theory is a heterotic N=(0,2) sigma model, with the CP(N-1) target space for bosonic fields and an extra right-handed fermion which couples to the fermion fields of the N=(2,2) CP(N-1) model. We derive the heterotic N=(0,2) world sheet model directly from the U(N) bulk theory. Parameters of the bulk theory are related to those of the world sheet theory. Qualitatively this relation turns out to be the same as in the U(2) case.
