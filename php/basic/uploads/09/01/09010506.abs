Title: Janus and Multifaced Supersymmetric Theories II
Authors: Chanju Kim and Eunkyung Koh and Ki-Myeong Lee
Abstract: We explore the physics of supersymmetric Janus gauge theories in four dimension with spatial dependent coupling constants, e^2 and theta. For the 8 supersymmetric case, we study the vacuum and BPS spectrum, and the physics of a sharp interface where the couple constants jump. We also find less supersymmetric cases either due to additional expressions in the Lagrangian or to the fact that coupling constants depend on additional spatial coordinates.
