Title: The vector meson mass in the large N limit of QCD
Authors: A. Hietanen and R. Narayanan and R. Patel and C. Prays
Abstract: The vector meson mass is computed as a function of quark mass in the large N limit of QCD. We use continuum reduction and directly compute the vector meson propagator in momentum space. Quark momentum is inserted using the quenched momentum prescription.
