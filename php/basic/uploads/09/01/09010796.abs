Title: Vector-Field Domain Walls
Authors: J. L. Chkareuli and Archil Kobakhidze and Raymond R. Volkas
Abstract: We argue that spontaneous Lorentz violation may generally lead to metastable domain walls related to the simultaneous violation of some accompanying discrete symmetries. Remarkably, such domain wall solutions exist for space-like Lorentz violation and do not exist for the time-like violation. Because a preferred space direction is spontaneously induced, these domain walls have no planar symmetry and produce a peculiar static gravitational field at small distances, while their long-distance gravity appears the same as for regular scalar-field walls. Some possible applications of vector-field domain walls are briefly discussed.
