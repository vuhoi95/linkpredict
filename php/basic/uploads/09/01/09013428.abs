Title: Kinetics of a non-glauberian Ising model: global observables and exact  results
Authors: Sreedhar B. Dutta and Malte Henkel and Hyunggyu Park
Abstract: We analyse the spin-flip dynamics in kinetic Ising chains with Kimball-Deker-Haake (KDH) transition rates, and evaluate exactly the evolution of global quantities like magnetisation and its fluctuations, and the two-time susceptibilities and correlations of the global spin and the global three-spin. Information on the ageing behaviour after a quench to zero temperature is extracted.
