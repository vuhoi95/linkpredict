Title: A dark radiation era prior to the inflationary phase
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera and Victor Cardenas
Abstract: A cosmological model dominated at the beginning by a dark radiation followed by a period of inflation is presented. This model is based on a Randall-Sundrum II type brane-world. Current observational data are used to fix the parameters associated to the dark radiation.
