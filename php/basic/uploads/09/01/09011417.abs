Title: String hypothesis for the AdS_5 x S^5 mirror
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov
Abstract: We discuss the states which contribute in the thermodynamic limit of the mirror theory, the latter is obtained from the light-cone gauge-fixed string theory in the AdS_5 x S^5 background by the double-Wick rotation. We analyze the Bethe-Yang equations for the mirror theory and formulate the string hypothesis. We show that in the thermodynamic limit solutions of the Bethe-Yang equations arrange themselves into Bethe string configurations similar to the ones appearing in the Hubbard model. We also derive a set of equations describing the bound states and the Bethe string configurations of the mirror theory.
