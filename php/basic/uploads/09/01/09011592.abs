Title: Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models on supermanifolds
Authors: A. Eghbali and A. Rezaei-Aghdam
Abstract: We investigate Poisson-Lie symmetry for T-dual sigma models on supermanifolds in general and on Lie supergroups in particular. We show that the integrability condition on this super Poisson-Lie symmetry is equivalent to the super Jacobi identities of the Lie super-bialgebras. As examples we consider models related to four dimensional Lie super-bialgebras $((2A1,1 + 2A)^1, D10_p=1/2)$ and $((2A1,1 + 2A)^1, I)$. Then generally it is shown that for Abelian case (g, I) the super Poisson-Lie T-duality transforms the role of fermionic (bosonic) fields in the model to bosonic (fermionic) fields on the dual model and vice versa.
