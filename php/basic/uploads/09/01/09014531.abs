Title: Particle mixing as possible explanation of the dark energy conundrum
Authors: Antonio Capolupo and Giuseppe Vitiello
Abstract: The vacuum condensate due to neutrino and quark mixing behaves as a perfect fluid and, at the present epoch, as a cosmological constant. The very small breaking of the Lorentz invariance constrains today the value of the dark energy.
