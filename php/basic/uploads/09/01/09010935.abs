Title: From gauge-string duality to strong interactions: a Pedestrian's Guide
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Andreas Karch
Abstract: We survey recent progress in understanding the relation of string theory to quantum chromodynamics, focusing on holographic models of gauge theories similar to QCD and applications to heavy-ion collisions.
