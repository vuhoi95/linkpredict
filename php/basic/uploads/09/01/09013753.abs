Title: Integrability for the Full Spectrum of Planar AdS/CFT
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Vladimir Kazakov and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We present a set of functional equations defining the anomalous dimensions of arbitrary local single trace operators in planar N=4 SYM theory. It takes the form of a Y-system based on the integrability of the dual superstring sigma-model on the AdS_5xS^5 background. This Y-system passes some very important tests: it incorporates the full asymptotic Bethe ansatz at large length of operator L, including the dressing factor, and it confirms all recently found wrapping corrections. The recently proposed AdS_4/CFT_3 duality is also treated in a similar fashion.
