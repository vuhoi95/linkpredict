Title: Mirror Symmetry for Toric Branes on Compact Hypersurfaces
Authors: M. Alim and M. Hecht and P. Mayr and A. Mertens
Abstract: We use toric geometry to study open string mirror symmetry on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. For a mirror pair of toric branes on a mirror pair of toric hypersurfaces we derive a canonical hypergeometric system of differential equations, whose solutions determine the open/closed string mirror maps and the partition functions for spheres and discs. We define a linear sigma model for the brane geometry and describe a correspondence between dual toric polyhedra and toric brane geometries. The method is applied to study examples with obstructed and classically unobstructed brane moduli at various points in the deformation space. Computing the instanton expansion at large volume in the flat coordinates on the open/closed deformation space we obtain predictions for enumerative invariants.
