Title: Emergent Einstein Universe under Deconstruction
Authors: Nahomi Kan and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We study self-consistent static solutions for an Einstein universe in a graph-based induced gravity. The one-loop quantum action is computed at finite temperature. In particular, we demonstrate specific results for the models based on cycle graphs.
