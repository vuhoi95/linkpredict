Title: Diffusion of Brownian particles and Liouville field theory
Authors: Franco Ferrari and Jaroslaw Paturej
Abstract: In this work we review a recently proposed transformation which is useful in order to simplify non-polynomial potentials given in the form of an exponential. As an application, it is shown that the Liouville field theory may be mapped into a field theory with a polynomial interaction between two scalar fields and a massive vector field. The used methodology is illustrated with the help of the simple case of a particle performing a random walk in a delta function potentials.
