Title: Deep inelastic scattering and factorization in the 't Hooft Model
Authors: Jorge Mondejar and Antonio Pineda
Abstract: We study in detail deep inelastic scattering in the 't Hooft model. We are able to analytically check current conservation and to obtain analytic expressions for the matrix elements with relative precision O(1/Q^2) for 1-x >> \beta^2/Q^2. This allows us to compute the electron-meson differential cross section and its moments with 1/Q^2 precision. For the former we find maximal violations of quark-hadron duality, as it is expected for a large N_c analysis. For the latter we find violations of the operator product expansion at next-to-leading order in the 1/Q^2 expansion.
