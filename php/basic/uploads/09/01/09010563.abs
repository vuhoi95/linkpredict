Title: Weak Interaction in Holographic QCD
Authors: Doron Gazit and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We present a recent proposal of a simple prescription for including low-energy weak-interactions into the framework of holographic QCD, based on the standard AdS/CFT dictionary of double-trace deformations. This opens a new perspective on phenomenological applications of holographic QCD: calculating weak observables in the strongly coupled regime of QCD. The idea is general enough to be implemented in any holographic model. Its efficiency and usefulness are demonstrated by performing few exemplar calculations of weak reactions involving mesons and baryons, within the Sakai-Sugimoto and hard/soft wall holographic models.
