Title: Brane-Antibrane Dynamics From the Tachyon DBI Action
Authors: Denis Erkal and David Kutasov and Oleg Lunin
Abstract: The Tachyon-Dirac-Born-Infeld (TDBI) action captures some aspects of the dynamics of non-BPS D-branes in type II string theory. We show that it can also be used to study the classical interactions of BPS branes and antibranes. Our analysis sheds light on real time D-Dbar tachyon condensation, on the proposal that the tachyon field can be thought of as an extra spatial dimension whose role is similar to the radial direction in holography, and on A. Sen's open string completeness conjecture.
