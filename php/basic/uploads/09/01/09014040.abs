Title: Super WZNW with Reductions to Supersymmetric and Fermionic Integrable  Models
Authors: J. F. Gomes and D. M. Schmidtt and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: A systematic construction for an action describing a class of supersymmetric integrable models as well as for pure fermionic theories is discussed in terms of the gauged WZNW model associated to twisted affine Kac-Moody algebras. Explicit examples of the $N=1,2$ super sinh(sine)-Gordon models are discussed in detail. Pure fermionic theories arises for cosets $sl(p,1)/sl(p)\otimes u(1)$ when a maximal kernel condition is fulfilled. The integrability condition for such models is discussed and it is shown that the simplest example when $p=2$ leads to the constrained Bukhvostov-Lipatov, Thirring, scalar massive and pseudo-scalar massless Gross-Neveu models.
