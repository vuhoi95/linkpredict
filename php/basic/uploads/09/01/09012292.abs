Abstract: We compare the existing observational data on type Ia Supernovae with the evolutions of the universe predicted by a one-parameter family of tachyon models which we have introduced recently in paper \cite{we-tach}. Among the set of the trajectories of the model which are compatible with the data there is a consistent subset for which the universe ends up in a new type of soft cosmological singularity dubbed Big Brake. This opens up yet another scenario for the future history of the universe besides the one predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.
