Title: Foundations of the AdS_5 x S^5 Superstring. Part I
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov
Abstract: We review the recent advances towards finding the spectrum of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring. We thoroughly explain the theoretical techniques which should be useful for the ultimate solution of the spectral problem. In certain cases our exposition is original and cannot be found in the existing literature. The present Part I deals with foundations of classical string theory in AdS_5 x S^5, light-cone perturbative quantization and derivation of the exact light-cone world-sheet scattering matrix.
