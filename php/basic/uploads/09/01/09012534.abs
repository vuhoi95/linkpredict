Title: The AdS/CFT Correspondence and Non-perturbative QCD
Authors: Jose D. Edelstein and Jonathan P. Shock and Dimitrios Zoakos
Abstract: We aim at providing an overview on the applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence to non-perturbative aspects of non-Abelian gauge theories, addressed to particle physicists. The finite temperature case, in connection with the physics of the quark-gluon plasma, is emphasized.
