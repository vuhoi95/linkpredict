Title: Classes of AdS4 type IIA/IIB compactifications with SU(3)xSU(3)  structure
Authors: Dieter Lust and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: We introduce an ansatz which allows us to solve the supersymmetry equations for warped N=1 AdS4 type II supergravity compactifications of general SU(3)xSU(3) structure. As a byproduct we obtain a set of necessary conditions which every supersymmetric AdS4 vacuum should obey. The case of AdS4 compactifications of IIB on manifolds of static SU(2) structure is examined in detail. Several examples of solutions are presented. In the limit of four-dimensional Minkowski space, we present examples of supersymmetric IIB warped compactifications with partially localized NS5- and D5-branes. We also present `massive' non-supersymmetric AdS4xM6 solutions of IIA, where M6 can be any six-dimensional Einstein-Kaehler manifold.
