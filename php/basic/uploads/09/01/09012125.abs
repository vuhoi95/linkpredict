Title: WIMPonium
Authors: William Shepherd and Tim M. P. Tait and Gabrijela Zaharijas
Abstract: We explore the possibility that weakly interacting dark matter can form bound states - WIMPonium. Such states are expected in a wide class of models of particle dark matter, including some limits of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We examine the conditions under which we expect bound states to occur, and use analogues of NRQCD applied to heavy quarkonia to provide estimates for their properties, including couplings to the Standard Model. We further find that it may be possible to produce WIMPonium at the LHC, and explore the properties of the WIMP that can be inferred from measurements of the WIMPonium states.
