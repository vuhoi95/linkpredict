Title: Lorentzian Lie (3-)algebra and toroidal compactification of M/string  theory
Authors: Pei-Ming Ho and Yutaka Matsuo and Shotaro Shiba
Abstract: We construct a class of Lie 3-algebras with an arbitrary number of pairs of generators with Lorentzian signature metric. Some examples are given and corresponding BLG models are studied. We show that such a system in general describes a supersymmetric massive vector multiplets after the ghost fields are Higgsed. Simple systems with nontrivial interaction are realized by infinite dimensional Lie 3-algebras associated with the loop algebras. The massive fields are then naturally identified with the Kaluza-Klein modes by the toroidal compactification triggered by the ghost fields. For example, Dp-brane with an (infinite dimensional) affine Lie algebra symmetry $\hat g$ can be identified with D(p+1)-brane with gauge symmetry $g$.
