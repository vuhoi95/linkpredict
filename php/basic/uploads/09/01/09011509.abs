Title: Thermodynamics in $F(R)$ gravity with phantom crossing
Authors: Kazuharu Bamba and Chao-Qiang Geng
Abstract: We study thermodynamics of the apparent horizon in $F(R)$ gravity. In particular, we demonstrate that a $F(R)$ gravity model with realizing a crossing of the phantom divide can satisfy the second law of thermodynamics in the effective phantom phase as well as non-phantom one.
