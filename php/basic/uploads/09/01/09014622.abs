Abstract: Under the hypotheses of smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, locality, Poincare invariance, Lorentz covariance, and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field in the Lagrangian of the interacting theory (the same number of derivatives like in the free Lagrangian), we prove that in D=11 there are no cross-interactions between the graviton and the massless gravitino and also no self-interactions in the Rarita-Schwinger sector. A comparison with the case D=4 is briefly discussed.
