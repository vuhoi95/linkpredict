Title: Field on Poincare group and quantum description of orientable objects
Authors: D. Gitman and A. Shelepin
Abstract: We propose an approach to the quantum-mechanical description of relativistic orientable objects. It generalizes Wigner's ideas concerning the treatment of nonrelativistic orientable objects (in particular, a nonrelativistic rotator) with the help of two reference frames (space-fixed and body-fixed). A technical realization of this generalization (for instance, in 3+1 dimensions) amounts to introducing wave functions that depend on elements of the Poincare group $G$. A complete set of transformations that test the symmetries of an orientable object and of the embedding space belongs to the group $\Pi =G\times G$. All such transformations can be studied by considering a generalized regular representation of $G$ in the space of scalar functions on the group, $f(x,z)$, that depend on the Minkowski space points $x\in G/Spin(3,1)$ as well as on the orientation variables given by the elements $z$ of a matrix $Z\in Spin(3,1)$. In particular, the field $f(x,z)$ is a generating function of usual spin-tensor multicomponent fields. In the theory under consideration, there are four different types of spinors, and an orientable object is characterized by ten quantum numbers. We study the corresponding relativistic wave equations and their symmetry properties.
