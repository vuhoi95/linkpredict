Abstract: Under the hypotheses of smoothness of the interactions in the coupling constant, locality, Poincare invariance, Lorentz covariance, and the preservation of the number of derivatives on each field in the Lagrangian of the interacting theory (the same number of derivatives like in the free Lagrangian), we prove that the only consistent interactions in D=11 among massless gravitini, a graviton, and a 3-form are described by N=1, D=11 SUGRA.
