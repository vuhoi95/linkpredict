Title: Irreducible SU(3) Schwinger Bosons
Authors: Ramesh Anishetty and Manu Mathur and Indrakshi Raychowdhury
Abstract: We develop simple computational techniques for constructing all possible SU(3) representations in terms of irreducible SU(3) Schwinger bosons. We show that these irreducible Schwinger oscillators make SU(3) representation theory as simple as SU(2). The new Schwinger oscillators satisfy certain Sp(2,R) constraints and solve the multiplicity problem as well. These SU(3) techniques can be generalized to SU(N).
