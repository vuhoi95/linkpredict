Title: Generalized Nonanalytic Expansions, PT-Symmetry and Large-Order Formulas  for Odd Anharmonic Oscillators
Authors: Ulrich D. Jentschura and Andrey Surzhykov and Jean Zinn-Justin
Abstract: The concept of a generalized nonanalytic expansion which involves nonanalytic combinations of exponentials, logarithms and powers of a coupling is introduced and its use illustrated in various areas of physics. Dispersion relations for the resonance energies of odd anharmonic oscillators are discussed, and higher-order formulas are presented for cubic and quartic potentials.
