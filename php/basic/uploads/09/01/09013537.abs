Title: Effective potentials and kink spectra in non-integrable perturbed  conformal field theories
Authors: G. Mussardo and G. Takacs
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of the effective potential and the particle spectrum of two-parameter families of non-integrable quantum field theories. These theories are defined by deformations of conformal minimal models M_m by using the operators Phi_{1,3}, Phi_{1,2} and Phi_{2,1}. This study extends to all minimal models the analysis previously done for the classes of universality of the Ising, the Tricritical Ising and the RSOS models. We establish the symmetry and the duality properties of the various models also identifying the limiting theories that emerge when m goes to infinity.
