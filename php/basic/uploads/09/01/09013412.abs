Title: Harmonic oscillator in a background magnetic field in noncommutative  quantum phase-space
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Frederik G Scholtz
Abstract: We solve explicitly the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the harmonic oscillator in a background magnetic field in noncommutative phase-space without making use of any type of representation. A key observation that we make is that for a specific choice of the noncommutative parameters, the time reversal symmetry of the systems get restored since the energy spectrum becomes degenerate. This is in contrast to the noncommutative configuration space where the time reversal symmetry of the harmonic oscillator is always broken.
