Abstract: We demonstrate the power of a recently-proposed approximation scheme for the non-perturbative renormalization group that gives access to correlation functions over their full momentum range. We solve numerically the leading-order flow equations obtained within this scheme, and compute the two-point functions of the O(N) theories at criticality, in two and three dimensions. Excellent results are obtained for both universal and non-universal quantities at modest numerical cost.
