Title: Gauge invariant averages for the cosmological backreaction
Authors: M. Gasperini and G. Marozzi and G. Veneziano
Abstract: We show how to provide suitable gauge invariant prescriptions for the classical spatial averages (resp. quantum expectation values) that are needed in the evaluation of classical (resp. quantum) backreaction effects. We also present examples illustrating how the use of gauge invariant prescriptions can avoid interpretation problems and prevent misleading conclusions.
