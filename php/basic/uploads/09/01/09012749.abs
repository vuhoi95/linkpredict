Title: The virtual scaling function of AdS/CFT
Authors: Lisa Freyhult and Stefan Zieme
Abstract: We write an integral equation that incorporates finite corrections to the large spin asymptotics of N=4 SYM twist operators from the non-linear integral equation. We show that these corrections are an all-loop result, not affected by wrapping effects, and agree, after determining the strong coupling expansion, with string theory predictions.
