Abstract: A supersymmetric spin-1/2 particle in the noncommutative plane, subject to an arbitrary magnetic field, is considered, with particular attention paid to the homogeneous case. The system has three different phases, depending on the magnetic field. Due to supersymmetry, the boundary critical phase which separates the sub- and super-critical cases can be viewed as a reduction to the zero-energy eigensubspace. In the sub-critical phase the system is described by the superextension of exotic Newton-Hooke symmetry, combined with the conformal so(2,1) ~ su(1,1) symmetry; the latter is changed into so(3) ~ su(2) in the super-critical phase. In the critical phase the spin degrees of freedom are frozen and supersymmetry disappears.
