Abstract: We consider $(4,1)$-dimensional branes constructed with two scalar fields $\phi$ and $\chi$ coupled to a Dirac spinor field by means of a general Yukawa coupling. The equation of motion for the coefficients of the chiral decomposition of the spinor in curved spacetime leads to a Sch\"odinger-like equation whose solutions allow to obtain the masses of the fermionic modes. The simplest Yukawa coupling $\bar\Psi\phi\chi\Psi$ is considered for the Bloch brane model and fermion localization is studied. We found resonances for both chiralities and related their appearance to branes with internal structure.
