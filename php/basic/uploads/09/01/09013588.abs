Title: Quasinormal modes of warped $AdS_3$ black holes and AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: Bin Chen and Zhi-bo Xu
Abstract: We calculate the scalar quasinormal modes of warped $AdS_3$ black holes analytically. We find that in general they are not in agreement with the prediction of the usual AdS/CFT correspondence. Nevertheless, for the black hole not deviating far from BTZ black hole, the quasinormal frequencies are still well consistent with AdS/CFT correspondence.
