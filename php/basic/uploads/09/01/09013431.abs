Title: Non-relativistic D3-brane in the presence of higher derivative  corrections
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Ahmad Ghodsi
Abstract: Using alpha'^3 terms of type IIB supergravity action we study higher order corrections to the non-relativistic non-extremal D3-brane. Utilizing the corrected solution we evaluate corrections to temperature, entropy and shear viscosity. We also compute the eta/s ratio which although within the range of validity of the supergravity approximation and in the lowest order of the correction the universal bound is respected, there is a possibility for a violation of the bound when higher terms in the expansion are taken into account.
