Title: Repulsons in the Myers-Perry Family
Authors: Gary Gibbons and Hideo Kodama
Abstract: In this paper, we show that curvature-regular asymptotically flat solitons with negative mass are contained in the Myers-Perry family of odd spacetime dimensions. These solitons do not have a horizon, but instead a conical singularity of quasi-regular nature surrounded by naked CTCs. This quasi-regular singularity can be made regular for a set of discrete values of angular momentum, at least for the Myers-Perry solutions with UG(N) symmetry. Although the time coordinate is required to have a periodicity at infinity and the spatial infinity becomes a lens space S^{D-2}/Z_n, the corresponding spacetime is simply connected, and the CTCs cannot be eliminated by taking a covering spacetime.
