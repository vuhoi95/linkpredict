Title: Kaehler Metrics: String vs Field Theoretical Approach
Authors: P. Di Vecchia and A. Liccardo and R. Marotta and F. Pezzella
Abstract: We use both a string and a field theoretical approach in order to determine respectively the Kaehler metrics of untwisted and twisted open strings attached to magnetized D9 branes in toroidal compactifications.
