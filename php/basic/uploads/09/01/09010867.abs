Title: Gravitational Wave Bursts from Cosmic Superstring Reconnections
Authors: Mark G. Jackson and Xavier Siemens
Abstract: We compute the gravitational waveform produced by cosmic superstring reconnections. This is done by first constructing the superstring reconnection trajectory, which closely resembles that of classical, instantaneous reconnection but with the singularities smoothed out due to the string path integral. We then evaluate the graviton vertex operator in this background to obtain the burst amplitude. The result is compared to the detection threshold for current and future gravitational wave detectors, finding that neither bursts nor the stochastic background would be detectable by Advanced LIGO. This disappointing but anticipated conclusion holds even for the most optimistic values of the reconnection probability and loop sizes.
