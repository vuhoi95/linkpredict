Title: Extended General Relativity: large-scale antigravity and short-scale  gravity with Ï‰=-1 from five dimensional vacuum
Authors: Jose Edgar Madriz Aguilar and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: Considering a five-dimensional (5D) Riemannian spacetime with a particular stationary Ricci-flat metric, we obtain in the framework of the induced matter theory an effective 4D static and spherically symmetric metric which give us ordinary gravitatory solutions on small (planetary and astrophysical) scales, but repulsive (antigravity) forces on very large (cosmological) scales with \omega = -1. Our approach is an unified manner to describe dark energy, dark matter and ordinary matter. We illustrate the theory with two examples, the solar system and the great attractor. From the geometrical point of view, these results follow from the assumption that exists a confining force that make possible that test particles move on a given 4D hypersurface.
