Title: Spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of modified gravity theory in  higher dimensions
Authors: T. R. P. CaramÃªs and E. R. Bezerra de Mello
Abstract: In this paper we investigate spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of $f(R)$ gravity in a higher dimensional spacetime. With this objective we construct a system of non-linear differential equations, whose solutions depend on the explicit form assumed for the function $F(R)=\frac{df(R)}{dR}$. We explicit show that for specific classes of this function exact solutions from the field equations are obtained; also we find approximated results for the metric tensor for more general cases admitting $F(R)$ close to the unity.
