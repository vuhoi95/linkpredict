Title: The Fate of Nearly Supersymmetric Vacua
Authors: Michael Dine and Guido Festuccia and Alexander Morisse
Abstract: Supersymmetric vacua are stable. It is interesting to ask: how long-lived are vacua which are nearly supersymmetric? This question is relevant if our universe is approximately supersymmetric. It is also of importance for a number of issues of the physics of the landscape and eternal inflation. In this note, we distinguish a variety of cases. In all of them the decay is slow. For a flat space theory decaying to a deep AdS vacuum, the leading behavior of the decay amplitude, if a thin wall approximation is valid, is ${\cal A} = \gamma e^{-2 \pi^2/({\rm Re} m_{3/2})^2}$ (where the phase of $m_{3/2}$ is defined in the text) for ${\rm Re} m_{3/2}>0$, and zero otherwise. Metastable supersymmetry breaking generally yields parametrically more rapid decays. For nearly supersymmetric decays, we will see that it is necessary to compute subleading terms in the exponential to extraordinarily high accuracy before one can meaningfully discuss the prefactor.
