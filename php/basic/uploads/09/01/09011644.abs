Title: Remarks on Multi-Dimensional Conformal Mechanics
Authors: Cestmir Burdik and Armen Nersessian
Abstract: Recently, Galajinsky, Lechtenfeld and Polovnikov proposed an elegant group-theoretical transformation of the generic conformal-invariant mechanics to the free one. Considering the classical counterpart of this transformation, we relate this transformation with the Weil model of Lobachewsky space.
