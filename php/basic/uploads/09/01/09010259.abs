Abstract: We extend the analysis of the recently obtained stringy cosmological solutions induced by thermal and quantum effects, once space-time supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by geometrical fluxes. Cases in which more than one modulus participating in the supersymmetry breaking mechanism are investigated. The free energy is obtained at the full string level. In the intermediate cosmological region where the temperature and the supersymmetry breaking scale are sufficiently smaller than the Hagedorn temperature, the quantum and thermal corrections are under control and calculable. The reason is that the contributions to the effective potential of the moduli that are not participating in the supersymmetry breaking are exponentially suppressed. The backreaction on the initially flat background results in many cases into cosmological evolutions, where the dynamics of all complex structure moduli is frozen. The solutions describe effectively a radiation dominated era, where thermal effects are never negligible, even if the temperature tends to zero at late times. We analyze several types of supersymmetry breaking patterns and examine the stability of the corresponding radiation era.
