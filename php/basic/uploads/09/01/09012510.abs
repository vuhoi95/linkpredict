Title: From Decay to Complete Breaking: Pulling the Strings in SU(2) Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: M. Pepe and U. -J. Wiese
Abstract: We study {2Q+1}-strings connecting two static charges Q in (2+1)-d SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. While the fundamental {2}-string between two charges Q = 1/2 is unbreakable, the adjoint {3}-string connecting two charges Q = 1 can break. When a {4}-string is stretched beyond a critical length, it decays into a {2}-string by gluon pair creation. When a {5}-string is stretched, it first decays into a {3}-string, which eventually breaks completely. The energy of the screened charges at the ends of a string is well described by a phenomenological constituent gluon model.
