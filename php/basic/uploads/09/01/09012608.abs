Title: Test of Quantum Effects of Spatial Noncommutativity using Modified  Electron Momentum Spectroscopy
Authors: Jian-Zu Zhang and Ke-Lin Gao and Chuan-Gang Ning
Abstract: The possibility of testing spatial noncommutativity by current experiments on normal quantum scales is investigated. For the case of both position-position and momentum-momentum noncommuting spectra of ions in crossed electric and magnetic fields are studied in the formalism of noncommutative quantum mechanics. In a limit of the kinetic energy approaching its lowest eigenvalue this system possesses non-trivial dynamics. Signals of spatial noncommutativity in the angular momentum are revealed. They are within limits of the measurable accuracy of current experiments. An experimental test of the predictions using a modified electron momentum spectrum is suggested. The related experimental sensitivity and subtle points are discussed. The results are the first step on a realizable way towards a conclusive test of spatial noncommutativity.
