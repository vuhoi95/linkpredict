Title: Bulk scalar field in brane-worlds with induced gravity inspired by the  ${\cal L}(R)$ term
Authors: Malihe Heydari-Fard and Hamid R. Sepangi
Abstract: We obtain the effective field equations in a brane-world scenario within the framework of a DGP model where the action on the brane is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar, ${\cal L}(R)$, and the bulk action includes a scalar field in the matter Lagrangian. We obtain the Friedmann equations and acceleration conditions in the presence of the bulk scalar field for the $R^n$ term in four-dimensional gravity.
