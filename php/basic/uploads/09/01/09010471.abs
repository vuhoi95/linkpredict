Title: Warm tachyonic inflation in warped background
Authors: Atri Deshamukhya and Sudhakar Panda
Abstract: We analyze warm tachyonic inflation, proposed in the literature, but from the viewpoint of four dimensional effective action for tachyon field on a non-BPS D3-brane. We find that consistency with observational data on density perturbation and validity of effective action requires warped compactification. The number of background branes which source the flux is found to be of the order of 10 in contrast to the order of $10^{14}$ in the standard cold inflationary scenario.
