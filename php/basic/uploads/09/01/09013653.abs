Title: Superprotected n-point correlation functions of local operators in N=4  super Yang-Mills
Authors: Nadav Drukker and Jan Plefka
Abstract: In this paper we study the n-point correlation functions of two different families of local gauge invariant operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The main idea is to consider the correlation functions of operators which all share a number of supersymmetries irrespective of their relative locations. We achieve this by equipping the operators with explicit space-time dependence. We provide evidence by different methods that these n-point correlators do not receive quantum corrections in perturbation theory and are hence given exactly by their tree-level result. The arguments rely on explicit checks for general four-point correlators, some five-point and six-point correlators and a more abstract calculation based on a novel topological twisting of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
