Title: A note on cosmological Levi-Civita spacetimes in higher dimensions
Authors: Ozgur Sarioglu and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We find a class of solutions to cosmological Einstein equations that generalizes the four dimensional cylindrically symmetric spacetimes to higher dimensions. The AdS soliton is a special member of this class with a unique singularity structure.
