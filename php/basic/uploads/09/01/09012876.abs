Title: The non-anticommutative supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory
Authors: I. Jack and D. R. T. Jones and R. Purdy
Abstract: We discuss the non-anticommutative (N=1/2) supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in four dimensions, including a superpotential. We perform the one-loop renormalisation of the model, including the complete set of terms necessary for renormalisability, showing in detail how the eliminated and uneliminated forms of the theory lead to equivalent results.
