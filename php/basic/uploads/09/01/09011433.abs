Title: Absolute anticommutativity of the nilpotent symmetries in the  Hamiltonian formalism: free Abelian 2-form gauge theory
Authors: R. P. Malik and B. P. Mandal and S. K. Rai
Abstract: The celebrated Curci-Ferrari (CF) type of restrictions are invoked to obtain the off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting (anti-) BRST as well as (anti-) co-BRST symmetry transformations in the context of the Lagrangian description of the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) free Abelian 2-form gauge theory. We show that the above CF type conditions, which turn out to be the secondary constraints of the theory, remain invariant with respect to the time-evolution of the above 2-form gauge system in the Hamiltonian formulation. This time-evolution invariance (i) physically ensures the linear independence of the BRST versus anti-BRST as well as co-BRST versus anti-co-BRST symmetry transformations, and (ii) provides a logical reason behind the imposition of the above CF type restrictions in the proof of the absolute anticommutativity of the off-shell nilpotent (anti-) BRST as well as (anti-) co-BRST symmetry transformations.
