Title: Spectra of Field Fluctuations in Braneworld Models with Broken Bulk  Lorentz Invariance
Authors: Peter Koroteev and Maxim Libanov
Abstract: We investigate five-dimensional braneworld setups with broken Lorentz invariance continuing the developments of our previous paper (arXiv:0712.1136), where a family of static self-tuning braneworld solutions was found. We show that several known braneworld models can be embedded into this family. Then we give a qualitative analysis of spectra of field fluctuations in backgrounds with broken Lorentz invariance. We also elaborate on one particular model and study spectra of scalar and spinor fields in it. It turns out that the spectra we have found possess very peculiar and unexpected properties.
