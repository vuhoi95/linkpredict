Title: One-Loop Calculations for a Translation Invariant Non-Commutative Gauge  Model
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke and Arnold Rofner and Manfred Schweda and Rene I. P. Sedmik
Abstract: In this paper we discuss one-loop results for the translation invariant non-commutative gauge field model we recently introduced in arXiv:0804.1914. This model relies on the addition of some carefully chosen extra terms in the action which mix long and short scales in order to circumvent the infamous UV/IR mixing, and were motivated by the renormalizable non-commutative scalar model of Gurau et al. (cf. arXiv:0802.0791).
