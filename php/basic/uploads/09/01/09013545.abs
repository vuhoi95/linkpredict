Title: U(1)_R-mediated supersymmetry breaking from a six-dimensional flux  compactification
Authors: Ki-Young Choi and Hyun Min Lee
Abstract: We study the U(1)_R-mediated supersymmetry breaking in a flux compactification of 6D chiral gauged supergravity with codimension-two branes. We consider a concrete model with manifest U(1)_R invariance for moduli stabilization and visible sector in the context of 4D effective supergravity with gauged U(1)_R and determine soft scalar masses in the visible sector mainly by a nonzero U(1)_R D-term. We obtain a low energy superparticle spectrum and discuss on the implications of the obtained non-universal scalar soft masses on the SUSY phenomenology such as dark matter relic abundances.
