Title: Supersymmetric Valence Bond Solid States
Authors: Daniel P. Arovas and Kazuki Hasebe and Xiao-Liang Qi and Shou-Cheng Zhang
Abstract: In this work we investigate the supersymmetric version of the valence bond solid (SVBS) state. In one dimension, the SVBS states continuously interpolate between the valence bond states for integer and half-integer spin chains, and they generally describe superconducting valence bond liquid states. Spin and superconducting correlation functions can be computed exactly for these states, and their correlation lengths are equal at the supersymmetric point. In higher dimensions, the wave function for the SVBS states can describe resonating valence bond states (RVB). The SVBS states for the spin models are shown to be precisely analogous to the bosonic Pfaffian states of the quantum Hall effect. We also give microscopic Hamiltonians for which the SVBS state is the exact ground state.
