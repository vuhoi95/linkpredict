Title: Supersymmetric solutions for non-relativistic holography
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We construct families of supersymmetric solutions of type IIB and D=11 supergravity that are invariant under the non-relativistic conformal algebra for various values of dynamical exponent z greater than or equal to 4 and 3, respectively. The solutions are based on five- and seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds and generalise the known solutions with dynamical exponent z=4 for the type IIB case and z=3 for the D=11 case, respectively.
