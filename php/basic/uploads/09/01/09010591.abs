Title: The temperature in Hawking radiation as tunneling
Authors: Baocheng Zhang and Qing-yu Cai and Ming-sheng Zhan
Abstract: The quasi-classical method of deriving Hawking radiation under the consideration of canonical invariance is investigated. We find that the horizon should be regarded as a two-way barrier and the ingoing amplitude should be calculated according to the negative energy particles tunneling into the black hole because of the whole space-time interchange and thus the standard Hawking temperature is recovered. We also discuss the advantage of the Painlev\'{e} coordinates in Hawking radiation as tunneling.
