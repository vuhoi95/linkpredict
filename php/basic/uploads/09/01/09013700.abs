Title: The Path-Integral Approach to the N=2 Linear Sigma Model
Authors: E. N. Argyres and M. T. M. van Kessel and R. H. P. Kleiss
Abstract: In QFT the effective potential is an important tool to study symmetry breaking phenomena. It is known that, in some theories, the canonical approach and the path-integral approach yield different effective potentials. In this paper we investigate this for the Euclidean N=2 linear sigma model. Both the Green's functions and the effective potential will be computed in three different ways. The relative merits of the various approaches are discussed.
