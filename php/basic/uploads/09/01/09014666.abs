Title: N=8 Gauged Supergravity Theory and N=6 Superconformal Chern-Simons  Matter Theory
Authors: Changhyun Ahn and Kyungsung Woo
Abstract: By studying the previously known holographic N=4 supersymmetric renormalization group flow(Gowdigere-Warner) in four dimensions, we find the mass deformed Chern-Simons matter theory which has N=4 supersymmetry by adding the four mass terms among eight adjoint fields. The geometric superpotential from the eleven dimensions is found and provides the M2-brane probe analysis. As second example, we consider known holographic N=8 supersymmetric renormalization group flow(Pope-Warner) in four dimensions. The eight mass terms are added and similar geometric superpotential is obtained.
