Abstract: We construct a quintom dark energy model with two non-minimally coupled scalar fields, one quintessence and the other phantom field, confined on the warped DGP brane. We study some important issues such as phantom divide line crossing, existence of the bouncing solutions and the stability of the solutions in this framework. We show that this model accounts for crossing of the phantom divide line and realization of the bouncing solutions. This model allows for stability of the solutions in separate regions of the $\omega$-$\omega'$ phase-plane.
