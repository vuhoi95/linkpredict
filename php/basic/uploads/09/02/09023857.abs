Title: Nonrelativistic Superconformal M2-Brane Theory
Authors: Ki-Myeong Lee and Sangmin Lee and Sungjay Lee
Abstract: We investigate the low energy physics of particles in the symmetric phase of the N=6 mass-deformed ABJM theory in terms of the superconformal nonrelativistic field theory with 14 supercharges. They describe the certain kind of excitations on M2 branes in the background of external four-form flux. We study the nonrelativistic superconformal algebra and their representations by using the operator-state correspondence with the related harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. We find the unitarity bounds on the scaling dimension and particle number of any local operator, and comment on subtleties in computing the superconformal Witten index that counts the chiral operators.
