Title: Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Soft-Wall AdS/QCD
Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Joseph I. Kapusta and Thomas M. Kelley
Abstract: We show how to incorporate chiral symmetry breaking in the soft-wall version of the AdS/QCD model by using a modified dilaton profile and a quartic term in the bulk scalar potential. This allows one to separate the dependence on spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking. Moreover our 5D model automatically incorporates linear trajectories and non chiral-symmetry restoration for highly excited radial states. We compare our resulting mass spectra in the scalar, vector and axial-vector sectors with the respective QCD resonances and find reasonable agreement using the known values for the pion mass and decay constant.
