Title: Stringy Instanton Effects in Models with Rigid Magnetised D-branes
Authors: C. Angelantonj and C. Condeescu and E. Dudas and M. Lennek
Abstract: We compute instantonic effects in globally consistent T^6/Z2xZ2 orientifold models with discrete torsion and magnetised D-branes. We consider fractional branes and instantons wrapping the same rigid cycles. We clarify and analyse in detail the low-energy effective action on D-branes in these models. We provide explicit examples where instantons induce linear terms in the charged fields, or non-perturbative mass terms are generated. We also find examples where the gauge theory on fractional branes has conformal symmetry at one-loop, broken by instantonic mass terms at a hierarchically small energy scale.
