Abstract: We solve the recently-proposed equations describing non-BPS extremal multi-center configurations, and construct explicit solutions describing non-supersymmetric extremal black rings in Taub-NUT, as well as the seed solution for the most general extremal non-BPS under-rotating black hole in four dimensions. We also find solutions that contain both a black hole and a black ring, which descend to four-dimensional extremal non-BPS two-center black holes with generic charges.
