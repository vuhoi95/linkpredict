Title: On Classification of QCD defects via holography
Authors: Alexander Gorsky and Valentin Zakharov and Ariel Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We discuss classification of defects of various codimensions within a holographic model of pure Yang-Mills theories or gauge theories with fundamental matter. We focus on their role below and above the phase transition point as well as their weights in the partition function. The general result is that objects which are stable and heavy in one phase are becoming very light (tensionless) in the other phase. We argue that the $\theta$ dependence of the partition function drastically changes at the phase transition point, and therefore it correlates with stability properties of configurations. Some possible applications for study the QCD vacuum properties above and below phase transition are also discussed.
