Title: Analytically solvable Hamiltonians for quantum systems with a nearest  neighbour interaction
Authors: G. Regniers and J. Van der Jeugt
Abstract: We consider quantum systems consisting of a linear chain of n harmonic oscillators coupled by a nearest neighbour interaction of the form $-q_r q_{r+1}$ ($q_r$ refers to the position of the $r$th oscillator). In principle, such systems are always numerically solvable and involve the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix. In this paper, we investigate when such a system is analytically solvable, i.e. when the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the interaction matrix have analytically closed expressions. This is the case when the interaction matrix coincides with the Jacobi matrix of a system of discrete orthogonal polynomials. Our study of possible systems leads to three new analytically solvable Hamiltonians: with a Krawtchouk interaction, a Hahn interaction or a q-Krawtchouk interaction. For each of these cases, we give the spectrum of the Hamiltonian (in analytic form) and discuss some typical properties of the spectra.
