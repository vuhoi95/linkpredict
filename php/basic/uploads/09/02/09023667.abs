Title: P-nflation: generating cosmic Inflation with p-forms
Authors: Cristiano Germani and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: We show that an inflationary background might be realized by using any p-form non-minimally coupled to gravity. Standard scalar field inflation corresponds to the 0-form case and vector inflation to the 1-form. Moreover, we show that the 2- and 3-form fields are dual to a new vector and scalar inflationary theories where the kinetic terms are non-minimally coupled to gravity.
