Title: Duality, Entropy and ADM Mass in Supergravity
Authors: Bianca L. Cerchiai and Sergio Ferrara and Alessio Marrani and Bruno Zumino
Abstract: We consider the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula in four dimensional extended ungauged supergravity and its electric-magnetic duality property. Symmetries of both "large" and "small" extremal black holes are considered, as well as the ADM mass formula for N=4 and N=8 supergravity, preserving different fraction of supersymmetry. The interplay between BPS conditions and duality properties is an important aspect of this investigation.
