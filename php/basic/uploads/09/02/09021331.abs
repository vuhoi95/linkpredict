Abstract: Liouville field theory on a sphere is considered. We explicitly derive a differential equation for four-point correlation functions with one degenerate field $V_{-\frac{mb}{2}}$. We introduce and study also a class of four-point conformal blocks which can be calculated exactly and represented by finite dimensional integrals of elliptic theta-functions for arbitrary intermediate dimension. We study also the bootstrap equations for these conformal blocks and derive integral representations for corresponding four-point correlation functions. A relation between the one-point correlation function of a primary field on a torus and a special four-point correlation function on a sphere is proposed.
