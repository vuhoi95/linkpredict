Title: Particle emission from a black hole on a tense codimension-2 brane
Authors: Usama A. al-Binni and George Siopsis
Abstract: We calculate analytically grey-body factors of Schwarzschild black-holes localized on a 3-brane of finite tension and codimension 2. We obtain explicit expressions for various types of particles emitted in the bulk as well as on the brane in both the low and high frequency regimes. In the latter case, we obtain expressions which are valid for arbitrary number of extra dimensions if the brane tension vanishes.
