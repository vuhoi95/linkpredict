Authors: Paul de Medeiros and José Figueroa-O'Farrill and Elena Méndez-Escobar and Patricia Ritter
Abstract: We prove a structure theorem for finite-dimensional indefinite-signature metric 3-Lie algebras admitting a maximally isotropic centre. This algebraic condition indicates that all the negative-norm states in the associated Bagger-Lambert theory can be consistently decoupled from the physical Hilbert space. As an immediate application of the theorem, new examples beyond index 2 are constructed. The lagrangian for the Bagger-Lambert theory based on a general physically admissible 3-Lie algebra of this kind is obtained. Following an expansion around a suitable vacuum, the precise relationship between such theories and certain more conventional maximally supersymmetric gauge theories is found. These typically involve particular combinations of N=8 super Yang-Mills and massive vector supermultiplets. A dictionary between the 3-Lie algebraic data and the physical parameters in the resulting gauge theories will thereby be provided.
