Title: Massive particles coupled with 2+1 dimensional gravity and  noncommutative field theory
Authors: Yuya Sasai and Naoki Sasakura
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the effective field theory of the Ponzano-Regge model with which spinless massive particles are coupled is given by three dimensional Euclidean noncommutative scalar field theory in the Lie algebraic noncommutative space [x^i, x^j]=2i kappa epsilon^{ijk}x_k (i,j,k=1,2,3) with kappa=4 pi G, where G is a gravitational constant. We examine whether there exists the relation between spinless massive particles coupled with 2+1 dimensional Einstein gravity and the Lorentzian version of the noncommutative field theory. Then, we point out that the momentum space of the spinless massive particles in 2+1 dimensional Einstein gravity is generally different from that of the noncommutative field theory, which is given by SL(2,R)/Z_2 group space.
