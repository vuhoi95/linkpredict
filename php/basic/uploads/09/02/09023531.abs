Title: On Unitarity of Massive Gravity in Three Dimensions
Authors: Masashi Nakasone and Ichiro Oda
Abstract: We examine a unitarity of a particular higher-derivative extension of general relativity in three space-time dimensions, which has been recently shown to be equivalent to the Pauli-Fierz massive gravity at the linearized approximation level, and explore a possibility of generalizing the model to higher space-time dimensions. We find that the model in three dimensions is indeed unitary in the tree-level, but the corresponding model in higher dimensions is not so due to the appearance of non-unitary massless spin-2 modes.
