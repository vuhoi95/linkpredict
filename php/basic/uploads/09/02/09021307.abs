Title: Comments on defects in the a_r Toda field theories
Authors: E. Corrigan and C. Zambon
Abstract: A simple, basic, argument is given, based solely on energy-momentum considerations to recover conditions under which a_r affine or conformal Toda field theories can support defects of integrable type. Associated triangle relations are solved to provide expressions for transmission matrices that generalize previously known examples calculated for the sine-Gordon model and the a_2 affine Toda model.
