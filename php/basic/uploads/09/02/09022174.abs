Title: Properties of codimension-2 braneworlds in six-dimensional Lovelock  theory
Authors: Christos Charmousis and Antonios Papazoglou
Abstract: We consider maximally symmetric 3-branes embedded in a six-dimensional bulk spacetime with Lovelock dynamics. We study the properties of the solutions with respect to their induced curvature, their vacuum energy and their effective compactness in the extra dimensions. Some simple solutions are shown to give rise to self-accelerating braneworlds, whereas several others solutions have self-tuning properties. For the case of geometric self-acceleration we argue that the cross-over scale in between four-dimensional and higher-dimensional gravity and the scale of late-time geometric acceleration, fixed by the present horizon size, are related via the conical deficit angle of the six-dimensional bulk solution, which is a free parameter.
