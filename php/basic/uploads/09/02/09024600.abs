Title: Dynamical symmetry of the Kaluza-Klein monopole
Authors: L. Feher and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: The Kepler-type dynamical symmetries of the Kaluza-Klein monopole are reviewed. At the classical level, the conservation of the angular momentum and of a Runge-Lenz vector imply that the trajectories are conic sections. The o(4) algebra allows us to calculate the bound-state spectrum, and the o(3,1) algebra yields the scattering matrix. The symmetry algebra extends to o(4,2).
