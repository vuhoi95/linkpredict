Title: Supersymmetric reduced models with a symmetry based on Filippov algebra
Authors: Kazuyuki Furuuchi and Dan Tomino
Abstract: Generalizations of the reduced model of super Yang-Mills theory obtained by replacing the Lie algebra structure to Filippov $n$-algebra structures are studied. Conditions for the reduced model actions to be supersymmetric are examined. These models are related with what we call $\{cal N}_{min}=2$ super $p$-brane actions.
