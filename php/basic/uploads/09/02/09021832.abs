Title: Magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate via holography
Authors: Alexander Gorsky and Alexander Krikun
Abstract: We discuss the holographic derivation of the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate. It is found that the susceptibility emerges upon the account of the Chern-Simons term in the holographic action. We demonstrate that Vainshtein's relation is not exact in the hard wall dual model but is fulfilled with high accuracy. Some comments concerning the spectral density of the Dirac operator are presented.
