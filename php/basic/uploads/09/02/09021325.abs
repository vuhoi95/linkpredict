Title: Holomorphicity and Modularity in Seiberg-Witten Theories with Matter
Authors: Min-xin Huang and Albrecht Klemm
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational corrections to the effective action of N=2 SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory with matter using modularity, the holomorphic anomaly equation and expected behavior at the boundaries of the moduli space. As in pure gauge theory we show that the gap condition at the dyon singularities completely fixes the gravitational corrections. We discuss the behavior of the gravitational corrections at the conformal points. We compare our results with the recursive solution of the loop equation in the matrix model approach, which provides in addition open amplitudes.
