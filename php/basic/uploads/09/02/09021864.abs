Title: D-deformed Wess-Zumino model and its renormalizability properties
Authors: Marija Dimitrijevic and Voja Radovanovic
Abstract: Using the methods developed in earlier papers we analyze a new type of deformation of the superspace. The twist we use to deform the N=1 SUSY Hopf algebra is non-hermitian and is given in terms of the covariant derivatives $D_\alpha$. A SUSY invariant deformation of the Wess-Zumino action is constructed and compared with results already known in the literature. Finally, by calculating divergences of the two-point Green functions a preliminary analysis of renormalizability properties of the constructed model is done. As expected, there is no renormalization of mass and no tadpole diagrams appear.
