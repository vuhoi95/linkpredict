Title: Local and Semi-local Vortices in Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons model
Authors: M. Buck and E. F. Moreno and F. A. Schaposnik
Abstract: We study BPS vortex configurations in three dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills theories with Chern-Simons interaction coupled to scalar fields carrying flavor. We consider two kind of configurations: local vortices (when the number of flavors $N_f=N$), and semi-local vortices (when $N_f>N$). In both cases we carefully analyze the electric and magnetic properties and present explicit numerical solutions.
