Title: Dressed Giant Magnons on CP^3
Authors: Chrysostomos Kalousios and Marcus Spradlin and Anastasia Volovich
Abstract: A new example of AdS/CFT duality relating IIA string theory on AdS_4 x CP^3 to N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory has recently been provided by ABJM. By now a number of papers have considered particular giant magnon classical string solutions in the CP^3 background, corresponding to excitations in the spin chain picture of the dual field theory. In this paper we apply the CP^3 = SU(4)/S(U(3) x U(1)) dressing method to the problem of constructing general classical string solutions describing various configurations of giant magnons. As a particular application we present a new giant magnon solution on CP^3. Interestingly the dressed solution carries only a single SO(6) charge, in contrast with the dyonic magnons found in previous applications of the dressing method.
