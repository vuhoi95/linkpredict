Title: Beyond conventional factorization: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with  radial oscillator spectrum
Authors: Ivan Cabrera-Munguia and Oscar Rosas-Ortiz
Abstract: The eigenvalue problem of the spherically symmetric oscillator Hamiltonian is revisited in the context of canonical raising and lowering operators. The Hamiltonian is then factorized in terms of two not mutually adjoint factorizing operators which, in turn, give rise to a non-Hermitian radial Hamiltonian. The set of eigenvalues of this new Hamiltonian is exactly the same as the energy spectrum of the radial oscillator and the new square-integrable eigenfunctions are complex Darboux-deformations of the associated Laguerre polynomials.
