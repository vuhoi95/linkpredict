Abstract: Axion fields provide the most elegant solution to the strong CP problem. In string compactifications it is difficult to obtain an axion whose decay constant is consistent with current cosmological bounds. We examine this question in theories with accidental U(1) symmetries that appear as low energy remnants of discrete symmetries. We refer to the axion-like particles from the spontaneous breakdown of these symmetries as accions. In such systems, the accion decay constant depends on the vacuum configuration and can be lowered to fit the bounds. Furthermore, we find that such accions with consistent decay constant can be embedded in special vacua of Z_6-II orbifold models with realistic features.
