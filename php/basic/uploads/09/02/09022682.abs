Abstract: We propose to use the second Hopf map for the reduction (via SU(2) group action) of the eight-dimensional N=8 supersymmetric mechanics to five-dimensional supersymmetric systems specified by the presence of an SU(2) Yang monopole. For our purpose we develop the relevant Lagrangian reduction procedure. The reduced system is characterized by its invariance under the N=5 or N=4 supersymmetry generators (with or without an additional conserved BRST charge operator) which commute with the su(2) generators.
