Title: Generation of Matrix Models by W-operators
Authors: A. Morozov and Sh. Shakirov
Abstract: We show that partition functions of various matrix models can be obtained by acting on elementary functions with exponents of W-operators. A number of illustrations is given, including the Gaussian Hermitian matrix model, Hermitian model in external field and the Hurwitz-Kontsevitch model, for which we suggest an elegant matrix-model representation. In all these examples, the relevant W-operators belong to the W_3-algebra.
