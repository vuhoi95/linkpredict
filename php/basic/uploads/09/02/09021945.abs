Title: Parikh-Wilczek Tunneling from Noncommutative Higher Dimensional Black  Holes
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and S. Hamid Mehdipour
Abstract: We study tunneling of massless and massive particles through the smeared quantum horizon of the extra-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. The emission rate of the particles' tunneling is modified by noncommutativity effects in a bulk spacetime of dimension $d$. The issues of information loss and possible correlations between emitted particles are discussed. We show that even by considering both noncommutativity and braneworld effects, there is no correlation between different modes of evaporation at least at late-time and within approximations used in the calculations. However, incorporation of quantum gravity effects such as modification of the standard dispersion relation or generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, leads to the correlation between emitted particles. Although time-evolution of these correlations is not trivial, a part of information coming out of the black hole can be preserved in these correlations. On the other hand, as a well-known result of spacetime noncommutativity, a part of information may be preserved in a stable black hole remnant.
