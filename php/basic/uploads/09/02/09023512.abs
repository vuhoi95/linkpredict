Title: Nine-Propagator Master Integrals for Massless Three-Loop Form Factors
Authors: G. Heinrich and T. Huber and D. A. Kosower and V. A. Smirnov
Abstract: We complete the calculation of master integrals for massless three-loop form factors by computing the previously-unknown three diagrams with nine propagators in dimensional regularisation. Each of the integrals yields a six-fold Mellin-Barnes representation which we use to compute the coefficients of the Laurent expansion in epsilon. Using Riemann zeta functions of up to weight six, we give fully analytic results for one integral; for a second, analytic results for all but the finite term; for the third, analytic results for all but the last two coefficients in the Laurent expansion. The remaining coefficients are given numerically to sufficiently high accuracy for phenomenological applications.
