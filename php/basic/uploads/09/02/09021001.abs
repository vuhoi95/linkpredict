Title: Central Charges in Extreme Black Hole/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Geoffrey Comp√®re and Keiju Murata and Tatsuma Nishioka
Abstract: The Kerr/CFT correspondence has been recently broadened to the general extremal black holes under the assumption that the central charges from the non-gravitational fields vanish. To confirm this proposal, we derive the expression of the conserved charges in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with topological terms in four and five dimensions and check that the above assumption was correct. Combining the computed central charge with the expected form of the temperature, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the general extremal black holes in four and five dimensions can be reproduced by using the Cardy formula.
