Title: Holonomy Loops, Spectral Triples & Quantum Gravity
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup and Ryszard Nest
Abstract: We review the motivation, construction and physical interpretation of a semi-finite spectral triple obtained through a rearrangement of central elements of loop quantum gravity. The triple is based on a countable set of oriented graphs and the algebra consists of generalized holonomy loops in this set. The Dirac type operator resembles a global functional derivation operator and the interaction between the algebra of holonomy loops and the Dirac type operator reproduces the structure of a quantized Poisson bracket of general relativity. Finally we give a heuristic argument as to how a natural candidate for a quantized Hamiltonian might emerge from this spectral triple construction.
