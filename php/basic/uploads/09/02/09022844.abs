Title: Singularity Avoidance in Nonlinear Quantum Cosmology
Authors: Le-Huy Nguyen and Rajesh R. Parwani
Abstract: We extend our previous study on the effects of an information-theoretically motivated nonlinear correction to the Wheeler-deWitt equation in the minisuperspace scheme for FRW universes. Firstly we show that even when the geometry is hyperbolic, and matter given by a cosmological constant, the nonlinearity can still provide a barrier to screen the initial singularity, just as in the case for flat universes. Secondly, in the flat case we show that singularity avoidance in the presence of a free massless scalar field is perturbatively possible for a very large class of initially unperturbed quantum states, generalising our previous discussion using Gaussian states.
