Abstract: Supersymmetric SU(N_C) gauge theories possess runaway-type superpotentials for N_F < N_C, where N_F is the flavor number of massless quarks. We show that the runaway behavior can be stabilized for N_F nearly equal to N_C by introducing singlets with the aid of perturbative corrections to the Kahler potential, generating (local) minima of supersymmetry breaking.
