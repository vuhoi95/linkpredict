Title: Fermions in non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Amin Akhavan and Mohsen Alishahiha and Ali Davody and Ali Vahedi
Abstract: We extend the non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspondence to the fermionic fields. In particular we study the two point function of a fermionic operator in non-relativistic CFTs by making use of a massive fermion propagating in geometries with Schrodinger group isometry. Although the boundary of the geometries with Schrodinger group isometry differ from that in AdS geometries where the dictionary of AdS/CFT is established, using the general procedure of AdS/CFT correspondence, we see that the resultant two point function has the expected form for fermionic operators in non-relativistic CFTs, though a non-trivial regularization may be needed.
