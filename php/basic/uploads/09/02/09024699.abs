Title: Dark radiation as a signature of dark energy
Authors: Sourish Dutta and Stephen D. H. Hsu and David Reeb and Robert J. Scherrer
Abstract: We propose a simple dark energy model with the following properties: the model predicts a late-time dark radiation component that is not ruled out by current observational data, but which produces a distinctive time-dependent equation of state w(z) for z < 3. The dark energy field can be coupled strongly enough to Standard Model particles to be detected in colliders, and the model requires only modest additional particle content and little or no fine-tuning other than a new energy scale of order milli-electron volts.
