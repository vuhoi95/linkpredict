Title: Effects of dark sectors' mutual interaction on the growth of structures
Authors: Jian-Hua he and Bin Wang and Y. P. Jing
Abstract: We present a general formalism to study the growth of dark matter perturbations when dark energy perturbations and interactions between dark sectors are present. We show that dynamical stability of the growth of structure depends on the type of coupling between dark sectors. By taking the appropriate coupling to ensure the stable growth of structure, we observe that the effect of the dark sectors' interaction overwhelms that of dark energy perturbation on the growth function of dark matter perturbation. Due to the influence of the interaction, the growth index can differ from the value without interaction by an amount within the observational sensibility, which provides a possibility to disclose the interaction between dark sectors through future observations on the growth of large structure.
