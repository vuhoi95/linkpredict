Title: The XXZ model with anti-periodic twisted boundary conditions
Authors: SÃ¶nke Niekamp and Tobias Wirth and Holger Frahm
Abstract: We derive functional equations for the eigenvalues of the XXZ model subject to anti-diagonal twisted boundary conditions by means of fusion of transfer matrices and by Sklyanin's method of separation of variables. Our findings coincide with those obtained using Baxter's method and are compared to the recent solution of Galleas. As an application we study the finite size scaling of the ground state energy of the model in the critical regime.
