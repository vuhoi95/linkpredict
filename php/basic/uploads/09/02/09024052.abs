Title: Optical potentials using resonance states in Supersymmetric Quantum  Mechanics
Authors: N. Fernandez-Garcia and O. Rosas-Ortiz
Abstract: Complex potentials are constructed as Darboux-deformations of short range, radial nonsingular potentials. They behave as optical devices which both refracts and absorbs light waves. The deformation preserves the initial spectrum of energies and it is implemented by means of a Gamow-Siegert function (resonance state). As straightforward example, the method is applied to the radial square well. Analytical derivations of the involved resonances show that they are `quantized' while the corresponding wave-functions are shown to behave as bounded states under the broken of parity symmetry of the related one-dimensional problem.
