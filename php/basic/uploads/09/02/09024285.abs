Title: Infrared divergence of pure Einstein gravity contributions to  cosmological density power spectrum
Authors: Hyerim Noh and Donghui Jeong and Jai-chan Hwang
Abstract: We probe the pure Einstein's gravity contributions to the second-order density power spectrum. In the small-scale, we discover that the Einstein's gravity contribution is negligibly small. This guarantees that Newton's gravity is sufficient to handle the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. In the large scale, however, we discover that the Einstein's gravity contribution to the second-order power spectrum dominates the linear-order power spectrum. Thus, pure Einstein gravity contribution appearing in the third-order perturbation leads to an infrared divergence in the power spectrum.
