Title: CMB dipole revisited
Authors: Josef Ludescher and Ralf Hofmann
Abstract: We re-evaluate the build-up of a horizon-sized temperature profile of amplitude $\delta T/T \sim 10^{-3}$ at $z\sim 1$ in light of an improved determination of the black-body anomaly, based on a pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, and the correction of a mistake in deriving the evolution equation for $\delta T$. Our present results for the temperature profiles hardly are distinguishable from those published previously.
