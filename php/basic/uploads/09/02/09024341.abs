Title: T-Duality as a Duality of Loop Group Bundles
Authors: Peter Bouwknegt and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: Representing the data of a string compactified on a circle in the background of H-flux in terms of the geometric data of a principal loop group bundle, we show that T-duality in type II string theory can be understood as the interchange of the momentum and winding homomorphisms of the principal loop group bundle, thus giving rise to a new interpretation of T-duality.
