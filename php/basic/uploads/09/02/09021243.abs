Title: Asymmetrically Warped Brane Models, Bulk Photons and Lorentz Invariance
Authors: K. Farakos and N. E. Mavromatos and P. Pasipoularides
Abstract: We present a brief review of our recent work [1] on asymmetrically warped brane models, where the background metric is characterized by different time and space warp factors. In particular we examine the case of bulk photons and we show that the standard Lorentz invariant dispersion relation is corrected by nonlinear terms which lead to an Energy-dependent speed of light. Stringent constraints on the parameters of our models can be set by comparing the results with recent data from high-energy Gamma-Ray Astrophysics, for instance the MAGIC Telescope.
