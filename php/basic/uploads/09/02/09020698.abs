Title: Time-dependent backgrounds of two dimensional string theory from the  $c=1$ matrix model
Authors: J. Sadeghi and B. Pourhassan
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use correspondence between solutions in the $c=1$ matrix model collective field theory and coupled dilaton-gravity to a massless scalar field. First, we obtain the incoming and outgoing fluctuations for the time-dependent backgrounds with the lightlike and spacelike boundaries. In the case of spacelike boundaries, we have done here for the first time. Then by using the leg-pole transformations we find corresponding tachyon field in two dimensional string theory for lightlikes and spacelikes boundary.
