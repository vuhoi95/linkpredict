Abstract: We construct twisted instanton solutions of CP(n) models. Generically a charge-k instanton splits into k(n+1) well-separated and almost static constituents carrying fractional topological charges and being ordered along the noncompact direction. The locations, sizes and charges of the constituents are related to the moduli parameters of the instantons. We sketch how solutions with fractional total charge can be obtained. We also calculate the fermionic zero modes with quasi-periodic boundary conditions in the background of twisted instantons for minimally and supersymmetrically coupled fermions. The zero modes are tracers for the constituents and show a characteristic hopping. The analytical findings are compared to results extracted from Monte-Carlo generated and cooled configurations of the corresponding lattice models. Analytical and numerical results are in full agreement and it is demonstrated that the fermionic zero modes are excellent filters for constituents hidden in fluctuating lattice configurations.
