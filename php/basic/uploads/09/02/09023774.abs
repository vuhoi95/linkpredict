Title: Deformed squeezed states in noncommutative phase space
Authors: Bing-Sheng Lin and Si-Cong Jing
Abstract: A deformed boson algebra is naturally introduced from studying quantum mechanics on noncommutative phase space in which both positions and momenta are noncommuting each other. Based on this algebra, corresponding intrinsic noncommutative coherent and squeezed state representations are constructed, and variances of single- and two-mode quadrature operators on these states are evaluated. The result indicates that in order to maintain Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, a restriction between the noncommutative parameters is required.
