Title: Spinor two-point functions and Peierls bracket in de Sitter space
Authors: Giampiero Esposito and Raju Roychowdhury
Abstract: This paper studies spinor two-point functions for spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 fields in maximally symmetric spaces such as de Sitter spacetime, by using intrinsic geometric objects. The Feynman, positive- and negative-frequency Green functions are then obtained for these cases, from which we eventually display the supercommutator and the Peierls bracket under such a setting in two-component-spinor language.
