Title: On a Logarithmic Deformation of the Supersymmetric bc-system on Curved  Manifolds
Authors: Kirsten Vogeler and Michael Flohr
Abstract: E. Frenkel, A. Losev and N. Nekrasov claim that a certain class of theories on compact Kahler manifolds and in particular the "gauged" supersymmetric bc-system on CP^1 are logarithmic conformal field theories. We discuss that proposition on a classical level for the bc-system on CP^1. The outcome of our investigation conforms to their conjecture. The property of being a logarithmic CFT thus can be interpreted as an effect of gravity.
