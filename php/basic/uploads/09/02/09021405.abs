Title: Confinement Mechanism in the Field Correlator Method
Authors: Yu. A. Simonov and V. I. Shevchenko
Abstract: Confinement in QCD is caused by vacuum fluctuations of gluon fields. There are two numerically different scales, characterizing nonperturbative QCD vacuum dynamics: a "small" scale, corresponding to gluon condensate, critical temperature etc, which is about 0.2-0.3 GeV, and a "large" one, given by inverse confining string width, glueball and gluelump masses etc, which is about 1.5-2.5 GeV. We discuss this mismatch in a picture where confinement is ensured by two-point gauge-invariant field strength correlator of special type. It supports most of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics, while contribution of other terms is argued to be small. This object, on the other hand, can be expressed via gluelump Green's function, whose dynamics is defined in terms of the same correlator. In this way one obtains a self-consistent scheme of mean-field type leading to permanent confinement at temperatures less than the critical one.
