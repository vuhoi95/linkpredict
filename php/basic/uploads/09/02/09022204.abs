Title: Non-Relativistic M2-brane Gauge Theory and New Superconformal Algebra
Authors: Yu Nakayama and Makoto Sakaguchi and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We study non-relativistic limits of the N=6 Chern-Simons-Matter theory that arises as a low-energy limit of the M2-brane gauge theory with background flux. The model admits several different non-relativistic limits and we find that the maximal supersymmetry we construct has 14 components of supercharges, which is a novel example of non-relativistic superconformal algebra in (1+2) dimension. We also investigate the other limits that realize less supersymmetries.
