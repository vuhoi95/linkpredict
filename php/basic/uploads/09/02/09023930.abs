Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for planar AdS/CFT: a proposal
Authors: Diego Bombardelli and Davide Fioravanti and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: Moving from the mirror theory Bethe-Yang equations proposed by Arutyunov and Frolov, we derive the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations which should control the spectrum of the planar $\text{AdS}_5/\text{CFT}_4$ correspondence. The associated set of universal functional relations (Y-system) satisfied by the exponentials of the TBA pseudoenergies is deduced, confirming the structure inferred by Gromov, Kazakov and Vieira.
