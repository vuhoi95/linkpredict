Title: Crum's Theorem for `Discrete' Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: In one-dimensional quantum mechanics, or the Sturm-Liouville theory, Crum's theorem describes the relationship between the original and the associated Hamiltonian systems, which are iso-spectral except for the lowest energy state. Its counterpart in `discrete' quantum mechanics is formulated algebraically, elucidating the basic structure of the discrete quantum mechanics, whose Schr\"odinger equation is a difference equation.
