Title: All null supersymmetric backgrounds of N=2, D=4 gauged supergravity  coupled to abelian vector multiplets
Authors: Dietmar Klemm and Emanuele Zorzan
Abstract: The lightlike supersymmetric solutions of N=2, D=4 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of abelian vector multiplets are classified using spinorial geometry techniques. The solutions fall into two classes, depending on whether the Killing spinor is constant or not. In both cases, we give explicit examples of supersymmetric backgrounds. Among these BPS solutions, which preserve one quarter of the supersymmetry, there are gravitational waves propagating on domain walls or on bubbles of nothing that asymptote to AdS_4. Furthermore, we obtain the additional constraints obeyed by half-supersymmetric vacua. These are divided into four categories, that include bubbles of nothing which are asymptotically AdS_4, pp-waves on domain walls, AdS_3 x R, and spacetimes conformal to AdS_3 times an interval.
