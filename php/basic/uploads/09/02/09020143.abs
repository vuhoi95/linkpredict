Title: On the Ricci flow and emergent quantum mechanics
Authors: J. M. Isidro and J. L. G. Santander and P. Fernandez de Cordoba
Abstract: The Ricci flow equation of a conformally flat Riemannian metric on a closed 2-dimensional configuration space is analysed. It turns out to be equivalent to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a point particle subject to a potential function that is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature of configuration space. This allows one to obtain Schroedinger quantum mechanics from Perelman's action functional: the quantum-mechanical wavefunction is the exponential of $i$ times the conformal factor of the metric on configuration space. We explore links with the recently discussed emergent quantum mechanics.
