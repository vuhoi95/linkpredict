Title: Hard thermal loops in static external fields
Authors: J. Frenkel and S. H. Pereira and N. Takahashi
Abstract: We study, in the imaginary-time formalism, the high temperature behavior of n-point thermal loops in static Yang-Mills and gravitational fields. We show that in this regime, any hard thermal loop gives the same leading contribution as the one obtained by evaluating the loop at zero external energies and momenta.
