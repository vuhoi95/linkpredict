Abstract: We apply the BRST approach, developed for higher spin field theories, to Lagrangian construction for totally antisymmetric massive fermionic fields in AdS_d space. As well as generic higher spin massive theories, the obtained Lagrangian theory is a reducible gauge model containing, besides the basic field, a number of auxiliary (Stuckelberg) fields and the order of reducibility grows with the value of the rank of the antisymmetric field. However, unlike the generic higher spin theory, for the special case under consideration we show that one can get rid of all the auxiliary fields and the final Lagrangian for fermionic antisymmetric field is formulated only in terms of basic field.
