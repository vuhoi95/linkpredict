Title: A Primer on Resonances in Quantum Mechanics
Authors: O. Rosas-Ortiz and N. Fernandez-Garcia and Sara Cruz y Cruz
Abstract: After a pedagogical introduction to the concept of resonance in classical and quantum mechanics, some interesting applications are discussed. The subject includes resonances occurring as one of the effects of radiative reaction, the resonances involved in the refraction of electromagnetic waves by a medium with a complex refractive index, and quantum decaying systems described in terms of resonant states of the energy. Some useful mathematical approaches like the Fourier transform, the complex scaling method and the Darboux transformation are also reviewed.
