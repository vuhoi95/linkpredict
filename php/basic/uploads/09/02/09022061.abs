Title: Quantum Fluctuations and Geometry: From Graph Counting to Ricci Flow
Authors: Mauro Carfora and Stefano Romano
Abstract: We discuss in rather general terms quantum field theories dealing with spaces of maps between Riemannian manifolds. In particular we explore the well--known connection between the renormalization group flow for non--linear sigma models and the Ricci flow.
