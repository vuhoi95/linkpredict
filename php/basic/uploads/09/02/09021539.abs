Title: The One-loop Open Superstring Massless Five-point Amplitude with the  Non-Minimal Pure Spinor Formalism
Authors: Carlos R. Mafra and Christian Stahn
Abstract: We compute the massless five-point amplitude of open superstrings using the non-minimal pure spinor formalism and obtain a simple kinematic factor in pure spinor superspace, which can be viewed as the natural extension of the kinematic factor of the massless four-point amplitude. It encodes bosonic and fermionic external states in supersymmetric form and reduces to existing bosonic amplitudes when expanded in components, therefore proving their equivalence. We also show how to compute the kinematic structures involving fermionic states.
