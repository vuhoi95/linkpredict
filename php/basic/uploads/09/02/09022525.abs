Title: One Loop Calculation of Cosmological Constant in a Scale Invariant  Theory
Authors: Pankaj Jain and Subhadip Mitra
Abstract: We compute the cosmological constant in a scale invariant scalar field theory. The gravitational action is also suitably modified to respect scale invariance. Due to scale invariance the theory does not admit a cosmological constant term. The scale invariance is broken by a recently introduced mechanism called cosmological symmetry breaking. This leads to a nonzero cosmological constant. We compute the one loop corrections to the cosmological constant and show that it is finite.
