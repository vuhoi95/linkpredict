Title: Attractor Universe in the Scalar-Tensor Theory of Gravitation
Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Yasunori Fujii
Abstract: In the scalar-tensor theory of gravitation it seems nontrivial to establish if solutions of the cosmological equations in the presence of a cosmological constant behave as attractors independently of the initial values. We develop a general formulation in terms of two-dimensional phase space. We show that there are two kinds of fixed points, one of which is an attractor depending on the coupling constant and equation of state. In the case with a power-law potential in the Jordan frame, we also find new type of inflation caused by the coupling to the matter fluid.
