Title: Energetics of a rotating charged black hole in 5-dimensional  supergravity
Authors: Kartik Prabhu and Naresh Dadhich
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the event horizon and static limit for a charged rotating black hole solution of minimal supergravity theory in (1 + 4) dimension. Unlike the four-dimensional case, there are in general two rotations, and they couple to both mass and charge. This gives rise to much richer structure to ergosphere leading to energy extraction even for axial fall. Another interesting feature is that the metric in this case is sensitive to the sign of the Maxwell charge.
