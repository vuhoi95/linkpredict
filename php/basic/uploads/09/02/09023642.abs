Title: Classification of IIB backgrounds with 28 supersymmetries
Authors: U. Gran and J. Gutowski and G. Papadopoulos
Abstract: We show that all IIB backgrounds with strictly 28 supersymmetries are locally isometric to the plane wave solution of arXiv:hep-th/0206195. Moreover, we demonstrate that all solutions with more than 26 supersymmetries and only 5-form flux are maximally supersymmetric. The N=28 plane wave solution is a superposition of the maximally supersymmetric IIB plane wave with a heterotic string solution. We investigate the propagation of strings in this background, find the spectrum and give the string light-cone Hamiltonian.
