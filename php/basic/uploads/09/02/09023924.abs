Title: From Maxwell Stresses to Photon-like Objects through Curvature  Geometrisation of Physical Interaction
Authors: Stoil Donev and Maria Tashkova
Abstract: This paper aims to review our recent results on exploring the capabilities of non-quantum field theory as a possible tool for describing single photon-like objects, considered as massless time-stable spatially finite physical entities with compatible translational-rotational dynamical structure. The main idea is to interpret the local physical interaction as available Frobenius curvature. It consists of five chapters and includes 22 sections and subsections.
