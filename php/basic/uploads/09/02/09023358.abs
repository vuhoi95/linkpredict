Title: Particle astrophysics in nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: An explanation of relations between the large scale structure of the universe and the tiny scale structure of the particle physics, e.g. the observed mysterious relation between the (dark) energy density and the dark matter of the universe and the neutrino mass and the SUSY breaking mass scale of the particle physics may be given by the nonlinear supersymmmetric general relativity (NLSUSY GR). NLSUSY GR shows that studying the physics before/of the Big Bang of the universe may be significant and may give new insight to unsolved problems of the low energy particle physics, cosmology and their relations.
