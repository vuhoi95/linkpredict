Title: SU(1,1) Coherent States For Position-Dependent Mass Singular Oscillators
Authors: Sara Cruz y Cruz and Oscar Rosas-Ortiz
Abstract: The Schroedinger equation for position-dependent mass singular oscillators is solved by means of the factorization method and point transformations. These systems share their spectrum with the conventional singular oscillator. Ladder operators are constructed to close the su(1,1) Lie algebra and the involved point transformations are shown to preserve the structure of the Barut-Girardello and Perelomov coherent states.
