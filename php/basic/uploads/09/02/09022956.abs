Abstract: We investigate the quantum effects of the nonlocal gauge invariant operator $\frac{1}{{}{D}^{2}}{F}_{\mu \nu}\ast \frac{1}{{}{D}^{2}}{F}^{\mu \nu}$ in the noncommutative U(1) action and its consequences to the infrared sector of the theory. Nonlocal operators of such kind were proposed to solve the infrared problem of the noncommutative gauge theories evading the questions on the explicit breaking of the Lorentz invariance. More recently, a first step in the localization of this operator was accomplished by means of the introduction of an extra tensorial matter field, and the first loop analysis was carried out $(Eur.Phys.J.\textbf{C62}:433-443,2009)$. We will complete this localization avoiding the introduction of new degrees of freedom beyond those of the original action by using only BRST doublets. This will allow us to make a complete BRST algebraic study of the renormalizability of the theory, following Zwanziger's method of localization of nonlocal operators in QFT.
