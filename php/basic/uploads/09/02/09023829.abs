Title: Algebraic Structures in Euclidean and Minkowskian Two-Dimensional  Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Liang Kong and Ingo Runkel
Abstract: We review how modular categories, and commutative and non-commutative Frobenius algebras arise in rational conformal field theory. For Euclidean CFT we use an approach based on sewing of surfaces, and in the Minkowskian case we describe CFT by a net of operator algebras.
