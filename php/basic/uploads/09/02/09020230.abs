Title: Hawking temperature and higher order calculations
Authors: Bhramar Chatterjee and P. Mitra
Abstract: Hawking radiation has recently been explained by using solutions of wave equations across black hole horizons in a WKB approximation. Higher order calculations using both usual and non-singular coordinates are found to change the solution for zero spin, but this change is not an alteration of the Hawking temperature. For spin 1/2, there is no correction to the simplest form of the solution.
