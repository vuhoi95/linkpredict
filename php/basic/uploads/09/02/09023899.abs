Title: Black hole solutions in massive gravity
Authors: Michael V. Bebronne and Peter G. Tinyakov
Abstract: The static vacuum spherically symmetric solutions in massive gravity are obtained both analytically and numerically. The solutions depend on two parameters (integration constants): the mass M (or, equivalently, the Schwarzschild radius), and an additional parameter, the "scalar charge" S. At zero value of S and positive mass the standard Schwarzschild black hole solutions are recovered. Depending on the parameters of the model and the signs of M and S, the solutions may or may not have horizon. Those with the horizon describe modified black holes provided they are stable against small perturbations. In the analytically solvable example, the modified black hole solutions may have both attractive and repulsive (anti-gravitating) behavior at large distances. At intermediate distances the gravitational potential of a modified black hole may mimics the presence of dark matter. Modified black hole solutions are also found numerically in more realistic massive gravity models which are attractors of the cosmological evolution.
