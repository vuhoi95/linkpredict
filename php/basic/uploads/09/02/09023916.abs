Title: Asymptotic symmetry of geometries with Schrodinger isometry
Authors: Mohsen Alishahiha and Reza Fareghbal and Amir E. Mosaffa and Shahin Rouhani
Abstract: We show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra of geometries with Schrodinger isometry in any dimension is an infinite dimensional algebra containing one copy of Virasoro algebra. It is compatible with the fact that the corresponding geometries are dual to non-relativistic CFTs whose symmetry algebra is the Schrodinger algebra which admits an extension to an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra containing a Virasoro subalgebra.
