Title: Position Dependent Mass Oscillators and Coherent States
Authors: Sara Cruz y Cruz and Oscar Rosas-Ortiz
Abstract: The solving of the Schrodinger equation for a position-dependent mass quantum system is studied in two ways. First, it is found the interaction which must be applied on a mass m(x) in order to supply it with a particular spectrum of energies. Second, given a specific potential V(x) acting on the mass m(x), the related spectrum is found. The method of solution is applied to a wide class of position-dependent mass oscillators and the corresponding coherent states are constructed. The analytical expressions of such position-dependent mass coherent states preserve the functional structure of the Glauber states.
