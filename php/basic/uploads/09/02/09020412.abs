Authors: Nahomi Kan and Koichiro Kobayashi and Teruki Hanada and Kiyoshi Shiraishi
Abstract: We examine cancellation of long-range forces in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilatonic system. Several conditions of the equilibrium of two charged masses in general relativity is found by many authors. These conditions are altered by taking account of dilatonic field. Under the new condition, we show cancellation of $1/r^2$ potential using Feynman diagrams.
