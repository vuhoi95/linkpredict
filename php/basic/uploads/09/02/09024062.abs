Title: Off-center collisions in AdS_5 with applications to multiplicity  estimates in heavy-ion collisions
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Silviu S. Pufu and Amos Yarom
Abstract: We study the trapped surface produced by an off-center collision of light-like, point-sourced shock waves in anti-de Sitter space. We find an analytic expression for the shape of the trapped surface in the limit where the energy of the shock waves is large and the impact parameter is not too large. We use the area of the trapped surface to estimate a lower bound on the entropy produced in the collision. We compare our results to particle multiplicity measurements in heavy-ion collisions as interpreted through the Glauber model. In an attempt to roughly simulate the effects of asymptotic freedom and confinement in quantum chromodynamics, we also consider the effects of slicing off parts of anti-de Sitter space.
