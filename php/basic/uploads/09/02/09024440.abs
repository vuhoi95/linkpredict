Title: Heterotic Flux Vacua from Hybrid Linear Models
Authors: Allan Adams and David Guarrera
Abstract: We construct hybrid linear models in which the chiral anomaly of a gauged linear sigma model is canceled by the classical anomaly of a gauged WZW model. Semi-classically, this corresponds to fibering the WZW model over the naive target space of the sigma model. When the gauge group is abelian, we recover known non-Kahler compactifications; non-abelian models describe novel quasi-geometric flux vacua of the heterotic string.
