Title: The Double Life of Thermal QCD
Authors: Mohammed Mia and Keshav Dasgupta and Charles Gale and Sangyong Jeon
Abstract: We study the gravity dual of a thermal gauge theory whose behavior parallels that of thermal QCD in the far IR. The UV of our theory has infinite degrees of freedom. We holographically renormalize the supergravity action to compute the stress tensor of the dual gauge theory with fundamental flavors incorporating the logarithmic running of the gauge coupling. From the stress tensor we obtain the shear viscosity and the entropy of the medium at a temperature T, and investigate the violation of the bound for the viscosity to the entropy ratio. This is a shortened and simplified companion paper to arXiv:0902.1540, and is based on the talks given by M. Mia at the "Strong and Electroweak Matter 2008" workshop and the McGill workshop on "AdS/CFT, Condensed Matter and QCD" in the fall of 2008.
