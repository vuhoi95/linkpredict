Title: Enhanced Symmetries of Orbifolds from Moduli Stabilization
Authors: Wilfried Buchmuller and Riccardo Catena and Kai Schmidt-Hoberg
Abstract: We study a supersymmetric field theory in six dimensions compactified on the orbifold T^2/Z_2 with two Wilson lines. After supersymmetry breaking, the Casimir energy fixes the shape moduli at fixed points in field space where the symmetry of the torus lattice is enhanced. Localized Fayet-Iliopoulos terms stabilize the volume modulus at a size much smaller than the inverse supersymmetry breaking scale. All moduli masses are smaller than the gravitino mass.
