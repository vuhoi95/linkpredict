Title: On Integrable Backgrounds Self-dual under Fermionic T-duality
Authors: Ido Adam and Amit Dekel and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We study the fermionic T-duality symmetry of integrable Green-Schwarz sigma-models on AdS backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond fluxes in various dimensions. We show that sigma-models based on supercosets of PSU supergroups, such as AdS_2 \times S^2 and AdS_3 \times S^3 are self-dual under fermionic T-duality, while supercosets of OSp supergroups such as non-critical AdS_2 and AdS_4 models, and the critical AdS_4 \times CP^3 background are not. We present a general algebraic argument to when a supercoset is expected to have a fermionic T-duality symmetry, and when it will fail to have one.
