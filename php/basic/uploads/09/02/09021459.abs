Title: One loop renormalizability of the Poisson-Lie sigma models
Authors: G. Valent and C. Klimcik and R. Squellari
Abstract: We present the proof of the one loop renormalizability in the strict field theoretic sense of the Poisson-Lie sigma models. The result is valid for any Drinfeld double and it relies solely on the Poisson-Lie structure encoded in the target manifold.
