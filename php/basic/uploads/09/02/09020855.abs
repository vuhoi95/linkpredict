Title: Particle Propagation on a Circle with a Point Interaction
Authors: Satoshi Ohya and Makoto Sakamoto
Abstract: We study a particle propagation on a circle in the presence of a point interaction. We show that the one-particle Feynman kernel can be written into the sum of reflected and transmitted trajectories which are weighted by the elements of the n-th power of the scattering matrix evaluated on a line with a point interaction. As a by-product we find three-parameter family of trace formulae as a generalization of the Poisson summation formula.
