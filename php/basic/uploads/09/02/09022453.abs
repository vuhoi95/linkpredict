Title: Dirac Quantization Condition for Monopole in Noncommutative Space-Time
Authors: Masud Chaichian and Subir Ghosh and Miklos Langvik and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: Since the structure of space-time at very short distances is believed to get modified possibly due to noncommutativity effects and as the Dirac Quantization Condition (DQC), $\mu e = \frac{N}{2}\hbar c$, probes the magnetic field point singularity, a natural question arises whether the same condition will still survive. We show that the DQC on a noncommutative space in a model of dynamical noncommutative quantum mechanics remains the same as in the commutative case to first order in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$, leading to the conjecture that the condition will not alter in higher orders.
