Title: Asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity in higher dimensions
Authors: Kentaro Tanabe and Norihiro Tanahashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: A definition of asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity in $d$ dimensions ($d\geq 4$) is given using the conformal completion approach. Then we discuss asymptotic symmetry and conserved quantities. As in four dimensions, in $d$ dimensions we should impose a condition at spatial infinity that the "magnetic" part of the $d$-dimensional Weyl tensor vanishes at faster rate than the "electric" part does, in order to realize the Poincare symmetry as asymptotic symmetry and construct the conserved angular momentum. However, we found that an additional condition should be imposed in $d>4$ dimensions.
