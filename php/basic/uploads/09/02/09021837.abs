Title: Three-Dimensional Solutions of Supersymmetrical Intertwining Relations  and Pairs of Isospectral Hamiltonians
Authors: F. Cannata and M. V. Ioffe and D. N. Nishnianidze
Abstract: The general solution of SUSY intertwining relations for three-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators is built using the class of second order supercharges with nondegenerate constant metric. This solution includes several models with arbitrary parameters. We are interested only in quantum systems which are not amenable to separation of variables, i.e. can not be reduced to lower dimensional problems. All constructed Hamiltonians are partially integrable - each of them commutes with a symmetry operator of fourth order in momenta. The same models can be considered also for complex values of parameters leading to a class of non-Hermitian isospectral Hamiltonians.
