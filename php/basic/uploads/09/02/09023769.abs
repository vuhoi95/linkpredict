Title: Deformation quantization for coupled harmonic oscillators on a general  noncommutative space
Authors: Bing-Sheng Lin and Si-Cong Jing and Tai-Hua Heng
Abstract: Deformation quantization is a powerful tool to quantize some classical systems especially in noncommutative space. In this work we first show that for a class of special Hamiltonian one can easily find relevant time evolution functions and Wigner functions, which are intrinsic important quantities in the deformation quantization theory. Then based on this observation we investigate a two coupled harmonic oscillators system on the general noncommutative phase space by requiring both spatial and momentum coordinates do not commute each other. We derive all the Wigner functions and the corresponding energy spectra for this system, and consider several interesting special cases, which lead to some significant results.
