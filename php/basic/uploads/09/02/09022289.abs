Title: On Lorentz Invariance, Spin-Charge Separation And SU(2) Yang-Mills  Theory
Authors: Antti J. Niemi and Sergey Slizovskiy
Abstract: Previously it has been shown that in spin-charge separated SU(2) Yang-Mills theory Lorentz invariance can become broken by a one-cocycle that appears in the Lorentz boosts. Here we study in detail the structure of this one-cocycle. In particular we show that its non-triviality relates to the presence of a (Dirac) magnetic monopole bundle. We also explicitely present the finite version of the cocycle.
