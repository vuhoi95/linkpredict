Title: A formal framework for a nonlocal generalization of Einstein's theory of  gravitation
Authors: Friedrich W. Hehl and Bahram Mashhoon
Abstract: The analogy between electrodynamics and the translational gauge theory of gravity is employed in this paper to develop an ansatz for a nonlocal generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. Working in the linear approximation, we show that the resulting nonlocal theory is equivalent to general relativity with "dark matter". The nature of the predicted "dark matter", which is the manifestation of the nonlocal character of gravity in our model, is briefly discussed. It is demonstrated that this approach can provide a basis for the Tohline-Kuhn treatment of the astrophysical evidence for dark matter.
