Title: Large Charge Four-Dimensional Extremal N=2 Black Holes with R^2-Terms
Authors: Eyal Gruss and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider N=2 supergravity in four dimensions with small R^2 curvature corrections. We construct large charge extremal supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric black hole solutions in all space, and analyze their thermodynamic properties.
