Title: Geometry of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar Model
Authors: M. Buric and M. Wohlgenannt
Abstract: We define a two-dimensional noncommutative space as a limit of finite-matrix spaces which have space-time dimension three. We show that on such space the Grosse-Wulkenhaar (renormalizable) action has natural interpretation as the action for the scalar field coupled to the curvature. We also discuss a natural generalization to four dimensions.
