Title: Heterotic String in a Constant Magnetic Field
Authors: Akira Kokado and Gaku Konisi and Takesi Saito
Abstract: When a charged heterotic string is placed in a constant magnetic field B, we show that this system can be solved exactly by using the cyclotron frequency. We then calculate anomalies of the super Virasoro algebra, and give the corresponding spectrum-generating algebra for this system. They differ from the free case by the cyclotron frequency. It is remarkable that our system is equivalent to the completely free system when B takes integral values.
