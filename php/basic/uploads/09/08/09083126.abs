Title: A new class of integrable defects
Authors: E. Corrigan and C. Zambon
Abstract: An alternative Lagrangian definition of an integrable defect is provided and analyzed. The new approach is sufficiently broad to allow a description of defects within the Tzitzeica model, which was not possible in previous approaches, and may be generalizable. New, two-parameter, sine-Gordon defects are also described, which have characteristics resembling a pair of 'fused' defects of a previously considered type. The relationship between these defects and Backlund transformations is described and a Hamiltonian description of integrable defects is proposed.
