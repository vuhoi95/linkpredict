Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of a phase-transition-induced collapse neutron star to a hybrid star, which consists of a mixture of hadronic matter and strange quark matter. The collapse is triggered by a sudden change of equation of state, which result in a large amplitude stellar oscillation. The evolution of the system is simulated by using a 3D Newtonian hydrodynamic code with a high resolution shock capture scheme. We find that both the temperature and the density at the neutrinosphere are oscillating with acoustic frequency. However, they are nearly 180$^{\circ}$ out of phase. Consequently, extremely intense, pulsating neutrino/antineutrino fluxes will be emitted periodically. Since the energy and density of neutrinos at the peaks of the pulsating fluxes are much higher than the non-oscillating case, the electron/positron pair creation rate can be enhanced dramatically. Some mass layers on the stellar surface can be ejected by absorbing energy of neutrinos and pairs. These mass ejecta can be further accelerated to relativistic speeds by absorbing electron/positron pairs, created by the neutrino and antineutrino annihilation outside the stellar surface. The possible connection between this process and the cosmological Gamma-ray Bursts is discussed.
