Title: Magnetic Brane Solutions in AdS
Authors: Eric D'Hoker and Per Kraus
Abstract: We construct asymptotically AdS_5 solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory dual to N=4 SYM theory on R^{3,1} in the presence of a background magnetic field. The solutions interpolate between AdS_5 and a near horizon AdS_3\times T^2. The central charge of the near horizon region, and hence low temperature entropy of the solution, is found to be \sqrt{4\over 3} times that of free N=4 SYM theory. The entropy vanishes at zero temperature. We also present the generalization of these solutions to arbitrary spacetime dimensionality.
