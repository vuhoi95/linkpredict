Abstract: We provide a supersymmetric generalization of n quantum bits by extending the local operations and classical communication entanglement equivalence group [SU(2)]^n to the supergroup [uOSp(1|2)]^n and the stochastic local operations and classical communication equivalence group [SL(2,C)]^n to the supergroup [OSp(1|2)]^n. We introduce the appropriate supersymmetric generalizations of the conventional entanglement measures for the cases of $n=2$ and $n=3$. In particular, super-Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are characterized by a nonvanishing superhyperdeterminant.
