Title: On Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism of Non-Commutative Field Theories
Authors: Klaus Bering and Harald Grosse
Abstract: We apply the BV formalism to non-commutative field theories, introduce BRST symmetry, and gauge-fix the models. Interestingly, we find that treating the full gauge symmetry in non-commutative models can lead to reducible gauge algebras. As one example we apply the formalism to the Connes-Lott two-point model. Finally, we offer a derivation of a superversion of the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral.
