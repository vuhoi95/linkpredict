Title: Higher order dilaton gravity: brane equations of motion in the covariant  formulation
Authors: Dominika Konikowska and Marek Olechowski
Abstract: Dilaton gravity with general brane localized interactions is investigated. Models with corrections up to arbitrary order in field derivatives are considered. Effective gravitational equations of motion at the brane are derived in the covariant approach. Dependence of such brane equations on the bulk quantities is discussed. It is shown that the number of the bulk independent brane equations of motion depends strongly on the symmetries assumed for the model and for the background. Examples with two and four derivatives of the fields are presented in more detail.
