Title: On AGT relation in the case of U(3)
Authors: A. Mironov and A. Morozov
Abstract: We consider the AGT relation, expressing conformal blocks for the Virasoro and W-algebras in terms of Nekrasov's special functions, in the simplest case of the 4-point functions for the first non-trivial W_3 algebra. The standard set of Nekrasov functions is sufficient only if additional null-vector restriction is imposed on a half of the external $W$-primaries and this is just the case when the conformal blocks are fully dictated by W-symmetry and do not depend on a particular model. Explicit checks confirm that the AGT relation survives in this restricted case, as expected.
