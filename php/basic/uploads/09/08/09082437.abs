Title: Symmetries of the N=4 SYM S-matrix
Authors: Amit Sever and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: Under the assumption of a CSW generalization to loop amplitudes in N=4 SYM, (1) We prove that, formally the S-matrix is superconformal invariant to any loop order, and (2) We argue that superconformal symmetry survives regularization. More precisely, IR safe quantities constructed from the S-matrix are superconformal covariant. The IR divergences are regularized in a new holomorphic anomaly friendly regularization. The CSW prescription is known to be valid for all tree level amplitudes and for one loop MHV amplitudes. In these cases, our formal results do not rely on any assumptions.
