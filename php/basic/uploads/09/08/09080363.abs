Title: Some No-go Theorems for String Duals of Non-relativistic Lifshitz-like  Theories
Authors: Wei Li and Tatsuma Nishioka and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: We study possibilities of string theory embeddings of the gravity duals for non-relativistic Lifshitz-like theories with anisotropic scale invariance. We search classical solutions in type IIA and eleven-dimensional supergravities which are expected to be dual to (2+1)-dimensional Lifshitz-like theories. Under reasonable ansaetze, we prove that such gravity duals in the supergravities are not possible. We also discuss a possible physical reason behind this.
