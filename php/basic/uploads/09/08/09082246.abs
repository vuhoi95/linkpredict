Title: A note on strings in deformed AdS_4 x CP3: giant magnon and single spike  solutions
Authors: M. Schimpf and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: In this paper we study the solitonic string solutions of magnon and single spike type in the beta-deformed AdS_4 x CP3 background. We find the dispersion relations which are supposed to give the anomalous dimension of the gauge theory operators.
