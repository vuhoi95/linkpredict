Authors: Andrei Mironov and Sergei Mironov and Alexei Morozov and Andrey Morozov
Abstract: An explicit check of the AGT relation between the W_N-symmetry controlled conformal blocks and U(N) Nekrasov functions requires knowledge of the Shapovalov matrix and various triple correlators for W-algebra descendants. We collect simplest expressions of this type for N=3 and for the two lowest descendant levels, together with the detailed derivations, which can be now computerized and used in more general studies of conformal blocks and AGT relations at higher levels.
