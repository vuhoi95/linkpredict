Title: Semiclassical Methods for Hawking Radiation from a Vaidya Black Hole
Authors: Haryanto M. Siahaan and Triyanta
Abstract: We derive the general form of Hawking temperature for Vaidya black hole in the tunneling pictures. This kind of black hole is regarded as the description of a more realistic one since it's time dependent decreasing mass due to the evaporation process. Clearly, the temperature would be time dependent as our findings. We use the semiclassical methods, namely radial null geodesic and complex paths methods. Both methods are found to give the same results. Then, we discuss the possible form of corresponding entropy.
