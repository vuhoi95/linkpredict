Title: The Groenewold - Moyal Plane and its Quantum Physics
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and Pramod Padmanabhan
Abstract: Quantum theories constructed on the noncommutative spacetime called the Groenewold-Moyal(GM) plane exhibit many interesting properties such as causality violation, Lorentz and CPT non-invariance and twisted statistics. Such violations lead to many striking features that may be tested experimentally. Thus these theories predict Pauli-forbidden transitions due to twisted statistics, anisotropies and acausal effects in the cosmic microwave background radiation in correlations of observables and Lorentz and CPT violations in scattering amplitudes. Such features of quantum physics on the GM plane are surveyed in this review.
