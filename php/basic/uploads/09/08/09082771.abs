Title: A higher-dimensional generalization of the geodesic part of the  Goldberg-Sachs theorem
Authors: Mark Durkee and Harvey S. Reall
Abstract: In more than four spacetime dimensions, a multiple Weyl-aligned null direction (WAND) need not be geodesic. It is proved that any higher-dimensional Einstein spacetime admitting a non-geodesic multiple WAND also admits a geodesic multiple WAND. All five-dimensional Einstein spacetimes admitting a non-geodesic multiple WAND are determined.
