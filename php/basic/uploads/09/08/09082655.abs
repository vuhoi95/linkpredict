Title: Discontinuous quantum evolutions in the presence of closed timelike  curves
Authors: Richard DeJonghe and Kimberly Frey and Tom Imbo
Abstract: We consider Deutsch's computational model of a quantum system evolving in a spacetime containing closed timelike curves. Although it is known that this model predicts non-linear and non-unitary evolutions of the system, we demonstrate that it also gives rise to evolutions which are a discontinuous function of the input state. These discontinuities persist for the most natural modifications of Deutsch's approach.
