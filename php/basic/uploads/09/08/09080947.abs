Title: S3 Quantum Hall Wavefunctions
Authors: Steven H. Simon and E. H. Rezayi and N. Regnault
Abstract: We construct a family of quantum Hall Hamiltonians whose ground states, at least for small system sizes, give correlators of the S3 conformal field theories. The ground states are considered as trial wavefunctions for quantum Hall effect of bosons at filling fraction nu=3/4 interacting either via delta function interaction or delta function plus dipole interaction. While the S3 theories can be either unitary or nonunitary, we find high overlaps with exact diagonalizations only for the nonunitary case, suggesting that these wavefunctions may correspond to critical points, possibly analogous to the previously studied Gaffnian wavefunction. These wavefunctions give an explicit example which cannot be fully characterized by their thin-torus limit or by their pattern of zeros.
