Title: Greybody Factors and Charges in Kerr/CFT
Authors: Mirjam Cvetic and Finn Larsen
Abstract: We compute greybody factors for near extreme Kerr black holes in D=4 and D=5. In D=4 we include four charges so that our solutions can be continuously deformed to the BPS limit. In D=5 we include two independent angular momenta so Left-Right symmetry is incorporated. We discuss the CFT interpretation of our emission amplitudes, including the overall frequency dependence and the dependence on all black hole parameters. We find that all additional parameters can be incorporated Kerr/CFT, with central charge independent of U(1) charges.
