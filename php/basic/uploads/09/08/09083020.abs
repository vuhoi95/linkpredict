Title: Double-helix Wilson loops: case of two angular momenta
Authors: Andrew Irrgang and Martin Kruczenski
Abstract: Recently, Wilson loops with the shape of a double helix have played an important role in studying large spin operators in gauge theories. They correspond to a quark and an anti-quark moving in circles on an S3 (and therefore each of them describes a helix in RxS3). In this paper we consider the case where the particles have two angular momenta on the S3. The string solution corresponding to such Wilson loop can be found using the relation to the Neumann-Rosochatius system allowing the computation of the energy and angular momenta of the configuration. The particular case of only one angular momentum is also considered. It can be thought as an analytic continuation of the rotating strings which are dual to operators in the SL(2) sector of N=4 SYM.
