Title: Conformal quantum field theory in various dimensions
Authors: Marcel Bischoff and Daniel Meise and Karl-Henning Rehren and Ingo Wagner
Abstract: Various relations between conformal quantum field theories in one, two and four dimensions are explored. The intention is to obtain a better understanding of 4D CFT with the help of methods from lower dimensional CFT.
