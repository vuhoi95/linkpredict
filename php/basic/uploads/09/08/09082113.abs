Title: Lattice Theta Constants vs Riemann Theta Constants and NSR Superstring  Measures
Authors: P. Dunin-Barkowski and A. Morozov and A. Sleptsov
Abstract: We discuss relations between two different representations of hypothetical holomorphic NSR measures, based on two different ways of constructing the semi-modular forms of weight 8. One of these ways is to build forms from the ordinary Riemann theta constants and another -- from the lattice theta constants. We discuss unexpectedly elegant relations between lattice theta constants, corresponding to 16-dimensional self-dual lattices, and Riemann theta constants and present explicit formulae expressing the former ones through the latter. Starting from genus 5 the modular-form approach to construction of NSR measures runs into serious problems and there is a risk that it fails completely already at genus 6.
