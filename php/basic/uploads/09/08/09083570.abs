Title: Quantum Gravitational Collapse in the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Model with a  Positive Cosmological Constant
Authors: Anne Franzen and Sashideep Gutti and Claus Kiefer
Abstract: Previous papers dealt with the quantization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model for vanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Here we extend the analysis to the case $\Lambda >0$. Our main goal is to present solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, to give their interpretation, and to derive Hawking radiation from them. We restrict ourselves to a discussion of those points that are different from the $\Lambda=0$-case. These have mainly to do with the occurrence of two horizons.
