Title: Large N reduction for Chern-Simons theory on S^3
Authors: Goro Ishiki and Shinji Shimasaki and Asato Tsuchiya
Abstract: We study a matrix model which is obtained by dimensional reduction of Chern-Simon theory on S^3 to zero dimension. We find that expanded around a particular background consisting of multiple fuzzy spheres, it reproduces the original theory on S^3 in the planar limit. This is viewed as a new type of the large N reduction generalized to curved space.
