Title: Tribrid Inflation in Supergravity
Authors: Stefan Antusch and Koushik Dutta and Philipp M. Kostka
Abstract: We propose a novel class of F-term hybrid inflation models in supergravity (SUGRA) where the $\eta$-problem is resolved using either a Heisenberg symmetry or a shift symmetry of the Kaehler potential. In addition to the inflaton and the waterfall field, this class (referred to as tribrid inflation) contains a third 'driving' field which contributes the large vacuum energy during inflation by its F-term. In contrast to the ''standard'' hybrid scenario, it has several attractive features due to the property of vanishing inflationary superpotential (W_inf=0) during inflation. While the symmetries of the Kaehler potential ensure a flat inflaton potential at tree-level, quantum corrections induced by symmetry breaking terms in the superpotential generate a slope of the potential and lead to a spectral tilt consistent with recent WMAP observations.
