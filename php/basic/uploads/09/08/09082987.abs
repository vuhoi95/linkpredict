Title: A Solution to Non-Linear Equations of Motion of Nambu-Goto String
Authors: C. G. Bollini and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In this paper we solve the non-linear Lagrange's equations for the Nambu-Goto closed bosonic string. We show that Ultradistributions of Exponential Type (UET) are appropriate for the description in a consistent way string and string field theories. We also prove that the string field is a linear superposition of UET of compact support (CUET), and give the notion of anti-string. We evaluate the propagator for the string field, and calculate the convolution of two of them.
