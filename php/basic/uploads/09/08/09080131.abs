Title: Non-Abelian Black Holes in D=5 Maximal Gauged Supergravity
Authors: M. Cvetic and H. Lu and C. N. Pope
Abstract: We investigate static non-abelian black hole solutions of anti-de Sitter Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton gravity, which is obtained as a consistent truncation of five-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity. If the dilaton is (consistently) set to zero, the remaining equations of motion, with a spherically-symmetric ansatz, may be derived from a superpotential. The associated first-order equations admit an explicit solution supported by a non-abelian SU(2) gauge potential, which has a logarithmically growing mass term. In an extremal limit the horizon geometry becomes AdS$_2\times S^3$. If the dilaton is also excited, the equations of motion cannot easily be solved explicitly, but we obtain the asymptotic form of the more general non-abelian black holes in this case. An alternative consistent truncation, in which the Yang-Mills fields are set to zero, also admits a description in terms of a superpotential. This allows us to construct explicit wormhole solutions (neutral spherically-symmetric domain walls). These solutions may be generalised to dimensions other than five.
