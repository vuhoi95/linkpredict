Title: Notes on Properties of Holographic Matter
Authors: Andreas Karch and Manuela Kulaxizi and Andrei Parnachev
Abstract: Probe branes with finite worldvolume electric flux in the background created by a stack of Dp branes describe holographically strongly interacting fundamental matter at finite density. We identify two quantities whose leading low temperature behavior is independent of the dimensionality of the probe branes: specific heat and DC conductivity. This behavior can be inferred from the dynamics of the fundamental strings which provide a good description of the probe branes in the regime of low temperatures and finite densities. We also comment on the speed of sound on the branes and the temperature dependence of DC conductivity at vanishing charge density.
