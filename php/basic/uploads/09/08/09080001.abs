Title: Scalar perturbations in p-nflation: the 3-form case
Authors: Cristiano Germani and Alex Kehagias
Abstract: We calculate the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations of the 3-form inflation and we find that the curvature perturbations decay at late times. As as result, although a non-minimally coupled massive 3-form field may drive inflation at early times, it should be assisted by other fields in order to reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations of the CMB sky.
