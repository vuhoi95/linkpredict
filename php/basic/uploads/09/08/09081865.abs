Title: Formation and evolution of kinky vortons
Authors: Richard A. Battye and Jonathan A. Pearson and Simon Pike and Paul M. Sutcliffe
Abstract: We present field theory simulations of a model with Z_2xU(1) symmetry in (2+1)-dimensions. This model has two discrete vacua, allowing for domain walls, and also a conserved Noether charge. For initial conditions in which the field is placed in one of the vacua and given a homogeneous background charge, we find that the number of walls does not scale in the standard way. We argue that the Noether charge and current become localized on the walls, forming kinky vortons, (2+1) dimensional analogues of cosmic vortons. These loops of wall can be long-lived, or even stable, depending on the precise characteristics. We suggest that our simulations illustrate a possible mechanism for dynamical frustration of domain wall networks and that cosmic vortons will form naturally in U(1)xU(1) models.
