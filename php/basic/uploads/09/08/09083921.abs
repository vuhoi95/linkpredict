Title: Rotating mesons in the presence of higher derivative corrections from  gauge-string duality
Authors: M. Ali-Akbari and K. Bitaghsir Fadafan
Abstract: We consider a rotating quark-antiquark $(q\bar{q})$ pair in $\mathcal{N}=4$ thermal plasma. By using AdS/CFT correspondence, the properties of this system have been investigated. We study variation of rotating string radius at the boundary as a function of the tip of U-shape string and angular velocity of rotating meson. We also extend the results to the higher derivative corrections i.e. ${\cal{R}}^2$ and ${\cal{R}}^4$ which correspond to finite coupling corrections on the rotating quark-antiquark system in the hot plasma. In ${\cal{R}}^4$ case and for fixed angular velocity as $\lambda^{-1}$ decreases the string endpoints get more and more separated. To study ${\cal{R}}^2$ corrections, rotating quark-antiquark system in Gauss-Bonnet background has been considered. We summarize the effects of these corrections in the conclusion section.
