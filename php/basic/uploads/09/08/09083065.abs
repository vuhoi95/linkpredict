Title: Strings on the deformed T^{1,1}: giant magnon and single spike solutions
Authors: H. Dimov and M. Michalcik and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: In this paper we find giant magnon and single spike string solutions in a sector of the gamma-deformed conifold. We examine the dispersion relations and find a behavior analogous to the undeformed case. The transcendental functional relations between the conserved charges are shifted by certain gamma-dependent term. The latter is proportional to the total momentum and thus qualitatively different from known cases.
