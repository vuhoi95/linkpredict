Title: Comment on "Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics with Minimal Length  Uncertainty"
Authors: Bijan Bagchi and Andreas Fring
Abstract: We demonstrate that the recent paper by Jana and Roy entitled ''Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with minimal length uncertainty'' [SIGMA 5 (2009), 083, 7 pages, arXiv:0908.1755] contains various misconceptions. We compare with an analysis on the same topic carried out previously in our manuscript [arXiv:0907.5354]. In particular, we show that the metric operators computed for the deformed non-Hermitian Swanson models differs in both cases and is inconsistent in the former.
