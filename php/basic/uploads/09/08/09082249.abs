Title: Geometric Aspects of D-branes and T-duality
Authors: Katrin Becker and Aaron Bergman
Abstract: We explore the differential geometry of T-duality and D-branes. Because D-branes and RR-fields are properly described via K-theory, we discuss the (differential) K-theoretic generalization of T-duality and its application to the coupling of D-branes to RR-fields. This leads to a puzzle involving the transformation of the A-roof genera in the coupling.
