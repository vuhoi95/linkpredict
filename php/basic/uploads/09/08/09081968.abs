Title: Warped 5-Dimensional Models: Phenomenological Status and Experimental  Prospects
Authors: Hooman Davoudiasl and Shrihari Gopalakrishna and Eduardo Ponton and Jose Santiago
Abstract: Warped 5-dimensional models, based on the original Randall-Sundrum geometry, have been extended beyond their initial purpose of resolving the gauge hierarchy problem. Over the past decade, various ingredients have been added to their basic structure in order to provide natural and predictive models of flavor and also to address existing constraints from precision data. In this review, we examine the theoretical and experimental status of realistic models that accommodate current data, while addressing the hierarchy and flavor puzzles of the Standard Model. We also discuss the prospects for future discovery of the TeV-scale Kaluza-Klein states that are predicted to emerge in these models, and outline some of the challenges that the detection of such particles pose for experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.
