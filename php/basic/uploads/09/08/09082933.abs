Title: Computing the Casimir energy using the point-matching method
Authors: F. C. Lombardo and F. D. Mazzitelli and M. VÃ¡quez and P. I. Villar
Abstract: We use a point-matching approach to numerically compute the Casimir interaction energy for a two perfect-conductor waveguide of arbitrary section. We present the method and describe the procedure used to obtain the numerical results. At first, our technique is tested for geometries with known solutions, such as concentric and eccentric cylinders. Then, we apply the point-matching technique to compute the Casimir interaction energy for new geometries such as concentric corrugated cylinders and cylinders inside conductors with focal lines.
