Title: Five-loop anomalous dimension at critical wrapping order in N=4 SYM
Authors: Francesco Fiamberti and Alberto Santambrogio and Christoph Sieg
Abstract: We compute the anomalous dimension of a length-five operator at five-loop order in the SU(2) sector of N=4 SYM theory in the planar limit. This is critical wrapping order at five loops. The result is obtained perturbatively by means of N=1 superspace techniques. Our result from perturbation theory confirms explicitly the formula conjectured in arXiv:0901.4864 for the five-loop anomalous dimension of twist-three operators. We also explicitly obtain the same result by employing the recently proposed Y-system.
