Abstract: We study 10D super Yang-Mills theory with the gauge groups $E_6$, $E_7$ and $E_8$. We consider the torus/orbifold compacfitication with magnetic fluxes and Wilson lines. They lead to 4D interesting models with three families of quarks and leptons, whose profiles in extra dimensions are quasi-localized because of magnetic fluxes.
