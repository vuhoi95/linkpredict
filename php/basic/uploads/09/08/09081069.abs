Title: 5d/4d U-dualities and N=8 black holes
Authors: Anna Ceresole and Sergio Ferrara and Alessandra Gnecchi
Abstract: We use the connection between the U-duality groups in d=5 and d=4 to derive properties of the N=8 black hole potential and its critical points (attractors). This approach allows to study and compare the supersymmetry features of different solutions.
