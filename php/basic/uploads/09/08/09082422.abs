Title: Gravitational Corrections to Yukawa and Phi^4 Interactions
Authors: Andreas Rodigast and Theodor Schuster
Abstract: We consider the lowest order quantum gravitational corrections to Yukawa and Phi^4 interactions. Our results show that quantum gravity leads to contributions to the running coupling constants if the particles are massive and therefore alters the scaling behavior of the Standard Model. Furthermore, we find that the gravitational contributions to the running of the masses vanish.
