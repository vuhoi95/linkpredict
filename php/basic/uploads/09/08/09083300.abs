Title: The N=1 Supersymmetric Landau Problem and its Supersymmetric Landau  Level Projections: the N=1 Supersymmetric Moyal-Voros Superplane
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Jan Govaerts and Frederik G. Scholtz
Abstract: The N=1 supersymmetric invariant Landau problem is constructed and solved. By considering Landau level projections remaining non trivial under N=1 supersymmetry transformations, the algebraic structures of the N=1 supersymmetric covariant non(anti)commutative superplane analogue of the ordinary N=0 noncommutative Moyal-Voros plane are identified.
