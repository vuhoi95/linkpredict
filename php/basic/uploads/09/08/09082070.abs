Title: On The Problem of Vacuum energy in Brane Theories
Authors: Ilya Gurwich and Shimon Rubin and Aharon Davidson
Abstract: We point out that modern brane theories suffer from a severe vacuum energy problem. To be specific, the Casimir energy associated with the matter fields confined to the brane, is stemming from the one and the same localization mechanism which forms the brane itself, and is thus generically unavoidable. Possible practical solutions are discussed, including in particular spontaneously broken supersymmetry, and quantum mechanically induced brane tension.
