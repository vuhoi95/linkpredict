Title: "Dynamical" interactions and gauge invariance
Authors: R. Saar and S. Groote and H. Liivat and I. Ots
Abstract: Appreciating the classical understanding of the elementary particle the "dynamical" Poincare algebra is developed. It is shown that the "dynamical" Poincare algebra and the equations of motion of particles with arbitrary spin are gauge invariant and that gauge invariance and relativistic invariance stand on equal footings. A "dynamical" non-minimal interaction is constructed explicitly and the Rarita-Schwinger equation is considered in the framework of this "dynamical" interaction.
