Title: Cosmological Magnetic Fields from Inflation and Backreaction
Authors: Sugumi Kanno and Jiro Soda and Masa-aki Watanabe
Abstract: We study the backreaction problem in a mechanism of magnetogenesis from inflation. In usual analysis, it has been assumed that the backreaction due to electromagnetic fields spoils inflation once it becomes important. However, there exists no justification for this assumption. Hence, we analyze magnetogenesis from inflation by taking into account the backreaction. On the contrary to the naive expectation, we show that inflation still continues even after the backreaction begins to work. Nevertheless, it turns out that creation of primordial magnetic fields is significantly suppressed due to the backreaction.
