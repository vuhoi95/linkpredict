Title: Potential Scattering in Dirac Field Theory
Authors: S. De Leo and P. Rotelli
Abstract: We develop the potential scattering of a spinor within the context of perturbation field theory. As an application, we reproduce, up to second order in the potential, the diffusion results for a potential barrier of quantum mechanics. An immediate consequence is a simple generalization to arbitrary potential forms, a feature not possible in quantum mechanics.
