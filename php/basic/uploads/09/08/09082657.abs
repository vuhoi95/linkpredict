Title: Black hole determinants and quasinormal modes
Authors: Frederik Denef and Sean A. Hartnoll and Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We derive an expression for functional determinants in thermal spacetimes as a product over the corresponding quasinormal modes. As simple applications we give efficient computations of scalar determinants in thermal AdS, BTZ black hole and de Sitter spacetimes. We emphasize the conceptual utility of our formula for discussing `1/N' corrections to strongly coupled field theories via the holographic correspondence.
