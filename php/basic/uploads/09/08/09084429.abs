Title: On the Perturbative Expansion around a Lifshitz Point
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: The quantum Lifshitz model provides an effective description of a quantum critical point. It has been shown that even though non--Lorentz invariant, the action admits a natural supersymmetrization. In this note we introduce a perturbative framework and show how the supersymmetric structure can be used to greatly simplify the Feynman rules and thus the study of the model.
