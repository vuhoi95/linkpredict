Title: Virial mass in DGP brane cosmology
Authors: H. R. Sepangi and S. Shahidi
Abstract: We study the virial mass discrepancy in the context of a DPG brane-world scenario and show that such a framework can offer viable explanations to account for the mass discrepancy problem. This is done by defining a geometrical mass $\mathcal{N}$ that we prove to be proportional to the virial mass. Estimating $\mathcal{N}$ using observational data, we show that it behaves linearly with $r$ and has a value of the order of $M_{200}$, pointing to a possible resolution of the virial mass discrepancy. We also obtain the radial velocity dispersion of galaxy clusters and show that it is compatible with the radial velocity dispersion profile of such clusters. This velocity dispersion profile can be used to differentiate various models predicting the virial mass.
