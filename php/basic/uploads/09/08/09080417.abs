Title: Spectral Flow of the Non-Supersymmetric Microstates of the D1-D5-KK  System
Authors: Jassem H. Al-Alawi and Simon F. Ross
Abstract: We show that a realisation of spectral flow as a coordinate transformation for asymptotically four-dimensional solutions can be extended to the non-supersymmetric case. We apply this transformation to smooth geometries describing microstates of the D1-D5-KK monopole system in type IIB supergravity compactified on a six-torus, and obtain solutions with an additional momentum charge. We study the supersymmetric and near-core limits of this construction.
