Title: Stability of branes trapped by d-dimensional black holes
Authors: Kenta Hioki and Umpei Miyamoto and Masato Nozawa
Abstract: The system of extended objects interplaying with a black hole describes or mimics various gravitational phenomena. In this brief paper, we report the results of stability analysis of codimension-one Dirac-Nambu-Goto branes rest at the equatorial plane of $d$-dimensional spherical black holes, including the Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter black holes. For the Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter backgrounds the stability of branes is shown analytically by means of a deformation technique. In contrast, for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background we demonstrate with the help of numerics that the brane is unstable (only) against the s-wave sector of perturbations.
