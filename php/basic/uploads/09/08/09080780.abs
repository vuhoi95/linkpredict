Title: Redesigning Electroweak Theory: Does the Higgs Particle Exist?
Authors: J. W. Moffat and V. T. Toth
Abstract: An electroweak model in which the masses of the W and Z bosons and the fermions are generated by quantum loop graphs through a symmetry breaking is investigated. The model is based on a regularized quantum field theory in which the quantum loop graphs are finite to all orders of perturbation theory and the massless theory is gauge invariant, Poincare invariant, and unitary. The breaking of the electroweak symmetry SU(2) X U(1) is achieved without a Higgs particle. A fundamental energy scale of ~542 GeV (not to be confused with a naive cutoff) enters the theory through the regularization of the Feynman loop diagrams. The theory yields a prediction for the W mass that is accurate to about 0.5% without radiative corrections. The scattering amplitudes for WW -> WW and e+e- -> WW processes do not violate unitarity at high energies due to the suppression of the amplitudes by the running of the coupling constants at vertices.
