Title: Quasi-normal modes of warped black holes and warped AdS/CFT  correspondence
Authors: Bin Chen and Zhi-bo Xu
Abstract: We analytically calculate the quasi-normal modes of various perturbations of spacelike stretched and null warped $AdS_3$ black holes. From AdS/CFT correspondence, these quasi-normal modes are expected to appear as the poles in momentum space of retarded Green functions of dual operators in CFT at finite temperature. We find that this is indeed the case, after taking into account of the subtle identification of quantum numbers. The subtlety comes from the fact that only after appropriate coordinate transformation the asymptotic geometries of warped black holes are the same as the ones of warped $AdS_3$ spacetimes. We show that in general the quasi-normal modes are in good agreement with the prediction of the warped AdS/CFT correspondence, up to a constant factor. As a byproduct, we compute the conformal dimensions of boundary operators dual to the perturbations. Our result gives strong support to the conjectured warped AdS/CFT correspondence.
