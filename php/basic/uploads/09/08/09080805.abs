Title: The Klauder-Daubechies Construction of the Phase Space Path Integral and  the Harmonic Oscillator
Authors: Jan Govaerts and Calvin Matondo Bwayi and Olivier Mattelaer
Abstract: The canonical operator quantisation formulation corresponding to the Klauder-Daubechies construction of the phase space path integral is considered. This formulation is explicitly applied and solved in the case of the harmonic oscillator, thereby illustrating in a manner complementary to Klauder and Daubechies' original work some of the promising features offered by their construction of a quantum dynamics. The Klauder-Daubechies functional integral involves a regularisation parameter eventually taken to vanish, which defines a new physical time scale. When extrapolated to the field theory context, besides providing a new regularisation of short distance divergences, keeping a finite value for that time scale offers some tantalising prospects when it comes to strong gravitational quantum systems.
