Title: sQGP as hCFT
Authors: Alex Buchel and Michal P. Heller and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We examine the proposal to make quantitative comparisons between the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and holographic descriptions of conformal field theory. In this note, we calculate corrections to certain transport coefficients appearing in second-order hydrodynamics from higher curvature terms to the dual gravity theory. We also clarify how these results might be consistently applied in comparisons with the sQGP.
