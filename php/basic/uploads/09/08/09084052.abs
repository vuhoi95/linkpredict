Title: Quantization of Integrable Systems and Four Dimensional Gauge Theories
Authors: Nikita A. Nekrasov and Samson L. Shatashvili
Abstract: We study four dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory in the Omega-background with the two dimensional N=2 super-Poincare invariance. We explain how this gauge theory provides the quantization of the classical integrable system underlying the moduli space of vacua of the ordinary four dimensional N=2 theory. The epsilon-parameter of the Omega-background is identified with the Planck constant, the twisted chiral ring maps to quantum Hamiltonians, the supersymmetric vacua are identified with Bethe states of quantum integrable systems. This four dimensional gauge theory in its low energy description has two dimensional twisted superpotential which becomes the Yang-Yang function of the integrable system. We present the thermodynamic-Bethe-ansatz like formulae for these functions and for the spectra of commuting Hamiltonians following the direct computation in gauge theory. The general construction is illustrated at the examples of the many-body systems, such as the periodic Toda chain, the elliptic Calogero-Moser system, and their relativistic versions, for which we present a complete characterization of the L^2-spectrum. We very briefly discuss the quantization of Hitchin system.
