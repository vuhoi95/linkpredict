Title: Computing the Spectrum of a Heterotic Flux Vacuum
Authors: Allan Adams and Joshua M. Lapan
Abstract: We compute the massless spectra of a set of flux vacua of the heterotic string. The vacua we study include well-known non-Kahler T^2-fibrations over K3 with SU(3) structure and intrinsic torsion. Following gauged linear sigma models of these vacua into phases governed by asymmetric Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds allows us to compute the spectrum using generalizations of familiar LG-orbifold techniques. We study several four- and six-dimensional examples with N=2 spacetime supersymmetry in detail.
