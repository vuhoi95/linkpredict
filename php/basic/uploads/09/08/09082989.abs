Title: Bosonic String and String Field Theory: a solution using the holomorphic  representation
Authors: C. G. Bollini and M. C. Rocca
Abstract: In this paper we show that the holomorphic representation is appropriate for description in a consistent way string and string field theories, when the considered number of component fields of the string field is finite. A new Lagrangian for the closed string is obtained and shown to be equivalent to Nambu-Goto's Lagrangian. We give the notion of anti-string, evaluate the propagator for the string field, and calculate the convolution of two of them.
