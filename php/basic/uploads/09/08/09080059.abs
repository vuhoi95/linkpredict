Title: Energy spectrum of simply constant chromoelectric flux tubes
Authors: Shahin Mamedov and Douglas Singleton and Shemsettin Turkoz
Abstract: In this article we obtain the energy spectrum of colored, spinor particles in chromoelectric flux tubes. The chromoelectric field of the flux tubes considered here comes from {\em simply} constant gauge potentials rather than from covariantly constant gauge potential, as is usually the case. The energy spectrum of the simply constant flux tubes is different than that of the covariantly constant flux tubes. The spectrum is discrete due to the walls of the tube and with a plus/minus constant shift depending on the magnitude of the constant chromoelectric background. This goes against the classical intuition where one would expect a charged particle in a uniform "electric" field to accelerate with ever increasing velocity/energy i.e. there would be no constant energy eigenvalue.
