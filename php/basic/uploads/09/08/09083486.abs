Title: Holographic counterterms from local supersymmetry without boundary  conditions
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen
Abstract: We show in some lower-dimensional supergravity models that the holographic counterterms which are needed in the AdS/CFT correspondence to make the theory finite, coincide with the counterterms that are needed to make the action supersymmetric without imposing any boundary conditions on the fields.
