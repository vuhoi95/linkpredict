Title: Solving the Topological String on K3 Fibrations
Authors: Babak Haghighat and Albrecht Klemm
Abstract: We present solutions of the holomorphic anomaly equations for compact two-parameter Calabi-Yau manifolds which are hypersurfaces in weighted projective space. In particular we focus on K3-fibrations where due to heterotic type II duality the topological invariants in the fibre direction are encoded in certain modular forms. The formalism employed provides holomorphic expansions of topological string amplitudes everywhere in moduli space.
