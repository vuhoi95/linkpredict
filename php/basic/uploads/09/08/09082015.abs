Title: Deformation of Dyonic Black Holes and Vacuum Geometries in Four  Dimensional N=1 Supergravity
Authors: Bobby Eka Gunara and Freddy Permana Zen and Arianto
Abstract: We study some aspects of spherical symmetric dyonic non-supersymmetric black holes in $4d \; N=1$ supergravity coupled to chiral and vector multiplets on K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. Then, we have a family of dyonic non-supersymmetric black holes deformed with respect to the flow parameter related to the K\"ahler-Ricci soliton, which possibly controls the nature of black holes, such as their asymptotic and near horizon geometries. Two types of black holes are discussed, namely a family of dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black holes and Bertotti-Robinson-like black holes where the scalars are freezing all over spacetime and at the horizon, respectively. In addition, the corresponding vacuum structures for such black holes are also studied in the context of Morse-(Bott) theory. Finally, we give some simple $\;{\lC \mathrm{P}}^n$-models whose superpotential and gauge couplings have a linear form.
