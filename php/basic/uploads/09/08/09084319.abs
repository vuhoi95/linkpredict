Title: Noncommutative quantum mechanics of a test particle under linearized  gravitational waves
Authors: Anirban Saha and Sunandan Gangopadhyay
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a test particle in noncommutative space under the influence of linearized gravitational waves in the long wave-length and low-velocity limit. A prescription for quantizing the classical Hamiltonian for the interaction of gravitational wave with matter in noncommutative space is proposed. The Hamiltonian (and hence the system) is then exactly solved by using standard algebraic methods. The solutions show prominent signatures of the noncommutative nature of space. Computation of the expectation value of the particle's position reveals the inherent quantum nature of spacetime noncommutativity.
