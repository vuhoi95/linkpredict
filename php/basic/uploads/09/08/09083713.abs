Title: Walls in supersymmetric massive nonlinear sigma model on complex quadric  surface
Authors: Masato Arai and Sunggeun Lee and Sunyoung Shin
Abstract: The Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) multiwall solutions are constructed in a massive Kahler nonlinear sigma model on the complex quadric surface, Q^N=SO(N+2)/[SO(N)\times SO(2)] in 3-dimensional space-time. The theory has a non-trivial scalar potential generated by the Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction from the massless nonlinear sigma model on Q^N in 4-dimensional space-time and it gives rise to 2[N/2+1] discrete vacua. The BPS wall solutions connecting these vacua are obtained based on the moduli matrix approach. It is also shown that the moduli space of the BPS wall solutions is the complex quadric surface Q^N.
