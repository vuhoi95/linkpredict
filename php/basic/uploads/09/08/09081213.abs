Title: Dual quark condensate in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio  model
Authors: Kouji Kashiwa and Hiroaki Kouno and Masanobu Yahiro
Abstract: The dual quark condensate $\Sigma^{(n)}$ proposed recently as a new order parameter of the spontaneous breaking of the ${\mathbb Z}_3$ symmetry are evaluated by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, where $n$ are winding numbers. The Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model well reproduces lattice QCD data on $\Sigma^{(1)}$ measured very lately. The dual quark condensate $\Sigma^{(n)}$ at higher temperatures is sensitive to the strength of the vector-type four-quark interaction in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and hence a good quantity to determine the strength.
