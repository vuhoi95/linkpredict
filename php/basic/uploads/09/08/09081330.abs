Title: Wilson Loop-Loop Correlators in AdS/QCD
Authors: J. Nian and H. J. Pirner
Abstract: We calculate the expectation value of one circular Wilson loop and the correlator of two concentric circular Wilson loops in AdS/QCD using the modified AdS_5-metric given in Ref.[1]. The confinement properties of this metric in AdS/QCD are analyzed and compared with QCD and Nambu-Goto theory in four dimensions.
