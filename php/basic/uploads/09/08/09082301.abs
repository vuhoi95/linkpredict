Title: Regge limit of R-current correlators in AdS Supergravity
Authors: J. Bartels and J. Kotanski and A. -M. Mischler and V. Schomerus
Abstract: Four-point functions of R-currents are discussed within Anti-de Sitter supergravity. In particular, we compute Witten diagrams with graviton and gauge boson exchange in the high energy Regge limit. Assuming validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence, our results apply to R-current four-point functions of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling.
