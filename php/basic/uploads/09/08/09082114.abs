Title: Fermions, Skyrmions and the 3-Sphere
Authors: Stephen W. Goatham and Steffen Krusch
Abstract: This paper investigates a background charge one Skyrme field chirally coupled to light fermions on the 3-sphere. The Dirac equation for the system commutes with a generalised angular momentum or grand spin. It can be solved explicitly for a Skyrme configuration given by the hedgehog form. The energy spectrum and degeneracies are derived for all values of the grand spin. Solutions for non-zero grand spin are each characterised by a set of four polynomials. The paper also discusses the energy of the Dirac sea using zeta function regularization.
