Title: On the effective potential in higher-derivative superfield theories
Authors: M. Gomes and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We study the one-loop quantum corrections for higher-derivative superfield theories, generalizing the approach for calculating the superfield effective potential. In particular, we calculate the effective potential for two versions of higher-derivative chiral superfield models. We point out that the equivalence of the higher-derivative theory for the chiral superfield and the one without higher derivatives but with an extended number of chiral superfields occurs only when the mass term is contained in the general Lagrangian. The presence of divergences can be taken as an indication of this equivalence.
