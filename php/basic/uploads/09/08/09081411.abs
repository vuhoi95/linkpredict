Title: Euclidean formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics
Authors: W. N. Polyzou and Philip Kopp
Abstract: We discuss preliminary work on a formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics that uses reflection-positive Euclidean Green functions or their generating functionals as phenomenological input. We discuss the construction of a Poincare invariant S-matrix from matrix element of exp(- \beta H).
