Abstract: The infrared structure of MHV gluon amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory is considered in the next-to-leading order of PT. Explicit cancelation of the infrared divergencies in properly defined cross-sections is demonstrated. The remaining finite parts for some inclusive differential cross-sections are calculated analytically. In general, contrary to the virtual corrections, they do not reveal any simple structure.
