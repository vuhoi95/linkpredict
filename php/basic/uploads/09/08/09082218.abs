Title: On the pulsating strings in AdS_4 x CP3
Authors: H. Dimov and R. C. Rashkov
Abstract: We study the class of pulsating strings on AdS_4 x CP3. Using a generalized ansatz for pulsating string configurations we find new solutions of this class. Further we quasi-classically quantize the theory and obtain the first corrections to the energy. The latter, due to AdS/CFT correspondence, is supposed to give the anomalous dimensions of operators of the gauge theory dual N=6 Chern-Simons theory.
