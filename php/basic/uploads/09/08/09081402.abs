Title: Asymptotic symmetries of Schrödinger spacetimes
Authors: Geoffrey Compère and Sophie de Buyl and Stéphane Detournay and Kentaroh Yoshida
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic symmetry algebra of the Schrodinger-invariant metrics in d+3 dimensions and its realization on finite temperature solutions of gravity coupled to matter fields. These solutions have been proposed as gravity backgrounds dual to non-relativistic CFTs with critical exponent z in d space dimensions. It is known that the Schrodinger algebra possesses an infinite-dimensional extension, the Schrodinger-Virasoro algebra. However, we show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra of Schrodinger spacetimes is only isomorphic to the exact symmetry group of the background. It is possible to construct from first principles finite and integrable charges that infinite-dimensionally extend the Schrodinger algebra but these charges are not correctly represented via a Dirac bracket. We briefly comment on the extension of our analysis to spacetimes with Lifshitz symmetry.
