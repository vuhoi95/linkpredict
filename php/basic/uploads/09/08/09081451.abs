Title: Computation of the string tension in four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory  using large N reduction
Authors: Joe Kiskis and Rajamani Narayanan
Abstract: Continuum reduction and Monte Carlo simulation are used to calculate the heavy quark potential and the string tension in large N Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. The potential is calculated out to a separation of nine lattice units on a lattice with extent six in each direction.
