Title: Color Magnetic Flux Tubes in Dense QCD. II: Effective World-Sheet Theory
Authors: Minoru Eto and Eiji Nakano and Muneto Nitta
Abstract: Color magnetic flux tubes appear in the color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD, which exhibits color superconductivity as well as superfluidity. They are non-Abelian superfluid vortices and are accompanied by orientational zero modes in the internal space associated with the color-flavor locked symmetry spontaneously broken in the presence of the vortex. We show that those zero modes are localized around the vortex in spite of the logarithmic divergence of its tension, and derive the low-energy effective theory of them on the world-sheet of the vortex-string.
