Abstract: When considering quantum field theories on non-commutative spaces one inevitably encounters the infamous UV/IR mixing problem. So far, only very few renormalizable models exist and all of them describe non-commutative scalar field theories on four-dimensional Euclidean Groenewold-Moyal deformed space, also known as `theta-deformed space'. In this work we discuss some major obstacles of constructing a renormalizable non-commutative gauge field model and sketch some possible ways out.
