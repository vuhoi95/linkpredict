Title: Large scale evolution of the curvature perturbation in Horava-Lifshitz  cosmology
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Yuko Urakawa and Masahide Yamaguchi
Abstract: In the non-relativistic theory of gravity recently proposed by Horava, the Hamiltonian constraint is not satisfied locally at each point in space. The absence of the local Hamiltonian constraint allows the system to have an extra dark-matter-like component as an integration constant. We discuss consequences of this fact in the context of cosmological perturbations, paying a particular attention to the large scale evolution of the curvature perturbation. The curvature perturbation is defined in a gauge invariant manner with this ``dark matter'' taken into account. We then clarify the conditions under which the curvature perturbation is conserved on large scales. This is done by using the evolution equations.
