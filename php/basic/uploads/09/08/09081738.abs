Title: Ternutator Identities
Authors: Chandrashekar Devchand and David Fairlie and Jean Nuyts and Gregor Weingart
Abstract: The ternary commutator or ternutator, defined as the alternating sum of the product of three operators, has recently drawn much attention as an interesting structure generalising the commutator. The ternutator satisfies cubic identities analogous to the quadratic Jacobi identity for the commutator. We present various forms of these identities and discuss the possibility of using them to define ternary algebras.
