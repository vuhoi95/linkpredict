Title: On the Moyal deformation of Nahm Equations in seven dimensions
Authors: Hugo Garcia-Compean and Aldo A. Martinez-Merino
Abstract: We show how the reduced (anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills equations in seven dimensions described by the Nahm equations can be carried over to the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism. In the process some new solutions for the cases of gauge groups SU(2) and SL(2,R) are explicitly obtained.
