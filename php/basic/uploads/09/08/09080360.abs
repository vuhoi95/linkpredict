Title: BPS State Counting in Local Obstructed Curves from Quiver Theory and  Seiberg Duality
Authors: Wu-yen Chuang and Guang Pan
Abstract: In this paper we study the BPS state counting in the geometry of local obstructed curve with normal bundle O+O(-2). We find that the BPS states have a framed quiver description. Using this quiver description along with the Seiberg duality and the localization techniques, we can compute the BPS state indices in different chambers dictated by stability parameter assignments. This provides a well-defined method to compute the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants. This method can be generalized to other affine ADE quiver theories.
