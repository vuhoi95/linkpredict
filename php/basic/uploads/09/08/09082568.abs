Title: Dual conformal invariance in the Regge limit
Authors: Cesar Gomez and Johan Gunnesson and Agustin Sabio Vera
Abstract: A dual conformal symmetry, analogous to the dual conformal symmetry observed for the scattering amplitudes of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory, is identified in the Regge limit of QCD. Combined with the original two-dimensional conformal symmetry of the theory, this dual symmetry can potentially explain the integrability of the BFKL Hamiltonian. We also give evidence that the symmetry survives when a subset of unitarity corrections are taken into account by studying briefly the non-planar 2 to m reggeon transition vertices.
