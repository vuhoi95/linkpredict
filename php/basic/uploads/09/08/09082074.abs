Title: Artifact Dark Matter from Unified Brane Gravity
Authors: Ilya Gurwich and Aharon Davidson
Abstract: Adopting Dirac's brane variation prescription, the energy-momentum tensor of a brane gets supplemented by a geometrical (embedding originated) dark component. While the masslessness of the graviton is preserved, and the Newton force law is recovered, the corresponding Newton constant is necessarily lower than the one which governs FRW cosmology. This has the potential to puzzle out cosmological dark matter, a subsequent conjecture concerning galactic dark matter follows.
