Title: Lorentz invariant field theory on kappa-Minkowski space
Authors: M. Arzano and J. Kowalski-Glikman and A. Walkus
Abstract: It is by now well established that the momentum space dual to the non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski space is a submanifold of de Sitter space. It has been noticed recently that field theories built on such momentum space suffer from a subtle form of Lorentz symmetry breaking. Namely, for any negative energy mode the allowed range of rapidities is bounded above. In this paper we construct a complex scalar field theory with a modified action of Lorentz generators which avoids this problem. For such theory we derive conserved charges corresponding to translational and U(1) symmetries. We also discuss in some details the inner product and Hilbert space structure of the $\kappa$-deformed complex quantum field.
