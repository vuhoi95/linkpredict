Title: Gibbons-Hawking M-branes
Authors: A. M. Ghezelbash and R. Oraji
Abstract: We present new M2 and M5-brane solutions in M-theory based on transverse Gibbons-Hawking spaces. These solutions provide realizations of fully localized type IIA D2/D6 and NS5/D6 brane intersections. One novel feature of these solutions is that the metric functions depend on more than two transverse coordinates (unlike all the other previous known solutions). All the solutions have eight preserved supersymmetries and the world-volume theories of the NS5-branes are new non-local, non-gravitational, six dimensional, T-dual little string theories with eight supersymmetries. We discuss the limits in which the dynamics of the D2 and NS5-branes decouple from the bulk for these solutions.
