Title: Vertex-algebraic structure of the principal subspaces of level one  modules for the untwisted affine Lie algebras of types A,D,E
Authors: Corina Calinescu and James Lepowsky and Antun Milas
Abstract: Generalizing some of our earlier work, we prove natural presentations of the principal subspaces of the level one standard modules for the untwisted affine Lie algebras of types A, D and E, and also of certain related spaces. As a consequence, we obtain a canonical complete set of recursions (q-difference equations) for the (multi-)graded dimensions of these spaces, and we derive their graded dimensions. Our methods are based on intertwining operators in vertex operator algebra theory.
