Title: Towards a Noncommutative Astrophysics
Authors: Orfeu Bertolami and Carlos A. D. Zarro
Abstract: We consider astrophysical objects such as main-sequence stars, white-dwarfs and neutron stars in a noncommutative context. Noncommutativity is implemented via a deformed dispersion relation $E^{2}=p^{2}c^{2}(1+\lambda E)^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}$ from which we obtain noncommutative corrections to the pressure, particle number and energy densities for radiation and for a degenerate fermion gas. The main implications of noncommutativity for the considered astrophysical objects are examined and discussed.
