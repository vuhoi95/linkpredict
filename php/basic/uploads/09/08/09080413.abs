Title: Relativistic Thermodynamics with an Invariant Energy Scale
Authors: Sudipta Das and Subir Ghosh and Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: A particular framework for Quantum Gravity is the Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) formalism that introduces a new observer independent scale, the Planck energy. Our aim in this paper is to study the effects of this energy upper bound in relativistic thermodynamics. We have explicitly computed the modified equation of state for an ideal fluid in the DSR framework. In deriving our result we exploited the scheme of treating DSR as a non-linear representation of the Lorentz group in Special Relativity.
