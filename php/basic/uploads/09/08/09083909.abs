Title: Holographic Derivation of Kerr-Newman Scattering Amplitudes for General  Charge and Spin
Authors: Thomas Hartman and Wei Song and Andrew Strominger
Abstract: Near-superradiant scattering of charged scalars and fermions by a near-extreme Kerr-Newman black hole and photons and gravitons by a near-extreme Kerr black hole are computed as certain Fourier transforms of correlators in a two-dimensional conformal field theory. The results agree with the classic spacetime calculations from the 1970s, thereby providing good evidence for a conjectured Kerr-Newman/CFT correspondence.
