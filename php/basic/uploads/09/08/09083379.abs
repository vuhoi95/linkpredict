Title: Dirac-Born-Infeld actions and Tachyon Monopoles
Authors: Vincenzo Cal√≤ and Gianni Tallarita and Steven Thomas
Abstract: We investigate magnetic monopole solutions of the non-abelian DBI action describing 2 coincident non-BPS D9-branes in flat space. Just as in the case of kink and vortex solitonic tachyon solutions of the full DBI non-BPS actions, as previously analyzed by Sen, these monopole configurations are singular in the first instance and require regularization. We discuss a suitable non-abelian ansatz and show it solves the equations of motion to leading order in the regularization parameter. Fluctuations are studied and shown to describe a codimension 3 BPS D6-brane. A formula is derived for its tension. We comment on the implication to our results from both the trace (Tr) and symmetrized trace (Str) prescriptions of the non-abelian DBI action of coincident non-BPS D9-branes.
