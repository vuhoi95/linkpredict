Title: On Crossing Symmmetry and Modular Invariance in Conformal Field Theory  and S Duality in Gauge Theory
Authors: Dimitri Nanopoulos and Dan Xie
Abstract: In this note, we explore the relation between crossing symmetry and modular invariance in conformal field theory and S-duality in gauge theory. It is shown that partition functions of different S dual theories of N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with four fundamentals can be derived from the crossing symmetry of the Liouville four point function. We also show that the partition function of N=4 SU(2) gauge theory can be derived from the Liouville partition function on torus.
