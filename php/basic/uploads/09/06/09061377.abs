Title: Ring of physical states in the M(2,3) Minimal Liouville gravity
Authors: O. Alekseev and M. Bershtein
Abstract: We consider the M(2,3) Minimal Liouville gravity, whose states in the gravity sector are represented by irreducible modules of the Virasoro algebra. We present a recursive construction for BRST cohomology classes. This construction is based on using an explicit form of singular vectors in irreducible modules of the Virasoro algebra. We construct an algebra of operators acting on the BRST cohomology space. The operator algebra of physical states is established by use of these operators.
