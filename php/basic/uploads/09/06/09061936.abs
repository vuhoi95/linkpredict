Title: Interacting non-minimally coupled canonical, phantom and quintom models  of holographic dark energy in non-flat universe
Authors: M R Setare and Alberto Rozas-Fern√°ndez
Abstract: Motivated by our recent work \cite{set1}, we generalize this work to the interacting non-flat case. Therefore in this paper we deal with canonical, phantom and quintom models, with the various fields being non-minimally coupled to gravity, within the framework of interacting holographic dark energy. We employ the holographic model of interacting dark energy to obtain the equation of state for the holographic energy density in non-flat (closed) universe enclosed by the event horizon measured from the sphere of horizon named $L$.
