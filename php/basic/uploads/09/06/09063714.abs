Title: Tunneling Constraints on Effective Theories of Stable de Sitter Space
Authors: Tom Banks and Jean-FranÃ§ois Fortin
Abstract: We argue that effective field theories compatible with the idea of Cosmological SUSY Breaking, can have no supersymmetric vacuum states in the M_P -> infinity limit. We introduce a revised version of the Pyramid Scheme, which satisfies this criterion. Combining the criteria for CSB with results of Nelson and Seiberg, any such Lagrangian is non-generic, but we argue that this is plausible in the context of CSB, where R-violating terms in the Lagrangian come from interactions with the horizon, rather than integrating out short distance degrees of freedom. We also point out a Landau pole in the hidden sector gauge group of the Pyramid Scheme, and propose an unique mechanism for avoiding it.
