Title: From PT-symmetric quantum mechanics to conformal field theory
Authors: Patrick Dorey and Clare Dunning and Roberto Tateo
Abstract: One of the simplest examples of a PT-symmetric quantum system is the scaling Yang-Lee model, a quantum field theory with cubic interaction and purely imaginary coupling. We give a historical review of some facts about this model in d <= 2 dimensions, from its original definition in connection with phase transitions in the Ising model and its relevance to polymer physics, to the role it has played in studies of integrable quantum field theory and of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. We also discuss some more general results on PT-symmetric quantum mechanics and the ODE/IM correspondence, and mention applications to magnetic systems and cold atom physics.
