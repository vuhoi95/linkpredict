Title: Uniqueness of Extremal Kerr and Kerr-Newman Black Holes
Authors: Aaron J. Amsel and Gary T. Horowitz and Donald Marolf and Matthew M. Roberts
Abstract: We prove that the only four dimensional, stationary, rotating, asymptotically flat (analytic) vacuum black hole with a single degenerate horizon is given by the extremal Kerr solution. We also prove a similar uniqueness theorem for the extremal Kerr-Newman solution. This closes a longstanding gap in the black hole uniqueness theorems.
