Abstract: We derive the perturbative five loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator in N = 4 SYM theory from the integrable string sigma model by evaluating finite size effects using Luscher formulas adapted to multimagnon states at weak coupling. In addition, we derive the five loop wrapping contribution for the L=2 single impurity state in the beta deformed theory, which may be within reach of a direct perturbative computation. The Konishi expression exhibits two new features - a modification of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz quantization and sensitiveness to an infinite set of coefficients of the BES/BHL dressing phase. The result satisfies nontrivial self-consistency conditions - simple transcendentality structure and cancellation of mu-term poles. It may be a testing ground for the proposed AdS/CFT TBA systems.
