Abstract: In this work, we study a $U(1) \times U(1) ^{\prime}-$ model that results from a dimensional reduction of the N=1-D=4 supersymmetric version of the Cremer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond model with non-minimal coupling to matter. Field truncations are not carried out, two Abelian symmetries coexist and three vector fields are present; two of them are gauge bosons. Then, by considering the full $N=2-D=3$ supersymmetric model, we study the mechanism for magnetic vortex formation by means of the Bogomol'nyi relations, the magnetic flux and the topological charge in the presence of the two gauge potentials. A short discussion on the relation between our $N=2-D=3$ supersymmetric model and vortices in superfluid films is also presented.
