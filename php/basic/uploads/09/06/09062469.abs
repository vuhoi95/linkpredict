Title: SU(2) reduction in N=4 supersymmetric mechanics
Authors: Sergey Krivonos and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: We perform an su(2) Hamiltonian reduction of the general su(2)-invariant action for a self-coupled (4,4,0) supermultiplet. As a result, we elegantly recover the N=4 supersymmetric mechanics with spin degrees of freedom which was recently constructed in arXiv:0812.4276. This observation underscores the exceptional role played by the ``root'' supermultiplet in N=4 supersymmetric mechanics.
