Title: The Riemannian Penrose inequality and a virtual gravitational collapse
Authors: Seiju Ohashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu and Sumio Yamada
Abstract: We reinterpret the proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality by H. Bray. The modified argument turns out to have a nice feature so that the flow of Riemannian metrics appearing Bray's proof gives a Lorentzian metric of a spacetime. We also discuss a possible extension of our approach to charged black holes.
