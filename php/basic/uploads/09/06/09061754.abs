Title: The QCD beta-function from global solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations
Authors: Guillaume van Baalen and Dirk Kreimer and David Uminsky and Karen Yeats
Abstract: We study quantum chromodynamics from the viewpoint of untruncated Dyson-Schwinger equations turned to an ordinary differential equation for the gluon anomalous dimension. This nonlinear equation is parameterized by a function P(x) which is unknown beyond perturbation theory. Still, very mild assumptions on P(x) lead to stringent restrictions for possible solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations. We establish that the theory must have asymptotic freedom beyond perturbation theory and also investigate the low energy regime and the possibility for a mass gap in the asymptotically free theory.
