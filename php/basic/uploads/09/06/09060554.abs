Title: The GÃ¶del solution in the modified gravity
Authors: C. Furtado and T. Mariz and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. F. Santos
Abstract: We consider the modified gravity whose action represents itself as a sum of the usual Einstein-Hilbert action and the gravitational Chern-Simons term and show that the G\"{o}del metric solves the modified equations of motion, thus proving that the closed timelike curves whose presence is characteristic for the G\"{o}del solution are not forbidden in the case of the Chern-Simons modified gravity as well.
