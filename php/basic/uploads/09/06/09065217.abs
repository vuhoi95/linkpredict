Title: Dark Solitons in Holographic Superfluids
Authors: Ville Keranen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Sean Nowling and K. P. Yogendran
Abstract: We construct dark soliton solutions in a holographic model of a relativistic superfluid. We study the length scales associated with the condensate and the charge density depletion, and find that the two scales differ by a non-trivial function of the chemical potential. By adjusting the chemical potential, we study the variation of the depletion of charge density at the interface.
