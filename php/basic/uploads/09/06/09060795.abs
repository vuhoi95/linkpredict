Authors: Jacques Distler and Daniel S. Freed and Gregory W. Moore
Abstract: We give a precise and concise formulation of the orientifold construction in Type II superstring theory. Our results include anomaly cancellation on the worldsheet and a spacetime computation of the background Ramond-Ramond charge.
