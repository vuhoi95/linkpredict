Title: Exact Pair Production Rate for a Smooth Potential Step
Authors: A. Chervyakov and H. Kleinert
Abstract: We derive the exact rate of pair production of oppositely charged scalar particles by a smooth potential proportional to tanh kz in three dimensions. As a check we recover from this the known results for an infinitely sharp step as well as for a uniform electric field.
