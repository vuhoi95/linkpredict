Title: Chiral Condensates in Finite Density Holographic NJL Model from String  Worldsheets
Authors: Mohammad Edalati and Justin F. Vazquez-Poritz
Abstract: We calculate the one-point function of certain chiral operators, known as open Wilson lines, in the holographic Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite temperature as well as finite chemical potential for quark (baryon) number density. These operators are holographically dual to Euclidean string worldsheets bounded by the flavor branes. Their one-point functions can serve as order parameters for chiral symmetry breaking in these models. Analyzing the behavior of the dual string worldsheets with respect to temperature and chemical potential (or quark density) enables us to determine how the order parameter depends on these parameters.
