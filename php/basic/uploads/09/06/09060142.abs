Title: Infinitely many shape invariant potentials and new orthogonal  polynomials
Authors: Satoru Odake and Ryu Sasaki
Abstract: Three sets of exactly solvable one-dimensional quantum mechanical potentials are presented. These are shape invariant potentials obtained by deforming the radial oscillator and the trigonometric/hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potentials in terms of their degree \ell polynomial eigenfunctions. We present the entire eigenfunctions for these Hamiltonians (\ell=1,2,...) in terms of new orthogonal polynomials. Two recently reported shape invariant potentials of Quesne and G\'omez-Ullate et al's are the first members of these infinitely many potentials.
