Title: Extremal rotating solutions in Horava Gravity
Authors: Ahmad Ghodsi and Ehsan Hatefi
Abstract: Recently a new four-dimensional non relativistic renormalizable theory of gravity was proposed by Horava. In this paper we have found different near horizon geometries in Horava gravity. We find the rotating solutions in a special range of parameters of the theory. This range allows us to include up to six derivative terms in the equations of motion. We have found our solutions as perturbed solutions over spherical symmetric background with small rotating parameter.
