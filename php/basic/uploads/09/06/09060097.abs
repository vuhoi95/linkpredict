Title: Tunneling for Dirac Fermions in Constant Magnetic Field
Authors: El Bouazzaoui Choubabi and Mohamed El Bouziani and Ahmed Jellal
Abstract: The tunneling effect of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a constant magnetic field is studied. This can be done by using the continuity equation at some points to determine the corresponding reflexion and transmission coefficients. For this, we consider a system made of graphene as superposition of two different regions where the second is characterized by an energy gap t'. In fact, we treat concrete systems to practically give two illustrations: barrier and diode. For each case, we discuss the transmission in terms of the ratio of the energy conservation and t'. Moreover, we analyze the resonant tunneling by introducing a scalar Lorentz potential where it is shown that a total transmission is possible.
