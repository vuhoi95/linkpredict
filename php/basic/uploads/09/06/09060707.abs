Title: 3-Form Flux Compactification of Salam-Sezgin Supergravity
Authors: Hamid Reza Afshar and Shahrokh Parvizi
Abstract: The compactification of 6 dimensional Salam-Sezgin model in the presence of 3-form flux H is investigated. We find a torus topology for this compactification with two cusps which are the places of branes, while at the limit of large size L of the compact direction we also obtain sphere topology. This resembles the Randall-Sundrum I,II model. The branes at one of the cusps can be chosen to be 3- and 4-branes which fill our 4-dimensional space together with the fact that H=0 at this position restores the Lorentz symmetry. This compactification also provides an example for the so-called `time warp' solution, [0812.5107 [hep-th]]. According to a no-go theorem in $d\ne 6$, the time warp compactification violates the null energy condition. While the theorem is quiet for d=6, our model gives a time warp compactification which satisfies the null energy condition. We also derive the four dimensional effective Planck mass which is not obvious due to the time warp nature of the solution.
