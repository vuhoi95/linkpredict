Title: On the Non-renormalization of the AdS Radius
Authors: Luca Mazzucato and Brenno Carlini Vallilo
Abstract: We show that the relation between the 't Hooft coupling and the radius of AdS is not renormalized at one-loop in the sigma model perturbation theory. We prove this by computing the quantum effective action for the superstring on AdS_5 x S^5 and showing that it does not receive any finite alpha' corrections. We also show that the central charge of the interacting worldsheet conformal field theory vanishes at one-loop.
