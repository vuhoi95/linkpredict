Title: The spatial string tension in the deconfined phase of three dimensional  QCD in the large N limit
Authors: J. Kiskis and R. Narayanan
Abstract: We numerically compute the spatial string tension in the deconfined phase of three dimensional QCD in the large N limit. Our results clearly show that the string tension grows linearly with temperature.
