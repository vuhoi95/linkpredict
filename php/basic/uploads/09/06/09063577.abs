Title: Light-Cone Gauge Superstring Field Theory and Dimensional Regularization
Authors: Yutaka Baba and Nobuyuki Ishibashi and Koichi Murakami
Abstract: We propose a dimensional regularization scheme in the light-cone gauge NSR superstring field theory to regularize the divergences caused by the colliding supercurrents inserted at the interaction points. We study the tree amplitudes and show that our scheme actually regularize the divergences. We examine the four-point amplitudes for the NS-NS closed strings and find that the results in the first-quantized theory are reproduced without any counterterms.
