Title: Non-Gaussianity beyond slow roll in multi-field inflation
Authors: Christian T. Byrnes and Gianmassimo Tasinato
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussianity generated during multiple-field inflation. We provide an exact expression for the bispectrum parameter f_NL which is valid beyond the slow-roll regime, valid for certain classes of inflationary models. We then study a new, exact multi-field inflationary model considering a case where the bispectrum grows to observable values at the end of inflation. We show that in this case the trispectrum is also large and may even provide the dominant signal of non-Gaussianity.
