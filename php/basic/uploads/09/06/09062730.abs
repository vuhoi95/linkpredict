Title: Cosmological and Black Hole Spacetimes in Twisted Noncommutative Gravity
Authors: Thorsten Ohl and Alexander Schenkel
Abstract: We derive noncommutative Einstein equations for abelian twists and their solutions in consistently symmetry reduced sectors, corresponding to twisted FRW cosmology and Schwarzschild black holes. While some of these solutions must be rejected as models for physical spacetimes because they contradict observations, we find also solutions that can be made compatible with low energy phenomenology, while exhibiting strong noncommutativity at very short distances and early times.
