Title: Liouville Correlation Functions from Four-dimensional Gauge Theories
Authors: Luis F. Alday and Davide Gaiotto and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We conjecture an expression for the Liouville theory conformal blocks and correlation functions on a Riemann surface of genus g and n punctures as the Nekrasov partition function of a certain class of N=2 SCFTs recently defined by one of the authors. We conduct extensive tests of the conjecture at genus 0,1.
