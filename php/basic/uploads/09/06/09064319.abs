Authors: Wei Huang and Zhao-Long Wang and Mu-Lin Yan
Abstract: The effective field theory of the fractional quantum Hall edge is reformulated from microscopic dynamics. Noncommutative Chern-Simons theory is a microscopic description for the quantum Hall fluid. We use it for reference. Considering relabeling symmetry of the electrons and incompressibility of the fluid, we obtain a constraint and derive a chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory containing interaction terms. We calculate one-loop corrections to the phonon and electron propagators and get a new tunneling exponent. It agrees with experiments.
