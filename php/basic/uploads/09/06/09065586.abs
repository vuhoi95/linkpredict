Title: Dark Matter and Pseudo-flat Directions in Weakly Coupled SUSY Breaking  Sectors
Authors: Boaz Keren-Zur and Luca Mazzucato and Yaron Oz
Abstract: We consider candidates for dark matter in models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, in which the supersymmetry breaking sector is weakly coupled and calculable. Such models typically contain classically flat directions, that receive one-loop masses of a few TeV. These pseudo-flat directions provide a new mechanism to account for the cold dark matter relic abundance. We discuss also the possibility of heavy gravitino dark matter in such models.
