Title: Gravitational Collapse of the Shells with the Smeared Gravitational  Source in Noncommutative Geometry
Authors: John J. Oh and Chanyong Park
Abstract: We study the formation of the (noncommutative) Schwarzschild black hole from collapsing shell {of the} generalized matters containing polytropic and Chaplygin gas. We show that this collapsing shell depending on various parameters forms either a black hole or a naked singular shell with the help of the pressure.Furthermore, by considering the smeared gravitational sources, we investigate the noncommutative black holes formation. Though this mild noncommutative correction of matters cannot ultimately resolve the emergence of the naked singularity, we show that in some parameter region the collapsing shell evolves to a noncommutative black hole before becoming a naked singular shell.
