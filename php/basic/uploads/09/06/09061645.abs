Title: Stochastic Quantization of the Ho≈ôava Gravity
Authors: Fu-Wen Shu and Yong-Shi Wu
Abstract: The stochastic quantization method is applied to the recent proposal by Ho\v{r}ava for gravity. We show that in contrast to General Relativity, the Ho\v{r}ava's action, satisfying the detailed balance condition, has a stable, non-perturbative quantum vacuum when the DeWitt parameter $\lambda$ is not greater than 1/3, providing a possible candidate for consistent quantum gravity.
