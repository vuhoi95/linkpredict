Abstract: We analyze the cosmic-ray signatures of decaying gravitino dark matter in a model independent way based on an operator analysis. Thermal leptogenesis and universal boundary conditions at the GUT scale restrict the gravitino mass to be below 600 GeV. Electron and positron fluxes from gravitino decays, together with the standard GALPROP background, cannot explain both, the PAMELA positron fraction and the electron + positron flux recently measured by Fermi LAT. For gravitino dark matter, the observed fluxes require astrophysical sources. The measured antiproton flux allows for a sizable contribution of decaying gravitinos to the gamma-ray spectrum, in particular a line at an energy below 300 GeV. Future measurements of the gamma-ray flux will provide important constraints on possible signatures of decaying gravitino dark matter at the LHC.
