Title: Para-hyperhermitian surfaces
Authors: Johann Davidov and Gueo Grantcharov and Oleg Mushkarov and Mirroslav Yotov
Abstract: In this note we discuss the problem of existence of para-hyperhermitian structures on compact complex surfaces. We construct examples of para-hypercomplex structures on Inoue surfaces of type $S^{-}$ which do not admit compatible metrics.
