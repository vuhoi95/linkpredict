Title: Non-commutative Kerr black hole
Authors: Elisabetta Di Grezia and Giampiero Esposito
Abstract: This paper applies the first-order Seiberg-Witten map to evaluate the first-order non-commutative Kerr tetrad. The classical tetrad is taken to follow the locally non-rotating frame prescription. We also evaluate the tiny effect of non-commutativity on the efficiency of the Penrose process of rotational energy extraction from a black hole.
