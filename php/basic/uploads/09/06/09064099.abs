Title: Constraints on AdS/CFT Gravity Dual Models of Heavy Ion Collisions
Authors: Jorge Noronha and Miklos Gyulassy and Giorgio Torrieri
Abstract: We show that the five-fold constraints due to (1) the observed nuclear modification of heavy quark jets measured via non-photonic electrons $R_{AA}^e(p_T \sim 6 {\rm GeV})$ in central Au+Au collisions at 200 AGeV, (2) the "perfect fluid' elliptic transverse flow of low transverse momenta pions, $v_2(p_T\sim 1 {\rm GeV})$ reported for noncentral collisions, (3) the global pion rapidity density $dN_\pi/dy$, (4) the lattice QCD entropy density deficiency, $S/S_{SB}$, of strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasmas (sQGP), and (5) a causal requirement are analytically correlated in a class of gauge/string gravity dual models of sQGP dynamics. Current RHIC/BNL and lattice QCD data are found to be remarkably compatible with these models if the t'Hooft and Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameters lie in the range $\lambda\approx 10-25$ and $0< \lambda_{GB}< 0.09$. In addition, the observed five-fold correlation appears to favor color glass condensate over Glauber initial conditions within current systematic errors.
