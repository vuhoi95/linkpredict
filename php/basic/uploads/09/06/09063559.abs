Title: Classification of solutions in topologically massive gravity
Authors: David D. K. Chow and C. N. Pope and Ergin Sezgin
Abstract: We study exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant and a gravitational Chern-Simons term: the theory known as topologically massive gravity. After reviewing the algebraic classification, we show that if a solution has curvature of algebraic type D, then it is biaxially squashed AdS_3. Applying the classification, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, showing that most known solutions are locally equivalent to biaxially squashed AdS_3 or to AdS pp-waves.
