Title: The unwarped, resolved, deformed conifold: fivebranes and the baryonic  branch of the Klebanov-Strassler theory
Authors: Juan Maldacena and Dario Martelli
Abstract: We study a gravity solution corresponding to fivebranes wrapped on the $S^2$ of the resolved conifold. By changing a parameter the solution continuously interpolates between the deformed conifold with flux and the resolved conifold with branes. Therefore, it displays a geometric transition, purely in the supergravity context. The solution is a simple example of torsional geometry and may be thought of as a non-K\"ahler analog of the conifold. By U-duality transformations we can add D3 brane charge and recover the solution in the form originally derived by Butti et al. This describes the baryonic branch of the Klebanov-Strassler theory. Far along the baryonic branch the field theory gives rise to a fuzzy two-sphere. This corresponds to the D5 branes wrapping the two-sphere of the resolved conifold in the gravity solution.
