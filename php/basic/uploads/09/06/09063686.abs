Abstract: We show that generic supersymmetric AdS_5 solutions of type IIB supergravity admit a canonical contact structure. This structure determines the central charge of the dual field theory and the conformal dimension of operators dual to supersymmetric wrapped D3-branes. Hence both quantities can be calculated using incomplete information about the solutions, allowing us to prove that they are rational numbers for solutions with a U(1) R-symmetry, in agreement with field theory expectations. We also discuss related Duistermaat-Heckman integrals and localization formulae.
