Title: A2-Planar Algebras I
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: We give a diagrammatic presentation of the A_2-Temperley-Lieb algebra. Generalizing Jones' notion of a planar algebra, we formulate an A_2-planar algebra motivated by Kuperberg's A_2-spider. This A_2-planar algebra contains a subfamily of vector spaces which will capture the double complex structure pertaining to the subfactor for a finite SU(3) ADE graph with a flat cell system, including both the periodicity three coming from the A_2-Temperley-Lieb algebra as well as the periodicity two coming from the subfactor basic construction. We use an A_2-planar algebra to obtain a description of the (Jones) planar algebra for the Wenzl subfactor in terms of generators and relations.
