Title: Exact AdS/CFT spectrum: Konishi dimension at any coupling
Authors: Nikolay Gromov and Vladimir Kazakov and Pedro Vieira
Abstract: We compute the full dimension of Konishi operator in planar N=4 SYM theory it for a wide range of couplings, from weak to strong coupling regime, and predict the subleading terms in its strong coupling asymptotics. For this purpose we solve numerically the integral form of the AdS/CFT Y-system equations for the exact energies of excited states proposed by us and A.Kozak.
