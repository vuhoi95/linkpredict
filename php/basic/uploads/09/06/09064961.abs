Title: Monopoles and flux strings from SU(2) adjoint scalars
Authors: Chandrasekhar Chatterjee and Amitabha Lahiri
Abstract: We construct, in an SU(2) gauge theory with two adjoint scalars, flux strings with monopoles attached at the ends. One scalar breaks SU(2) to U(1) and produces monopoles, the other then breaks the U(1) and produces strings. Dualizing, we write the theory in terms of effective string variables and show that the flux in the string is exactly saturated by the monopoles at the ends.
