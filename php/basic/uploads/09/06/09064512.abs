Title: Bethe equations for generalized Hubbard models
Authors: V. Fomin and L. Frappat and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We compute the eigenfunctions, energies and Bethe equations for a class of generalized integrable Hubbard models based on gl(n|m)\oplus gl(2) superalgebras. The Bethe equations appear to be similar to the Hubbard model ones, up to a phase due to the integration of a subset of `simple' Bethe equations. We discuss relations with AdS/CFT correspondence, and with condensed matter physics.
