Title: Generating Primordial Black Holes Via Hilltop-Type Inflation Models
Authors: Laila Alabidi and Kazunori Kohri
Abstract: It has been shown that black holes would have formed in the early Universe if, on any given scale, the spectral amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exceeds 10^(-4). This value is within the bounds allowed by astrophysical phenomena for the small scale spectrum of the CMB, corresponding to scales which exit the horizon at the end of slow-roll inflation. Previous work by Kohri et. al. (2007) showed that for black holes to form from a single field model of inflation, the slope of the potential at the end of inflation must be flatter than it was at horizon exit. In this work we show that a phenomenological Hilltop model of inflation, satisfying the Kohri et. al. criteria, could lead to the production of black holes, if the power of the inflaton self-interaction is less than or equal to 3, with a reasonable number or e-folds. We extend our analysis to the running mass model, and confirm that this model results in the production of black holes, and by using the latest WMAP year 5 bounds on the running of the spectral index, and the black hole constraint we update the results of Leach et. al. (2000) excluding more of parameter space.
