Title: Phenomenology of Supersymmetric Gauge-Higgs Unification
Authors: Felix Brummer and Sylvain Fichet and Arthur Hebecker and Sabine Kraml
Abstract: Supersymmetric Gauge-Higgs Unification is a well-motivated new physics scenario, both in heterotic model building and from the perspective of higher-dimensional Grand Unified Theories. When combined with radion mediated supersymmetry breaking, it allows for very specific predictions concerning the high-scale parameters of the MSSM. Using an appropriately modified version of a standard RGE evolution code (SuSpect), we derive low-scale predictions which can be tested at the LHC. The phenomenological success of our setting depends crucially on the 5d Chern-Simons term, which has not been used in previous, less encouraging studies of gauge-Higgs unification in supersymmetry.
