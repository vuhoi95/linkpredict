Title: Eschenburg space as gravity dual of flavored N=4 Chern-Simons-matter  theory
Authors: Mitsutoshi Fujita and Ta-Sheng Tai
Abstract: We find 3D flavored N=4 Chern-Simons-matter theory, a kind of N=3 SCFT, has a gravity dual AdS4xM7(t1,t2,t3) where three coprime parameters can be read off according to the number and charge of 5-branes in Type IIB setup. Because M7(t1,t2,t3) has been known in literatures as Eschenburg space, we exploit some of its properties to examine the correspondence between two sides.
