Title: On Subextensive Corrections to Fluid Dynamics from Gravity
Authors: G. L. Cardoso and G. Dall'Agata and V. Grass
Abstract: We use the fluid-gravity correspondence to compute subextensive corrections, proportional to the shear tensor, to the energy-momentum tensor of fluids on three-spheres. The dual configurations we consider are charged black hole solutions of N = 2 gauged supergravity theories in five dimensions.
