Title: Area Spectrum of the Large AdS Black Hole from Quasinormal Modes
Authors: Shao-Wen Wei and Yu-Xiao Liu
Abstract: Using the new physical interpretation of quasinormal modes proposed by Maggiore, we calculate the area and entropy spectra for the 3-dimensioal and 5-dimensional large AdS black holes. The spectra are obtained by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition to the adiabatic invariant quantity. With this semiclassical method, we find that the spacings of the area and entropy spectra are equidistant and independent of the AdS radius of the black hole for both the cases. However, the spacings of the spectra are not the same for different dimension of space-time. The equidistant area spectra will be broken when the black hole has other parameters (i.e., charge and angular momentum) or in a non-Einstein's gravity theory.
