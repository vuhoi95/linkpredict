Title: Semiclassical and quantum description of motion on noncommutative plane
Authors: M. C. Baldiotti and J. P. Gazeau and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: We study the canonical and the coherent state quantization of a particle moving in a magnetic field on a non-commutative plane. Starting from the so called \theta-modified action, we perform the canonical quantization and analyze the gauge dependence of the obtained quantum theory. We construct the Malkin-Man'ko coherent states of the system in question, and the corresponding quantization. On this base, we study the relation between the coherent states and the "classical" trajectories predicted by the \theta-modified action. In addition, we construct different semiclassical states, making use of special properties of circular squeezed states. With the help of these states, we perform the Berezin-Klauder-Toeplitz quantization and present a numerical exploration of the semiclassical behavior of physical quantities in these states.
