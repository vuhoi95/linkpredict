Title: Quantum mirror symmetry and twistors
Authors: Sergei Alexandrov and Frank Saueressig
Abstract: Using the twistor approach to hypermultiplet moduli spaces, we derive the worldsheet, D(-1), and D1-instanton contributions to the generalized mirror map, relating Type IIA and Type IIB string theory compactified on generic mirror Calabi-Yau threefolds. For this purpose, we provide a novel description of the twistor space underlying the Type IIB hypermultiplet moduli space where the SL(2,Z)-action is found to be free from quantum corrections. The extent to which instanton effects may resolve the perturbative singularities of the moduli space metric is discussed.
