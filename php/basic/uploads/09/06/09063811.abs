Title: Nonholonomic Black Ring and Solitonic Solutions in Finsler and Extra  Dimension Gravity Theories
Authors: Mihai Anastasiei and Sergiu I. Vacaru
Abstract: We study stationary configurations mimicking nonholonomic locally anisotropic black rings (for instance, with ellipsoidal polarizations and/or imbedded into solitonic backgrounds) in three/six dimensional pseudo-Finsler/ Riemannian spacetimes. In the asymptotically flat limit, for holonomic configurations, a subclass of such spacetimes contains the set of five dimensional black ring solutions with regular rotating event horizon. For corresponding parameterizations, the metrics and connections define Finsler-Einstein geometries modeled on tangent bundles, or on nonholonomic (pseudo) Riemannian manifolds. In general, there are vacuum nonholonomic gravitational configurations which can not be generated in the limit of zero cosmological constant.
