Title: Comment on ``New ansatz for metric operator calculation in  pseudo-Hermitian field theory''
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Gregorio Benincasa and Hugh F. Jones
Abstract: In a recent Brief Report by Shalaby a new first-order perturbative calculation of the metric operator for an $i\phi^3$ scalar field theory is given. It is claimed that the result is an improvement on a previous calculation by Bender, Brody and Jones because it is local. Unfortunately Shalaby's calculation is not valid because of sign errors.
