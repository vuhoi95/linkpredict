Title: Spectral Measures and Generating Series for Nimrep Graphs in Subfactor  Theory
Authors: David E. Evans and Mathew Pugh
Abstract: We determine spectral measures for some nimrep graphs arising in subfactor theory, particularly those associated with SU(3) modular invariants and subgroups of SU(3). Our methods also give an alternative approach to deriving the results of Banica and Bisch for ADE graphs and subgroups of SU(2) and explain the connection between their results for affine ADE graphs and the Kostant polynomials. We also look at the Hilbert generating series of associated pre-projective algebras.
