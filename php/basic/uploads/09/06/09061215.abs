Title: Generalized q-Onsager algebras and boundary affine Toda field theories
Authors: P. Baseilhac and S. Belliard
Abstract: Generalizations of the q-Onsager algebra are introduced and studied. In one of the simplest case and q=1, the algebra reduces to the one proposed by Uglov-Ivanov. In the general case and $q\neq 1$, an explicit algebra homomorphism associated with coideal subalgebras of quantum affine Lie algebras (simply and non-simply laced) is exhibited. Boundary (soliton non-preserving) integrable quantum Toda field theories are then considered in light of these results. For the first time, all defining relations for the underlying non-Abelian symmetry algebra are explicitely obtained. As a consequence, based on purely algebraic arguments all integrable (fixed or dynamical) boundary conditions are classified.
