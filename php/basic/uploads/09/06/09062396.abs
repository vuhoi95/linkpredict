Title: The Holographic Superconductor Vortex
Authors: Marc Montull and Alex Pomarol and Pedro J. Silva
Abstract: A gravity dual of a superconductor at finite temperature has been recently proposed. We present the vortex configuration of this model and study its properties. In particular, we calculate the free energy as a function of an external magnetic field, the magnetization and the superconducting density. We also find the two critical magnetic fields that define the region in which the vortex configurations are energetically favorable.
