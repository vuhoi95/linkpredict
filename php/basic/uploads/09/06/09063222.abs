Title: Two loop MSbar Gribov mass gap equation with massive quarks
Authors: F. R. Ford and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: We compute the two loop MSbar correction to the Gribov mass gap equation in the Landau gauge using the Gribov-Zwanziger Lagrangian with massive quarks included. The computation involves dilogarithms of complex arguments and reproduces the known gap equation when the quark mass tends to zero.
