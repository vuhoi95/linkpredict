Title: Most General Spherically Symmetric M2-branes and Type IIB Strings
Authors: Zhao-Long Wang and H. Lu
Abstract: We obtain the most general spherically symmetric M2-branes and type IIB strings, with \R^{1,2}\times SO(8) and \R^{1,1}\times SO(8) isometries respectively. We find that there are twelve different classes of M2-branes, and we study their curvature properties. In particular we obtain new smooth M2-brane wormholes that connect two asymptotic regions: one is flat and the other can be either flat or AdS_4\times S^7. We find that these wormholes are traversable with certain time-like trajectories. We also obtain the most general Ricci-flat solutions in five dimensions with \R^{1,1}\times SO(3) isometries.
