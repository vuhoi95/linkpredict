Title: Inhomogeneous tachyon dynamics and the zipper
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matthew Lippert
Abstract: We study the process of inhomogeneous tachyon condensation in an intersecting D1- and anti-D1-brane system using an effective tachyon DBI action. By switching to the Hamiltonian formalism, we numerically solve for the dynamical evolution of the system at a small intersection angle. We find that the decay proceeds indefinitely and resembles the action of two zippers moving away from the intersection point at the speed of light, zipping the branes together and leaving inhomogeneous tachyon matter behind. We also discuss the range of validity of our analysis and discuss the relation of the D1-anti-D1 description of the system to one in terms of an intersecting D1-D1-brane pair.
