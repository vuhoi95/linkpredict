Title: The cosmological constant from the ghost. A toy model
Authors: Federico R. Urban and Ariel R. Zhitnitsky
Abstract: We suggest that the solution to the cosmological vacuum energy puzzle is linked to the infrared sector of the effective theory of gravity interacting with standard model fields. We propose a specific solvable two dimensional model where our proposal can be explicitly tested. We analyse the 2d Schwinger model on a 2-torus and in curved 2d space, mostly exploiting the properties of its topological susceptibility, its links with the non-trivial topology or deviations from spacetime flatness, and its relations to the real 4d world. The Kogut-Susskind ghost (which is a direct analogue of the Veneziano ghost in 4d) on a 2-torus and in curved 2d space plays a crucial role in the computation of the vacuum energy. The departure from Minkowski flatness, which is defined as the cosmological constant in our framework, is found to scale as 1/L, where L is the linear size of the torus. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the physical sector of 2d QED is represented by a single massive scalar particle, the deviation from Minkowski space is linear in L rather than exponentially suppressed as one could naively expect.
