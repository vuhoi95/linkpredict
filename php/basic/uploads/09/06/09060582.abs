Title: Wormhole solutions to Horava gravity
Authors: Marcelo Botta-Cantcheff and Nicolas Grandi and Mauricio Sturla
Abstract: We present wormhole solutions to Horava non-relativistic gravity theory in vacuum. We show that, if the parameter $\lambda$ is set to one, transversable wormholes connecting two asymptotically de Sitter or anti-de Sitter regions exist. In the case of arbitrary $\lambda$, the asymptotic regions have a more complicated metric with constant curvature. We also show that, when the detailed balance condition is violated softly, tranversable and asymptotically Minkowski, de Sitter or anti-de Sitter wormholes exist.
