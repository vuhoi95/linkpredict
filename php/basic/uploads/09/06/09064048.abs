Title: Dynamics of Charged Events
Authors: C. Bachas and C. Bunster and M. Henneaux
Abstract: In three spacetime dimensions the worldvolume of a magnetic source is a single point, an event. We make the event dynamical by regarding it as the imprint of a flux-carrying particle impinging from an extra dimension. This can be generalized to higher spacetime dimensions and to extended events. We exhibit universal observable consequences of the existence of events and argue that events are as important as particles or branes. We explain how events arise on the worldvolume of membranes in M theory, and in a Josephson junction in superconductivity.
