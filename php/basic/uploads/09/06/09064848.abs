Title: Chaotic inflation on the Randall-Sundrum 2-brane model
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and Siamak Akhshabi
Abstract: We construct an inflation model on the Randall-Sundrum I (RSI) brane where a bulk scalar field stabilizes the inter-brane separation. We study impact of the bulk scalar field on the inflationary dynamics on the brane. We proceed in two different approaches: in the first approach, the stabilizing field potential is directly appeared in the Friedmann equation and the resulting scenario is effectively a two-field inflation. In the second approach the stabilization mechanism is considered in the context of a warp factor so that there is just one field present that plays the roles of both inflaton and stabilizer. We study constraints imposed on the model parameters from recent observations.
