Abstract: We first briefly review some aspects of the techniques of dealing with ultraviolet divergences in Feynman amplitudes in an Euclidian $D$-dimensional space-time. Next we consider compactification of a $d$-dimensional ($d\leq D$) subspace. This includes effects of temperature and of compactification of $d-1$ spatial coordinates. Then we show how dimensional renormalization can be implemented for a field theory defined on this Euclidian space-time with a compactified subspace.
