Title: Non-minimal Maxwell-Modified Gauss-Bonnet Cosmologies: Inflation and  Dark Energy
Authors: J Sadeghi and M R Setare and A Banijamali
Abstract: In this paper we show that power-law inflation can be realized in non-minimal gravitational coupling of electromagnetic field with a general function of Gauss-Bonnet invariant. Such a non-minimal coupling may appear due to quantum corrections. We also consider modified Maxwell-$F(G)$ gravity in which non-minimal coupling between electromagnetic field and $f(G)$ occur in the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. It is shown that inflationary cosmology and late-time accelerated expansion of the universe are possible in such a theory.
