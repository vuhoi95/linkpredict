Title: S-duality, 't Hooft operators and the operator product expansion
Authors: Jaume Gomis and Takuya Okuda
Abstract: We study S-duality in N=4 super Yang-Mills with an arbitrary gauge group by determining the operator product expansion of the circular BPS Wilson and 't Hooft loop operators. The coefficients in the expansion of an 't Hooft loop operator for chiral primary operators and the stress-energy tensor are calculated in perturbation theory using the quantum path-integral definition of the 't Hooft operator recently proposed. The corresponding operator product coefficients for the dual Wilson loop operator are determined in the strong coupling expansion. The results for the 't Hooft operator in the weak coupling expansion exactly reproduce those for the dual Wilson loop operator in the strong coupling expansion, thereby demonstrating the quantitative prediction of S-duality for these observables.
