Title: Systems of Gibbons-Tsarev type and integrable 3-dimensional models
Authors: A. V. Odesskii and V. V. Sokolov
Abstract: We review the role of Gibbons-Tsarev-type systems in classification of integrable multi-dimensional hydrodynamic-type systems. Our main observation is an universality of Gibbons-Tsarev-type systems. We also constract explicitly a wide class of 3-dimensional hydrodynamic-type systems corresponding to the simplest possible Gibbons-Tsarev-type system.
