Title: Non-singular cosmology in a model of non-relativistic gravity
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Emmanuel N. Saridakis
Abstract: We present a model of non-relativistic gravitational theory which is power-counting renormalizable in 3+1 dimensional spacetime. When applied to cosmology, the relativity-violation terms lead to a dark radiation component, which can give rise to a bounce if dark radiation possesses negative energy density. Additionally, we investigate a cyclic extension of the non-singular cosmology in which the universe undergoes contractions and expansions periodically. In both scenarios the background theory is well defined at the quantum level.
