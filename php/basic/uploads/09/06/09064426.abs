Title: Boost invariant flow, black hole formation, and far-from-equilibrium  dynamics in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Paul M. Chesler and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the creation and evolution of boost invariant anisotropic, strongly coupled N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. In the dual gravitational description, this corresponds to horizon formation in a geometry driven to be anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions.
