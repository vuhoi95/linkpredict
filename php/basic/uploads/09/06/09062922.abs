Title: Causality of Holographic Hydrodynamics
Authors: Alex Buchel and Robert C. Myers
Abstract: We study causality violation in holographic hydrodynamics in the gauge theory/string theory correspondence, focussing on Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling is related to the difference between the central charges of the dual conformal gauge theory. We show that, when this difference is sufficiently large, causality is violated both in the second-order truncated theory of hydrodynamics, as well as in the exact theory. We find that the latter provides more stringent constraints, which match precisely those appearing in the CFT analysis of Hofman and Maldacena.
