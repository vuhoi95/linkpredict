Title: A general class of holographic superconductors
Authors: Sebastian Franco and Antonio Garcia-Garcia and Diego Rodriguez-Gomez
Abstract: We introduce a simple generalization of the basic holographic superconductor model in which the spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry occurs via the Stueckelberg mechanism. This more general setting allows tuning features such as the order of the transition. The physical vacuum of the condensed phase and the order of the transition are determined by a detailed analysis of the free energy of the system. For first order transitions, we identify a metastable phase above the critical temperature. In this case, the conductivity shows additional poles, thus suggesting that the condensate has internal structure. We comment on the possibility of obtaining second order phase transitions with non mean-field critical exponents.
