Title: Phantom and inflation scenarios from a 5D vacuum through form-invariance  transformations of the Einstein equations
Authors: Maria Laura Pucheu and Mauricio Bellini
Abstract: We study phantom and inflationary cosmologies using form-invariance transformations of the Einstein equations with respect to $\rho$, $H$, $a$ and $p$, from a 5D vacuum. Equations of state and squared fluctuations of the inflaton and phantom fields are examined.
