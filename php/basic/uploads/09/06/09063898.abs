Title: Static BPS black hole in 4d higher-spin gauge theory
Authors: V. E. Didenko and M. A. Vasiliev
Abstract: We find exact spherically symmetric solution of 4d nonlinear bosonic higher-spin gauge theory, that preserves a quarter of supersymmetries of N=2 supersymmetric 4d higher-spin gauge theory. In the weak field regime it describes $AdS_4$ Schwarzschild black hole in the spin two sector along with non-zero massless fields of all integer spins.
