Title: Non-minimal coupling of the phantom field and cosmic acceleration
Authors: M. R. Setare and Elias C. Vagenas
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in phantom fields as candidates for the dark energy component, we investigate the consequences of the phantom field when is minimally coupled to gravity. In particular, the necessary (but insufficient) conditions for the acceleration and superacceleration of the universe are obtained when the non-minimal coupling term is taken into account. Furthermore, the necessary condition for the cosmic acceleration is derived when the phantom field is non-minimally coupled to gravity and baryonic matter is included.
