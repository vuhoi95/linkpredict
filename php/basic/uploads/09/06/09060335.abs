Title: Twister quintessence scenario
Authors: Orest Hrycyna and Marek Szydlowski
Abstract: We study generic solutions in a non-minimally coupled to gravity scalar field cosmology. It is shown that dynamics for both canonical and phantoms scalar fields with the potential can be reduced to the dynamical system from which the exact forms for an equation of the state parameter can be derived. We have found the stationary solutions of the system and discussed their stability. Within the large class of admissible solutions we have found a non-degenerate critical points and we pointed out multiple attractor type of trajectory travelling in neighborhood of three critical points at which we have the radiation dominating universe, the barotropic matter dominating state and finally the de Sitter attractor. We have demonstrated the stability of this trajectory which we call the twister solution. Discovered evolutional path is only realized if there exist the non-minimal coupling constant. We have found simple duality relations between twister solutions in phantom and canonical scalar fields in the radiation domination phase. For the twister trajectory we have found an oscillating regime of approaching the de Sitter attractor.
