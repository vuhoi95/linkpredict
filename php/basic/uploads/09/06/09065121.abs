Title: Hawking Radiation of Black Holes in Infrared Modified  Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Jun-Jin Peng and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: We study the Hawking radiation of the spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes in the infrared modified Horava-Lifshitz gravity by applying the methods of covariant anomaly cancellation and effective action, as well as the approach of Damour-Ruffini-Sannan's. These black holes behave as the usual Schwarzschild ones of the general relativity when the radial distance is very large. We also extend the method of covariant anomaly cancellation to derive the Hawking temperature of the spherically symmetric, asymptotically AdS black holes that represent the analogues of the Schwarzschild AdS ones.
