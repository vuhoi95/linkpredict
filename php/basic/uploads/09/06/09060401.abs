Title: Gravitational Dual of Tachyon Condensation
Authors: Gary W. Gibbons and Koji Hashimoto and Shinji Hirano
Abstract: We study a system of N D3-branes in which open string tachyons survive in the low energy alpha' -> 0 limit. We compute the height of the tachyon potential both in the weak and strong couplings by using N=4 super Yang-Mills and the dual AdS_5 descriptions respectively. We find an exact agreement between the two descriptions in the large N limit. This provides an example of gravitational duals of open string tachyon condensation.
