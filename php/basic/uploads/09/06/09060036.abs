Title: Exact 2-point function in Hermitian matrix model
Authors: A. Morozov and Sh. Shakirov
Abstract: J. Harer and D. Zagier have found a strikingly simple generating function for exact (all-genera) 1-point correlators in the Gaussian Hermitian matrix model. In this paper we generalize their result to 2-point correlators, using Toda integrability of the model. Remarkably, this exact 2-point correlation function turns out to be an elementary function - arctangent. Relation to the standard 2-point resolvents is pointed out. Some attempts of generalization to 3-point and higher functions are described.
