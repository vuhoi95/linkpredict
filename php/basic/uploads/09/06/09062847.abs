Title: Holographic dark energy with varying gravitational constant
Authors: Mubasher Jamil and Emmanuel N. Saridakis and M. R. Setare
Abstract: We investigate the holographic dark energy scenario with a varying gravitational constant, in flat and non-flat background geometry. We extract the exact differential equations determining the evolution of the dark energy density-parameter, which include $G$-variation correction terms. Performing a low-redshift expansion of the dark energy equation of state, we provide the involved parameters as functions of the current density parameters, of the holographic dark energy constant and of the $G$-variation.
