Title: Cosmological Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer condensate as dark energy
Authors: Stephon Alexander and Tirthabir Biswas and Gianluca Calcagni
Abstract: We argue that the occurrence of late-time acceleration can conveniently be described by first-order general relativity covariantly coupled to fermions. Dark energy arises as a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer condensate of fermions which forms in the early universe. At late times, the gap and chemical potential evolve to have an equation of state with effective negative pressure, thus naturally leading to acceleration.
