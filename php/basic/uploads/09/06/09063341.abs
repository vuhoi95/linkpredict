Title: Primordial perturbation with a modified dispersion relation
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: In this paper we study the generation of primordial perturbation with a modified dispersion relation in various cosmological evolutions. We stress that the formation of the power spectrum is strongly dependent on the background. Working in a bounce model with a matter-like contracting phase, we obtain a red tilt spectrum due to the modified dispersion relation.
