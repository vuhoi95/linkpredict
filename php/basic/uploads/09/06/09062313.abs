Title: Interplay between geometry and temperature for inclined Casimir plates
Authors: Alexej Weber and Holger Gies
Abstract: We provide further evidence for the nontrivial interplay between geometry and temperature in the Casimir effect. We investigate the temperature dependence of the Casimir force between an inclined semi-infinite plate above an infinite plate in D dimensions using the worldline formalism. Whereas the high-temperature behavior is always found to be linear in T in accordance with dimensional-reduction arguments, different power-law behaviors at small temperatures emerge. Unlike the case of infinite parallel plates, which shows the well-known T^D behavior of the force, we find a T^{D-1} behavior for inclined plates, and a ~T^{D-0.3} behavior for the edge effect in the limit where the plates become parallel. The strongest temperature dependence ~T^{D-2} occurs for the Casimir torque of inclined plates. Numerical as well as analytical worldline results are presented.
