Title: Temperature quantization from the TBA equations
Authors: Sergey Frolov and Ryo Suzuki
Abstract: We analyze the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for the mirror model which determine the ground state energy of the light-cone AdS_5 x S^5 superstring living on a cylinder. The light-cone momentum of string is equal to the circumference of the cylinder, and is identified with the inverse temperature of the mirror model. We show that the natural requirement of the analyticity of the Y-functions leads to the quantization of the temperature of the mirror model which has never been observed in any other models.
