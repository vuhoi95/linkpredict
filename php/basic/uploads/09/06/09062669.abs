Title: Lump-like Structures in Scalar-field Models
Authors: A. T. Avelar and D. Bazeia and W. B. Cardoso and L. Losano
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of lump-like solutions in models described by a single real scalar field. We take advantage of a procedure recently used to describe explicit analytical solutions and we study several distinct models, showing how the parameters can be used to control the specific features of the lump-like structures. The proposed models are of direct interest to the construction of q-balls, to induce tachyonic excitations and gravitating structures of nontopological profile on braneworld models with a single extra dimension, to map solitons in optical fibers, and to describe collective excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates.
