Title: Remarks on D_p and D_{p-2} with each carrying a flux
Authors: J. X. Lu and Shan-Shan Xu
Abstract: We explore various properties of interaction between D$_p$ and D$_{p'}$ with each carrying a worldvolume flux and with the $p'$-branes placed along $p'$ spatial worldvolume directions of the p-branes at a separation when $p - p' = 2$. Carefully analyzing the annulus amplitudes calculated via the boundary state approach, we find that many features of amplitudes remain similar to those studied when $p = p'$ such as the nature of force on the brane separation, the onset of various instabilities when the brane-separation is on the order of string scale and the occurrence of pair production of open strings when there is a relevant electric flux present. In addition, we have also found many new features of interaction which don't appear in the absence of fluxes or when $p = p'$ in the presence of fluxes, for examples, the nature of interaction can be repulsive and there is no onset of tachyonic instability under certain conditions. Even in the absence of a magnetic flux, we can have an exponential enhancement of the rate of pair production of open strings in certain cases, which may be significant enough to give observational consequences.
