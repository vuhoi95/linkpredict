Title: Chiral Lagrangian and spectral sum rules for dense two-color QCD
Authors: Takuya Kanazawa and Tilo Wettig and Naoki Yamamoto
Abstract: We analytically study two-color QCD with an even number of flavors at high baryon density. This theory is free from the fermion sign problem. Chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously by the diquark condensate. Based on the symmetry breaking pattern we construct the low-energy effective Lagrangian for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We identify a new epsilon-regime at high baryon density in which the quark mass dependence of the partition function can be determined exactly. We also derive Leutwyler-Smilga-type spectral sum rules for the complex eigenvalues of the Dirac operator in terms of the fermion gap. Our results can in principle be tested in lattice QCD simulations.
