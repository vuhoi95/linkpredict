Title: Quantum dot with spin-orbit interaction in noncommutative phase space  and analog Landau levels
Authors: B. K. Pal and B. Roy and B. Basu
Abstract: We have studied a quantum dot with Rashba spin orbit interaction on a plane where the position and momentum coordinates are considered to be noncommutative. The energy spectrum of the system is found to be equivalent to that of a quantum dot with Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a magnetic field under certain conditions.
