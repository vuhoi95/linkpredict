Title: The E(2) Particle
Authors: Subir Ghosh and And Probir Pal
Abstract: Recently it has been advocated [1] that for describing nature within the minimal symmetry requirement, certain subgroups of Lorentz group may play a fundamental role. One such group is E(2) which induces a Lie algebraic Non-Commutative spacetime [4] where translation invariance is not fully maintained. We have constructed a consistent structure of Non-commutative phase space for this system and furthermore we have studied an appropriate point particle action on it. Interestingly, the Einstein dispersion relation $p^2=m^2$ remains intact. The model is constructed by exploiting a dual canonical phase space following the scheme developed by us earlier [8].
