Title: Composite system in deformed space with minimal length
Authors: C. Quesne and V. M. Tkachuk
Abstract: For composite systems made of $N$ different particles living in a space characterized by the same deformed Heisenberg algebra, but with different deformation parameters, we define the total momentum and the center-of-mass position to first order in the deformation parameters. Such operators satisfy the deformed algebra with new effective deformation parameters. As a consequence, a two-particle system can be reduced to a one-particle problem for the internal motion. As an example, the correction to the hydrogen atom $n$S energy levels is re-evaluated. Comparison with high-precision experimental data leads to an upper bound of the minimal length for the electron equal to $3.3\times 10^{-18} {\rm m}$. The effective Hamiltonian describing the center-of-mass motion of a macroscopic body in an external potential is also found. For such a motion, the effective deformation parameter is substantially reduced due to a factor $1/N^2$. This explains the strangely small result previously obtained for the minimal length from a comparison with the observed precession of the perihelion of Mercury. From our study, an upper bound of the minimal length for quarks equal to $2.4\times 10^{-17}{\rm m}$ is deduced, which appears close to that obtained for electrons.
