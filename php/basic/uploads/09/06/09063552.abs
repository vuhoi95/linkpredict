Title: Proof of the Dual Conformal Anomaly of One-Loop Amplitudes in N=4 SYM
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Paul Heslop and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We provide two derivations of the one-loop dual conformal anomaly of generic n-point superamplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Our proofs are based on simple applications of unitarity, and the known analytic properties of the amplitudes.
