Title: Confinement and the quark Fermi-surface in SU(2N) QCD-like theories
Authors: Kurt Langfeld and Bjoern H. Wellegehausen and Andreas Wipf
Abstract: Yang-Mills theories with a gauge group SU(N_c\=3)and quark matter in the fundamental representation share many properties with the theory of strong interactions, QCD with N_c=3. We show that, for N_c even and in the confinement phase, the gluonic average of the quark determinant is independent of the boundary conditions, periodic or anti-periodic ones. We then argue that a Fermi sphere of quarks can only exist under extreme conditions when the centre symmetry is spontaneously broken and colour is liberated. Our findings are supported by lattice gauge simulations for N_c=2...5 and are illustrated by means of a simple quark model.
