Title: On Equivalence of two Hurwitz Matrix Models
Authors: A. Morozov and Sh. Shakirov
Abstract: In arXiv:0902.2627 a matrix model representation was found for the simplest Hurwitz partition function, which has Lambert curve phi e^{-phi} = psi as a classical equation of motion. We demonstrate that Fourier-Laplace transform in the logarithm of external field Psi converts it into a more sophisticated form, recently suggested in arXiv:0906.1206.
