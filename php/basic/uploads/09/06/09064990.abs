Title: Dark Energy as an off-shell Tachyon Background in four-dimensional  Strings
Authors: J. Alexandre and N. E. Mavromatos
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent bosonic string in graviton, dilaton and tachyon backgrounds, for which it was already shown that conformal invariance is respected to all orders in alpha' and in any space-time dimension. Assuming that the tachyon is off-shell, we show in this note that the specific time-homogeneity of the corresponding space time effective action leads to a power-law expanding Universe, that can be accelerating or decelerating, depending on the range of parameter space considered. We interpret this result as dark energy. We arrive at this result without requiring the knowledge of the structure of the string effective action, which is not known to all orders in alpha'. Moreover, in our approach, the background configurations are consistent in a four-dimensional space time, without any need for extra dimensions.
