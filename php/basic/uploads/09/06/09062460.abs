Abstract: The $f(R)$ gravity models proposed by Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky are generic for local gravity constraints to be evaded. The large deviations from these models either result into violation of local gravity constraints or the modifications are not distinguishable from cosmological constant. The curvature singularity in these models is generic but can be avoided provided that proper fine tuning is imposed on the evolution of scalaron in the high curvature regime. In principle, the problem can be circumvented by incorporating quadratic curvature correction in the Lagrangian though it might be quite challenging to probe the relevant region numerically.
