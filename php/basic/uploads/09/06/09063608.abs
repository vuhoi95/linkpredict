Title: Inflation in a Web
Authors: Sheng Li and Yang Liu and Yun-Song Piao
Abstract: In a given path with multiple branches, in principle, it can be expected that there are some fork points, where one branch is bifurcated into different branches, or various branches converge into one or several branches. In this paper, it is showed that if there is a web formed by such branches in a given field space, in which each branch can be responsible for a period of slow roll inflation, a multiverse separated by domain wall network will come into being, some of which might corresponds to our observable universe. We discuss this scenario and show possible observations of a given observer at late time.
