Title: Bare and effective fluid description in brane world cosmology
Authors: Norman Cruz and Samuel Lepe and Francisco Pena and Joel Saavedra
Abstract: An effective fluid description, for a brane world model in five dimensions, is discussed for both signs of the brane tension. We found several cosmological scenarios where the effective equation differs widely from the bare equation of state. For universes with negative brane tension, with a bare fluid satisfying the strong energy condition, the effective fluid can cross the barrier $\omega _{eff} =-1$.
