Title: On the uniqueness of extremal vacuum black holes
Authors: Pau Figueras and James Lucietti
Abstract: We prove uniqueness theorems for asymptotically flat, stationary, extremal, vacuum black hole solutions, in four and five dimensions with one and two commuting rotational Killing fields respectively. As in the non-extremal case, these problems may be cast as boundary value problems on the two dimensional orbit space. We show that the orbit space for solutions with one extremal horizon is homeomorphic to an infinite strip, where the two boundaries correspond to the rotational axes, and the two asymptotic regions correspond to spatial infinity and the near-horizon geometry. In four dimensions this allows us to establish the uniqueness of extremal Kerr amongst asymptotically flat, stationary, rotating, vacuum black holes with a single extremal horizon. In five dimensions we show that there is at most one asymptotically flat, stationary, extremal vacuum black hole with a connected horizon, two commuting rotational symmetries and given interval structure and angular momenta. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for four and five dimensional asymptotically flat vacuum black holes with the above symmetries to be static (valid for extremal, non-extremal and even non-connected horizons).
