Title: New supersymmetric AdS4 type II vacua
Authors: Dieter Lust and Dimitrios Tsimpis
Abstract: Building on our recent results on dynamic SU(3)xSU(3) structures we present a set of sufficient conditions for supersymmetric AdS4xM6 backgrounds of type IIA/IIB supergravity. These conditions ensure that the background solves, besides the supersymmetry equations, all the equations of motion of type II supergravity. The conditions state that the internal manifold is locally a codimension-one foliation such that the five dimensional leaves admit a Sasaki-Einstein structure. In type IIA the supersymmetry is N=2, and the total six-dimensional internal space is locally an S^2 bundle over a four-dimensional Kaehler-Einstein base; in IIB the internal space is the direct product of a circle and a five-dimensional squashed Sasaki-Einstein manifold. Given any five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold we construct the corresponding families of type IIA/IIB vacua. The precise profiles of all the fields are determined at the solution and depend on whether one is in IIA or in IIB. In particular the background does not contain any sources, all fluxes (including the Romans mass in IIA) are generally non-zero, and the dilaton and warp factor are non-constant.
