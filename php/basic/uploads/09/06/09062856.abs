Title: On the mystery of the missing pie in graphene
Authors: Paola Giacconi and Roberto Soldati
Abstract: We investigate in some detail the structure of the electromagnetic current density for the pseudo-relativistic massless spinor effective model for graphene. It is shown that the pseudo-relativistic massless Dirac field theory in {\em 2+1} space-time dimensions and in the presence of a constant homogeneous electric field actually leads to the measured current density and to the minimum quantum conductivity.
