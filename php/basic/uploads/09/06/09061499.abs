Title: A short review on entanglement in quantum spin systems
Authors: J. I. Latorre and A. Riera
Abstract: We review some of the recent progress on the study of entropy of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Emphasis is placed on the scaling properties of entropy for one-dimensional multi-partite models at quantum phase transitions and, more generally, on the concept of area law. We also briefly describe the relation between entanglement and the presence of impurities, the idea of particle entanglement, the evolution of entanglement along renormalization group trajectories, the dynamical evolution of entanglement and the fate of entanglement along a quantum computation.
