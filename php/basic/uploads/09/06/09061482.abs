Title: A new current algebra and the reflection equation
Authors: P. Baseilhac and K. Shigechi
Abstract: We establish an explicit algebra isomorphism between the quantum reflection algebra for the $U_q(\hat{sl_2})$ R-matrix and a new type of current algebra. These two algebras are shown to be two realizations of a special case of tridiagonal algebras (q-Onsager).
