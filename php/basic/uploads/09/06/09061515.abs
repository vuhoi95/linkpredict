Title: Graviton emission from simply rotating Kerr-de Sitter black holes:  Transverse traceless tensor graviton modes
Authors: Jason Doukas and H. T. Cho and A. S. Cornell and Wade Naylor
Abstract: In this article we present results for tensor graviton modes (in seven dimensions and greater, $n\geq 3$) for greybody factors of Kerr-dS black holes and for Hawking radiation from simply rotating (n+4)-dimensional Kerr black holes. Although there is some subtlety with defining the Hawking temperature of a Kerr-dS black hole, we present some preliminary results for emissions assuming the standard Hawking normalization and a Bousso-Hawking-like normalization.
