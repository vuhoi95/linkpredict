Title: Vacuum pressure, dark energy and dark matter
Authors: Bogusław Broda and Michał Szanecki
Abstract: It has been argued that the correct, i.e. positive, sign of quantum vacuum energy density, or more properly, negative sign of quantum vacuum pressure, requires not a very large number, e.g. ~100, of additional, undiscovered fundamental bosonic particle species, absent in the standard model. Interpretation of the new particle species in terms of dark matter ones permits to qualitatively, and even quantitatively, connect all the three concepts given in the title.
