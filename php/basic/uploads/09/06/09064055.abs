Title: Hidden superconformal symmetry of spinless Aharonov-Bohm system
Authors: Francisco Correa and Horacio Falomir and Vit Jakubsky and Mikhail S. Plyushchay
Abstract: A hidden supersymmetry is revealed in the spinless Aharonov-Bohm problem. The intrinsic supersymmetric structure is shown to be intimately related with the scale symmetry. As a result, a bosonized superconformal symmetry is identified in the system. Different self-adjoint extensions of the Aharonov-Bohm problem are studied in the light of this superconformal structure and interacting anyons. Scattering problem of the original Aharonov-Bohm model is discussed in the context of the revealed supersymmetry.
