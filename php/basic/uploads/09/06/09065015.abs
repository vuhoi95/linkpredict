Title: Axions in Gauge Mediation
Authors: Linda M. Carpenter and Michael Dine and Guido Festuccia and Lorenzo Ubaldi
Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, the presence of axions usually implies the existence of a non-compact, (pseudo)moduli space. In gauge mediated models, the axion would seem a particularly promising dark matter candidate. The cosmology of the moduli then constrains the gravitino mass and the axion decay constant; the former can't be much below 10 MeV; the latter can't be much larger than 10^{13} GeV. Axinos, when identifiable, are typically heavy and do not play an important role in cosmology.
