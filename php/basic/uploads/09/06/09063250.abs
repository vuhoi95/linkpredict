Title: Schrodinger formalism, black hole horizons and singularity behavior
Authors: John E. Wang and Eric Greenwood and Dejan Stojkovic
Abstract: The Gauss-Codazzi method is used to discuss the gravitational collapse of a charged Reisner-Nordstr\"om domain wall. We solve the classical equations of motion of a thin charged shell moving under the influence of its own gravitational field and show that a form of cosmic censorship applies. If the charge of the collapsing shell is greater than its mass, then the collapse does not form a black hole. Instead, after reaching some minimal radius, the shell bounces back. The Schrodinger canonical formalism is used to quantize the motion of the charged shell. The limits near the horizon and near the singularity are explored. Near the horizon, the Schrodinger equation describing evolution of the collapsing shell takes the form of the massive wave equation with a position dependent mass. The outgoing and incoming modes of the solution are related by the Bogolubov transformation which precisely gives the Hawking temperature. Near the classical singularity, the Schrodinger equation becomes non-local, but the wave function describing the system is non-singular. This indicates that while quantum effects may be able to remove the classical singularity, it may also introduce some new effects.
