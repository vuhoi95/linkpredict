Title: Quintessence and phantom dark energy from ghost D-branes
Authors: Emmanuel N. Saridakis and John Ward
Abstract: We present a novel dark energy candidate, based upon the existence and dynamics of Ghost D-branes in a warped compactification of type IIB string theory. Gp-branes cancel the combined BPS sectors of the Dp-branes, while they preserve the same supersymmetries. We show that this scenario can naturally lead to either quintessence or phantom-like behaviors, depending on the form of the involved potentials and brane tension.
