Title: Quantum gravity as sum over spacetimes
Authors: Jan Ambjorn and Jerzy Jurkiewicz and Renate Loll
Abstract: A major unsolved problem in theoretical physics is to reconcile the classical theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. These lectures will deal with an attempt to describe quantum gravity as a path integral over geometries known as "Causal Dynamical Triangulations" (CDT).
