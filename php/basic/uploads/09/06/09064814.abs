Title: BRST Detour Quantization
Authors: D. Cherney and E. Latini and A. Waldron
Abstract: We present the BRST cohomologies of a class of constraint (super) Lie algebras as detour complexes. By giving physical interpretations to the components of detour complexes as gauge invariances, Bianchi identities and equations of motion we obtain a large class of new gauge theories. The pivotal new machinery is a treatment of the ghost Hilbert space designed to manifest the detour structure. Along with general results, we give details for three of these theories which correspond to gauge invariant spinning particle models of totally symmetric, antisymmetric and K\"ahler antisymmetric forms. In particular, we give details of our recent announcement of a (p,q)-form K\"ahler electromagnetism. We also discuss how our results generalize to other special geometries.
