Title: Quark Mass Dependence of Hadron Spectrum in Holographic QCD
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Takayuki Hirayama and Deog Ki Hong
Abstract: We compute a shift of baryon mass spectra due to quark masses in perturbation, in Sakai-Sugimoto model of holographic QCD. We find the shift for the ground state nucleons to be \delta M = 4.1 m_{\pi}^2 [GeV^{-1}], which is consistent with the current lattice QCD result. We predict the same value of the shift for N(1535) and Delta, while a larger value 7.7 m_{\pi}^2 [GeV^{-1}] for Roper N(1440). We also present some evidences that the shifts of the vector meson masses are suppressed in the large 't Hooft coupling limit.
