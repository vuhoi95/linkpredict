Title: Scalar and tensor gauge field localization on deformed thick branes
Authors: W. T. Cruz and M. O. Tahim and C. A. S. Almeida
Abstract: We make an analysis about several aspects of localization of a scalar field and a Kalb-Ramond gauge field in a specific four dimensional AdS membrane embedded in a five dimensional space-time. The membrane is generated from a deformation of the $\lambda \phi^4$ potential and belongs to a new class of defect solutions. The study of deformed defects is important because they contain internal structures and these may have implications to the way the background space-time is constructed and the way its curvature behaves. The main objective is to observe the contributions of the deformation procedure to the well known field localization methods.
