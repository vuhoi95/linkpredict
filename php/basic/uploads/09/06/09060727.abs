Title: Natural semi-direct gauge mediation and D-branes at singularities
Authors: Riccardo Argurio and Matteo Bertolini and Gabriele Ferretti and Alberto Mariotti
Abstract: We consider semi-direct gauge mediation models of supersymmetry breaking where the messengers are composite fields and their supersymmetric mass is naturally generated through quartic superpotential couplings. We show that such composite messenger models can be easily embedded in quiver gauge theories arising from D-branes at Calabi-Yau singularities, and argue that semi-direct gauge mediation is in fact a very natural option for supersymmetry breaking in D-brane models. We provide several explicit examples and discuss their salient phenomenological properties.
