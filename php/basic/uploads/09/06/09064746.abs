Title: First Order String Theory and the Kodaira-Spencer Equations. I
Authors: O. Gamayun and A. S. Losev and A. Marshakov
Abstract: We consider first-order bosonic string theory, perturbed by the primary operator, corresponding to deformation of the target-space complex structure. We compute the effective action in this theory and find that its consistency with the world-sheet conformal invariance requires necessarily the Kodaira-Spencer equations to be satisfied by target-space Beltrami differentials. We discuss the symmetries of the theory and its reformulation in terms of the vielbein background fields.
