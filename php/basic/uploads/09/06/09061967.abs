Title: Generalized Galileons: All scalar models whose curved background  extensions maintain second-order field equations and stress tensors
Authors: C. Deffayet and S. Deser and G. Esposito-Farese
Abstract: We extend to curved backgrounds all flat-space scalar field models that obey purely second-order equations, while maintaining their second-order dependence on both field and metric. This extension simultaneously restores to second order the, originally higher derivative, stress tensors as well. The process is transparent and uniform for all dimensions.
