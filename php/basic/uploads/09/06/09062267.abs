Title: Conformal Symmetry for Rotating D-branes
Authors: Li-Ming Cao and Yoshinori Matsuo and Takuya Tsukioka and Chul-Moon Yoo
Abstract: We apply the Kerr/CFT correspondence to the rotating black p-brane solutions. These solutions give the simplest examples from string theory point of view. Their near horizon geometries have structures of AdS, even though black p-brane solutions do not have AdS-like structures in the non-rotating case. The microscopic entropy which can be calculated via the Cardy formula exactly agrees with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
