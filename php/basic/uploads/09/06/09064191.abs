Title: Decoupling of Higgs boson from the inflationary stage of Universe  evolution
Authors: V. V. Kiselev and S. A. Timofeev
Abstract: The constraint on the mass of Higgs field in the Standard Model at the minimal interaction with the gravity is derived in the form of lower bound $m_H> 150$ GeV by the strict requirement of decoupling the Higgs boson from the inflation of early Universe: the inflation produced by the Higgs scalar could crucially destroy visible properties of large scale structure of Universe, while the large mass makes the Higgs particle not able to produce the inflation and shifts its cosmological role into the region of quantum gravity.
