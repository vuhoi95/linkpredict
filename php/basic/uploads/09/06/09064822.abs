Title: Chiral Supergravity
Authors: Melanie Becker and Paul Bruillard and Sean Downes
Abstract: We study the linearized approximation of N=1 topologically massive supergravity around AdS3. Linearized gravitino fields are explicitly constructed. For appropriate boundary conditions, the conserved charges demonstrate chiral behavior, so that chiral gravity can be consistently extended to chiral supergravity.
