Title: Non-Minimal Warm Inflation and Perturbations on the Warped DGP Brane  with Modified Induced Gravity
Authors: Kourosh Nozari and M. Shoukrani and Behnaz Fazlpour
Abstract: We construct a warm inflation model with inflaton field non-minimally coupled to induced gravity on a warped DGP brane. We incorporate possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane in the spirit of $f(R)$-gravity. We study cosmological perturbations in this setup. In the case of two field inflation such as warm inflation, usually entropy perturbations are generated. While it is expected that in the case of one field inflation these perturbations to be removed, we show that even in the absence of the radiation field, entropy perturbations are generated in our setup due to non-minimal coupling and modification of the induced gravity.
