Title: Non-singular inflationary universe from polymer matter
Authors: Golam Mortuza Hossain and Viqar Husain and Sanjeev S. Seahra
Abstract: We consider a polymer quantization of a free massless scalar field in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological spacetime. This quantization method assumes that field translations are fundamentally discrete, and is related to but distinct from that used in loop quantum gravity. The semi-classical Friedman equation yields a universe that is non-singular and non-bouncing, without quantum gravity. The model has an early de Sitter-like inflationary phase with sufficient expansion to resolve the horizon and entropy problems, and a built in mechanism for a graceful exit from inflation.
