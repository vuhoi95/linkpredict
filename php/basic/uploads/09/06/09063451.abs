Title: Instantons, black holes and harmonic functions
Authors: Thomas Mohaupt and Kirk Waite
Abstract: We find a class of five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell type Lagrangians which contains the bosonic Lagrangians of vector multiplets as a subclass, and preserves some features of supersymmetry, namely the existence of multi-centered black hole solutions and of attractor equations. Solutions can be expressed in terms of harmonic functions through a set of algebraic equations. The geometry underlying these Lagrangians is characterized by the existence of a Hesse potential and generalizes the very special real geometry of vector multiplets. Our construction proceeds by first obtaining instanton solutions for a class of four-dimensional Euclidean sigma models, which includes those occuring for four-dimensional Euclidean N=2 vector multiplets as a subclass.
