Title: The BPS spectrum of monopole operators in ABJM: towards a field theory  description of the giant torus
Authors: David Berenstein and Jaemo Park
Abstract: We study the BPS spectrum of monopole operators in ABJM theory. First we work out the complete spectrum of the chiral ring by using a semiclassical analysis of the field theory compactified on a two sphere. By properly taking into account the full quantization condition of monopole charges, we show that the moduli space of ABJM theory with Chern-Simons level k, -k is a particular Z_k cover of the symmetric product of C^4/Z_k. We also work out in detail the spectrum of fluctuations around half-BPS monopole configurations and we find candidate states for a dual BPS configuration to the giant torus solution found by Nishioka and Takayanagi in the supergravity limit. We also discuss more general BPS states.
