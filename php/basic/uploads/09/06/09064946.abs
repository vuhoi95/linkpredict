Title: A Special Case Of A Conjecture By Widom With Implications To Fermionic  Entanglement Entropy
Authors: R. C. Helling and H. Leschke and W. L. Spitzer
Abstract: We prove a special case of a conjecture in asymptotic analysis by Harold Widom. More precisely, we establish the leading and next-to-leading term of a semi-classical expansion of the trace of the square of certain integral operators on the Hilbert space $L^2(\R^d)$. As already observed by Gioev and Klich, this implies that the bi-partite entanglement entropy of the free Fermi gas in its ground state grows at least as fast as the surface area of the spatially bounded part times a logarithmic enhancement.
