Authors: Anisur Rahaman and Safia Yasmin and Sahazada Aziz
Abstract: Chiral Schwinger model with the Faddeevian anomaly is considered. It is found that imposing a chiral constraint this model can be expressed in terms of chiral boson. The model when expressed in terms of chiral boson remains anomalous and the Gauss law of which gives anomalous Poisson brackets between itself. In spite of that a systematic BRST quantization is possible. The Wess-Zumino term corresponding to this theory appears automatically during the process of quantization. A gauge invariant reformulation of this model is also constructed. Unlike the former one gauge invariance is done here without any extension of phase space. This gauge invariant version maps onto the vector Schwinger model.The gauge invariant version of the chiral Schwinger model for $a=2$ has a massive field with identical mass however gauge invariant version obtained here does not map on to that.
