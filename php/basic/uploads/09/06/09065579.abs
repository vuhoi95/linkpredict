Title: Negative Even Grade mKdV Hierarchy and its Soliton Solutions
Authors: J. F. Gomes and G. Starvaggi Franca and G. R. de Melo and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: In this paper we provide an algebraic construction for the negative even mKdV hierarchy which gives rise to time evolutions associated to even graded Lie algebraic structure. We propose a modification of the dressing method, in order to incorporate a non-trivial vacuum configuration and construct a deformed vertex operator for $\hat{sl}(2)$, that enable us to obtain explicit and systematic solutions for the whole negative even grade equations.
