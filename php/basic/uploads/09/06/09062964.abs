Title: Holographic model with a NS-NS field
Authors: Yunseok Seo and Sang-jin Sin and Wei-shui Xu
Abstract: We consider a holographic model constructed through using the D4/D8-$\bar{\rm D8}$ brane configuration with a background field. We study some properties of the effective field theory in this intersecting brane construction, and calculate the effects of this NS-NS background field on some underlying dynamics. We also discuss some other general brane configurations.
