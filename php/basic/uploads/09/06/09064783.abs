Title: Bound State Transfer Matrix for AdS5 x S5 Superstring
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Marius de Leeuw and Ryo Suzuki and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We apply the algebraic Bethe ansatz technique to compute the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix constructed from the general bound state S-matrix of the light-cone AdS5 x S5 superstring. This allows us to verify certain conjectures on the quantum characteristic function, and to extend them to the general case.
