Title: Non-relativistic M-Theory solutions based on Kaehler-Einstein spaces
Authors: Eoin 'O Colgain and Oscar Varela and Hossein Yavartanoo
Abstract: We present new families of non-supersymmetric solutions of D=11 supergravity with non-relativistic symmetry, based on six-dimensional Kaehler-Einstein manifolds. In constructing these solutions, we make use of a consistent reduction to a five-dimensional gravity theory coupled to a massive scalar and vector field. This theory admits a non-relativistic CFT dual with dynamical exponent z=4, which may be uplifted to D=11 supergravity. Finally, we generalise this solution and find new solutions with various z, including z=2.
