Title: Wilson Loops from D-branes in AdS(4) X CP**3 with B-NS Holonomy
Authors: J. Kluson and Kamal L. Panigrahi
Abstract: We study Wilson loops in N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $U(M) \times \bar{U(N)}$ that is dual to N M2-branes and (M-N) fractional M2-branes, equivalently, discrete 3-form holonomy at C4/Zk orbifold singularity. We give description of these Wilson loops in terms of macroscopic fundamental string and D6-branes in the dual AdS$_4\times$ CP$^3$ geometry with NS-NS B field turned on over CP$^1 \subset$ CP$^3$.
