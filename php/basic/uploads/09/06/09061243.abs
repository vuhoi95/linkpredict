Title: Boundary conditions for spacelike and timelike warped AdS_3 spaces in  topologically massive gravity
Authors: Geoffrey Compère and Stéphane Detournay
Abstract: We propose a set of consistent boundary conditions containing the spacelike warped black holes solutions of Topologically Massive Gravity. We prove that the corresponding asymptotic charges whose algebra consists in a Virasoro algebra and a current algebra are finite, integrable and conserved. A similar analysis is performed for the timelike warped AdS_3 spaces which contain a family of regular solitons. The energy of the boundary Virasoro excitations is positive while the current algebra leads to negative (for the spacelike warped case) and positive (for the timelike warped case) energy boundary excitations. We discuss the relationship with the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions.
