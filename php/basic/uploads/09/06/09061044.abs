Title: Generalized particle dynamics in anti de Sitter spaces: A source for  dark energy
Authors: Sudipta Das and Subir Ghosh and Jan-Willem van Holten and Supratik Pal
Abstract: We consider the generalized particle dynamics, proposed by us, in brane world formalisms for an asymptotically anti de Sitter background. The present framework results in a new model that accounts for the late acceleration of the universe. An effective Dark Energy equation of state, exhibiting a phantom like behaviour, is generated. The model is derived by embedding the physical FRW universe in a $(4+1)$-dimensional effective space-time, induced by the generalized particle dynamics. We corroborate our results with present day observed cosmological parameters.
