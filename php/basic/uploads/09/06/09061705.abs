Title: Marginal Deformations and 3-Algebra Structures
Authors: Nikolas Akerblom and Christian Saemann and Martin Wolf
Abstract: We study marginal deformations of superconformal Chern-Simons matter theories that are based on 3-algebras. For this, we introduce the notion of an associated 3-product, which captures very general gauge invariant deformations of the superpotentials of the BLG and ABJM models. We also consider conformal multi-trace deformations preserving N=2 supersymmetry. We then use N=2 supergraph techniques to compute the two-loop beta functions of these deformations. Besides confirming conformal invariance of both the BLG and ABJM models, we also verify that the recently proposed beta-deformations of the ABJM model are indeed marginal to the order we are considering.
