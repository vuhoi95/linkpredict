Title: Corrected entropy of high dimensional black holes
Authors: Tao Zhu and Ji-Rong Ren and Ming-Fan Li
Abstract: Using the corrected expression of Hawking temperature derived from the tunneling formalism beyond semiclassical approximation developed by \emph{Banerjee} and \emph{Majhi}\cite{beyond}, we calculate the corrected entropy of a high dimensional Schwarzschild black hole and a 5-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet (GB) black hole. It is shown that the corrected entropy for this two kinds of black hole are in agreement with the corrected entropy formula (\ref{entropy of apparent horiozn}) that derived from tunneling method for a $(n+1)$-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe\cite{FRW}. This feature strongly suggests deep universality of the corrected entropy formula (\ref{entropy of apparent horiozn}), which may not depend on the dimensions of spacetime and gravity theories. In addition, the leading order correction of corrected entropy formula always appears as the logarithmic of the semiclassical entropy, rather than the logarithmic of the area of black hole horizon, this might imply that the logarithmic of the semiclassical entropy is more appropriate for quantum correction than the logarithmic of the area.
