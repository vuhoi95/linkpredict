Title: New family of sine-Gordon models
Authors: D. Bazeia and L. Losano and R. Menezes and M. A. M. Souza
Abstract: This work deals with a new family of models, which includes the sine-Gordon model and the double-sine-Gordon, triple-sine-Gordon and so on. The investigation is based on a deformation procedure, which is used to deform a well-known model, to get to the family of sine-Gordon models. Due to properties of the procedure, we get to the models and find the corresponding solutions explicitly, together with all the important features they engender.
