Title: Spin chain for the deformed ABJM theory
Authors: Davide Forcella and Waldemar Schulgin
Abstract: In this short note we begin the analysis of deformed integrable Chern-Simons theories. We construct the two loop dilatation operator for the scalar sector of the ABJM theory with $k1 \neq -k2$ and we compute the anomalous dimension of some operators.
