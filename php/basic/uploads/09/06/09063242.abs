Title: Bouncing universe and non-BPS branes

Abstract: We describe string frame bouncing universe scenarios involving the creation and annihilation of a non-BPS D9-brane in type IIA superstring theory. We find several classes of solutions, in which the bounce is driven by the tachyon dynamics of the non-BPS brane. The metric and the dilaton are consistently described in terms of the lowest order effective action. The bounce solutions interpolate between contracting and expanding pre-big bang (or post-big bang) solutions. The singular behavior of our bounce solutions is the same as that of the pre-big bang (or post-big bang) solution. Upon adding a simple dilaton potential the asymptotic curvature singularity is removed but the dilaton still grows without bound. Such a potential may result from $\alpha'$ corrections in the open string sector.
