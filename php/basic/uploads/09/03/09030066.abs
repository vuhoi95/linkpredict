Title: Spherically symmetric solutions and gravitational collapse in  brane-worlds
Authors: Malihe Heydari-Fard and Hamid R. Sepangi
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric solutions within the context of brane-world theory without mirror symmetry or any form of junction conditions. For a constant curvature bulk, we obtain the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) interior solutions in two cases where one is matched to a schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior while the other is consistent with an exterior solution whose structure can be used to explain the galaxy rotation curves without postulating dark matter. We also find the upper bound to the mass of a static brane-world star and show that the influence of the bulk effects on the interior solutions is small. Finally, we investigate the gravitational collapse on the brane and show that the exterior of a collapsing star can be static in this scenario.
