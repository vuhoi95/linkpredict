Title: Holographic Hydrodynamics with a Chemical Potential
Authors: Robert C. Myers and Miguel F. Paulos and Aninda Sinha
Abstract: We consider five-dimensional gravity coupled to a negative cosmological constant and a single U(1) gauge field, including a general set of four-derivative interactions. In this framework, we construct charged planar AdS black hole solutions perturbatively and consider the thermal and hydrodynamic properties of the plasma in the dual CFT. In particular, we calculate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density and argue that the violation of the KSS bound is enhanced in the presence of a chemical potential. We also compute the electrical conductivity and comment on various conjectured bounds related to this coefficient.
