Title: Wormhole Solutions in Gauss-Bonnet-Born-Infeld Gravity
Authors: M. H. Dehghani and S. H. Hendi
Abstract: A new class of solutions which yields an $(n+1)$-dimensional spacetime with a longitudinal nonlinear magnetic field is introduced. These spacetimes have no curvature singularity and no horizon, and the magnetic field is non singular in the whole spacetime. They may be interpreted as traversable wormholes which could be supported by matter not violating the weak energy conditions. We generalize this class of solutions to the case of rotating solutions and show that the rotating wormhole solutions have a net electric charge which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameter, while the static wormhole has no net electric charge. Finally, we use the counterterm method and compute the conserved quantities of these spacetimes.
