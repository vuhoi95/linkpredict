Title: Is There an Observable Limit to Lorentz Invariance at the Compton  Wavelength Scale?
Authors: Dinesh Singh and Nader Mobed
Abstract: The possibility of a frame-induced violation of Lorentz invariance due to non-inertial spin-1/2 particle motion is explored in detail for muon decay while in orbit near the event horizon of a microscopic Kerr black hole. It is explicitly shown that kinematic and curvature contributions to the muon's decay spectrum--in the absence of any unforeseen processes due to quantum gravity--lead to its stabilization at the muon's Compton wavelength scale. This example is emblematic of the search for unambiguous indicators to critically assess current and future approaches to quantum gravity research.
