Title: Topological Expansion for the Cauchy two-Matrix-Model
Authors: Marco Bertola and Aleix Prats Ferrer
Abstract: Recently, a two-matrix-model with a new type of interaction [1] has been introduced and analyzed using bi-orthogonal polynomial techniques. Here we present the complete 1/N^2 expansion for the formal version of this model, following the spirit of [2,3], i.e. the full expansion for the non mixed resolvent correlators and for the free energies.
