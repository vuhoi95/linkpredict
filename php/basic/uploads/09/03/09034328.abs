Title: Coupled currents in cosmic strings
Authors: Marc Lilley and Xavier Martin and Patrick Peter
Abstract: We first examine the microstructure of a cosmic string endowed with two simple Abelian currents. This microstructure depends on two state parameters. We then provide the macroscopic description of such a string and show that it depends on an additional Lorentz-invariant state parameter that relates the two currents. We find that in most of the parameter space, the two-current string is essentially equivalent to the single current-carrying string, i.e., only one field condenses onto the defect. In the regions where two currents are present, we find that as far as stability is concerned, one can approximate the dynamics with good accuracy using an analytic model based on either a logarithmic (on the electric side, i.e., for timelike currents) or a rational (on the magnetic side, i.e., for spacelike currents) worldsheet Lagrangian.
