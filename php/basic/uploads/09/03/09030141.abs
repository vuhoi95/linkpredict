Title: Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the AdS_5 x S^5 Mirror Model
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Sergey Frolov
Abstract: We use the string hypothesis for the mirror theory to derive the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for the AdS_5 x S^5 mirror model. We further demonstrate how these equations can be used to construct the associated Y-system recently discussed in the literature, putting particular emphasis on the assumptions and the range of validity of the corresponding construction.
