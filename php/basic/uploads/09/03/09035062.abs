Title: Exact solutions for U(1) globally invariant membranes
Authors: M. Trzetrzelewski and A. A. Zheltukhin
Abstract: The exact solvability problem of the nonlinear equations describing the U(1) invariant membranes is studied and the general solution for the static membrane in D=2N+1-dimensional Minkowski space-time, including M-theory case D=11, is obtained. The time-dependent Jacobi elliptic function solution describing a family of contracting tori is also found, together with the solution corresponding to a spinning torus characterized by the presence of the critical rotation frequency Omega=T^{1/3}/pi^{1/2} expressed via the membrane tension T.
