Title: Conformal invariant interaction of a scalar field with the higher spin  field in AdS_{D}
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Karapet Mkrtchyan
Abstract: The explicit form of linearized gauge invariant interactions of scalar and general higher even spin fields in the $AdS_{D}$ space is obtained. In the case of general spin $\ell$ a generalized 'Weyl' transformation is proposed and the corresponding 'Weyl' invariant action is constructed. In both cases the invariant actions of the interacting higher even spin gauge field and the scalar field include the whole tower of invariant actions for couplings of the same scalar with all gauge fields of smaller even spin. For the particular value of $\ell=4$ all results are in exact agreement with hep-th/0403241
