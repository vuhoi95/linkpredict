Title: Natural inflation mechanism in asymptotic noncommutative geometry
Authors: William Nelson and Mairi Sakellariadou
Abstract: The possibility of having an inflationary epoch within a noncommutative geometry approach to unifying gravity and the standard model is demonstrated. This inflationary phase occurs without the need to introduce "ad hoc" additional fields or potentials, rather it is a consequence of a nonminimal coupling between the geometry and the Higgs field.
