Title: Three loop MSbar anomalous dimension for renormalizable gauge invariant  non-local gluon mass operator in QCD
Authors: F. R. Ford and J. A. Gracey
Abstract: The three loop anomalous dimension for the gauge invariant, renormalizable, non-local mass operator for a gluon is computed in the MSbar scheme. In addition the anomalous dimensions of the associated localizing ghost fields are also deduced at the same order and it is shown that the three loop QCD beta-function correctly emerges from the gluon localizing ghost vertex renormalization.
