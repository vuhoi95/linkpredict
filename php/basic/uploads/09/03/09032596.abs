Title: Real-time response in AdS/CFT with application to spinors
Authors: Nabil Iqbal and Hong Liu
Abstract: We discuss a simple derivation of the real-time AdS/CFT prescription as an analytic continuation of the corresponding problem in Euclidean signature. We then extend the formalism to spinor operators and apply it to the examples of real-time fermionic correlators in CFTs dual to pure AdS and the BTZ black hole.
