Title: On Representations and Correlation Functions of Galilean Conformal  Algebras
Authors: Arjun Bagchi and Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: Galilean Conformal Algebras (GCA) have been recently proposed as a different non-relativistic limit of the AdS/CFT conjecture. In this note, we look at the representations of the GCA. We also construct explicitly the two and three point correlators in this non-relativistic limit of CFT and comment on the differences with the relativistic case and also the more studied Schrodinger group.
