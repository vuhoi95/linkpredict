Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Vilar et al. arXiv:0902.2956 we enhance our non-commutative translation invariant gauge model arXiv:0901.1681 by introducing auxiliary fields and ghosts forming a BRST doublet structure. In this way localization of the problematic 1/D^2 term can be achieved without the necessity for any additional degrees of freedom. The resulting theory is suspected to be renormalizable. A rigorous proof, however, has not been accomplished up to now.
