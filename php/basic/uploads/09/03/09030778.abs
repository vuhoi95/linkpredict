Title: On the wrapping correction to single magnon energy in twisted N=4 SYM
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Gian Fabrizio De Angelis
Abstract: We apply Zeilberger summation to derive a closed formula for the wrapping correction to one-impurity states in the su(2) sector of the beta-deformed N=4 SYM theory at beta=1/2. As an application depending heavily on the result, we compute the large volume expansion of the wrapping correction.
