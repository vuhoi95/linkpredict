Title: Acceleration and Energy Loss in N=4 SYM
Authors: Mariano Chernicoff and Alberto Guijosa
Abstract: We give a brief overview of the results obtained in arXiv:0803.3070, concerning the rate of energy loss of an accelerating quark in strongly-coupled N=4 super-Yang-Mills, both at zero and finite temperature. For phenomenological purposes, our main result is that, when a quark is created within the plasma together with its corresponding antiquark, the quark starts feeling the plasma only after the q-\bar{q} separation becomes larger than the (v-dependent) screening length, and from this point on the motion is correctly described by the analytic energy loss formula previously derived by Herzog et al. and Gubser within the stationary or late-time approximations. The present text is a slightly expanded version of two talks given at the XIII Mexican School of Particles and Fields in October 2008.
