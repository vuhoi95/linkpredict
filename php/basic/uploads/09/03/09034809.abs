Title: A Quantum Goldman Bracket for Loops on Surfaces
Authors: J. E. Nelson and R. F. Picken
Abstract: In the context of (2+1)--dimensional gravity, we use holonomies of constant connections which generate a $q$--deformed representation of the fundamental group to derive signed area phases which relate the quantum matrices assigned to homotopic loops. We use these features to determine a quantum Goldman bracket (commutator) for intersecting loops on surfaces, and discuss the resulting quantum geometry.
