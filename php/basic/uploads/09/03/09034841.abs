Title: Mass-spin relation for quark anti-quark bound states in non-commutative  Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Sheikh Shajidul Haque and Akikazu Hashimoto
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between mass and spin of quark anti-quark bound state in non-commutative gauge theory with N=4 supersymmetry. In the large N and large 't Hooft coupling limit, these bound states correspond to rotating open strings ending on a D-brane embedded into the supergravity background dual of the non-commutative field theory. Although the physical configuration of the open strings are drastically deformed by the non-commutativity, we find that the relation between the energy and the angular momentum of the bound state is unaffected by the non-commutativity parameter. We also clarify the holographic interpretation of quark anti-quark potential in non-commutative gauge theories.
