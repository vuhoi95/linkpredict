Abstract: The problem of neutrino spin rotation in dense matter and in strong electromagnetic fields is solved in accordance with the basic principles of quantum mechanics. We obtain a complete system of wave functions for a massive Dirac neutrino with an anomalous magnetic moment which are the eigenfunctions of the kinetic momentum operator and have the form of nonspreading wave packets. These wave functions enable one to consider the states of neutrino with rotating spin as pure quantum states and can be used for calculating probabilities of various processes with the neutrino in the framework of the Furry picture.
