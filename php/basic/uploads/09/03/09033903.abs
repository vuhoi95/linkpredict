Title: Higher-loop amplitudes in the non-minimal pure spinor formalism
Authors: Pietro Antonio Grassi and Pierre Vanhove
Abstract: We analyze the properties of the non-minimal pure spinor formalism. We show that Siegel gauge on massless vertex operators implies the primary field constraint and the level-matching condition in closed string theory by reconstructing the integrated vertex operator representation from the unintegrated ones. The pure spinor integration in the non-minimal formalism needs a regularisation. To this end we introduce a new regulator for the pure spinor integration and an extension of the regulator to allow for the saturation of the fermionic d-zero modes to all orders in perturbation. We conclude with a preliminary analysis of the properties of the four-graviton amplitude to all genus order.
