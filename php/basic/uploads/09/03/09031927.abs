Title: On the effective action of confining strings
Authors: Ofer Aharony and Eyal Karzbrun
Abstract: We study the low-energy effective action on confining strings (in the fundamental representation) in SU(N) gauge theories in D space-time dimensions. We write this action in terms of the physical transverse fluctuations of the string. We show that for any D, the four-derivative terms in the effective action must exactly match the ones in the Nambu-Goto action, generalizing a result of Luscher and Weisz for D=3. We then analyze the six-derivative terms, and we show that some of these terms are constrained. For D=3 this uniquely determines the effective action for closed strings to this order, while for D>3 one term is not uniquely determined by our considerations. This implies that for D=3 the energy levels of a closed string of length L agree with the Nambu-Goto result at least up to order 1/L^5. For any D we find that the partition function of a long string on a torus is unaffected by the free coefficient, so it is always equal to the Nambu-Goto partition function up to six-derivative order. For a closed string of length L, this means that for D>3 its energy can, in principle, deviate from the Nambu-Goto result at order 1/L^5, but such deviations must always cancel in the computation of the partition function. Next, we compute the effective action up to six-derivative order for the special case of confining strings in weakly-curved holographic backgrounds, at one-loop order (leading order in the curvature). Our computation is general, and applies in particular to backgrounds like the Witten background, the Maldacena-Nunez background, and the Klebanov-Strassler background. We show that this effective action obeys all of the constraints we derive, and in fact it precisely agrees with the Nambu-Goto action (the single allowed deviation does not appear).
