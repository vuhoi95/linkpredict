Title: Non-relativistic scattering of a spin-1/2 particle off a self-dual  monopole
Authors: L. Feher and P. A. Horvathy
Abstract: The non-relativistic scattering of a spin-1/2 particle off a self-dual monopole reduces, for large distances, to the dyon problem, studied previously by D'Hoker and Vinet. The S matrix (calculated by Zwanziger's algebraic method based on the o(3,1)\oplus o(3) dynamical symmetry, discovered by D'Hoker and Vinet) is shown to factorize into the product of the spinless S-matrix, S_0, with a spin-dependent factor. The total cross-section is identical to the one found in the spinless case.
