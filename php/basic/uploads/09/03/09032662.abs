Title: Model Independent Tests of Skyrmions and Their Holographic Cousins
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and Thomas D. Cohen and Marina Nielsen
Abstract: We describe a new exact relation for large $N_c$ QCD for the long-distance behavior of baryon form factors in the chiral limit. This model-independent relation is used to test the consistency of the structure of several baryon models. All 4D semiclassical chiral soliton models satisfy the relation, as does the Pomarol-Wulzer holographic model of baryons as 5D Skyrmions. However, remarkably, we find that the holographic model treating baryons as instantons in the Sakai-Sugimoto model does not satisfy the relation.
