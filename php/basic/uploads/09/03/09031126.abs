Title: On the Structure of Infrared Singularities of Gauge-Theory Amplitudes
Authors: Thomas Becher and Matthias Neubert
Abstract: A closed formula is obtained for the infrared singularities of dimensionally regularized, massless gauge-theory scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary number of legs and loops. It follows from an all-order conjecture for the anomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators in soft-collinear effective theory. We show that the form of this anomalous dimension is severely constrained by soft-collinear factorization, non-abelian exponentiation, and the behavior of amplitudes in collinear limits. Using a diagrammatic analysis, we demonstrate that these constraints imply that to three-loop order the anomalous dimension involves only two-parton correlations, with the possible exception of a single color structure multiplying a function of conformal cross ratios depending on the momenta of four external partons, which would have to vanish in all two-particle collinear limits. We argue that such a function does not appear at three-loop order, and that the same is true in higher orders. Our formula predicts Casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension to all orders in perturbation theory, and we explicitly check that the constraints exclude the appearance of higher Casimir invariants at four loops. Using known results for the quark and gluon form factors, we derive the three-loop coefficients of the 1/epsilon^n pole terms (with n=1,...,6) for an arbitrary n-parton scattering amplitude in massless QCD. This generalizes Catani's two-loop formula proposed in 1998.
