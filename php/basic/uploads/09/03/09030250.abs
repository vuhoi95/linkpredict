Title: Hawking black body spectrum from tunneling mechanism
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Bibhas Ranjan Majhi
Abstract: We obtain, using a reformulation of the tunneling mechanism, the Hawking black body spectrum with the appropriate temperature for a black hole. This is a new result in the tunneling formalism of discussing Hawking effect. Our results are given for a spherically symmetric geometry that is asymptotically flat.
