Abstract: In this paper we study the deformed statistics and oscillator algebras of quantum fields defined in $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. The twisted flip operator obtained from the twist associated with the star product requires an enlargement of the Poincar\'e algebra to include the dilatation generators. Here we propose a novel notion of a fully covariant flip operator and show that to the first order in the deformation parameter it can be expressed completely in terms of the Poincar\'e generators alone. The $R$-matrices corresponding to the twisted and the covariant flip operators are compared up to first order in the deformation parameter and they are shown to be different. We also construct the deformed algebra of the creation and annihilation operators that arise in the mode expansion of a scalar field in $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. We obtain a large class of such new deformed algebras which, for certain choice of realizations, reduce to results known in the literature.
