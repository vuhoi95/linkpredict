Title: On Alphabetic Presentations of Clifford Algebras and Their Possible  Applications
Authors: Francesco Toppan and Piet W. Verbeek
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of constructing a class of representations of Clifford algebras that can be named "alphabetic (re)presentations". The Clifford algebras generators are expressed as m-letter words written with a 3-character or a 4-character alphabet. We formulate the problem of the alphabetic presentations, deriving the main properties and some general results. At the end we briefly discuss the motivations of this work and outline some possible applications.
