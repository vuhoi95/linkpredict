Title: Universal Hubbard models with arbitrary symmetry
Authors: G. Feverati and L. Frappat and E. Ragoucy
Abstract: We propose a general framework that leads to one-dimensional XX and Hubbard models in full generality, based on the decomposition of an arbitrary vector space (possibly infinite dimensional) into a direct sum of two subspaces, the two corresponding orthogonal projectors allowing one to define a R-matrix of a universal XX model, and then of a Hubbard model using a Shastry type construction. The QISM approach ensures integrability of the models, the properties of the obtained R-matrices leading to local Hubbard-like Hamiltonians. In all cases, the energies, the symmetry algebras and the scattering matrices are explicitly determined. The computation of the Bethe Ansatz equations for some subsectors of the universal Hubbard theories are determined, while they are fully computed in the XX case. A perturbative calculation in the large coupling regime is also done for the universal Hubbard models.
