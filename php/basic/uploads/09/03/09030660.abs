Title: Dark Matter via Many Copies of the Standard Model
Authors: Gia Dvali and Ignacy Sawicki and Alexander Vikman
Abstract: We propose a cosmological scenario based on the assumption that the Standard Model possesses a large number of copies. It is demonstrated that baryons in the hidden copies of the standard model can naturally account for the dark matter. The right abundance of the hidden-sector baryons and the correct spectrum of density perturbations are simultaneously generated during modulated reheating. We show that for the natural values of inflaton coupling constants, dictated by unitarity, the dark-matter abundance is predicted to be proportional to the ratio of observed cosmological parameters: the square of the amplitude of cosmological perturbations and the baryon-to-photon number ratio.
