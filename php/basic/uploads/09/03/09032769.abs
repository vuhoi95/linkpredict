Title: Gravitational waves from p-form inflation
Authors: Tsutomu Kobayashi and Shuichiro Yokoyama
Abstract: Recently it was shown that an inflationary background can be realized by any $p$-form field non-minimally coupled to gravity. In this paper, we study gravitational waves generated during p-form inflation. Even though the background evolution is identical to that in conventional scalar field inflation, the behavior of gravitational waves is different in p-form inflation. In particular, we find that the propagation speed of gravitational waves differs from unity in 2- and 3-form inflationary models. We point out that the squared speed becomes negative in the large field models. The small field models are free from pathologies and the correction to the spectrum of gravitational waves turns out to be very small.
