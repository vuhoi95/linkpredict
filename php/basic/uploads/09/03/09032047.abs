Title: Generalized Lorentz-Dirac Equation for a Strongly-Coupled Gauge Theory
Authors: Mariano Chernicoff and J. Antonio Garcia and Alberto Guijosa
Abstract: We derive a semiclassical equation of motion for a `composite' quark in strongly-coupled large-N_c N=4 super-Yang-Mills, making use of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The resulting non-linear equation incorporates radiation damping, and reduces to the standard Lorentz-Dirac equation for external forces that are small on the scale of the quark Compton wavelength, but has no self-accelerating or pre-accelerating solutions. From this equation one can read off a non-standard dispersion relation for the quark, as well as a Lorentz covariant formula for its radiation rate.
