Title: Off-shell construction of some trilinear higher spin gauge field  interactions
Authors: Ruben Manvelyan and Karapet Mkrtchyan and Werner Ruehl
Abstract: Several trilinear interactions of higher spin fields involving two equal ($s=s_{1}=s_{2}$) and one higher even ($s_{3}\geq 2s$) spin are presented. Interactions are constructed on the Lagrangian level using Noether's procedure together with the corresponding next to free level fields of the gauge transformations. In certain cases when the number of derivatives in the transformation is $2s-1$ the interactions lead to the currents constructed from the generalization of the gravitational Bell-Robinson tensors. In other cases when the number of derivatives in the transformation is more than $2s-1$ we obtain the finite tower of interactions with smaller even spins less than $s_{3}$ in full agreement with our previous results for the interaction of the higher even spins field with a conformal scalar [1,2].
