Title: MSSM-like AdS Flux Vacua with Frozen Open-string Moduli
Authors: Ching-Ming Chen and Tianjun Li and Van Eric Mayes and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric Pati-Salam flux vacua in AdS from intersecting D6-branes on T^6/(Z_2 x Z_2'). The models constructed have three generations of MSSM matter plus right-handed neutrinos. Because the cycles wrapped by the D-branes are rigid there are no extra massless fields in the adjoint representation, arising as open-string moduli. However, we find that it is problematic to break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry to the Standard Model (SM) while keeping the SM hypercharge massless.
