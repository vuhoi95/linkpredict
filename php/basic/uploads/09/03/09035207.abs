Abstract: Motivated by the interest raised by the problem of Lorenz-symmetry violating gauge theories in connetion with gravity models, this contribution sets out to provide a general method to systematically study the excitation spectrum of gravity actions which include a Lorentz-symmetry breaking Chern-Simons-type action term for the spin connection. A complete set of spin-type operators is found which accounts for the (Lorentz) violation parameter to all orders and graviton propagators are worked out in a number of different situations.
