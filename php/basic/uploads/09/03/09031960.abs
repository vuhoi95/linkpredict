Title: Conformal Tightness of Holographic Scaling in Black Hole Thermodynamics
Authors: Horacio E. Camblong and Carlos R. Ordonez
Abstract: The near-horizon conformal symmetry of nonextremal black holes is shown to be a mandatory ingredient for the holographic scaling of the scalar-field contribution to the black hole entropy. This conformal tightness is revealed by semiclassical first-principle scaling arguments through an analysis of the multiplicative factors in the entropy due to the radial and angular degrees of freedom associated with a scalar field. Specifically, the conformal SO(2,1) invariance of the radial degree of freedom conspires with the area proportionality of the angular momentum sums to yield a robust holographic outcome.
