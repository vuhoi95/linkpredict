Title: A note on the holography of Chern-Simons matter theories with flavour
Authors: Stefan Hohenegger and Ingo Kirsch
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional N=3 U(N)_k x U(N)_{-k} Chern-Simons matter theory with flavour, corresponding to the N=6 Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena CSM theory coupled to 2N_f fundamental fields. The dual holographic description is given by the near-horizon geometry of N M2-branes at a particular hypertoric geometry M_8. We explicitly construct the space M_8 and match its isometries to the global symmetries of the field theory. We also discuss the model in the quenched approximation by embedding probe D6-branes in AdS_4 x CP^3.
