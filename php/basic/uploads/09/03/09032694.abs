Title: A Fluid Analog Model for Boundary Effects in Field Theory
Authors: L. H. Ford and N. F. Svaiter
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in the density of a fluid with a linear phonon dispersion relation are studied. In particular, we treat the changes in these fluctuations due to non-classical states of phonons and to the presence of boundaries. These effects are analogous to similar effects in relativistic quantum field theory, and we argue that the case of the fluid is a useful analog model for effects in field theory. We further argue that the changes in the mean squared density are in principle observable by light scattering experiments.
