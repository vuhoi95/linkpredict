Title: Non-Quadratic Gauge Fixing and Global Gauge Invariance in the Effective  Action
Authors: F. T. Brandt and D. G. C. McKeon
Abstract: The possibility of having a gauge fixing term in the effective Lagrangian that is not a quadratic expression has been explored in spin-two theories so as to have a propagator that is both traceless and transverse. We first show how this same approach can be used in spontaneously broken gauge theories as an alternate to the 't Hooft gauge fixing which avoids terms quadratic in the scalar fields. This "non-quadratic" gauge fixing in the effective action results in there being two complex Fermionic and one real Bosonic ghost fields. A global gauge invariance involving a Fermionic gauge parameter, analogous to the usual BRST invariance, is present in this effective action.
