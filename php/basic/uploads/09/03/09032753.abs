Abstract: The future finite-time singularities emerging in alternative gravity dark energy models are classified and studied in Jordan and Einstein frames. It is shown that such singularity may occur even in flat spacetime for the specific choice of the effective potential. The conditions for the avoidance of finite-time singularities are presented and discussed. The problem is reduced to the study of a scalar field evolving on an effective potential by using the conformal transformations. Some viable modified gravity models are analyzed in detail and the way to cure singularity is considered by introducing the higher-order curvature corrections. These results maybe relevant for the resolution of the conjectured problem in the relativistic star formation in such modified gravity where finite-time singularity is also manifested.
