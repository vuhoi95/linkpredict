Title: Note on New Massive Gravity in $AdS_3$
Authors: Yan Liu and Ya-Wen Sun
Abstract: In this note we study the properties of linearized gravitational excitations in the new massive gravity theory in asymptotically $AdS_3$ spacetime and find that there is also a critical point for the mass parameter at which massive gravitons become massless as in topological massive gravity in $AdS_3$. However, at this critical point in the new massive gravity the energy of all branches of highest weight gravitons vanish and the central charges also vanish within the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions. The new massive gravity in asymptotically $AdS_3$ spacetime seems to be trivial at this critical point under the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions if the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions can be consistent with this theory. At this point, the boundary conditions of log gravity may be preferred.
