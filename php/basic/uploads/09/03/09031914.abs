Title: Probabilistic Evolutionary Process: a possible solution to the problem  of time in quantum cosmology and creation from nothing
Authors: N. Khosravi and H. R. Sepangi
Abstract: We present a method, which we shall call the probabilistic evolutionary process, based on the probabilistic nature of quantum theory to offer a possible solution to the problem of time in quantum cosmology. It offers an alternative for perceiving an arrow of time which is compatible with the thermodynamical arrow of time and makes a new interpretation of the FRW universe in vacua which is consistent with creation of a de Sitter space-time from nothing. This is a completely quantum result with no correspondence in classical cosmology.
