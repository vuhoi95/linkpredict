Title: Stringy WIMP Detection and Annihilation
Authors: James A. Maxin and Van E. Mayes and Dimitri V. Nanopoulos
Abstract: We calculate the direct dark matter detection spin-independent and proton spin-dependent cross-sections for a semi-realistic intersecting D6-brane model. The cross-sections are compared to the latest constraints of the current dark matter direct detection experiments, as well as the projected results of future dark matter experiments. The allowed parameter space of the intersecting D6-brane model is shown with all current experimental constraints, including those regions satisfying the WMAP and Supercritical String Cosmology (SSC) limits on the dark matter density in the universe. Additionally, we compute the indirect detection gamma-ray flux resulting from neutralino annihilation for the D6-brane model and compare the flux to the projected sensitivity of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Finally, we compute the direct and indirect detection cross-sections as well as the gamma-ray flux resulting from WIMP annihilations for the one-parameter model for comparison, where the one-parameter model is a highly constrained subset of the mSUGRA parameter space such that the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are functions of the common gaugino mass, which is common to many string compactifications.
