Title: Inflation from N-Forms and its stability
Authors: Tomi S. Koivisto and David F. Mota and Cyril Pitrou
Abstract: Anisotropic and isotropic slow-roll inflation supported by n-forms are sought. Canonical field strengths and their duals are taken into account, and they are allowed to have a potential and also, when necessary for slow-roll, a nonminimal curvature coupling. New isotropic solutions are found for three-forms. It is also shown that some n-form actions are equivalent to f(R) gravity and scalar field models with possible nonminimal couplings. Anisotropic solutions are found for two-forms, generalising vector inflation, however, also the two-form is unstable during inflation due to the nonminimal coupling to curvature. We also address the stability of the isotropic background solutions supported by a triad of vectors .
