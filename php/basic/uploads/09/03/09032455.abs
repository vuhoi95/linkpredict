Title: Correlation Functions in Non-Relativistic Holography
Authors: Anastasia Volovich and Congkao Wen
Abstract: Recently constructed gravity solutions with Schrodinger symmetry provide a new example of AdS/CFT-type dualities for the type of non-relativistic field theories relevant to certain cold atom systems. In this paper we use the gravity side to calculate n-point correlation functions of scalar fields by reducing the computation to that in ordinary AdS space via a particular Fourier transform. We evaluate the relevant integrals for 3- and 4-point functions and show that the results are consistent with the requirements of Schrodinger invariance, the implications of which we also work out for general n-point functions.
