Title: Differential Structure on kappa-Minkowski Spacetime Realized as Module  of Twisted Weyl Algebra
Authors: Jong-Geon Bu and Jae Hyung Yee and Hyeong-Chan Kim
Abstract: The differential structure on the kappa-Minkowski spacetime from Jordanian twist of Weyl algebra is constructed, and it is shown to be closed in 4-dimensions in contrast to the conventional formulation. Based on this differential structure, we have formulated a scalar field theory in this kappa-Minkowski spacetime.
