Title: Equivalence between domain-walls and "noncommutative" two-sheeted  spacetimes: Model-independent matter swapping between branes
Authors: Michael Sarrazin and Fabrice Petit
Abstract: We report a mathematical equivalence between certain models of universe relying on domain-walls and noncommutative geometries. It is shown that a two-brane world made of two domain-walls can be seen as a "noncommutative" two-sheeted spacetime under certain assumptions. This equivalence also implies a model-independent phenomenology which is presently studied. Matter swapping between the two branes (or sheets) is predicted through fermionic oscillations induced by magnetic vector potentials. This phenomenon, which might be experimentally studied, could reveal the existence of extra dimensions in a new and accessible way.
