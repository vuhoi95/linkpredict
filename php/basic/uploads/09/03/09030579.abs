Title: A Class of Mixed Integrable Models
Authors: J. F. Gomes and G. R. de Melo and A. H. Zimerman
Abstract: The algebraic structure of the integrable mixed mKdV/sinh-Gordon model is discussed and \textit{}extended to the AKNS/Lund-Regge model and to its corresponding supersymmetric versions. The integrability of the models is guaranteed from the zero curvature representation and some soliton solutions are discussed.
