Title: Chern-Simons S-Brane Solutions in M-theory and Accelerating Cosmologies
Authors: Nihat Sadik Deger and Ali Kaya
Abstract: We construct an intersecting S-brane solution of 11-dimensional supergravity for which the contribution of the Chern-Simons term to the field equations is non-zero. After studying some of its properties, we consider three different compactifications (each with 3 separate subcases) of this system to 4-dimensions. Two of these give accelerating cosmologies, however their expansion factors are of order unity. We also find two static versions of this configuration and its dimensional reduction to type IIA theory.
