Title: Thermodynamic and dynamical stability of Freund-Rubin compactification
Authors: Shunichiro Kinoshita and Shinji Mukohyama
Abstract: We investigate stability of two branches of Freund-Rubin compactification from thermodynamic and dynamical perspectives. Freund-Rubin compactification allows not only trivial solutions but also warped solutions describing warped product of external de Sitter space and internal deformed sphere. We study dynamical stability by analyzing linear perturbations around solutions in each branch. Also we study thermodynamic stability based on de Sitter entropy. We show complete agreement of thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities of this system. Finally, we interpret the results in terms of effective energy density in the four-dimensional Einstein frame and discuss cosmological implications.
