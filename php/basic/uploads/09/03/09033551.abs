Title: Anti-selfdual Connections on the Quantum Projective Plane: Monopoles
Authors: Francesco D'Andrea and Giovanni Landi
Abstract: We present several results on the geometry of the quantum projective plane CP2q. They include: explicit generators for the K-theory and the K-homology; a real calculus with a Hodge star operator; anti-selfdual connections on line bundles with explicit computation of the corresponding 'monopoles' and 'instanton' charges; complete diagonalization of gauged Laplacians on these line bundles; quantum invariants via equivariant K-theory and q-indices.
