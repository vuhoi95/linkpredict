Abstract: We present a simple lattice formulation of two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ $U(k)$ supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with $N$ matter multiplets in the fundamental representation. The construction uses compact gauge link variables and exactly preserves one linear combination of supercharges on the two-dimensional regular lattice. Artificial saddle points in the weak coupling limit and the species doubling are evaded without imposing the admissibility. A perturbative power-counting argument indicates that the target supersymmetric theory is realized in the continuum limit without any fine tuning.
