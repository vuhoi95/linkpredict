Title: The superspin approach to a disordered quantum wire in the  chiral-unitary symmetry class with an arbitrary number of channels
Authors: Andreas P. Schnyder and Christopher Mudry and Ilya A. Gruzberg
Abstract: We use a superspin Hamiltonian defined on an infinite-dimensional Fock space with positive definite scalar product to study localization and delocalization of noninteracting spinless quasiparticles in quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires perturbed by weak quenched disorder. Past works using this approach have considered a single chain. Here, we extend the formalism to treat a quasi-one-dimensional system: a quantum wire with an arbitrary number of channels coupled by random hopping amplitudes. The computations are carried out explicitly for the case of a chiral quasi-one-dimensional wire with broken time-reversal symmetry (chiral-unitary symmetry class). By treating the space direction along the chains as imaginary time, the effects of the disorder are encoded in the time evolution induced by a single site superspin (non-Hermitian) Hamiltonian. We obtain the density of states near the band center of an infinitely long quantum wire. Our results agree with those based on the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar equation for the chiral-unitary symmetry class.
