Title: Non-Gaussianity in a Matter Bounce
Authors: Yi-Fu Cai and Wei Xue and Robert Brandenberger and Xinmin Zhang
Abstract: A nonsingular bouncing cosmology in which the scales of interest today exit the Hubble radius in a matter-dominated contracting phase yields an alternative to inflation for producing a scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic cosmological fluctuations. In this paper we identify signatures in the non-Gaussianities of the fluctuations which are specific to this scenario and allow it to be distinguished from the results of inflationary models.
