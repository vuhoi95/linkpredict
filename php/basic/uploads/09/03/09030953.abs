Title: Radiation of scalar oscillons in 2 and 3 dimensions
Authors: Gyula Fodor and Péter Forgács and Zalán Horváth and Márk Mezei
Abstract: The radiation loss of small-amplitude radially symmetric oscillons (long-living, spatially localized, time-dependent solutions) in two- and three-dimensional scalar field theories is computed analytically in the small-amplitude expansion. The amplitude of the radiation is beyond all orders in perturbation theory and it is determined using matched asymptotic series expansions and Borel summation. The general results are illustrated on the case of the two- and three-dimensional sine-Gordon theory and a two-dimensional $\phi^6$ model. The analytic predictions are found to be in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations of oscillons.
