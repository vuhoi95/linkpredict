Title: Shear Viscosity to Entropy Density Ratio in Six Derivative Gravity
Authors: Nabamita Banerjee and Suvankar Dutta
Abstract: We calculate shear viscosity to entropy density ratio in presence of four derivative (with coefficient $\alpha'$) and six derivative (with coefficient $\alpha'^2$) terms in bulk action. In general, there can be three possible four derivative terms and ten possible six derivative terms in the Lagrangian. Among them two four derivative and eight six derivative terms are ambiguous, i.e., these terms can be removed from the action by suitable field redefinitions. Rest are unambiguous. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence all the unambiguous coefficients (coefficients of unambiguous terms) can be fixed in terms of field theory parameters. Therefore, any measurable quantities of boundary theory, for example shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, when calculated holographically can be expressed in terms of unambiguous coefficients in the bulk theory (or equivalently in terms of boundary parameters). We calculate $\eta/s$ for generic six derivative gravity and find that apparently it depends on few ambiguous coefficients at order $\alpha'^2$. We calculate six derivative corrections to central charges $a$ and $c$ and express $\eta/s$ in terms of these central charges and unambiguous coefficients in the bulk theory.
