Title: Cosmological solutions of emergent noncommutative gravity
Authors: Daniela Klammer and Harold Steinacker
Abstract: Matrix models of Yang-Mills type lead to an emergent gravity theory, which may not require fine-tuning of a cosmological constant. We find cosmological solutions of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker type. They generically have a big bounce, and an early inflation-like phase with graceful exit. The mechanism is purely geometrical, no ad-hoc scalar fields are introduced. The solutions are stabilized through vacuum fluctuations and are thus compatible with quantum mechanics. This leads to a Milne-like universe after inflation, which appears to be in remarkably good agreement with observation and may provide an alternative to standard cosmology.
