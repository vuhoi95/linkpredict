Title: Self-dual solutions of Yang-Mills theory on Euclidean AdS space
Authors: Ozgur Sarioglu and Bayram Tekin
Abstract: We find non-trivial, time-dependent solutions of the (anti) self-dual Yang-Mills equations in the four dimensional Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space. In contrast to the Euclidean flat space, the action depends on the moduli parameters and the charge can take any non-integer value.
