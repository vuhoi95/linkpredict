Title: Comments on Galilean conformal field theories and their geometric  realization
Authors: Dario Martelli and Yuji Tachikawa
Abstract: We discuss non-relativistic conformal algebras generalizing the Schr\"odinger algebra. One instance of these algebras is a conformal, acceleration-extended, Galilei algebra, which arises also as a contraction of the relativistic conformal algebra. In two dimensions, this admits an "exotic" central extension, whereby boosts do not commute. We study general properties of non-relativistic conformal field theories with such symmetry. We realize geometrically the symmetry in terms of a metric invariant under the exotic conformal Galilei algebra, although its signature is neither Lorentzian nor Euclidean. We comment on holographic-type calculations in this background.
