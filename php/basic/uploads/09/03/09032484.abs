Title: Non-Fermi liquid properties of 2d symplectic fermions: the role of a  dynamically generated (pseudo)-gap
Authors: Eliot Kapit and Andr√© LeClair
Abstract: The interacting symplectic fermion model in two spatial dimensions is further analyzed. As an effective low energy theory, the model is unitary. We show that a relativistic mass m is dynamically generated and derive a gap equation for it. By incorporating a finite temperature we study some fundamental properties of the model, such as the specific heat and spin response, which clearly show non-Fermi liquid properties. We find that various physical properties are suppressed at temperatures T< T* where the cross-over scale is T* = m. As a simplified, toy model of high Tc superconductivity, we thus identify the pseudogap energy scale with the zero temperature relativistic mass m, and show that this reproduces some qualitative aspects of the observed phenomenology of the pseudogap. The effects of the pseudogap and finite temperature on the d-wave gap equation are analyzed. In this model, the pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon from superconductivity and in fact competes with it. Our analysis of Tc suggests that the quantum critical point of our model, where the pseudogap vanishes, occurs inside the superconducting dome near optimal doping. For an antiferromagnetic exchange energy of J/k_B ~ 1350K, solutions of the d-wave gap equation give a maximum Tc of about 110K.
