Title: Classical and Quantal Ternary Algebras
Authors: Thomas Curtright and David Fairlie and Xiang Jin and Luca Mezincescu and Cosmas Zachos
Abstract: We consider several ternary algebras relevant to physics. We compare and contrast the quantal versions of the algebras, as realized through associative products of operators, with their classical counterparts, as realized through classical Nambu brackets. In some cases involving infinite algebras, we show the classical limit may be obtained by a contraction of the quantal algebra, and then explicitly realized through classical brackets. We illustrate this classical-contraction method by the Virasoro-Witt example.
