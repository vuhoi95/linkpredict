Title: Once again on thin-shell wormholes in scalar-tensor gravity
Authors: Kirill A. Bronnikov and Alexei A. Starobinsky
Abstract: It is proved that all thin-shell wormholes built from two identical regions of vacuum static, spherically symmetric space-times have a negative shell surface energy density in any scalar-tensor theory of gravity with a non-ghost massless scalar field and a non-ghost graviton.
