Title: Lumps of plasma in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya and Subhaneil Lahiri
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence in a regime in which the field theory reduces to fluid dynamics to construct an infinite class of new black objects in Scherk-Schwarz compactified AdS(d+2) space. Our configurations are dual to black objects that generalize black rings and have horizon topology S^(d-n) x T^n, for n less than or equal to (d-1)/2. Locally our fluid configurations are plasma sheets that curve around into tori whose radii are large compared to the thickness of the sheets (the ratio of these radii constitutes a small parameter that permits the perturbative construction of these configurations). These toroidal configurations are stabilized by angular momentum. We study solutions whose dual horizon topologies are S^3 x S^1, S^4 x S^1 and S^3 x T^2 in detail; in particular we investigate the thermodynamic properties of these objects. We also present a formal general construction of the most general stationary configuration of fluids with boundaries that solve the d-dimensional relativistic Navier-Stokes equation.
