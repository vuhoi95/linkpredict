Title: A holographic perspective on non-relativistic conformal defects
Authors: Andreas Karch and Piotr Surowka and Ethan G. Thompson
Abstract: We study defects in non-relativistic conformal field theories. As in the well-studied case of relativistic conformal defects, we find that a useful tool to organize correlation functions is the defect operator expansion (dOPE). We analyze how the dOPE is implemented in theories with a holographic dual, highlighting some interesting aspects of the operator/state mapping in non-relativistic holography.
