Title: Higher Order Couplings in Magnetized Brane Models
Authors: Hiroyuki Abe and Kang-Sin Choi and Tatsuo Kobayashi and Hiroshi Ohki
Abstract: We compute three-point and higher order couplings in magnetized brane models. We show that higher order couplings are written as products of three-point couplings. This behavior is the same as higher order amplitudes by conformal field theory calculations e.g. in intersecting D-brane models.
