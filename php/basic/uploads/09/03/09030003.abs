Title: The Power of the Higgs Mechanism: Higher-Derivative BLG Theories
Authors: Bobby Ezhuthachan and Sunil Mukhi and Constantinos Papageorgakis
Abstract: We use the novel Higgs mechanism of arXiv:0803.3218 to determine the leading higher-derivative corrections to the Euclidean N = 8 Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson field theory. The result matches that previously found for Lorentzian 3-algebras, pointing to a universal answer for all maximally supersymmetric 3-algebra theories. We also comment on the extension to the lower-supersymmetric case of ABJM theory.
