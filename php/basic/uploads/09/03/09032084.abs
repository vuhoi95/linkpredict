Title: The Volume Conjecture and Topological Strings
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf and Hiroyuki Fuji
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a relation between Jones-Witten theory of knot invariants and topological open string theory on the basis of the volume conjecture. We find a similar Hamiltonian structure for both theories, and interpret the AJ conjecture as the D-module structure for a D-brane partition function. In order to verify our claim, we compute the free energy for the annulus contributions in the topological string using the Chern-Simons matrix model, and find that it coincides with the Reidemeister torsion in the case of the figure-eight knot complement and the SnapPea census manifold m009.
