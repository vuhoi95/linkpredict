Title: Improved Holographic Yang-Mills at Finite Temperature: Comparison with  Data
Authors: U. Gursoy and E. Kiritsis and L. Mazzanti and F. Nitti
Abstract: The semi-phenomenological improved holographic model for QCD is confronted with data of the pure glue, large-Nc gauge theory. After fitting two phenomenological parameters in the potential, the model can reproduce in detail all thermodynamic functions at finite temperature. It also reproduces in detail all known spin-0 and spin-2 glueball observables at zero temperature and predicts the rest of the 0++ and 2++ towers. A similar two parameter fit in the CP-odd sector postdicts the correct second 0+- glueball mass, and predicts the rest of the 0+- tower.
