Title: Multi-Stream Inflation
Authors: Miao Li and Yi Wang
Abstract: We propose a "multi-stream" inflation model, which is a double field model with spontaneous breaking and restoration of an approximate symmetry. We calculate the density perturbation and non-Gaussianity in this model. We find that this model can have large, scale dependent, and probably oscillating non-Gaussianity. We also note that our model can produce features in the CMB power spectrum and hemispherical power asymmetry.
