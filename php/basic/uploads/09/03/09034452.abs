Title: Ideal gas matching for thermal Galilean holography
Authors: Jose L. F. Barbon and Carlos A. Fuertes
Abstract: We exhibit a nonrelativistic ideal gas with a Kaluza-Klein tower of species, featuring a singular behavior of thermodynamic functions at zero chemical potential. In this way, we provide a qualitative match to the thermodynamics of recently found black holes in backgrounds with asymptotic nonrelativistic conformal symmetry.
