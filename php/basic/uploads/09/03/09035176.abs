Title: Cosmological perturbations in SFT inspired non-local scalar field models
Authors: Alexey S. Koshelev and Sergey Yu. Vernov
Abstract: We study cosmological perturbations in models with a single non-local scalar field originating from the string field theory description of the rolling tachyon dynamics. We construct the equation for the energy density perturbations of the non-local scalar field and explicitly prove that for the free field it is identical to a system of local cosmological perturbation equations in a particular model with multiple (maybe infinitely many) local free scalar fields.
