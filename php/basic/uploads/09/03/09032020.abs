Title: Some notes about the density of states for a negative pressure matter
Authors: Nayereh Majd and D. Momeni
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is deriving Density of states $g(\epsilon)$ (degeneracy function) per volume for an equation of state (EOS) $p=-\rho$ (we called it dark energy(DE)).We have concluded that thermodynamic quantities such as pressure and energy density are simple functions of temperature, fugacity, curvature and mass of Bosons. Our work has been expressed the origin of some claims about the negativity of the entropy for the scalar fields models of DE.
