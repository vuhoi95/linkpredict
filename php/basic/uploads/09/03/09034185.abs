Title: A Holographic model for Non-Relativistic Superconductor
Authors: Shi Pu and Sang-Jin Sin and Yang Zhou
Abstract: We build a holographic description of non-relativistic system for superconductivity in strongly interacting condensed matter via gauge/gravity duality. We focus on the phase transition and give an example to show that a simple gravitational theory can provide a non-relativistic holographical dual description of a superconductor. There is also a critical temperature like the relativistic case, below which a charged condensation field appears by a second order phase transition and the (DC) conductivity becomes infinite. We also calculated the frequency dependent conductivity.
