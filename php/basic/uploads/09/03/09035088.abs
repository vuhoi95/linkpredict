Title: The Edge Of Supersymmetry: Stability Walls in Heterotic Theory
Authors: Lara B. Anderson and James Gray and Andre Lukas and Burt Ovrut
Abstract: We explicitly describe, in the language of four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric field theory, what happens when the moduli of a heterotic Calabi-Yau compactification change so as to make the internal non-Abelian gauge fields non-supersymmetric. At the edge of the region in Kahler moduli space where supersymmetry can be preserved, an additional anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry appears in the four-dimensional theory. The D-term contribution to the scalar potential associated to this U(1) attempts to force the system back into a supersymmetric configuration and provides a consistent low-energy description of gauge bundle stability.
