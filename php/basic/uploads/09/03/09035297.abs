Abstract: This work deals with the dynamics of inflation in the context of a scalar-vector-tensor theory of gravity exhibiting spontaneous Lorentz violation at early times. We describe a first-order formalism which we use to obtain new exact Lorentz violating inflationary solutions for a broad family of models, some in the absence of a potential for the inflaton field. Our results show that different conditions are required to solve the horizon and flatness problems. In particular, we find a necessary condition for inflation to provide a solution to both problems and we show that in inflationary models with no inflaton potential a period of superinflation might be necessary to solve the flatness problem.
