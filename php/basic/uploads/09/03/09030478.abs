Title: Poincare' Quasi-Hopf Symmetry and Non-Associative Spacetime Algebra from  Twisted Gauge Theories
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and B. A. Qureshi
Abstract: In previous work, starting from the Moyal plane, we formulated interacting theories of matter and gauge fields with only the former fields twisted. In this approach, gauge theories, including the standard model, can be formulated without new gauge degrees of freedom. We show their underlying symmetry algebra to be Poincar\'e quasi-Hopf . The associated spacetime algebra is hence non-associative.
