Abstract: We study the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry which acts on the near-horizon region of extremal four-dimensional black hole solutions of gravity theories with higher-derivative corrections, following the recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence. We demonstrate that its central charge correctly reproduces the entropy formula of Iyer-Wald, once the boundary terms in the symplectic structure are carefully chosen.
