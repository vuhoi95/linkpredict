Title: Classical basis for kappa-Poincare algebra and doubly special relativity  theories
Authors: A. Borowiec and A. Pachol
Abstract: Several issues concerning quantum kappa-Poincare algebra are discussed and reconsidered here. We propose two different formulations of kappa-Poincare quantum algebra. Firstly we present a complete Hopf algebra formulae of kappa-Poincare in classical Poincare basis. Further by adding one extra generator, which modifies the classical structure of Poincare algebra, we eliminate non polynomial functions in the kappa-parameter. Hilbert space representations of such algebras make Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) similar to the Stueckelberg's version of (proper-time) relativistic Quantum Mechanics.
