Title: BLG theory with generalized Jordan triple systems
Authors: Sudipto Paul Chowdhury and Subir Mukhopadhyay and Koushik Ray
Abstract: We use a generalized Jordan algebra of the second kind to study the recently proposed BLG theory of multiple M2-branes. We find the restriction imposed on the ternary product from its consistency with the BLG theory.
