Title: Computing Black Hole entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity from a Conformal  Field Theory perspective
Authors: Ivan Agullo and Enrique F. Borja and Jacobo Diaz-Polo
Abstract: Motivated by the analogy proposed by Witten between Chern-Simons and Conformal Field Theories, we explore an alternative way of computing the entropy of a black hole starting from the isolated horizon framework in Loop Quantum Gravity. The consistency of the result opens a window for the interplay between Conformal Field Theory and the description of black holes in Loop Quantum Gravity.
