Title: On spacelike and timelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n$
Authors: Harald Dorn and George Jorjadze and Sebastian Wuttke
Abstract: We discuss timelike and spacelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n$ using a Pohlmeyer type reduction. The differential equations for the reduced system are derived in a parallel treatment of both type of surfaces, with emphasis on their characteristic differences. In the timelike case we find a formulation corresponding to a complete gauge fixing of the torsion. In the spacelike case we derive three sets of equations, related to different parameterizations enforced by the Lorentzian signature of the metric in normal space. On the basis of these equations, we prove that there are no flat spacelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_n, n\geq 4$ beyond the four cusp surfaces used in the Alday-Maldacena conjecture. Furthermore, we give a parameterization of flat timelike minimal surfaces in $AdS_5$ in terms of two chiral fields.
