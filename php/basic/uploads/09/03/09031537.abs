Title: Scalar field dynamics in warped AdS_3 black hole background
Authors: Sayan K. Chakrabarti and Pulak Ranjan Giri and Kumar S. Gupta
Abstract: We study the normal modes of a scalar field in the background of a warped AdS_3 black hole which arises in topologically massive gravity. We discuss the normal mode spectrum using the brick wall boundary condition. In addition, we investigate the possibility of a more general boundary condition for the scalar field.
