Authors: Kei-ichi Maeda and Nobuyoshi Ohta and Makoto Tanabe and Ryo Wakebe
Abstract: We construct a fairy general family of supersymmetric solutions in time- and space-dependent backgrounds in general supergravity theories. One class of the solutions are intersecting brane solutions with factorized form of time- and space-dependent metrics, the second class are brane solutions in pp-wave backgrounds carrying spacetime-dependence, and the final class are the intersecting branes with more nontrivial spacetime-dependence, and their intersection rules are given. Physical properties of these solutions are discussed, and the relation to existing literature is also briefly mentioned. The number of remaining supersymmetries are identified for various configurations including single branes, D1-D5, D2-D6-branes with nontrivial dilaton, and their possible dual theories are briefly discussed.
