Title: Holographic nonlinear hydrodynamics from AdS/CFT with  multiple/non-Abelian symmetries
Authors: Mahdi Torabian and Ho-Ung Yee
Abstract: We study viscous hydrodynamics of hot conformal field theory plasma with multiple/non-Abelian symmetries in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, using a recently proposed method of directly solving bulk gravity in derivative expansion of local plasma parameters. Our motivation is to better describe the real QCD plasma produced at RHIC, incorporating its U(1)^Nf flavor symmetry as well as SU(2)_I non-Abelian iso-spin symmetry. As concrete examples, we choose to study the STU model for multiple U(1)^3 symmetries, which is a sub-sector of 5D N=4 gauged SUGRA dual to N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory, capturing Cartan U(1)^3 dynamics inside the full R-symmetry. For SU(2), we analyze the minimal 4D N=3 gauged SUGRA whose bosonic action is simply an Einstein-Yang-Mills system, which corresponds to SU(2) R-symmetry dynamics on M2-branes at a Hyper-Kahler cone. By generalizing the bosonic action to arbitrary dimensions and Lie groups, we present our analysis and results for any non-Abelian plasma in arbitrary dimensions.
