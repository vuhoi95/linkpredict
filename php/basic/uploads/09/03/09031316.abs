Title: Heterotic $D=2 (1/3, 0)$ Susy Models
Authors: M. B. Sedra and J. Zerouaoui
Abstract: Following our previous work on fractional spin symmetries (FSS) \cite{2, 4}, we build here a superspace representation of the heterotic $D=2(1/3,0)$ superalgebra and derive a field theoretical model invariant under this symmetry.
