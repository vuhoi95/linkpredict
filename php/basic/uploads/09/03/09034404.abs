Title: The Picard-Fuchs equation of a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds without  maximal unipotent monodromy
Authors: Alice Garbagnati and Bert van Geemen
Abstract: Recently J.C. Rohde constructed families of Calabi-Yau threefolds parametrised by Shimura varieties. The points corresponding to threefolds with CM are dense in the Shimura variety and, moreover, the families do not have boundary points with maximal unipotent monodromy. Both aspects are of interest for Mirror Symmetry. In this paper we discuss one of Rohde's examples in detail and we explicitly give the Picard-Fuchs equation for this one dimensional family.
