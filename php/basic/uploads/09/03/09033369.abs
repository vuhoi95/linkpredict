Title: Critical behavior of collapsing surfaces
Authors: Kasper Olsen and Christos Sourdis
Abstract: We consider the mean curvature evolution of rotationally symmetric surfaces. Using numerical methods, we detect critical behavior at the threshold of singularity formation resembling the one of gravitational collapse. In particular, the mean curvature simulation of a one-parameter family of initial data reveals the existence of a critical initial surface that develops a degenerate neckpinch. The limiting flow of the Type II singularity is accurately modeled by the rotationally symmetric translating soliton.
