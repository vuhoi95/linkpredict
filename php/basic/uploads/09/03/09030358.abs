Title: Positron Excess, Luminous-Dark Matter Unification and Family Structure
Authors: Paul H. Frampton and Pham Q. Hung
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that dark matter may be composed of one or at most a few elementary particles. PAMELA data present a window of opportunity into a possible relationship between luminous and dark matter. Along with ATIC data the two positron excesses are interpreted as a reflection of dark matter family structure. In a unified model it is predicted that at least a third enhancement might show up at a different energy. The strength of the enhancements however depends on interfamily mixing angles.
