Title: On the consistent interactions in D=11 among a graviton, a massless  gravitino and a three-form
Authors: E. M. Cioroianu and E. Diaconu and S. C. Sararu
Abstract: The couplings that can be introduced between a massless Rarita-Schwinger field, a Pauli-Fierz field and an Abelian three-form gauge field in eleven spacetime dimensions are analyzed in the context of the deformation of the solution of the master equation.
