Title: Simplifying superstring and D-brane actions in AdS(4) x CP(3)  superbackground
Authors: Pietro Antonio Grassi and Dmitri Sorokin and Linus Wulff
Abstract: By making an appropriate choice for gauge fixing kappa-symmetry we obtain a relatively simple form of the actions for a D=11 superparticle in AdS(4) x S(7)/Z_k, and for a D0-brane, fundamental string and D2-branes in the AdS(4) x CP(3) superbackground. They can be used to study various problems of string theory and the AdS4/CFT3 correspondence, especially in regions of the theory which are not reachable by the OSp(6|4)/U(3) x SO(1,3) supercoset sigma-model. In particular, we present a simple form of the gauge-fixed superstring action in AdS(4) x CP(3) and briefly discuss issues of its T-dualization.
