Title: A Randall-Sundrum scenario with bulk dilaton and torsion
Authors: Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya and Somasri Sen and Soumitra SenGupta
Abstract: We consider a string-inspired torsion-dilaton-gravity action in a Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario and show that, in an effective four-dimensional theory on the visible brane, the rank-2 antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field (source of torsion) is exponentially suppressed. The result is similar to our earlier result in [12], where no dilaton was present in the bulk. This offers an explanation of the apparent invisibility of torsion in our space-time. However, in this case the trilinear couplings ~ Tev^{-1} between dilaton and torsion may lead to new signals in Tev scale experiments, bearing the stamp of extra warped dimensions.
