Title: Gauge Invariant Summation of All QCD Virtual Gluon Exchanges
Authors: H. M. Fried and Y. Gabellini and T. Grandou and Y. -M. Sheu
Abstract: The interpretation of virtual gluons as ghosts in the non-linear gluonic structure of QCD permits the formulation and realization of a manifestly gauge-invariant and Lorentz covariant theory of interacting quarks/anti-quarks, for all values of coupling. The simplest example of quark/anti-quark scattering in a high-energy, quenched, eikonal model at large coupling is shown to be expressible as a set of finite, local integrals which may be evaluated numerically; and before evaluation, it is clear that the result will be dependent only on, and is damped by increasing momentum transfer, while displaying physically-reasonable color dependence in a manner underlying the MIT Bag Model and an effective, asymptotic freedom. A similar but more complicated integral will result from all possible gluonic-radiative corrections to this simplest eikonal model. Our results are compatible with an earlier, field-strength analysis of Reinhardt et al.
