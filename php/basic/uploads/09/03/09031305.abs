Abstract: We study the exact solution for the energy density of a real massless scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime, inside a non-static cavity with an arbitrary initial field state, taking into account the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. This work generalizes the exact solution proposed by Cole and Schieve in the context of the Dirichlet boundary condition and vacuum as the initial state. We investigate diagonal states, examining the vacuum and thermal field as particular cases. We also study non-diagonal initial field states, taking as examples the coherent and Schrodinger cat states.
