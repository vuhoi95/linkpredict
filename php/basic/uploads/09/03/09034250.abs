Title: On the objective existence of physical processes: a physicist's  philosophical view
Authors: J. Sanchez-Guillen and R. A. Vazquez
Abstract: Inspired by philosophical ideas of Boltzmann, which are briefly recalled, we provide strong support for the possibility and convenience of a realistic world picture, properly nuanced. The arguments have consequences for the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and for relevant concepts of quantum field and string theory, like monopoles and branes. Our view is illustrated with a cybernetic analogy and complemented with a summary of the basic philosophical concepts.
