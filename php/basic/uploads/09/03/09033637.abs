Title: Higgs-Inflaton Potential in Higher-Dimensional SUSY Gauge Theories
Authors: Takeo Inami and Yoji Koyama and C. S. Lim and Shie Minakami
Abstract: We study the possibility that the Higgs and the inflaton are the same single field or cousins arising from the extra space components of some higher-dimensional gauge field. We take 5D supersymmetric gauge theory with a matter compactified on S^1 as a toy model and evaluate the one-loop contribution to the Higgs-inflaton potential. Our gauge-Higgs-inflaton unification picture applied to the gauge field of intermediate energy scale (\sim 10^{13} GeV) can explain the observed inflation parameters without fine-tuning.
