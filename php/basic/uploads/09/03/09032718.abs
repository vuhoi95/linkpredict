Title: Flavor Symmetry and Galois Group of Elliptic Curves
Authors: Chuichiro Hattori and Mamoru Matsunaga and Takeo Matsuoka and Kenichi Nakanishi
Abstract: A new approach to the generation structure of fermions is proposed. We consider a brane configuration in which the brane intersection yields a two-torus in the extra space. It is assumed that the two-torus is discretized and is given by the torsion points of the elliptic curve over Q . We direct our attention to the arithmetic structure of the elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM). In our approach the flavor symmetry including the R-parity has its origin in the Galois group of elliptic curves with CM. We study the possible types of the Galois group. The Galois group is shown to be an extension of Z_2 by some abelian group. A phenomenologically viable example of the Galois group is presented, in which the characteristic texture of fermion masses and mixings is reproduced and the mixed-anomaly conditions are satisfied.
