Title: No entropy enigmas for N=4 dyons
Authors: Atish Dabholkar and Monica Guica and Sameer Murthy and Suresh Nampuri
Abstract: We explain why multi-centered black hole configurations where at least one of the centers is a large black hole do not contribute to the indexed degeneracies in theories with N=4 supersymmetry. This is a consequence of the fact that such configurations, although supersymmetric, belong to long supermultiplets. As a result, there is no entropy enigma in N=4 theories, unlike in N=2 theories.
