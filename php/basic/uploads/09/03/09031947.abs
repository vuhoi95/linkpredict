Title: Counting states in the Bousso-Polchinski Landscape
Authors: Cesar Asensio and Antonio Segui
Abstract: Starting from an exact counting of small and positive cosmological constant states in the Bousso-Polchinski Landscape we recover a well-known approximate formula and a systematic method of improvement by means of the Poisson summation formula. This is a contribution to the special Volume published by the University of Zaragoza in honor of Julio Abad Anto\~nanzas. En memoria de nuestro amigo, compa\~nero y maestro Julio.
