Abstract: Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) vortices in U(N) gauge theories have two layers corresponding to non-Abelian and Abelian fluxes, whose widths depend nontrivially on the ratio of U(1) and SU(N) gauge couplings. We find numerically and analytically that the widths differ significantly from the Compton lengths of lightest massive particles with the appropriate quantum number.
