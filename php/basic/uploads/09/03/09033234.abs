Title: Phases of M2-brane Theories
Authors: John Davey and Amihay Hanany and Noppadol Mekareeya and Giuseppe Torri
Abstract: We investigate different toric phases of 2+1 dimensional quiver gauge theories arising from M2-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4 folds. A brane tiling for each toric phase is presented. We apply the 'forward algorithm' to obtain the toric data of the mesonic moduli space of vacua and exhibit the equivalence between the vacua of different toric phases of a given singularity. The structures of the Master space, the mesonic moduli space, and the baryonic moduli space are examined in detail. We compute the Hilbert series and use them to verify the toric dualities between different phases. The Hilbert series, R-charges, and generators of the mesonic moduli space are matched between toric phases.
