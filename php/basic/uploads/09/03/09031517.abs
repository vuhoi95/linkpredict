Title: Noncommutativity and Ramond-Ramond fields
Authors: Masud Chaichian and Dimitri Polyakov and Anca Tureanu
Abstract: We study the properties of the Ramond fields in superstring theory in the presence of a constant B-field and the subsequent implications of space-time noncommutativity for space-time fermions and space-time supersymmetry. We find that the noncommutativity of space-time coordinates leads to extra singularities in the spin field correlators and to appearance of the extra poles in the RR scattering amplitudes, carrying the opposite GSO parities.
