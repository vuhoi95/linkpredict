Title: Dyonic Giant Magnons in CP^3: Strings and Curves at Finite J
Authors: Michael C. Abbott and InÃªs Aniceto and Olof Ohlsson Sax
Abstract: This paper studies giant magnons in AdS_4 x CP^3 using both the string sigma-model and the algebraic curve. We complete the dictionary of solutions by finding the dyonic generalisation of the CP^1 string solution, which matches the `small' giant magnon in the algebraic curve, and by pointing out that the solution recently constructed by the dressing method is the `big' giant magnon. We then use the curve to compute finite-J corrections to all cases, which for the non-dyonic cases always match the AFZ result. For the dyonic RP^3 magnon we recover the S^5 answer, but for the `small' and `big' giant magnons we obtain new corrections.
