Title: A Novel Approach to Lorentz Gauge Theory
Authors: Nakia Carlevaro and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: This paper is devoted to introduce a gauge theory of the Lorentz Group based on the analysis of isometric diffeomorphism-induced Lorentz transformations. The behaviors under local transformations of fermion fields and spin connections (assumed to be coordinate vectors) are analyzed and the role of the torsion field in a curved space-time is discussed.
