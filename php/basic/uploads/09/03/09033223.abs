Title: BPS Vortices in Non-relativistic M2-brane Chern-Simons-matter Theory
Authors: Shinsuke Kawai and Shin Sasaki
Abstract: We study BPS vortices in the mass-deformed non-relativistic ${\C N}=6$ $U(N)_k\times U(N)_{-k}$ Chern-Simons-matter theory. We focus on the massive deformation that preserves the maximal ${\C N}=6$ supersymmetry, and consider a non-relativistic limit that carry 14 supercharges. In this non-relativistic field theory we find Jackiw-Pi type exact vortex solutions combined with $S^3$ fuzzy sphere geometry. We analyse their properties and show that they preserve one dynamical, one conformal and five kinematical supersymmetries among the full super Schr\"odinger symmetry.
