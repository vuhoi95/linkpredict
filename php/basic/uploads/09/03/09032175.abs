Title: Notes on adding D6 branes wrapping RP3 in AdS4 x CP3
Authors: Davide Gaiotto and Daniel Louis Jafferis
Abstract: We deform the N=6 Chern Simons theory by adding extra matter hypermultiplets in a fundamental representation of one or both gauge groups. We compute the quantum corrected moduli space. We verify that the holographic dual of the modified theory consists of the usual AdS4 x CP3 background in presence of AdS4 filling D6 branes which wrap RP3 in CP3. We extend the correspondence to a similar modification of more general known N=3 dual pairs
