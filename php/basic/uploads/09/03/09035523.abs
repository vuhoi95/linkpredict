Title: Deconstructing the D0-D6 system
Authors: Alejandra Castro and Joan Simon
Abstract: We find the complete classical moduli space of two-centered supersymmetric solutions carrying D0 and D6 brane charge in the STU model delimited by walls of marginal stability of co-dimension one. U-duality guarantees our conclusions hold for any BPS state with negative quartic invariant. The analysis explicitly shows that the conditions of marginal stability, i.e. the integrability conditions, are generically insufficient to provide a regular supergravity solution in this model.
