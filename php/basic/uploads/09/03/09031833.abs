Title: Universal blocks of the AdS/CFT Scattering Matrix
Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Marius de Leeuw and Alessandro Torrielli
Abstract: We identify certain blocks in the S-matrix describing the scattering of bound states of the AdS5 x S5 superstring that allow for a representation in terms of universal R-matrices of Yangian doubles. For these cases, we use the formulas for Drinfeld's second realization of the Yangian in arbitrary bound-state representations to obtain the explicit expressions for the corresponding R-matrices. We then show that these expressions perfectly match with the previously obtained S-matrix blocks.
