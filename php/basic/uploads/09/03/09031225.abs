Title: F-Susy And The Three States Potts Model
Authors: M. B. Sedra and J. Zerouaoui
Abstract: In view of its several involvements in various physical and mathematical contexts, 2D-fractional supersymmetry (F-susy) is once again considered in this work. We are, for instance, interested to study the three states Potts model $(k = 3)$ which represents with the tricritical Ising model $(k = 2)$ the two leading examples of more general spin $1/k$ fractional supersymmetric theories.
