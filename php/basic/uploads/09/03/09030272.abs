Title: Scattering in graphene with impurities : A low energy effective theory
Authors: Kumar S. Gupta and Andjelo Samsarov and Siddhartha Sen
Abstract: We analyze the scattering sector of the Hamiltonians for both gapless and gapped graphene in the presence of a charge impurity using the 2D Dirac equation, which is applicable in the long wavelength limit. We show that for certain range of the system parameters, the combined effect of the short range interactions due to the charge impurity can be modelled using a single real parameter appearing in the boundary conditions. The phase shifts and the scattering matrix depend explicitly on this parameter. We argue that this parameter for graphene can be fixed empirically, through measurements of observables that depend on the scattering data.
