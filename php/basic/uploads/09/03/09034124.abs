Title: Fermion Dynamics by Internal and Space-Time Symmetries
Authors: Nakia Carlevaro and Orchidea Maria Lecian and Giovanni Montani
Abstract: This manuscript is devoted to introduce a gauge theory of the Lorentz Group based on the ambiguity emerging in dealing with isometric diffeo-morphism-induced Lorentz transformations. The behaviors under local transformations of fermion fields and spin connections (assumed to be ordinary world vectors) are analyzed in flat space-time and the role of the torsion field, within the generalization to curved space-time, is briefly discussed. The fermion dynamics is then analyzed including the new gauge fields and assuming time-gauge. Stationary solutions of the problem are also analyzed in the non-relativistic limit, to study the spinor structure of an hydrogen-like atom.
