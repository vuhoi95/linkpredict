Title: Light Front Holography: Response to a Comment by L. Glozman
Authors: Guy F. de Teramond and Stanley J. Brodsky
Abstract: We reply to L. Ya. Glozman's Comment "Is a consistent holographic description of excited hadrons with fixed $L$ possible?" In general, the solutions of the bound state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD have Fock state components with different $L$, and consequently hadronic relativistic wave equations derived in the framework of light-front holography share this property. For example, the proton eigenstate has components with L=0 and L=1. The results of AdS/QCD are consistent with the requirements of chiral symmetry and do not violate any fundamental physical principle. This is further illustrated with various examples.
