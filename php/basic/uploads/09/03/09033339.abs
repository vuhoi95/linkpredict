Title: Magnetic field delocalization and flux inversion in fractional vortices  in two-component superconductors
Authors: Egor Babaev and Juha Jäykkä and Martin Speight
Abstract: We demonstrate that, in contrast to the single-component Abrikosov vortex, in two-component superconductors vortex solutions with exponentially screened magnetic field exist only in exceptional cases: in the case of vortices carrying an integer number of flux quanta, and in a special parameter limit for half-quantum vortices. For all other parameters the vortex solutions have delocalized magnetic field with a slowly decaying tail. Furthermore, we demonstrate a new effect which is generic in two-component systems but has no counterpart in single-component systems: on exactly half of the parameter space of the $U(1)\times U(1)$ Ginzburg-Landau model, the magnetic field of a generic fractional vortex inverts its direction at a certain distance from the vortex core.
