Title: Moduli Dynamics of AdS_3 Strings
Authors: Antal Jevicki and Kewang Jin
Abstract: We construct a general class of solutions for a classical string in AdS_3 spacetime. The construction is based on a Pohlmeyer type reduction, with the sinh-Gordon model providing the general N-soliton solutions. The corresponding exact spiky string configurations are then reconstructed through the inverse scattering method. It is shown that the string moduli are determined entirely by those of the solitons.
