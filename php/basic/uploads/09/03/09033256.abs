Title: Thermodynamic instability of rotating black holes
Authors: Ricardo Monteiro and Malcolm J. Perry and Jorge E. Santos
Abstract: We show that the quasi-Euclidean sections of various rotating black holes in different dimensions possess at least one non-conformal negative mode when thermodynamic instabilities are expected. The boundary conditions of fixed induced metric correspond to the partition function of the grand-canonical ensemble. Indeed, in the asymptotically flat cases, we find that a negative mode persists even if the specific heat at constant angular momenta is positive, since the stability in this ensemble also requires the positivity of the isothermal momentum of inertia. We focus in particular on Kerr black holes, on Myers-Perry black holes in five and six dimensions, and on the Emparan-Reall black ring solution. We go on further to consider the richer case of the asymptotically AdS Kerr black hole in four dimensions, where thermodynamic stability is expected for a large enough cosmological constant. The results are consistent with previous findings in the non-rotation limit and support the use of quasi-Euclidean instantons to construct gravitational partition functions.
