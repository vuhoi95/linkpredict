Title: Curvature and Entropy Perturbations in Generalized Gravity
Authors: Xiangdong Ji and Tower Wang
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological perturbations in generalized gravity, where the Ricci scalar and a scalar field are non-minimally coupled via an arbitrary function. In the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background, by studying the linear perturbation theory, we separate the scalar type perturbations into the curvature perturbation and the entropy perturbation, whose evolution equations are derived. Then we apply this framework to inflation. We consider the generalized slow-roll conditions and the quantization initial condition. Under these conditions, two special examples are studied analytically. One example is the case with no entropy perturbation. The other example is a model with the entropy perturbation large initially but decaying significantly after crossing the horizon.
