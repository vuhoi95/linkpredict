Title: Quantization of non-Abelian Berry phase for time reversal invariant  systems
Authors: T. Fukui and T. Fujiwara
Abstract: We present a quantized non-Abelian Berry phase for time reversal invariant systems such as quantum spin Hall effect. Ordinary Berry phase is defined by an integral of Berry's gauge potential along a loop (an integral of the Chern-Simons one-form), whereas we propose that a similar integral but over five dimensional parameter space (an integral of the Chern-Simons five-form) is suitable to define a non-Abelian Berry phase. We study its global topological aspects and show that it is indeed quantized into two values. We also discuss its close relationship with the nonperturbative anomalies.
