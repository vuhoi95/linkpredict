Title: Flavor Superconductivity from Gauge/Gravity Duality
Authors: Martin Ammon and Johanna Erdmenger and Matthias Kaminski and Patrick Kerner
Abstract: We give a detailed account and extensions of a holographic flavor superconductivity model which we have proposed recently. The model has an explicit field theory realization as strongly coupled N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter at finite temperature and finite isospin chemical potential. Using gauge/gravity duality, i.e. a probe of two flavor D7-branes in the AdS black hole background, we show that the system undergoes a second order phase transition with critical exponent 1/2. The new ground state may be interpreted as a rho meson superfluid. It shows signatures known from superconductivity, such as an infinite dc conductivity and a gap in the frequency-dependent conductivity. We present a stringy picture of the condensation mechanism in terms of a recombination of strings. We give a detailed account of the evaluation of the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action involved using two different methods. Finally we also consider the case of massive flavors and discuss the holographic Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in our scenario.
