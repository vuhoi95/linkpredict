Abstract: It is shown that the Veldkamp space of the unique generalized quadrangle GQ(2,4) is isomorphic to PG(5,2). Since the GQ(2,4) features only two kinds of geometric hyperplanes, namely point's perp-sets and GQ(2,2)s, the 63 points of PG(5,2) split into two families; 27 being represented by perp-sets and 36 by GQ(2,2)s. The 651 lines of PG(5,2) are found to fall into four distinct classes: in particular, 45 of them feature only perp-sets, 216 comprise two perp-sets and one GQ(2,2), 270 consist of one perp-set and two GQ(2,2)s and the remaining 120 ones are composed solely of GQ(2,2)s, according as the intersection of two distinct hyperplanes determining the (Veldkamp) line is, respectively, a line, an ovoid, a perp-set and a grid (i. e., GQ(2,1)) of a copy of GQ(2,2). A direct "by-hand" derivation of the above-listed properties is followed by their heuristic justification based on the properties of an elliptic quadric of PG(5,2) and complemented by a proof employing combinatorial properties of a 2-(28, 12, 11)-design and associated Steiner complexes. Surmised relevance of these findings for quantum (information) theory and the so-called black hole analogy is also outlined.
