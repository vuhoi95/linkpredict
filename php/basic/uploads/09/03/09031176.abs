Title: Beyond the Einstein Equation of State: Wald Entropy and Thermodynamical  Gravity
Authors: Maulik K. Parikh and Sudipta Sarkar
Abstract: We show that the classical equations of gravity follow from a thermodynamic relation, dQ = T dS, where S is taken to be the Wald entropy, applied to a local Rindler horizon at any point in spacetime. Our approach works for all diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity. This suggests that classical gravity may be thermodynamic in origin.
