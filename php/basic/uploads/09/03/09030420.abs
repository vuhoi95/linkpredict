Title: Unparticles and Holographic Renormalization Group
Authors: Chiu Man Ho and Yu Nakayama
Abstract: We revisit the unparticle interactions and propagators from the AdS-CFT point of view, and we show how the contact terms and their renormalization group flow appear in the context of the holographic renormalization. We study both vector unparticles and unfermions, uncovering the relevant boundary conditions and renormalization group flows.
