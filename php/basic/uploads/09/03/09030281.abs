Title: One-loop Self-energies in the Electroweak Model with Nonlinearly  Realized Gauge Group
Authors: Daniele Bettinelli and Ruggero Ferrari and Andrea Quadri
Abstract: We evaluate at one loop the self-energies in generic D dimensions for the W,Z mesons in the Electroweak model where the gauge group is nonlinearly realized. In this model the Higgs boson parameters are absent, while a second mass parameter appears together with a scale for the radiative corrections. We estimate these parameters in a simplified fit on leptons and gauge bosons data. We check physical unitarity and the absence of infrared divergences. Landau gauge is used.
