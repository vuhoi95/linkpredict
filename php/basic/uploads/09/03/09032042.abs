Title: Infinite Dimensional Symmetries of Self-Dual Yang-Mills
Authors: Paul Mansfield and Adam Wardlow
Abstract: We construct symmetries of the Chalmers-Siegel action describing self-dual Yang-Mills theory using a canonical transformation to a free theory. The symmetries form an infinite dimensional Lie algebra in the group algebra of isometries.
