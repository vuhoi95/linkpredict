Title: Degenerate and critical domain walls and accelerating universes driven  by bulk particles
Authors: A. de Souza Dutra and A. C. Amaro de Faria Jr. and M. Hott
Abstract: We consider a scenario where our universe is taken as a three-dimensional domain wall embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time, as originally proposed by Brito and collaborators [1]. We explore the existence of a richer class of soliton solutions and their consequences for the acceleration of the universe driven by collisions of bulk particle excitations with the walls. In particular it is shown that some of these solutions should play a fundamental role throughout the expansion process.
