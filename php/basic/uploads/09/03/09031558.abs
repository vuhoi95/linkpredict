Title: Second-order light deflection by tidal charged black holes on the brane
Authors: László Á. Gergely and Zoltán Keresztes and Marek Dwornik
Abstract: We derive the deflection angle of light rays passing near a black hole with mass m and tidal charge q, confined to a generalized Randall-Sundrum brane with codimension one. We employ the weak lensing approach, up to the second order in perturbation theory by two distinct methods. First we adopt a Lagrangian approach and derive the deflection angle from the analysis of the geodesic equations. Then we adopt a Hamiltonian approach and we recover the same result from the analysis of the eikonal. With this we re-establish the unicity of the result as given by the two methods. Our results in turn implies a more rigurous constraint on the tidal charge from Solar System measurements, then derived before.
