Title: Worldline Monte Carlo for fermion models at large N_f
Authors: Gerald Dunne and Holger Gies and Klaus Klingmuller and Kurt Langfeld
Abstract: Strongly-coupled fermionic systems can support a variety of low-energy phenomena, giving rise to collective condensation, symmetry breaking and a rich phase structure. We explore the potential of worldline Monte Carlo methods for analyzing the effective action of fermionic systems at large flavor number N_f, using the Gross-Neveu model as an example. Since the worldline Monte Carlo approach does not require a discretized spacetime, fermion doubling problems are absent, and chiral symmetry can manifestly be maintained. As a particular advantage, fluctuations in general inhomogeneous condensates can conveniently be dealt with analytically or numerically, while the renormalization can always be uniquely performed analytically. We also critically examine the limitations of a straightforward implementation of the algorithms, identifying potential convergence problems in the presence of fermionic zero modes as well as in the high-density region.
