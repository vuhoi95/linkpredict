Title: Phase diagrams of SU(N) gauge theories with fermions in various  representations
Authors: Joyce C. Myers and Michael C. Ogilvie
Abstract: We minimize the one-loop effective potential for SU(N) gauge theories including fermions with finite mass in the fundamental (F), adjoint (Adj), symmetric (S), and antisymmetric (AS) representations. We calculate the phase diagram on S^1 x R^3 as a function of the length of the compact dimension, beta, and the fermion mass, m. We consider the effect of periodic boundary conditions [PBC(+)] on fermions as well as antiperiodic boundary conditions [ABC(-)]. The use of PBC(+) produces a rich phase structure. These phases are distinguished by the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop P. Minimization of the effective potential for QCD(AS/S,+) results in a phase where | Im Tr P | is maximized, resulting in charge conjugation (C) symmetry breaking for all N and all values of (m beta), however, the partition function is the same up to O(1/N) corrections as when ABC are applied. Therefore, regarding orientifold planar equivalence, we argue that in the one-loop approximation C-breaking in QCD(AS/S,+) resulting from the application of PBC to fermions does not invalidate the large N equivalence with QCD(Adj,-). Similarly, with respect to orbifold planar equivalence, breaking of Z(2) interchange symmetry resulting from application of PBC to bifundamental (BF) representation fermions does not invalidate equivalence with QCD(Adj,-) in the one-loop perturbative limit because the partition functions of QCD(BF,-) and QCD(BF,+) are the same. Of particular interest as well is the case of adjoint fermions where for Nf > 1 Majorana flavour confinement is obtained for sufficiently small (m beta), and deconfinement for sufficiently large (m beta). For N >= 3 these two phases are separated by one or more additional phases, some of which can be characterized as partially-confining phases.
