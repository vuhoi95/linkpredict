Abstract: We consider the semiclassical rigid-body quantization of Skyrmion solutions of mass numbers B = 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. We determine the allowed quantum states for each Skyrmion, and find that they often match the observed states of nuclei. The spin and isospin inertia tensors of these Skyrmions are accurately calculated for the first time, and are used to determine the excitation energies of the quantum states. We calculate the energy level splittings, using a suitably chosen parameter set for each mass number. We find good qualitative and encouraging quantitative agreement with experiment. In particular, the rotational bands of beryllium-8 and carbon-12, along with isospin 1 triplets and isospin 2 quintets, are especially well reproduced. We also predict the existence of states that have not yet been observed, and make predictions for the unknown quantum numbers of some observed states.
