Title: Anti de Sitter 5D black hole solutions with a self-interacting bulk  scalar field: a potential reconstruction approach
Authors: K. Farakos and A. P. Kouretsis and P. Pasipoularides
Abstract: We construct asymptotically AdS black hole solutions, with a self-interacting bulk scalar field, in the context of 5D general relativity. As the observable universe is characterized by spatial flatness, we focus to solutions where the horizon of the black hole, and subsequently all 3D hypersurfaces for fixed radial coordinate,have zero spatial curvature. We examine two cases for the black hole scalar hair: a) an exponential decaying scalar field profile and b) an inverse power scalar field profile. The scalar black hole solutions we present in this paper, are characterized by four functions f(r), a(r), phi(r) and V(phi(r)). Only the functions phi(r) and a(r) are determined analytically, while the functions f(r) and V(phi(r)) are expressed semi-analytically, by integral formulas in terms of a(r). We present our numerical results in figures and we study in detail the characteristic properties of our solutions. We also note that the potential we obtain has a non-convex form in agreement with the corresponding "no hair theorem" for AdS space-times.
