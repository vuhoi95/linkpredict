Authors: V. A. Fateev and S. L. Lukyanov and A. B. Zamolodchikov
Abstract: We study 't Hooft's integral equation determining the meson masses M_n in multicolor QCD_2. In this note we concentrate on developing an analytic method, and restrict our attention to the special case of quark masses m_1=m_2=g/\sqrt{\pi}. Among our results is systematic large-n expansion, and exact sum rules for M_n. Although we explicitly discuss only the special case, the method applies to the general case of the quark masses, and we announce some preliminary results for m_1=m_2.
