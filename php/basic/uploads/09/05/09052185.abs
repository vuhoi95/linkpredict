Title: Chiral Zero Modes on Intersecting Heterotic 5-branes
Authors: Tetsuji Kimura and Shun'ya Mizoguchi
Abstract: We show that there exist two 27 and one 27bar of E6, net one chiral supermultiplet as zero modes localized on the intersecting 5-branes in the E8 x E8 heterotic string theory. A heterotic background is constructed by the standard embedding in the smeared solution, and the Dirac equation is solved explicitly on this background. It provides, after a compactification of some of the transverse dimensions, a Randall-Sundrum II like brane-world set-up in heterotic string theory.
