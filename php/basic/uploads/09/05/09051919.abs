Title: Vacuum energy density kicked by the electroweak crossover
Authors: F. R. Klinkhamer and G. E. Volovik
Abstract: Using q-theory, we show that the electroweak crossover can generate a remnant vacuum energy density \Lambda \sim E_{ew}^8 / E_{planck}^4, with effective electroweak energy scale E_{ew} \sim 10^{3} GeV and reduced Planck-energy scale E_{planck} \sim 10^{18} GeV. The obtained expression for the effective cosmological constant \Lambda may be a crucial input for the suggested solution by Arkani-Hamed et al. of the triple cosmic coincidence puzzle (why the orders of magnitude of the energy densities of vacuum, matter, and radiation are approximately the same in the present Universe).
