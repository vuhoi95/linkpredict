Title: Cosmic acceleration and crossing of $Ï‰=-1$ in non-minimal modified  Gauss-Bonnet gravity
Authors: J Sadeghi and M R Setare and A Banijamali
Abstract: Modified Gauss-Bonnet, i.e, $f(G)$ gravity is a possible explanation of dark energy. Late time cosmology for the $f(G)$ gravity non-minimally coupled with a free massless scalar field have been investigated in Ref. [32]. In this paper we generalize the work of Ref. [32] by including scalar potential in the matter Lagrangian which is non-minimally coupled with modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Also we obtain the conditions for having a much more amazing problem than the acceleration of the universe, i.e: crossing of $\omega=-1$, in $f(G)$ non-minimally coupled with tachyonic Lagrangian.
