Abstract: We report on recent results in the study of extremal black hole attractors in N=2, d=4 ungauged Maxwell-Einstein supergravities. For homogeneous symmetric scalar manifolds, the three general classes of attractor solutions with non-vanishing Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are discussed. They correspond to three (inequivalent) classes of orbits of the charge vector, which sits in the relevant symplectic representation R_{V} of the U-duality group. Other than the 1/2-BPS one, there are two other distinct non-BPS classes of charge orbits, one of which has vanishing central charge. The complete classification of the U-duality orbits, as well as of the moduli spaces of non-BPS attractors (spanned by the scalars which are not stabilized at the black hole event horizon), is also reviewed. Finally, we consider the analogous classification for N>2-extended, d=4 ungauged supergravities, in which also the 1/N-BPS attractors yield a related moduli space.
