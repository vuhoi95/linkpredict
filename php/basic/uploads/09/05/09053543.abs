Title: 2D Gravity with Torsion, Oriented Matroids and 2+2 Dimensions
Authors: J. A. Nieto and E. A. Leon
Abstract: We find a link between oriented matroid theory and 2d gravity with torsion. Our considerations may be useful in the context of noncommutative phase space in a target spacetime of signature (2+2) and in a possible theory of gravity ramification.
