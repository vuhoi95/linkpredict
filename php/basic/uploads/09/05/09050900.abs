Title: Holography and the speed of sound at high temperatures
Authors: Paul M. Hohler and Mikhail A. Stephanov
Abstract: We show that in a general class of strongly interacting theories at high temperatures the speed of sound approaches the conformal value c_s^2=1/3 universally from_below_. This class includes theories holographically dual to a theory of gravity coupled to a single scalar field, representing the operator of the scale anomaly.
