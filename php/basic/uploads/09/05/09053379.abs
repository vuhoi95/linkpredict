Title: Realistic Yukawa Structures from Orientifold Compactifications
Authors: Mirjam Cvetiƒç and James Halverson and Robert Richter
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of globally consistent D-brane quivers which realize the MSSM, and analyze them with respect to their Yukawa couplings. Often, desired couplings are perturbatively forbidden due to the presence of global U(1) symmetries. We investigate the conditions under which D-brane instantons will induce these missing couplings without generating other phenomenological drawbacks, such as R-parity violating couplings or a mu-term which is too large. Furthermore, we systematically analyze which quivers allow for a mechanism that can account for the small neutrino masses and other experimentally observed hierarchies. We show that only a small fraction of the globally consistent D-brane quivers exhibits phenomenology compatible with experimental observations.
