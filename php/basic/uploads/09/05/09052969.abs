Title: Universal relations of transport coefficients from holography
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and Abhinav Nellore
Abstract: We show that there are universal high-temperature relations for transport coefficients of plasmas described by a wide class of field theories with gravity duals. These theories can be viewed as strongly coupled large-Nc conformal field theories deformed by one or more relevant operators. The transport coefficients we study are the speed of sound and bulk viscosity, as well as the conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and charge susceptibility of probe U(1) charges. We show that the sound bound v_s^2 <= 1/3 is satisfied at high temperatures in these theories and also discuss bounds on the diffusion coefficient, the conductivity and the bulk viscosity.
