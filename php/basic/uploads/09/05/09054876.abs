Title: Ageing in bosonic particle-reaction models with long-range transport
Authors: Xavier Durang and Malte Henkel
Abstract: Ageing in systems without detailed balance is studied in bosonic contact and pair-contact processes with Levy diffusion. In the ageing regime, the dynamical scaling of the two-time correlation function and two-time response function is found and analysed. Exact results for non-equilibrium exponents and scaling functions are derived. The behaviour of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio is analysed. A passage time from the quasi-stationary regime to the ageing regime is defined, in qualitative agreement with kinetic spherical models and p-spin spherical glasses.
