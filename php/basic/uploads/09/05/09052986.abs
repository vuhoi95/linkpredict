Title: CP-violating Phases in M-theory and Implications for EDMs
Authors: Gordon Kane and Piyush Kumar and Jing Shao
Abstract: We demonstrate that in effective theories arising from a class of N=1 fluxless compactifications of M-theory on a G2 manifold with low energy supersymmetry, CP-violating phases do not appear in the soft-breaking Lagrangian except via the Yukawas appearing in the trilinear parameters. Such a mechanism may be present in other string compactifications as well; we describe properties sufficient for this to occur. CP violation is generated via the Yukawas since the soft trilinear matrices are generically not proportional to the Yukawa matrices. Within the framework considered, the estimated theoretical upper bounds for electric dipole moments (EDM) of the electron, neutron and mercury are all within the current experimental limits and could be probed in the near future.
