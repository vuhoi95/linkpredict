Title: The Subleading Term of the Strong Coupling Expansion of the Heavy-Quark  Potential in a $\mathcal N=4$ Super Yang-Mills Vacuum
Authors: Shao-xia Chu and Defu Hou and Hai-cang Ren
Abstract: Applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, the expansion of the heavy-quark potential of the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at large $N_c$ is carried out to the sub-leading term in the large 't Hooft coupling at zero temperature. The strong coupling corresponds to the semi-classical expansion of the string-sigma model, the gravity dual of the Wilson loop operator, with the sub-leading term expressed in terms of functional determinants of fluctuations. The singularities of these determinants are examined and their contributions are evaluated numerically.
