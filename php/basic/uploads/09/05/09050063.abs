Abstract: The projective superspace formulation for four-dimensional N = 2 matter-coupled supergravity presented in arXiv:0805.4683 makes use of the variant superspace realization for the N = 2 Weyl multiplet in which the structure group is SL(2,C) x SU(2) and the super-Weyl transformations are generated by a covariantly chiral parameter. An extension to Howe's realization of N = 2 conformal supergravity in which the tangent space group is SL(2,C) x U(2) and the super-Weyl transformations are generated by a real unconstrained parameter was briefly sketched. Here we give the explicit details of the extension.
