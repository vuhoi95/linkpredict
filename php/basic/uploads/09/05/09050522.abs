Title: Tree-level Split Helicity Amplitudes in Ambitwistor Space
Authors: Bin Chen and Jun-Bao Wu
Abstract: We study all tree-level split helicity gluon amplitudes by using the recently proposed BCFW recursion relation and Hodges diagrams in ambitwistor space. We pick out the contributing diagrams and find that all of them can be divided into triangles in a suitable way. We give the explicit expressions for all of these amplitudes. As an example, we reproduce the six gluon split NMHV amplitudes in momentum space.
