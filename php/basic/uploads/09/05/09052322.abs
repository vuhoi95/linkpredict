Title: High-Energy Symmetry of Bosonic Open String Theory in the Light-like  Linear Dilaton Background
Authors: Chuan-Tsung Chan and Wei-Ming Chen
Abstract: High-energy limits of fixed-angle tree-level stringy scattering amplitudes in the light-like linear dilaton background are calculated. Treating the time component of the gradient of light-like dilaton field (V_0) as a moduli parameter, we show that: (1) there exists a new fixed-point (V_0/E \to \infty) in the moduli space of the bosonic open string theory, where a new high-energy symmetry among scattering amplitudes can be identified, (2) this new symmetry can be interpreted as a deformation of the flat-space high-energy symmetry, as proposed by D. Gross. Hence, our results give a concrete illustration about the relation between high-energy stringy symmetry and the background independent formulation of string theory.
