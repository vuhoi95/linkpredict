Title: BPS-like bound and thermodynamics of the charged BTZ black hole
Authors: M. Cadoni and C. Monni
Abstract: The charged Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole is plagued by several pathologies: a) Presence of divergent boundary terms in the action, hence of a divergent black hole mass; b) Once a finite, renormalized, mass M is defined black hole states exist for arbitrarily negative values of M; c) There is no upper bound on the charge Q. We show that these pathological features are an artifact of the renormalization procedure. They can be completely removed by using an alternative renormalization scheme leading to a different definition M_0 of the black hole mass, which is the total energy inside the horizon. The new mass satisfies a BPS-like bound M_0\ge (\pi/2)Q^2 and the heat capacity of the hole is positive. We also discuss the black hole thermodynamics that arises when M_0 is interpreted as the internal energy of the system. We show, using three independent approaches (black hole thermodynamics, Einstein equations, Euclidean action formulation) that M_0 satisfies the first law if a term describing the mechanical work done by the electrostatic pressure is introduced.
