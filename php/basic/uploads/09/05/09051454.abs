Title: An alternative construction of the positive inner product in  non-Hermitian quantum mechanics
Authors: Ashok Das and L. Greenwood
Abstract: Within the context of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, we use the generators of eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian to construct a unitary inner product space. Such models have been of interest in recent years, for instance, in the context of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry, although our construction extends to the larger class of so-called pseudo-Hermitian Operators. We provide a detailed example to illustrate the concept and compare with known results.
