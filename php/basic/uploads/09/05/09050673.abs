Title: Supersymmetric IIB Solutions with Schr√∂dinger Symmetry
Authors: Nikolay Bobev and Arnab Kundu and Krzysztof Pilch
Abstract: We find a class of non-relativistic supersymmetric solutions of IIB supergravity with non-trivial B-field that have dynamical exponent n=2 and are invariant under the Schrodinger group. For a general Sasaki-Einstein internal manifold with U(1)^3 isometry, the solutions have two real supercharges. When the internal manifold is S^5, the number of supercharges can be four. We also find a large class of non-relativistic scale invariant type IIB solutions with dynamical exponents different from two. The explicit solutions and the values of the dynamical exponents are determined by vector eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on an Einstein manifold.
