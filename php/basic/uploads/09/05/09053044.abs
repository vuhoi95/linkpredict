Title: On mass hierarchies in orientifold vacua
Authors: Pascal Anastasopoulos and Elias Kiritsis and Andrea Lionetto
Abstract: We analyze the problem of the hierarchy of masses and mixings in orientifold realizations of the Standard Model. We find bottom-up brane configurations that can generate such hierarchies.
