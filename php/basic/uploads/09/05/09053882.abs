Title: $(n+1)$-Dimensional Lorentzian Wormholes in an Expanding Cosmological  Background
Authors: E. Ebrahimi and N. Riazi
Abstract: We discuss $(n+1)$-dimensional dynamical wormholes in an evolving cosmological background with a throat expanding with time. These solutions are examined in the general relativity framework. A linear relation between diagonal elements of an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor is used to obtain the solutions. The energy-momentum tensor elements approach the vacuum case when we are far from the central object for one class of solutions. Finally, we discuss the energy-momentum tensor which supports this geometry, taking into account the energy conditions .
