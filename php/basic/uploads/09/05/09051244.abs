Title: A tomographic description for classical and quantum cosmological  perturbations
Authors: S. Capozziello and V. I. Man'ko and G. Marmo and C. Stornaiolo
Abstract: Classical and quantum perturbations can be described in terms of marginal distribution functions in the framework of tomographic cosmology. In particular, the so called Radon transformation and the mode-parametric quantum oscillator description can give rise to links between quantum and classical regimes. The approach results a natural scheme to discuss the transition from the quantum to the classical perturbations and then it could be a workable scheme to connect primordial fluctuations with the today observed large scale structure.
