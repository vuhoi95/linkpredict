Title: Fractal Dimension in 3d Spin-Foams
Authors: Francesco Caravelli and Leonardo Modesto
Abstract: In this paper we perform the calculation of the spectral dimension of the space-time in 3d quantum gravity using the dynamics of the Ponzano-Regge vertex (PR) and its quantum group generalization (Turaev-Viro model (TV)). We realize this considering a very simple decomposition of the 3d space-time and introducing a boundary state which selects a classical geometry on the boundary. We obtain that the spectral dimension of the space-time runs from 2 to 3, across a 1.5 phase, when the energy of a probe scalar field decreases from high to low energy. For the TV model the spectral dimension at hight energy increase with the value of the cosmological constant. At low energy the presence of the cosmological constant does not change the spectral dimension.
