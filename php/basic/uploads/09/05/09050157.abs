Abstract: A general three-dimensional noncommutative quantum mechanical system mixing spatial and spin degrees of freedom is proposed. The analogous of the harmonic oscillator in this description contains a magnetic dipole interaction and the ground state is explicitly computed and we show that it is infinitely degenerated and implying a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The model can be straightforwardly extended to many particles and the main above properties are retained. Possible applications to the Bose-Einstein condensation with dipole-dipole interactions are briefly discussed.
