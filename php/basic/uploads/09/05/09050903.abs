Title: A bound on the speed of sound from holography
Authors: Aleksey Cherman and Thomas D. Cohen and Abhinav Nellore
Abstract: We show that the squared speed of sound v_{s}^{2} is bounded from above at high temperatures by the conformal value of 1/3 in a class of strongly coupled four-dimensional field theories, given some mild technical assumptions. This class consists of field theories that have gravity duals sourced by a single scalar field. There are no known examples to date of field theories with gravity duals for which v_{s}^{2} exceeds 1/3 in energetically favored configurations. We conjecture that v_{s}^{2}=1/3 represents an upper bound for a broad class of four-dimensional theories.
