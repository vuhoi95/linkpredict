Title: The virtual scaling function of twist operators in the N=6 Chern-Simons  theory
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We consider twist-L operators in the planar N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons ABJM theory. Their anomalous dimension gamma_L^{CS}(N) is a function of the twist L, the spin N, and the dressed coupling of ABJM. We show that at next-to-leading order in the large spin expansion, this anomalous dimension is related to that of N=4 SYM twist operators by a simple scaling law.
