Title: A Dual Geometry of the Hadron in Dense Matter
Authors: Bum-Hoon Lee and Chanyong Park and Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We identify the dual geometry of the hadron phase of dense nuclear matter and investigate the confinement/deconfinement phase transition. We suggest that the low temperature phase of the RN black hole with the full backreaction of the bulk gauge field is described by the zero mass limit of the RN black hole with hard wall. We calculated the density dependence of critical temperature and found that the phase diagram closes. We also study the density dependence of the rho meson mass.
