Title: Classification of U_q(sl_2)-module algebra structures on the quantum  plane
Authors: Steven Duplij and Sergey Sinel'shchikov
Abstract: A complete list of Uq(sl2)-module algebra structures on the quantum plane is produced and the (uncountable family of) isomorphism classes of these structures are described. The composition series of representations in question are computed. The classical limits of the Uq(sl2)-module algebra structures are discussed.
