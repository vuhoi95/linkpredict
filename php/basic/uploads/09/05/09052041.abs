Title: Scalar field fluctuations in Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time
Authors: Hing-Tong Cho and Kin-Wang Ng and I-Chin Wang
Abstract: We calculate quantum fluctuations of a free scalar field in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time, adopting the planar coordinates that is pertinent to the presence of a black hole in an inflationary universe. In a perturbation approach, doing expansion in powers of a small black hole event horizon compared to the de Sitter cosmological horizon, we obtain time evolution of the quantum fluctuations and then derive the scalar power spectrum.
