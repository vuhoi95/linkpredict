Title: Solutions of type IIB and D=11 supergravity with Schrodinger(z) symmetry
Authors: Aristomenis Donos and Jerome P. Gauntlett
Abstract: We construct families of supersymmetric solutions of type IIB and D=11 supergravity that are invariant under the non-relativistic Schrodinger(z) algebra for various values of the dynamical exponent z. The new solutions are based on five- and seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, respectively, and include supersymmetric solutions with z=2.
