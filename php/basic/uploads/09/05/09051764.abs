Title: Conformal Supersymmetry Breaking in Vector-like Gauge Theories
Authors: K. -I. Izawa and Fuminobu Takahashi and T. T. Yanagida and Kazuya Yonekura
Abstract: A new class of models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking is proposed. The models are based on SU(N_C) gauge theories with N_F(<N_C) flavors of quarks and singlets. Dynamically generated superpotential exibits runaway behavior. By embedding the models into conformal field theories at high energies, the runaway potential is stabilized by strong quantum corrections to the Kahler potential. The quantum corrections are large but nevertheless can be controlled due to superconformal symmetry of the theories.
