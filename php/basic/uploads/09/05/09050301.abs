Title: On the Renormalizability of Horava-Lifshitz-type Gravities
Authors: Domenico Orlando and Susanne Reffert
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the renormalizability of Horava-Lifshitz-type gravity theories. Using the fact that Horava-Lifshitz gravity is very closely related to the stochastic quantization of topologically massive gravity, we show that the renormalizability of HL gravity only depends on the renormalizability of topologically massive gravity. This is a consequence of the BRST and time-reversal symmetries pertinent to theories satisfying the detailed balance condition.
