Title: Inflation on a Pair of D3-brane and D3bar-brane in Klebanov-Strassler  Background
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and Hiroaki Nakajima and Kyungha Ryu and Hang Bae Kim
Abstract: We explain how to obtain Klabanov-Strassler solution in the low-energy limit of type IIB superstring theory and describe slow-roll inflation on the system of parallely-separated D3-brane and D3bar-brane in the Klebanov-Strassler background.
