Title: AC Transport at Holographic Quantum Hall Transitions
Authors: Janne Alanen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Per Kraus and Ville Suur-Uski
Abstract: We compute AC electrical transport at quantum Hall critical points, as modeled by intersecting branes and gauge/gravity duality. We compare our results with a previous field theory computation by Sachdev, and find unexpectedly good agreement. We also give general results for DC Hall and longitudinal conductivities valid for a wide class of quantum Hall transitions, as well as (semi)analytical results for AC quantities in special limits. Our results exhibit a surprising degree of universality; for example, we find that the high frequency behavior, including subleading behavior, is identical for our entire class of theories.
