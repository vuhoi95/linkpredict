Title: k-Mouflage gravity
Authors: E. Babichev and C. Deffayet and R. Ziour
Abstract: We introduce a large class of scalar-tensor theories where gravity becomes stronger at large distances via the exchange of a scalar that mixes with the graviton. At small distances, i.e. large curvature, the scalar is screened via an analog of the Vainshtein mechanism of massive gravity. The crossover distance between the two regimes can be made cosmological by an appropriate choice of the parameters.
