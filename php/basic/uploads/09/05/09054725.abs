Title: R-symmetry and supersymmetry breaking in 3D WZ models
Authors: Antonio Amariti and Massimo Siani
Abstract: We analyze metastable supersymmetry breaking in 3D WZ models. We study the regime of validity of the perturbative computation for superpotentials with marginal and relevant couplings. Lifetime of the metastable states in presence of a triangular potential barrier is estimated.
