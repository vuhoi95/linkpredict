Title: One-Loop Amplitudes in N=4 Super Yang-Mills and Anomalous Dual Conformal  Symmetry
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber and Paul Heslop and Gabriele Travaglini
Abstract: We discuss what predictions can be made for one-loop superamplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by using anomalous dual conformal symmetry. We show that the anomaly coefficient is a specific combination of two-mass hard and one-mass supercoefficients which appears in the supersymmetric on-shell recursion relations and equals the corresponding tree-level superamplitude. We discuss further novel relations among supercoefficients imposed by the remaining non-anomalous part of the symmetry. In particular, we find that all one-loop supercoefficients, except the four-mass box coefficients, can be expressed as linear combinations of three-mass box coefficients and a particular symmetric combination of two-mass hard coefficients. We check that our equations are explicitly satisfied in the case of one-loop n-point MHV and NMHV amplitudes. As a bonus, we prove the covariance of the NMHV superamplitudes at an arbitrary number of points, extending previous results at n <= 9.
