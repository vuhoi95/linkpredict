Title: Flux Attractors and Generating Functions
Authors: Finn Larsen and Ross O'Connell
Abstract: We use the flux attractor equations to study IIB supergravity compactifications with ISD fluxes. We show that the attractor equations determine not just the values of moduli fields, but also the masses of those moduli and the gravitino. We then show that the flux attractor equations can be recast in terms of derivatives of a single generating function. We also find a simple expression for this generating function in terms of the gravitino mass, with both quantities considered as functions of the fluxes. For a simple prepotential, we explicitly solve the attractor equations. We conclude by discussing a thermodynamic interpretation of this generating function, and possible implications for the landscape.
