Title: Boundary Lax pairs from non-ultra local Poisson algebras
Authors: Jean Avan and Anastasia Doikou
Abstract: We consider non-ultra local linear Poisson algebras on a continuous line . Suitable combinations of representations of these algebras yield representations of novel generalized linear Poisson algebras or "boundary" extensions. They are parametrized by a "boundary" scalar matrix and depend in addition on the choice of an anti-automorphism. The new algebras are the classical-linear counterparts of known quadratic quantum boundary algebras. For any choice of parameters the non-ultra local contribution of the original Poisson algebra disappears. We also systematically construct the associated classical Lax pair. The classical boundary PCM model is examined as a physical example.
