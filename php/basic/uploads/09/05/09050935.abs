Authors: Z. G. Huang and H. Q. Lu and W. Fang
Abstract: Applying the parametrization of dark energy density, we can construct directly independent-model potentials. In Born-Infeld type phantom dark energy model, we consider four special parametrization equation of state parameter. The evolutive behavior of dark energy density with respect to red-shift $z$, potentials with respect to $\phi$ and $z$ are shown mathematically. Moreover, we investigate the effect of parameter $\eta$ upon the evolution of the constructed potential with respect to $z$. These results show that the evolutive behavior of constructed Born-Infeld type dark energy model is quite different from those of the other models.
