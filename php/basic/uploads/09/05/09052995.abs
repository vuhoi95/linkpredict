Title: Four-dimensional N=1 super Yang-Mills from matrix model
Authors: Masanori Hanada and Lorenzo Mannelli and Yoshinori Matsuo
Abstract: We consider a supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics. This is obtained by adding Myers and mass terms to the dimensional reduction of 4d N=1 super Yang-Mills theory to one dimension. Using this model we construct 4d N=1 super Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit by using the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence. The same matrix quantum mechanics is also used to provide a nonperturbative formulation of 4d N=1 super Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative space.
