Title: Galilean Superconformal Symmetries
Authors: J. A. de Azcarraga and J. Lukierski
Abstract: We consider the non-relativistic c -> \infty contraction limit of the (N=2k)- extended D=4 superconformal algebra su(2,2;N), introducing in this way the non-relativistic (N=2k)-extended Galilean superconformal algebra. Such a Galilean superconformal algebra has the same number of generators as su(2,2|2k). The usp(2k) algebra describes the non-relativistic internal symmetries, and the generators from the coset u(2k)/usp(2k) become central charges after contraction.
