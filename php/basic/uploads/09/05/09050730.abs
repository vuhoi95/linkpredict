Authors: Hayato Motohashi and Alexei A. Starobinsky and Jun'ichi Yokoyama
Abstract: For a class of viable cosmological models in $f(R)$ gravity which deviation from the Einstein gravity decreases as a inverse power law of the Ricci scalar $R$ for large $R$, an analytic solution for density perturbations in the matter component during the matter dominated stage is obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions. An analytical expression for the matter transfer function at scales much less than the present Hubble scale is also obtained.
