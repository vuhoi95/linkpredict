Title: Quantum and Classical Statistical Mechanics of a Class of non-Hermitian  Hamiltonians
Authors: H. F. Jones and E. S. Moreira Jr
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamics of a large class of non-Hermitian, $PT$-symmetric oscillators, whose energy spectrum is entirely real. The spectrum is estimated by second-order WKB approximation, which turns out to be very accurate even for small quantum numbers, and used to generate the quantum partition function. Graphs showing the thermal behavior of the entropy and the specific heat, at all regimes of temperature, are given. To obtain the corresponding classical partition function it turns out to be necessary in general to integrate over a complex "phase space". For the wrong-sign quartic, whose equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian is known exactly, it is demonstrated explicitly how this formulation arises, starting from the Hermitian case.
