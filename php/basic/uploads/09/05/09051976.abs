Title: Age problem in holographic dark energy
Authors: L. N. Granda and A. Oliveros and W. Cardona
Abstract: We study the age problem of the universe with the holographic DE model introduced in [21], and test the model with some known old high redshift objects (OHRO). The parameters of the model have been constrained using the SNIa, CMB and BAO data set. We found that the age of the old quasar APM 08 279+5255 at z = 3.91 can be described by the model.
