Title: Kaluza-Klein Theory as a Dynamics in a Dual Geometry
Authors: Avi Gershon and Lawrence Horwitz
Abstract: It has been shown that the orbits of motion for a wide class of non-relativistic Hamiltonian systems can be described as geodesic flow on a manifold and an associated dual. This method can be applied to a four dimensional manifold of orbits in space-time associated with a relativistic system. One can study the consequences on the geometry of the introduction of electromagnetic interaction. We find that resulting geometrical structure in the dual space is that of Kaluza and Klein.
