Title: Non-polynomial potentials with deformable topological structures
Authors: Augusto E. R. Chumbes and Marcelo B. Hott
Abstract: We construct models of self-interacting scalar fields whose BPS solutions exhibit kink profiles which can be continuously deformed into two-kinks by varying one of the parameters of the self-interacting potential. The effective models are obtained from other models with two interacting scalar fields. The effective models are then applied in a brane-world scenario where we analyze the consequences of the thicker branes in the warped geometry and in the localization of gravity.
