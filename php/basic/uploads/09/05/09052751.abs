Title: A Trouble with Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Miao Li and Yi Pang
Abstract: We study the structure of the phase space in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory. With the constraints derived from the action, the phase space is described by five fields, thus there is a lack of canonical structure. The Poisson brackets of the Hamiltonian density do not form a closed structure, resulting in many new constraints. Taking these new constraints into account, it appears that there is no degree of freedom left, or the phase space is reduced to one with an odd number of fields.
