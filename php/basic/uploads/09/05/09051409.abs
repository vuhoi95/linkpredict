Title: Quasinormal modes of a black hole in the deformed Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz  gravity
Authors: Songbai Chen and Jiliang Jing
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of the massless scalar perturbation in the background of a deformed black hole in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with coupling constant $\lambda=1$. Our results show that the quasinormal frequencies depend on the parameter in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and the behavior of the quasinormal modes is different from those in the Reissner-Norstr\"{om} and Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole spacetimes. The absolute value of imaginary parts is smaller and the scalar perturbations decay more slowly in the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black hole spacetime. This information can help us understand more about the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
