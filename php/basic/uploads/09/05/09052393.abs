Title: Supersymmetric Heterotic Action out of M5 Brane
Authors: Jaemo Park and Woojoo Sim
Abstract: Generalizing the work by Cherkis and Schwarz [1], we carry out the double dimensional reduction of supersymmetric M5 brane on K3 to obtain the supersymmetric action of heterotic string in 7-dimensional flat space-time. Motivated by this result, we propose the supersymmetric heterotic action in 10-dimensional flat space-time where the current algebra is realized in a novel way. We explicitly verify the kappa-symmetry of the proposed action.
