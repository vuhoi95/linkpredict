Title: Cosmic Signals from the Hidden Sector
Authors: Jeremy Mardon and Yasunori Nomura and Jesse Thaler
Abstract: Cosmologically long-lived, composite states arise as natural dark matter candidates in theories with a strongly interacting hidden sector at a scale of 10 - 100 TeV. Light axion-like states, with masses in the 1 MeV - 10 GeV range, are also generic, and can decay via Higgs couplings to light standard model particles. Such a scenario is well motivated in the context of very low energy supersymmetry breaking, where ubiquitous cosmological problems associated with the gravitino are avoided. We investigate the astrophysical and collider signatures of this scenario, assuming that dark matter decays into the axion-like states via dimension six operators, and we present an illustrative model exhibiting these features. We conclude that the recent data from PAMELA, FERMI, and H.E.S.S. points to this setup as a compelling paradigm for dark matter. This has important implications for future diffuse gamma ray measurements and collider searches.
