Title: Inflation, baryogenesis and gravitino dark matter at ultra low reheat  temperatures
Authors: Kazunori Kohri and Anupam Mazumdar and Narendra Sahu
Abstract: It is quite possible that the reheat temperature of the universe is extremely low close to the scale of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, i.e. $T_{R}\sim 1-10$ MeV. At such low reheat temperatures generating matter anti-matter asymmetry and synthesizing dark matter particles are challenging issues which need to be addressed within a framework of beyond the Standard Model physics. In this paper we point out that a successful cosmology can emerge naturally provided the R-parity violating interactions are responsible for the excess in baryons over anti-baryons and at the same time they can explain the longevity of dark matter with the right abundance.
