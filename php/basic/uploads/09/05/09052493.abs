Title: Polarized DIS in N=4 SYM: Where is spin at strong coupling?
Authors: Yoshitaka Hatta and Takahiro Ueda and Bo-Wen Xiao
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the polarized structure functions in strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory deformed in the infrared. We find that the flavor singlet contribution to the g_1 structure function is vanishingly small, while the flavor non-singlet contribution shows the Regge behavior at small-x with an intercept slightly less than 1. We explicitly check that the latter satisfies the moment sum rule. We discuss the `spin crisis' problem and suggest that at strong coupling the spin of a hadron entirely comes from the orbital angular momentum.
