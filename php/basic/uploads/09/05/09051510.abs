Title: Static spherically symmetric solutions for conformal gravity in three  dimensions
Authors: Julio Oliva and David Tempo and Ricardo Troncoso
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric solutions for conformal gravity in three dimensions are found. Black holes and wormholes are included within this class. Asymptotically the black holes are spacetimes of arbitrary constant curvature, and they are conformally related to the matching of different solutions of constant curvature by means of an improper conformal transformation. The wormholes can be constructed from suitable identifications of a static universe of negative spatial curvature, and it is shown that they correspond to the conformal matching of two black hole solutions with the same mass.
