Title: Holographic Entanglement Entropy: An Overview
Authors: Tatsuma Nishioka and Shinsei Ryu and Tadashi Takayanagi
Abstract: In this article, we review recent progresses on the holographic understandings of the entanglement entropy in the AdS/CFT correspondence. After reviewing the general idea of holographic entanglement entropy, we will explain its applications to confinement/deconfinement phase transitions, black hole entropy and covariant formulation of holography.
