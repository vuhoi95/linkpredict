Title: Supernatural A-term Inflation
Authors: Chia-Min Lin and Kingman Cheung
Abstract: Following \cite{Lin:2009yt}, we explore the parameter space of the case when the supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scale is lower, for example, in gauge mediated SUSY breaking model. During inflation, the form of the potential is $V_0$ plus MSSM (MSSM stands for Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model) (or A term (It is called A-term inflation when the inflaton field is any direction (gauge or singlet) that generates an A-term.)) inflation. We show that the model works for a wide range of the potential $V_0$ with the soft SUSY breaking mass $m\sim O(1)$ TeV. The implication to MSSM (or A-term) inflation is that the flat directions which is lifted by the non-renormalizable terms described by the superpotential $W=\lambda_p \phi^{p-1}/M^{p-3}_P$ with $p=4$ and $p=5$ are also suitable to be an inflaton field for $\lambda_p=O(1)$ provided there is an additional false vacuum term $V_0$ with appropriate magnitude. The flat directions corresponds to $p=6$ also works for $0 \lae V_0/M_P^4 \lae 10^{-40}$.
