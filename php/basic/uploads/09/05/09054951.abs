Title: OSp(4|2) Superconformal Mechanics
Authors: Sergey Fedoruk and Evgeny Ivanov and Olaf Lechtenfeld
Abstract: A new superconformal mechanics with OSp(4|2) symmetry is obtained by gauging the U(1) isometry of a superfield model. It is the one-particle case of the new N=4 super Calogero model recently proposed in arXiv:0812.4276 [hep-th]. Classical and quantum generators of the osp(4|2) superalgebra are constructed on physical states. As opposed to other realizations of N=4 superconformal algebras, all supertranslation generators are linear in the odd variables, similarly to the N=2 case. The bosonic sector of the component action is standard one-particle (dilatonic) conformal mechanics accompanied by an SU(2)/U(1) Wess-Zumino term, which gives rise to a fuzzy sphere upon quantization. The strength of the conformal potential is quantized.
