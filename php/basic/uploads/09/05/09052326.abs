Title: The Ultraviolet Behavior of N=8 Supergravity at Four Loops
Authors: Z. Bern and J. J. Carrasco and L. J. Dixon and H. Johansson and R. Roiban
Abstract: We describe the construction of the complete four-loop four-particle amplitude of N=8 supergravity. The amplitude is ultraviolet finite, not only in four dimensions, but in five dimensions as well. The observed extra cancellations provide additional non-trivial evidence that N=8 supergravity in four dimensions may be ultraviolet finite to all orders of perturbation theory.
