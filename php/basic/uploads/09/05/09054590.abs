Title: Exact Gravitational Dual of a Plasma Ball
Authors: Roberto Emparan and Giuseppe Milanesi
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a black hole localized near an infrared wall in four-dimensional anti-deSitter space. By computing the holographic stress tensor we show that the CFT dual of the black hole is a 2+1-dimensional ball (i.e., a disk) of plasma at finite temperature, surrounded by vacuum. This confirms some earlier conjectures about plasma balls in AdS/CFT. We also estimate the value of the surface tension for the ball. The solution displays a number of peculiarities, most notably a non-trivial curvature of the boundary geometry, as well as other properties associated to the vanishing deconfinement temperature of the set up. We discuss how these features are related to specific physics at the infrared and ultraviolet boundaries for this solution, and should not be generic properties of plasma balls.
