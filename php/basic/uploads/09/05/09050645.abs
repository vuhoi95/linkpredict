Title: Adjoint fermion zero-modes for SU(N) calorons
Authors: Margarita García Pérez and Antonio González-Arroyo and Alfonso Sastre
Abstract: We derive analytic formulas for the zero-modes of the Dirac equation in the adjoint representation in the background field of Q=1 SU(N) calorons. Solutions with various boundary conditions are obtained, including the physically most relevant cases of periodic and antiperiodic ones. The latter are essential ingredients in a semiclassical treatment of finite temperature supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. A detailed discussion of adjoint zero-modes in several other contexts is also presented.
