Title: Causality and statistics on the Groenewold-Moyal plane
Authors: A. P. Balachandran and Anosh Joseph and Pramod Padmanabhan
Abstract: Quantum theories constructed on the noncommutative spacetime called the Groenewold-Moyal plane exhibit many interesting properties such as Lorentz and CPT noninvariance, causality violation and twisted statistics. We show that such violations lead to many striking features that may be tested experimentally. These theories predict Pauli forbidden transitions due to twisted statistics, anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation due to correlations of observables in spacelike regions and Lorentz and CPT violations in scattering amplitudes.
