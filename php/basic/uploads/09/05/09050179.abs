Title: Thermodynamics of Ho≈ôava-Lifshitz black holes
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Yong-Wan Kim
Abstract: We study black holes in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with a parameter $\lambda$. For $1/3 \le \lambda < 3$, the black holes behave the Lifshitz black holes with dynamical exponent $0 < z \le 4$, while for $\lambda > 3$, the black holes behave the Reissner-Nordstr\"om type black hole in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Hence, these all are quite different from the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole of Einstein gravity. The temperature, mass, entropy, and heat capacity are derived for investigating thermodynamic properties of these black holes.
