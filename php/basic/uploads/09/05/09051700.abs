Title: Finite size corrections for open strings/open chains in planar AdS/CFT
Authors: D. H. Correa and C. A. S. Young
Abstract: We identify the leading finite-size (Luscher-type) correction to the energy of open strings ending on maximal giant gravitons. In particular we obtain the leading finite size correction at weak 't Hooft coupling and in the planar limit to the energy of very short vacuum states. These results are shown to agree with certain 1, 2, 3 and 4-loop dual gauge theory perturbative calculations, which we also perform.
