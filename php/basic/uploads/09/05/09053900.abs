Title: Dirac quantization of membrane in time dependent orbifold
Authors: Przemyslaw Malkiewicz and Wlodzimierz Piechocki
Abstract: We present quantum theory of a membrane propagating in the vicinity of a time dependent orbifold singularity. The dynamics of a membrane, with the parameters space topology of a torus, winding uniformly around compact dimension of the embedding spacetime is mathematically equivalent to the dynamics of a closed string in a flat FRW spacetime. The construction of the physical Hilbert space of a membrane makes use of the kernel space of self-adjoint constraint operators. It is a subspace of the representation space of the constraints algebra. There exist non-trivial quantum states of a membrane evolving across the singularity.
