Title: Thermodynamics and classification of cosmological models in the  Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity
Authors: Anzhong Wang and Yumei Wu
Abstract: We study thermodynamics of cosmological models in the Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity, and systematically investigate the evolution of the universe filled with a perfect fluid that has the equation of state $p=w\rho$, where $p$ and $\rho$ denote, respectively, the pressure and energy density of the fluid, and $w$ is an arbitrary real constant. Depending on specific values of the free parameters involved in the models, we classify all of them into various cases. In each case the main properties of the evolution are studied in detail, including the periods of deceleration and/or acceleration, and the existence of big bang, big crunch, and big rip singularities. We pay particular attention on models that may give rise to a bouncing universe.
