Title: Coupling between M2-branes and Form Fields
Authors: Yoonbai Kim and O-Kab Kwon and Hiroaki Nakajima and D. D. Tolla
Abstract: In the context of low-energy effective theory of multiple M2-branes, we construct the interaction terms between the world-volume fields of M2-branes and the antisymmetric tensor fields of three- and six-forms. By utilizing the compactification procedure, we show coincidence between the dimensionally reduced coupling and the R-R coupling to D-branes in type II string theory. We also discuss that a cubic term proportional to six-form field reproduces the quartic mass-deformation term in the world-volume theory of multiple M2-branes.
