Title: Thermodynamics of Black Holes in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity
Authors: Rong-Gen Cai and Li-Ming Cao and Nobuyoshi Ohta
Abstract: By using the canonical Hamiltonian method, we obtain the mass and entropy of the black holes with general dynamical coupling constant $\lambda$ in Ho\v{r} ava-Lifshitz Gravity. Regardless of whether the horizon is sphere, plane or hyperboloid, we find these black holes are thermodynamically stable in some parameter space and unstable phase also exists in other parameter space. The relation between the entropy and horizon area of the black holes has an additional coefficient depending on the coupling constant $\lambda$, compared to the $\lambda=1$ case. For $\lambda=1$, the well-known coefficient of one quarter is recovered in the infrared region.
