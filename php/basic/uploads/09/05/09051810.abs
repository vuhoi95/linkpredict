Title: On Calogero-Francoise-type Lax matrices and their dynamical r-matrices
Authors: Jean Avan and Genevieve Rollet
Abstract: New classical integrable systems of Camassa-Holm peakon type are proposed. They realize the maximal even piecewise-D_2 generalization of the Calogero-Francoise flows, yielding periodic and pseudoperiodic trigonometric/hyperbolic potentials. The associated r-matrices are computed. They are dynamical and depend on both sets {p_i} and {q_i} of canonical variables.
