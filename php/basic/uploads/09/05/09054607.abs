Title: Gaugino radiative decay in an anomalous U(1)' model
Authors: Andrea Lionetto and Antonio Racioppi
Abstract: We study the neutralino radiative decay into the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the framework of a minimal anomalous U(1)' extension of the MSSM. It turns out that in a suitable decoupling limit the axino, which is present in the St\"uckelberg multiplet, is the LSP. We compute the branching ratio (BR) for the decay of a neutralino into an axino and a photon. We find that in a wide region of the parameter space, the BR is higher than 93% in contrast with the typical value (<=1%) in the CMSSM.
