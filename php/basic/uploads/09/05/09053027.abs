Title: Relativistic Theory of Infinite Statistics Fields
Authors: Chao Cao and Yi-Xin Chen and Jian-Long Li
Abstract: Infinite statistics in which all representations of the symmetric group can occur is known as a special case of quon theory. However, the validity of relativistic quon theories is still in doubt. In this paper we prove that there exists a relativistic quantum field theory which allows interactions involving infinite statistics particles. We also give some consistency analysis of this theory such as conservation of statistics and Feynman rules.
