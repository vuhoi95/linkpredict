Abstract: A generalized parameterization $w_\beta(z)$ for the dark energy equation of state (EoS) is proposed and some of its cosmological consequences are investigated. We show that in the limit of the characteristic dimensionless parameter $\beta \to +1, 0$ and -1 some well-known EoS parameterizations are fully recovered whereas for other values of $\beta$ the proposed parameterization admits a wider and new range of cosmological solutions. We also discuss possible constraints on the $w_\beta(z)$ parameters from current observational data.
