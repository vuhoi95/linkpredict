Title: Redundancy of the off-shell parameters in chiral effective field theory  with explicit spin-3/2 degrees of freedom
Authors: H. Krebs and E. Epelbaum and U. -G. Mei√üner
Abstract: In this note we prove to all orders in the small scale expansion that all off-shell parameters which appear in the chiral effective Lagrangian with explicit Delta(1232) isobar degrees of freedom can be absorbed into redefinitions of certain low-energy constants and are therefore redundant.
