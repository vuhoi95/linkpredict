Title: On the renormalization procedure for quantum fields with modified  dispersion relation in curved spacetimes
Authors: Diana LÃ³pez Nacir and Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Abstract: We review our recent results on the renormalization procedure for a free quantum scalar field with modified dispersion relations in curved spacetimes. For dispersion relations containing up to $2s$ powers of the spatial momentum, the subtraction necessary to renormalize $<\phi^2>$ and $<T_{\mu\nu}>$ depends on $s$. We first describe our previous analysis for spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker and Bianchi type I metrics. Then we present a new power counting analysis for general background metrics in the weak field approximation.
