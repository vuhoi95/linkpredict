Title: Reheating the D-brane universe via instant preheating
Authors: Sudhakar Panda and M. Sami and I. Thongkool
Abstract: We investigate a possibility of reheating in a scenario of D-brane inflation in a warped deformed conifold background which includes perturbative corrections to throat geometry sourced by chiral operator of dimension 3/2 in the CFT. The effective D-brane potential, in this case, belongs to the class of non-oscillatory models of inflation for which the conventional reheating mechanism does not work. We find that gravitational particle production is inefficient and leads to reheating temperature of the order of ${10^8} GeV$. We show that instant preheating is quite suitable to the present scenario and can easily reheat universe to a temperature which is higher by about three orders of magnitudes than its counter part associated with gravitational particle production. The reheating temperature is shown to be insensitive to a particular choice of inflationary parameters suitable to observations.
