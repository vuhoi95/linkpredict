Abstract: In our five-dimensional cosmological model, we investigate the role of a Lorentz violating vector "{\ae}ther" field on the moduli stabilization mechanism. We consider the case of a space-like {\ae}ther field on a compact circle with Maxwell-type kinetic term. The Casimir energy of certain combinations of massless and massive bulk fields generates a stabilizing potential for the radius of the compact direction while driving the accelerated expansion in the non-compact directions. It is shown that the {\ae}ther field can reduce the influence of the Casimir force and slow down the oscillation of the radion field. This property proves crucial to the stability of the extra dimension in the universe where non-relativistic matter is present. We speculate that this scenario might reveal a hidden connection between the dimensionality of spacetime and the spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry.
