Title: Loop Corrections to Cosmological Perturbations in Multi-field  Inflationary Models
Authors: Xian Gao and Fanrong Xu
Abstract: We investigate one-loop quantum corrections to the power spectrum of adiabatic perturbation from entropy modes/adiabatic mode cross-interactions in multiple DBI inflationary models. We find that due to the non-canonical kinetic term in DBI models, the loop corrections are enhanced by slow-varying parameter $\epsilon$ and small sound speed $c_s$. Thus, in general the loop-corrections in multi-DBI models can be large. Moreover, we find that the loop-corrections from adiabatic/entropy cross-interaction vertices are IR finite.
