Title: Information loss and entropy conservation in quantum corrected Hawking  radiation
Authors: Yi-Xin Chen and Kai-Nan Shao
Abstract: It was found in [Phys.Lett.B 675 (2009) 98] that information is conserved in the process of black hole evaporation, by using the tunneling formulism and considering the correlations between emitted particles. In this Letter, we shall include quantum gravity effects, by taking into account of the log-area correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The correlation between successively emitted particles is calculated, with Planck-scale corrections. By considering the black hole evaporation process, entropy conservation is checked, and the existence of black hole remnant is emphasized. We conclue in this case information can leak out through the radiation and black hole evaporation is still a unitary process.
