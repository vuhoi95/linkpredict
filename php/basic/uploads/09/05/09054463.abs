Title: On D3-brane Dynamics at Strong Warping
Authors: Heng-Yu Chen and Yu Nakayama and Gary Shiu
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a D3 brane in generic IIB warped compactifications, using the Hamiltonian formulation discussed in arXiv:0805.3700 [hep-th]. Taking into account of both closed and open string fluctuations, we derive the warped Kahler potential governing the motion of a probe D3 brane. By including the backreaction of D3, we also comment on how the problem of defining a holomorphic gauge coupling on wrapped D7 branes in warped background can be resolved.
