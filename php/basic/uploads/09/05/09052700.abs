Title: Duality covariant variables for STU-model in presence of non-holomorphic  corrections
Authors: Shamik Banerjee and Rajesh Kumar Gupta
Abstract: It is known that non-holomorphic corrections are necessary in order to get duality invariant free energy and entropy function. However the present methods of incorporating non-holomorphic corrections are in conflict with special geometry properties of moduli space. The moduli fields do not transform in duality covariant way and their duality transformation also involves the graviphoton field strength. In the present note we construct duality covariant moduli fields for STU-model perturbatively in powers of the graviphoton field strength and demonstrated their existence upto second order.
