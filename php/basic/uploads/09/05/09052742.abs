Title: De Sitter space and perpetuum mobile
Authors: Emil T. Akhmedov and P. V. Buividovich and Douglas A. Singleton
Abstract: We give general arguments that any interacting non--conformal {\it classical} field theory in de Sitter space leads to the possibility of constructing a perpetuum mobile. The arguments are based on the observation that massive free falling particles can radiate other massive particles on the classical level as seen by the free falling observer. The intensity of the radiation process is non-zero even for particles with any finite mass, i.e. with a wavelength which is within the causal domain. Hence, we conclude that either de Sitter space can not exist eternally or that one can build a perpetuum mobile.
