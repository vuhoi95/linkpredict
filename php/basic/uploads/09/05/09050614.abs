Title: On the Stability of Jordan-Brans-Dicke Static Universe
Authors: Sergio del Campo and Ramon Herrera and Pedro Labrana
Abstract: In this work we study the stability of the Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) static universe. This is motivated by the possibility that the universe might have started out in an asymptotically JBD static state, in the context of the so called emergent universe scenario. We extent our previous results on stability of JBD static universe by considering spatially homogeneous Bianchi type IX anisotropic perturbation modes and by including more general perfect fluids. Contrary to general relativity, we have found that the JBD static universe, dominated by a standard perfect fluid, could be stable against isotropic and anisotropic perturbations. The implications of these results for the initial state of the universe and its pre-inflationary evolution are discussed.
