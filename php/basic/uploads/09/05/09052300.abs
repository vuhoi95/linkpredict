Title: Scale Invariant Power Spectrum in Hořava-Lifshitz Cosmology without  Matter
Authors: Bin Chen and Shi Pi and Jin-Zhang Tang
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the physical implications of the dynamical scalar mode in pure Horava-Lifshitz gravity on cosmology. We find that it can produce a scale-invariant power spectrum in UV era if the detailed balance condition on the action is relaxed. This indicates that the physical scalar mode may seed the large scale structure and Horava-Lifshitz cosmology could be a qualified alternative to inflationary scenario.
