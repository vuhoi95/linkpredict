Abstract: We compute the one-loop scalar massless pentagon integral I_5^{6-2 eps} in D=6-2\eps dimensions in the limit of multi-Regge kinematics. This integral first contributes to the parity-odd part of the one-loop N=4 five-point MHV amplitude m_5^{(1)} at O(eps). In the high energy limit defined, the pentagon integral reduces to double sums or equivalently two-fold Mellin-Barnes integrals. By determining the O(eps) contribution to I_5^{6-2 eps}, one therefore gains knowledge of m_5^{(1)} through to O(eps^2) which is necessary for studies of the iterative structure of N=4 SYM amplitudes beyond one-loop. One immediate application is the extraction of the one-loop gluon-production vertex through to O(eps^2) and the iterative construction of the two-loop gluon-production vertex through to finite terms which is described in a companion paper. The analytic methods we have used for evaluating the pentagon integral in the high energy limit may also be applied to the hexagon integral and may ultimately give information on the form of the remainder function.
