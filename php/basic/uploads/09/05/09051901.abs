Title: Quantum Noncanonical Field Theory: Symmetries and Interaction
Authors: J. M. Carmona and J. L. Cortes and J. Indurain and D. Mazon
Abstract: The symmetry properties of a proposal to go beyond relativistic quantum field theory based on a modification of the commutation relations of fields are identified. Poincar\'e invariance in an auxiliary spacetime is found in the Lagrangian version of the path integral formulation. This invariance is contrasted with the idea of Doubly (or Deformed) Special Relativity (DSR). This analysis is then used to go from the free theory of a complex field to an interacting field theory.
