Title: Gravitino Dark Matter and Non-Gaussianity
Authors: Tomo Takahashi and Masahide Yamaguchi and Jun'ichi Yokoyama and Shuichiro Yokoyama
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations in a scenario with gravitino dark matter in the framework of modulated reheating, which is known to generate large non-Gaussianity. We show that gravitino dark matter is disfavored if primordial fluctuations have large local-type non-Gaussianity in this framework. We also briefly discuss the case with the curvaton mechanism and some other possible dark matter scenarios.
