Title: Branes and instantons intersecting at angles
Authors: Mirjam Cvetič and Iñaki García-Etxebarria and Robert Richter
Abstract: We study in detail the system of D6 branes and euclidean D2-brane instantons intersecting at angles in type IIA string theory. We find that in the absence of orientifolds the system does not contribute to the low energy superpotential, in agreement with expectations based on effective field theory arguments. We also comment on the implications of our results for dual string theory pictures.
