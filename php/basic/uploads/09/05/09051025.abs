Title: Non-perturbative renormalization group for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang  equation
Authors: Léonie Canet and Hugues Chaté and Bertrand Delamotte and Nicolás Wschebor
Abstract: We present a simple approximation of the non-perturbative renormalization group designed for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation and show that it yields the correct phase diagram, including the strong-coupling phase with reasonable scaling exponent values in physical dimensions. We find indications of a possible qualitative change of behavior around $d=4$. We discuss how our approach can be systematically improved.
