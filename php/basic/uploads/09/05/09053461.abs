Title: Second Hopf map and Yang-Coulomb system on 5d (pseudo)sphere
Authors: Stefano Bellucci and Francesco Toppan and Vahagn Yeghikyan
Abstract: Using the second Hopf map, we perform the reduction of the eight-dimensional (pseudo)spherical (Higgs)oscillator to a five-dimensional system interacting with a Yang monopole. Then, using a standard trick, we obtain, from the latter system, the pseudospherical and spherical generalizations of the Yang-Coulomb system (the five dimensional analog of MICZ-Kepler system). We present the whole set of its constants of motions, including the hidden symmetry generators given by the analog of Runge-Lenz vector. In the same way, starting from the eight-dimensional anisotropic inharmonic Higgs oscillator, we construct the integrable (pseudo)spherical generalization of the Yang-Coulomb system with the Stark term.
