Title: On two-dimensional quasitopological field theories
Authors: P. Teotonio-Sobrinho and C. Molina and N. Yokomizo
Abstract: We study a class of lattice field theories in two dimensions that includes gauge theories. We show that in these theories it is possible to implement a broader notion of local symmetry, based on semi-simple Hopf algebras. A character expansion is developed for the quasitopological field theories, and partition functions are calculated with this tool. Expected values of generalized Wilson loops are defined and studied with the character expansion.
