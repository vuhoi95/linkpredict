Title: Black hole entropy and SU(2) Chern-Simons theory
Authors: Jonathan Engle and Karim Noui and Alejandro Perez
Abstract: Black holes in equilibrium can be defined locally in terms of the so-called isolated horizon boundary condition given on a null surface representing the event horizon. We show that this boundary condition can be treated in a manifestly SU(2) invariant manner. Upon quantization, state counting is expressed in terms of the dimension of Chern-Simons Hilbert spaces on a sphere with marked points. Moreover, the counting can be mapped to counting the number of SU(2) intertwiners compatible with the spins that label the defects. The resulting BH entropy is proportional to a_H with logarithmic corrections \Delta S=-3/2 \log a_H. Our treatment from first principles completely settles previous controversies concerning the counting of states.
