Title: Q-balls in flat potentials
Authors: Edmund J. Copeland and Mitsuo I. Tsumagari
Abstract: We study the classical and absolute stability of Q-balls in scalar field theories with flat potentials arising in both gravity-mediated and gauge-mediated models. We show that the associated Q-matter formed in gravity-mediated potentials can be stable against decay into their own free particles as long as the coupling constant of the nonrenormalisable term is small, and that all of the possible three-dimensional Q-ball configurations are classically stable against linear fluctuations. Three-dimensional gauge-mediated Q-balls can be absolutely stable in the "thin-wall-like" limit, but are completely unstable in the "thick-wall" limit.
