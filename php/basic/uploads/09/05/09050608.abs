Title: Gauge field theories with covariant star-product
Authors: M. Chaichian and A. Tureanu and G. Zet
Abstract: A noncommutative gauge theory is developed using a covariant star-product between differential forms defined on a symplectic manifold, considered as the space-time. It is proven that the field strength two-form is gauge covariant and satisfies a deformed Bianchi identity. The noncommutative Yang-Mills action is defined using a gauge covariant metric on the space-time and its gauge invariance is proven up to the second order in the noncommutativity parameter.
