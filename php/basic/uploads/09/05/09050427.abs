Title: Absence of Klein's paradox for massive bosons coupled by nonminimal  vector interactions
Authors: T. R. Cardoso and L. B. Castro and A. S. de Castro
Abstract: A few properties of the nonminimal vector interactions in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory are revised. In particular, it is shown that the space component of the nonminimal vector interaction plays a peremptory role for confining bosons whereas its time component contributes to the leakage. Scattering in a square step potential with proper boundary conditions is used to show that Klein's paradox does not manifest in the case of a nonminimal vector coupling.
