Title: Influence of a Brane Tension on Phantom and Massive Scalar Field  Emission
Authors: Marek Rogatko and Agnieszka Szyp≈Çowska
Abstract: We elaborate the signature of the extra dimensions and brane tension in the process of phantom and massive scalar emission in the spacetime of (4+n)-dimensional tense brane black hole. Absorption cross section, luminosity of Hawking radiation and cross section in the low-energy approximation were found. We envisage that parameter connected with the existence of a brane imprints its role in the Hawking radiation of the considered fields.
