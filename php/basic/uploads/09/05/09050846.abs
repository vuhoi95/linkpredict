Title: F-term Uplift in Heterotic M-theory
Authors: Filipe Paccetti Correia and Michael G. Schmidt
Abstract: We investigate the viability of F-term uplift in heterotic M-theory. With this aim we explore a natural ingredient of heterotic compactifications, namely vector bundle moduli. It is shown that it is generically possible to obtain stable de Sitter vacua with broken supersymmetry provided the little Kahler potential and the prefactors of the non-perturbative superpotential are suitably tuned. An additional requirement is the existence of non-trivial gauge instantons both at the visible and hidden sectors. This is illustrated with analytical and numerical examples.
