Title: Noncommutative principal torus bundles via parametrised strict  deformation quantization
Authors: Keith Hannabuss and Varghese Mathai
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of a parametrised version of Rieffel's strict deformation quantization. We apply it to give a classification of noncommutative principal torus bundles, in terms of parametrised strict deformation quantization of ordinary principal torus bundles. The paper also contains a putative definition of noncommutative non-principal torus bundles.
