Title: Self-interacting Elko dark matter with an axis of locality
Authors: D. V. Ahluwalia and Cheng-Yang Lee and D. Schritt
Abstract: This communication is a natural and nontrivial continuation of the 2005 work of Ahluwalia and Grumiller on Elko. Here we report that Elko breaks Lorentz symmetry in a rather subtle and unexpected way by containing a `hidden' preferred direction. Along this preferred direction, a quantum field based on Elko enjoys locality. In the form reported here, Elko offers a mass dimension one fermionic dark matter with a quartic self-interaction and a preferred axis of locality. The locality result crucially depends on a judicious choice of phases.
