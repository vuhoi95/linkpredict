Title: From weak coupling to spinning strings
Authors: Lisa Freyhult and Adam Rej and Stefan Zieme
Abstract: We identify the gauge theory dual of a spinning string of minimal energy with spins S_1, S_2 on AdS_5 and charge J on S^5. For this purpose we focus on a certain set of local operators with two different types of covariant derivatives acting on complex scalar fields. We analyse the corresponding nested Bethe equations for the ground states in the limit of large spins. The auxiliary Bethe roots form certain string configurations in the complex plane, which enable us to derive integral equations for the leading and sub-leading contribution to the anomalous dimension. The results can be expressed through the observables of the sl(2) sub-sector, i.e. the cusp anomaly f(g) and the virtual scaling function B_L(g), rendering the strong-coupling analysis straightforward. Furthermore, we also study a particular sub-class of these operators specialising to a scaling limit with finite values of the second spin at weak and strong coupling.
