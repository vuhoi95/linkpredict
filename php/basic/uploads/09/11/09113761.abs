Title: Bulk Higgs field in a Randall-Sundrum model with nonvanishing brane  cosmological constant

Abstract: We consider the possibility of Higgs mechanism in the bulk in a generalised Randall-Sundrum model, where a nonvanishing cosmological constant is induced on the visible brane. This scenario has the advantage of accommodating positive tension of the visible brane and thus ensures stability of the model. It is shown that several problems usually associated with this mechanism are avoided if some dimensionful parameters in the bulk are allowed to lie a little below the Planck mass. The most important of these is keeping the lowest massive mode in the scale of the standard electroweak model, and at the same time reducing the gauge coupling of the next excited state, thus ameliorating otherwise stringent phenomenological constraints.
