Title: Penner Type Matrix Model and Seiberg-Witten Theory
Authors: Tohru Eguchi and Kazunobu Maruyoshi
Abstract: We discuss the Penner type matrix model recently proposed by Dijkgraaf and Vafa for a possible explanation of the relation between four-dimensional gauge theory and Liouville theory by making use of the connection of the matrix model to two-dimensional CFT. We first consider the relation of gauge couplings defined in UV and IR regimes of N_f = 4, N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory being related as $q_{{\rm UV}}={\vartheta_2(q_{{\rm IR}})^4/\vartheta_3(q_{{\rm IR}})^4}$. We then use this relation to discuss the action of modular transformation on the matrix model and determine its spectral curve. We also discuss the decoupling of massive flavors from the N_f = 4 matrix model and derive matrix models describing asymptotically free N = 2 gauge theories. We find that the Penner type matrix theory reproduces correctly the standard results of N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories.
