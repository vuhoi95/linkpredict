Title: Recursive representation of the torus 1-point conformal block
Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski and Paulina Suchanek
Abstract: The recursive relation for the 1-point conformal block on a torus is derived and used to prove the identities between conformal blocks recently conjectured by R. Poghossian. As an illustration of the efficiency of the recurrence method the modular invariance of the 1-point Liouville correlation function is numerically analyzed.
