Title: The Higgs boson: from the lattice to LHC
Authors: Paolo Cea and Leonardo Cosmai
Abstract: We discuss the triviality and spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario where the Higgs boson without self-interaction coexists with spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that non perturbative lattice investigations support this scenario. Moreover, from lattice simulations we predict that the Higgs boson is rather heavy. We estimate the Higgs boson mass $m_H = 754 \pm 20 {\text{(stat)}} \pm 20 {\text{(syst)}} {\text{GeV}}$ and the Higgs total width $\Gamma(H) \simeq 340 {\text{GeV}}$.
