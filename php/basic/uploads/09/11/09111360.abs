Title: Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking via Seesaw
Authors: Pavel Fileviez Perez and Hoernisa Iminniyaz and German Rodrigo and Sogee Spinner
Abstract: We present a simple scenario for gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking where the messengers are also the fields that generate neutrino masses. We show that the simplest such scenario corresponds to the case where neutrino masses are generated through the Type I and Type III seesaw mechanisms. The entire supersymmetric spectrum and Higgs masses are calculable from only four input parameters. Since the electroweak symmetry is broken through a doubly radiative mechanism, meaning a nearly zero B-term at the messenger scale which runs down to acceptable values, one obtains quite a constrained spectrum for the supersymmetric particles whose properties we describe. We refer to this mechanism as "nu-GMSB".
