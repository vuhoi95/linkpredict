Title: Formula for Fixed Point Resolution Matrix of Permutation Orbifolds
Authors: M. Maio and A. N. Schellekens
Abstract: We find a formula for the resolution of fixed points in extensions of permutation orbifold conformal field theories by its (half-)integer spin simple currents. We show that the formula gives a unitary and modular invariant S matrix.
