Title: Simple generalizations of Anti-de Sitter space-time
Authors: Joao Magueijo and Ali Mozaffari
Abstract: We consider new cosmological solutions which generalize the cosmological patch of the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, allowing for fluids with equations of state such that $w\neq -1$. We use them to derive the associated full manifolds. We find that these solutions can all be embedded in flat five-dimensional space-time with $--+++$ signature, revealing deformed hyperboloids. The topology and causal-structure of these spaces is therefore unchanged, and closed time-like curves are identified, before a covering space is considered. However the structure of Killing vector fields is entirely different and so we may expect a different structure of Killing horizons in these solutions.
