Title: Bosonic Colored Group Field Theory
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun and Jacques Magnen and Vincent Rivasseau
Abstract: Bosonic colored group field theory is considered. Focusing first on dimension four, namely the colored Ooguri group field model, the main properties of Feynman graphs are studied. This leads to a theorem on optimal perturbative bounds of Feynman amplitudes in the "ultraspin" (large spin) limit. The results are generalized in any dimension. Finally integrating out two colors we write a new representation which could be useful for the constructive analysis of this type of models.
