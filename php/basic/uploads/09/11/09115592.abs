Title: Jordanian deformation of the open XXX-spin chain
Authors: P. P. Kulish and N. Manojlovic and Z. Nagy
Abstract: The general solution to the reflection equation associated with the jordanian deformation of the SL(2) invariant Yang R-matrix is found. The same K-matrix is obtained by the special scaling limit of the XXZ-model with general boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian with the boundary terms is explicitly derived according to the Sklyanin formalism. We discuss the structure of the spectrum of the deformed XXX-model and its dependence on the boundary conditions.
