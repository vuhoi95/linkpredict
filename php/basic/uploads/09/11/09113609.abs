Title: Dimensional reduction and the phase diagram of 5d Yang-Mills theory
Authors: A. Kurkela and Ph. de Forcrand and M. Panero
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative study of the phase diagram of 5d SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with one compact extra dimension on the lattice. Assuming at least a modest scale separation between the cutoff and the compactification scales leads to an exponential separation between the compactification scale and the four-dimensional correlation length. While we demonstrate that it is not possible to take a full five-dimensional continuum limit, this dynamical generation of scale hierarchy opens up the possibility for us to make limited, but non-perturbative, predictions about continuum theories whose low-energy sector is described by an effective 5d Yang-Mills theory.
