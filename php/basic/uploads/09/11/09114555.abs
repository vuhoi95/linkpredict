Title: Symmetry and Z_2-Orbifolding Approach in Five-dimensional Lattice Gauge  Theory
Authors: K. Ishiyama and M. Murata and H. So and K. Takenaga
Abstract: In a lattice gauge-Higgs unification scenario using a Z_2-orbifolded extra-dimension, we find a new global symmetry in a case of SU(2) bulk gauge symmetry. It is a global symmetry on sites in a fixed point with respect to Z_2-orbifolding, independent of the bulk gauge symmetry. It is shown that the vacuum expectation value of a Z_2-projected Polyakov loop is a good order parameter of the new symmetry. The effective theory on lattice is also discussed.
