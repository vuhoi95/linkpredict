Title: Non-conformal limit of AGT relation from the 1-point torus conformal  block
Authors: Vasiliy Alba and Andrey Morozov
Abstract: Given a 4d N=2 SUSY gauge theory, one can construct the Seiberg-Witten prepotentional, which involves a sum over instantons. Integrals over instanton moduli spaces require regularisation. For UV-finite theories the AGT conjecture favours particular, Nekrasov's way of regularization. It implies that Nekrasov's partition function equals conformal blocks in 2d theories with W_{N_c} chiral algebra. For $N_c=2$ and one adjoint multiplet it coincides with a torus 1-point Virasoro conformal block. We check the AGT relation between conformal dimension and adjoint multiplet's mass in this case and investigate the limit of the conformal block, which corresponds to the large mass limit of the 4d theory e.i. the asymptotically free 4d N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Though technically more involved, the limit is the same as in the case of fundamental multiplets, and this provides one more non-trivial check of AGT conjecture.
