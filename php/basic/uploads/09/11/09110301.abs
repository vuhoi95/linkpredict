Authors: Bo Feng and Junqi Wang and Yihong Wang and Zhibai Zhang
Abstract: The appearance of BCFW on-shell recursion relation has deepen our understanding of quantum field theory, especially the one with gauge boson and graviton. To be able to write the BCFW recursion relation, the knowledge of boundary contributions is needed. So far, most applications have been constrained to the cases where the boundary contribution is zero. In this paper, we show that for some theories, although there is no proper deformation to annihilate the boundary contribution, its effects can be analyzed in simple way, thus we do able to write down the BCFW recursion relation with boundary contributions. The examples we will present in this paper include the lambda-phi-four theory and Yukawa coupling between fermions and scalars.
