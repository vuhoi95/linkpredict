Title: Lattice Loop Quantum Gravity
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup
Abstract: We present a separable version of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) based on an inductive system of cubic lattices. We construct semi-classical states for which the LQG operators -- the flux, the area and the volume operators -- have the right classical limits. Also, we present the Hamilton and diffeomorphism constraints as operator constraints and show that they have the right classical limit. Finally, we speculate whether the continuum limit, which these semi-classical states probe, can be defined for the entire construction and thereby restore an action of the diffeomorphism group.
