Title: The nonrelativistic limit of the Magueijo-Smolin model of deformed  special relativity
Authors: M. Coraddu and S. Mignemi
Abstract: We study the nonrelativistic limit of the motion of a classical particle in a model of deformed special relativity and of the corresponding generalized Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, and show that they reproduce nonrelativistic classical and quantum mechanics, respectively, although the rest mass of a particle no longer coincides with its inertial mass. This fact clarifies the meaning of the different definitions of velocity of a particle available in DSR literature. Moreover, the rest mass of particles and antiparticles differ, breaking the CPT invariance. This effect is close to observational limits and future experiments may give indications on its effective existence.
