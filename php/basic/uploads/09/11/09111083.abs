Title: Path Integral over Reparametrizations: Levy Flights versus Random Walks
Authors: Pavel Buividovich and Yuri Makeenko
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the path integral over reparametrizations (= the boundary value of the Liouville field in open string theory). Discretizing the path integral, we apply the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to numerical simulations of a proper (subordinator) stochastic process and find that typical trajectories are not Brownian but rather have discontinuities of the type of Levy's flights. We study a fractal structure of these trajectories and show that their Hausdorff dimension is zero. We confirm thereby the discretization and heuristic consideration of QCD scattering amplitudes by analytical and numerical calculations. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations of the path integral over reparametrization in the effective-string ansatz for a circular Wilson loop and discuss their subtleties associated with the discretization of Douglas' functional.
