Title: Dirac gaugino as leptophilic dark matter
Authors: Eung Jin Chun and Jong-Chul Park and Stefano Scopel
Abstract: We investigate the leptophilic properties of Dirac gauginos in an R--symmetric N=2 supersymmetric model with extended gauge and Higgs sectors. The annihilation of Dirac gauginos to leptons requires no chirality flip in the final states so that it is not suppressed as in the Majorana case. This implies that it can be sizable enough to explain the positron excess observed by the PAMELA experiment with moderate or no boost factors. When squark masses are heavy, the annihilation of Dirac gauginos to hadrons is controlled by their Higgsino fraction and is driven by the $hZ$ and $W^+W^-$ final states. Moreover, at variance with the Majorana case, Dirac gauginos with a non-vanishing higgsino fraction can also have a vector coupling with the $Z$ gauge boson leading to a sizable spin--independent scattering cross section off nuclei. Saturating the current antiproton limit, we show that Dirac gauginos can leave a signal in direct detection experiments at the level of the sensitivity of dark matter searches at present and in the near future.
