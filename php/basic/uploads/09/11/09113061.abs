Title: On Higher Derivatives in 3D Gravity and Higher Spin Gauge Theories
Authors: Eric A. Bergshoeff and Olaf Hohm and Paul K. Townsend
Abstract: The general second-order massive field equations for arbitrary positive integer spin in three spacetime dimensions, and their "self-dual" limit to first-order equations, are shown to be equivalent to gauge-invariant higher-derivative field equations. We recover most known equivalences for spins 1 and 2, and find some new ones. In particular, we find a non-unitary massive 3D gravity theory with a 5th order term obtained by contraction of the Ricci and Cotton tensors; this term is part of an N=2 super-invariant that includes the "extended Chern-Simons" term of 3D electrodynamics. We also find a new unitary 6th order gauge theory for "self-dual" spin 3.
