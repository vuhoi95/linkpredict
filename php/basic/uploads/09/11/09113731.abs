Title: Hidden Grassmann Structure in the XXZ Model IV: CFT limit
Authors: H. Boos and M. Jimbo and T. Miwa and F. Smirnov
Abstract: The Grassmann structure of the critical XXZ spin chain is studied in the limit to conformal field theory. A new description of Virasoro Verma modules is proposed in terms of Zamolodchikov's integrals of motion and two families of fermionic creation operators. The exact relation to the usual Virasoro description is found up to level 6.
