Title: Interpolations Among NAHE-based Supersymmetric and Nonsupersymmetric  String Vacua
Authors: Alon E. Faraggi and Mirian Tsulaia
Abstract: The quasi-realistic free fermionic heterotic-string models provide some of the most detailed examples to explore the phenomenology of string unification. While providing a powerful tool to generate models and their spectra, understanding the realisation of the free fermion models in a bosonic formalism will provide important insight into their basic properties away from the free fermion point. In this paper we elucidate bosonic equivalent of the basic symmetry breaking pattern in the free fermion models from E8XE8 to SO(16)XSO(16) and exhibit the connection of the free fermion models with corresponding non--supersymmetric vacua by interpolations.
