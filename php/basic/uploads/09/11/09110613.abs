Abstract: I review results recently obtained within the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge. In particular, I will present results for the ghost and gluon propagators and compare these with recent lattice data. Furthermore, I will give an interpretation of the inverse of the ghost form factor as the dielectric function of the Yang-Mills vacuum. Our ansatz for the vacuum wave functional will be checked by means of functional renormalization group flow equations, which are solved for the gluon energy and the ghost form factor. Finally, we calculate the Wilson loop for the vacuum wave functional obtained from the variational approach, using a Dyson equation.
