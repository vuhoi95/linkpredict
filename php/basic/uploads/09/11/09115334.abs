Title: The Schwinger-DeWitt technique for quantum effective action in brane  induced gravity models
Authors: A. O. Barvinsky and D. V. Nesterov
Abstract: We develop the Schwinger-DeWitt technique for the covariant curvature expansion of the quantum effective action for brane induced gravity models in curved spacetime. This expansion has a part nonanalytic in DGP type scale parameter, leading to the cutoff scale which is given by the geometric average of the mass of the quantum field in the bulk and DGP scale. This cutoff is much higher than the analogous strong coupling scale of the DGP model treated by weak field expansion in the tree-level approximation. The lowest orders of this curvature expansion are calculated for the case of the scalar field in the $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk with the brane carrying the $d$-dimensional kinetic term of this field. The ultraviolet divergences in this model are obtained for a particular case of $d=4$.
