Title: Chiral flavors and M2-branes at toric CY4 singularities
Authors: Francesco Benini and Cyril Closset and Stefano Cremonesi
Abstract: We extend the stringy derivation of N=2 AdS4/CFT3 dualities to cases where the M-theory circle degenerates at complex codimension-two submanifolds of a toric conical CY4. The type IIA backgrounds include D6-branes, and the dual N=2 quiver gauge theories contain chiral flavors. We provide a general recipe to derive the geometric moduli space of flavored versions of Abelian toric quiver gauge theories. The CY4 cone is reproduced thanks to a non-trivial quantum F-term relation between diagonal monopole operators and bifundamental fields. We find new field theory duals to many geometries, including Q111.
