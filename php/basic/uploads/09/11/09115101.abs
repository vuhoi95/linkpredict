Title: BRST symmetry vs. Horizon condition in Yang-Mills theories
Authors: G. Burgio and M. Quandt and H. Reinhardt
Abstract: We show that in SU(2) Yang-Mills theories a simple relation exists between lattice gluon propagators in Coulomb and Landau gauge and discuss the physical implications of such result. In particular, the realization of the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement mechanism in Coulomb gauge, linked to dual-superconductivity, would imply that the standard BRST charge must be ill defined non perturbatively. As a consequence, the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion, which relies on BRST charge conservation beyond perturbation theory, would not be fulfilled.
