Title: Plane symmetric solutions in Horava-Lifshitz theory
Authors: M. R. Setare and D. Momeni
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to find and analyze plane symmetric, static(non static) solutions in Ho\v{r}ava- Lifshitz gravity. We discussed two versions of Horava gravity. First we showed that if the detailed balance principle have considered, there are both static and non-static solutions. We show that in static case there are two family of solvable models which either of them has a well defined EOS, in analogous to the perfect fluid solutions in GR. In non-static case we find a family of solutions. Some physical properties of these solutions was discussed. Secondly we investigated the plane symmetric solutions for a new modified version of Ho\v{r}avaa gravity \cite{bla}, which has the new terms inserted action in it.
