Title: Aspects of the N=4 SYM amplitude -- Wilson polygon duality
Authors: A. Gorsky and A. Zhiboedov
Abstract: We discuss formulation of Wilson polygon - MHV amplitude duality at the perturbative level in various regularizations. For four gluons it is shown that at one loop one can formulate diagrammatic correspondence interpolating between the dimensional regularization and the off-shell one. We suggest new interpretation of all types of box diagrams in terms of the dual simplex in dimensional regularization and describe its degeneration to the Wilson polygon. The interesting nullification phenomena for the low-energy amplitudes in the Higgsed phase has been found.
