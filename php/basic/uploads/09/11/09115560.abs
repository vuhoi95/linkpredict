Title: Static black hole uniqueness and Penrose inequality
Authors: Ryosuke Mizuno and Seiju Ohashi and Tetsuya Shiromizu
Abstract: Under certain conditions, we give a new way to prove the uniqueness of static black hole in higher dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the proof, the Penrose inequality plays a key role in higher dimensions as well as four dimensions.
