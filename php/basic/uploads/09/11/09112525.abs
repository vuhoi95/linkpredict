Title: Chaotic universe in the z=2 Hovava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Yun Soo Myung and Yong-Wan Kim and Woo-Sik Son and Young-Jai Park
Abstract: The deformed z=2 Horava-Lifshitz gravity with coupling constant w leads to a nonrelativistic "mixmaster" cosmological model. The potential of theory is given by the sum of IR and UV potentials in the ADM Hamiltonian formalism. It turns out that adding the UV-potential cannot suppress chaotic behaviors existing in the IR-potential.
