Title: Maurer-Cartan Equations and Black Hole Superpotentials in N =8  Supergravity
Authors: S. Ferrara and A. Marrani and E. Orazi
Abstract: We retrieve the non-BPS extremal black hole superpotential of N=8, d=4 supergravity by using the Maurer-Cartan equations of the symmetric space E_7(7)/SU(8). This superpotential was recently obtained with different 3- and 4-dimensional techniques. The present derivation is independent on the reduction to d=3.
