Title: Vortex Content of SU(2) Calorons and Multi-Calorons
Authors: Bo Zhang and Falk Bruckmann and Ernst-Michael Ilgenfritz
Abstract: We use Laplacian Center Gauge to reveal the vortex content of single SU(2) calorons and multi-caloron systems at different holonomies. The vortex surfaces in a single SU(2) caloron consist of two parts that are induced by the constituent dyon charges and by the twist between the dyons, respectively. The latter part percolates in a caloron ensemble at maximal nontrivial holonomy. This finding fits perfectly in the confinement scenario of vortices and shows that calorons are suitable to facilitate the vortex confinement mechanism.
