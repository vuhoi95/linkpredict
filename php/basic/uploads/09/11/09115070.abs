Title: Extremal Kerr/CFT correspondence of five-dimensional rotating (charged)  black holes with squashed horizons
Authors: Jun-Jin Peng and Shuang-Qing Wu
Abstract: A new holographic duality named Kerr/CFT correspondence was recently proposed to derive the statistical entropy of four-dimensional extremal Kerr black holes via identifying the quantum states in the near-horizon region with those of two-dimensional conformal field theory living on the boundary. In this paper, we apply this method to investigate five-dimensional extremal Kerr and Cveti\v{c}-Youm black holes with squashed horizons in different coordinates and find that the near-horizon geometries are not affected by the squashing transformation. Our investigation shows that the microscopic entropies are in agreement with those given by Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In addition, we have also investigated thermodynamics of the general non-extremal Cveti\v{c}-Youm black holes with squashed horizons.
