Title: N-Body Nuclear Forces at Short Distances in Holographic QCD
Authors: Koji Hashimoto and Norihiro Iizuka and Takashi Nakatsukasa
Abstract: We provide a calculation of N-body (N>2) nucleon interactions at short distances in holographic QCD. In the Sakai-Sugimoto model of large N_c massless QCD, N baryons are described by N Yang-Mills instantons in 5 spacetime dimensions. We compute a classical short distance interaction hamiltonian for N 'tHooft instantons. This corresponds to N baryons sharing identical classical spins and isospins. We find that genuine N-body nuclear forces turn out to vanish for N>2, at the leading order. This suggests that classical N-body forces are always suppressed compared with 2-body forces.
