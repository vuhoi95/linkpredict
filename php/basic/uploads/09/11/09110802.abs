Title: On the global structure of the Pomeransky-Senkov black holes
Authors: Piotr T. Chruściel and Julien Cortier and Alfonso García-Parrado Gómez-Lobo
Abstract: We construct analytic extensions of the Pomeransky-Senkov metrics with multiple Killing horizons and asymptotic regions. We show that, in our extensions, the singularities associated to an obstruction to differentiability of the metric lie beyond event horizons. We analyze the topology of the non-empty singular set, which turns out to be parameter-dependent. We present numerical evidence for stable causality of the domain of outer communications. The resulting global structure is somewhat reminiscent of that of Kerr space-time.
