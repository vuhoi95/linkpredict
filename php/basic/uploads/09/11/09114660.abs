Title: Parity effects in the scaling of block entanglement in gapless spin  chains
Authors: Pasquale Calabrese and Massimo Campostrini and Fabian Essler and Bernard Nienhuis
Abstract: We consider the Renyi alpha-entropies for Luttinger liquids (LL). For large block lengths l these are known to grow like ln l. We show that there are subleading terms that oscillate with frequency 2k_F (the Fermi wave number of the LL) and exhibit a universal power-law decay with l. The new critical exponent is equal to K/(2 alpha), where K is the LL parameter. We present numerical results for the anisotropic XXZ model and the full analytic solution for the free fermion (XX) point.
