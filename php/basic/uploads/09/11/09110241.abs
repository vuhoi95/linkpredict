Title: Separating expansion from contraction: generalized TOV condition, LTB  models with pressure and $Λ$CDM
Authors: Morgan Le Delliou and Filipe C. Mena and José Pedro Mimoso
Abstract: We discuss the existence of a dividing shell separating expanding and collapsing regions in spherically symmetric solutions with pressure. We obtain gauge invariant conditions relating not only the intrinsic spatial curvature of the shells to the ADM mass, but also a function of the pressure which we introduce that generalises the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equilibrium condition, in the framework of a 3+1 spacetime splitting. We consider the particular case of a Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi dust models with a cosmological constant (a $\Lambda$-CDM model) as an example of our results.
