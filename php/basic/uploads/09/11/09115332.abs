Title: An Analytic Result for the Two-Loop Hexagon Wilson Loop in N = 4 SYM
Authors: Vittorio Del Duca and Claude Duhr and Vladimir A. Smirnov
Abstract: In the planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the conformal symmetry constrains multi-loop n-edged Wilson loops to be basically given in terms of the one-loop n-edged Wilson loop, augmented, for n greater than 6, by a function of conformally invariant cross ratios. We identify a class of kinematics for which the Wilson loop exhibits exact Regge factorisation and which leave invariant the analytic form of the multi-loop n-edged Wilson loop. In those kinematics, the analytic result for the Wilson loop is the same as in general kinematics, although the computation is remarkably simplified with respect to general kinematics. Using the simplest of those kinematics, we have performed the first analytic computation of the two-loop six-edged Wilson loop in general kinematics.
