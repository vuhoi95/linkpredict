Title: Topological Casimir effect in power-law FRW cosmologies
Authors: A. L. Mkhitaryan and A. A. Saharian
Abstract: We investigate the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor for a massless scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified dimensions. When the comoving lengths of the compact dimensions are short compared to the Hubble length, the topological parts coincide with those for a conformal coupling. This limit corresponds to the adiabatic approximation. In the opposite limit of large comoving lengths of the compact dimensions, in dependence of the curvature coupling parameter, two regimes are realized with monotonic or oscillatory behavior of the vacuum expectation values.
