Abstract: In the baryogenesis via leptogenesis scenario the self-energy contribution to the CP-violating parameter plays a very important role. Here, we calculate it in a simple toy model of leptogenesis using the Schwinger-Keldysh/Kadanoff-Baym formalism as starting point. We show that the formalism is free of the double-counting problem typical for the canonical Boltzmann approach. Within the toy model, medium effects increase the CP-violating parameter. In contrast to results obtained earlier in the framework of thermal field theory, the medium corrections are linear in the particle number densities. In the resonant regime quantum corrections lead to modified expressions for the CP-violating parameter and for the decay width. Most notably, in the maximal resonant regime the Boltzmann picture breaks down and an analysis in the full Kadanoff-Baym formalism is required.
