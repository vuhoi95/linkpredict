Title: Electromagnetic Casimir Effect in Wedge Geometry and the Energy-Momentum  Tensor in Media
Authors: I. Brevik and S. A. Ellingsen and K. A. Milton
Abstract: The wedge geometry closed by a circular-cylindrical arc is a nontrivial generalization of the cylinder, which may have various applications. If the radial boundaries are not perfect conductors, the angular eigenvalues are only implicitly determined. When the speed of light is the same on both sides of the wedge, the Casimir energy is finite, unlike the case of a perfect conductor, where there is a divergence associated with the corners where the radial planes meet the circular arc. We advance the study of this system by reporting results on the temperature dependence for the conducting situation. We also discuss the appropriate choice of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor.
