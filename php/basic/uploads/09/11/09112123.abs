Title: Voros product, Noncommutative Schwarzschild Black Hole and Corrected  Area Law
Authors: Rabin Banerjee and Sunandan Gangopadhyay and Sujoy Kumar Modak
Abstract: We show the importance of the Voros product in defining a noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole. The corrected entropy/area-law is then computed in the tunneling formalism. Two types of corrections are considered; one, due to the effects of noncommutativity and the other, due to the effects of going beyond the semiclassical approximation. The leading correction to the semiclassical entropy/area-law is logarithmic and its coefficient involves the noncommutative parameter.
