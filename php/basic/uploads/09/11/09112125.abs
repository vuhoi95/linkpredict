Title: Holonomy Groups Coming From F-Theory Compactification
Authors: Adil Belhaj and Luis J. Boya and Antonio Segui
Abstract: We study holonomy groups coming from F-theory compactifications. We focus mainly on SO(8) as 12-4=8 and subgroups SU(4), Spin(7), G2 and SU(3) suitable for descent from F-theory, M-theory and Superstring theories. We consider the relation of these groups with the octonions, which is striking and reinforces their role in higher dimensions and dualities. These holonomy groups are related in various mathematical forms, which we exhibit.
