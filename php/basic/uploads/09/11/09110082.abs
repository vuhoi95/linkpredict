Abstract: The existence of gauge (Gribov) copies disturbs the usual Faddeev-Popov quantization procedure in the Landau gauge. It is a very hard job to treat these in the continuum, even in a partial manner. A decent way to do so was worked out by Gribov, and later on by Zwanziger. The final point was a renormalizable action (the Gribov-Zwanziger action), implementing the restriction of the path integration to the so-called Gribov region, which is free of a subset of gauge copies, but not of all copies. Till recently, everybody agreed upon the fact that the restriction to the Gribov region implied a infrared enhanced ghost, and vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator. We discuss how the Gribov-Zwanziger action naturally leads to the existence of vacuum condensates of dimension two. As it is very common, such condensates can seriously alter the dynamics. In particular, the Gribov-Zwanziger condensates give rise to a gluon propagator with a finite but nonvanishing zero momentum limit, and reconstitute a nonenhanced ghost. We call this the refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework. The predictions are in qualitative agreement with most recent lattice simulations, and certain solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. A crucial feature of the Gribov-Zwanziger framework is the soft (controllable) breaking of the BRST symmetry. We also point out that imposing the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion on the Faddeev-Popov theory as a boundary condition from the beginning leads to the same partition function as of Gribov-Zwanziger, with associated BRST symmetry breaking. This clouds the interpretation of the Kugo-Ojima criterion in se.
