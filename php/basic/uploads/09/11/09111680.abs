Title: The Heavy Quark Free-Energy at T<Tc in AdS/QCD
Authors: K. Veshgini and E. Megias and J. Nian and H. J. Pirner
Abstract: Starting with the modified AdS/QCD metric developed in Ref.[1] we use the Nambu-Goto action to obtain the free energy of a quark-antiquark pair at T<Tc, for which we show that the effective string tension goes to zero at Tc=154MeV.
