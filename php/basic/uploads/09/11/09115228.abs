Title: String instanton in AdS(4)xCP(3)
Authors: Alessandra Cagnazzo and Dmitri Sorokin and Linus Wulff
Abstract: We study the string instanton wrapping a non-trivial two-cycle in CP(3) of the type IIA string theory compactified on AdS_4 x CP(3) superspace and find that it has twelve fermionic zero modes associated with 1/2 of the supersymmetry of the background thus manifesting that this classical instanton configuration is 1/2 BPS
