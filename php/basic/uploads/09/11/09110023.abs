Abstract: We calculate elastic and non-elastic electromagnetic form factors for vector and axial-vector mesons in the holographic D4-D8 brane model. We obtain the mass spectrum and Regge trajectories for these particles. From the elastic form factors we extract the electric radius, the magnetic and quadrupole moments. Form factors for transverse and longitudinal polarizations are also obtained. We find superconvergence sum rules for the vector and axial-vector meson couplings that determine the asymptotic behavior of the form factors at large momentum transfer. Our results show good agreement with other holographic models and QCD.
