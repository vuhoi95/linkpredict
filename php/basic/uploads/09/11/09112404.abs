Title: Emergent Dirac Hamiltonians in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Johannes Aastrup and Jesper M. Grimstrup and Mario Paschke
Abstract: We modify the construction of the spectral triple over an algebra of holonomy loops by introducing additional parameters in form of families of matrices. These matrices generalize the already constructed Euler-Dirac type operator over a space of connections. We show that these families of matrices can naturally be interpreted as parameterizing foliations of 4-manifolds. The corresponding Euler-Dirac type operators then induce Dirac Hamiltonians associated to the corresponding foliation, in the previously constructed semi-classical states.
