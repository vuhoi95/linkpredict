Authors: P. S. Bisht and Tianjun Li and Pushpa and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: We have studied the different symmetric properties of the generalized Maxwell's - Dirac equation along with their quantum properties. Applying the parity (\mathcal{P}), time reversal (\mathcal{T}), charge conjugation (\mathcal{C}) and their combined effect like parity time reversal (\mathcal{PT}), charge conjugation and parity (\mathcal{CP}) and \mathcal{CP}T transformations to varius equations of generalized fields of dyons, it is shown that the corresponding dynamical quantities and equations of dyons are invariant under these discrete symmetries. Abstract Key words- parity, time reversal, charge-conjugation, dyons Abstract PACS No.- 14.80 Hv.
