Title: Dynamics of Toroidal Spiral Strings around Five-dimensional Black Holes
Authors: Takahisa Igata and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: We examine the separability of the Nambu-Goto equation for test strings in a shape of toroidal spiral in a five-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole. In particular, for a `{\it Hopf loop}\rq string which is a special class of the toroidal spiral strings, we show the complete separation of variables occurs in two cases, Kerr background and Kerr-AdS background with equal angular momenta. We also obtain the dynamical solution for the Hopf loop around a black hole and for the general toroidal spiral in Minkowski background.
