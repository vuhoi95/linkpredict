Title: Covariant propagator in AdS5 x S5 superspace
Authors: Peng Dai and Ru-Nan Huang and Warren Siegel
Abstract: We give an explicit superspace propagator for the chiral scalar field strength of 10D IIB supergravity on an AdS5 x S5 background. Because this space is conformally flat, the propagator is very simple, almost identical to that of flat space. We also give an explicit expansion over the Kaluza-Klein modes of S5. The fact that the full propagator is so much simpler suggests that, as in 2D conformal field theory, AdS/CFT calculations would be simpler without a mode expansion.
