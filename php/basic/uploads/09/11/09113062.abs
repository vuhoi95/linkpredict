Title: Gravitating Semilocal strings
Authors: Betti Hartmann and Jon Urrestilla
Abstract: We discuss the properties of semilocal strings minimally coupled to gravity. Semilocal strings are solutions of the bosonic sector of the Standard Model in the limit $\sin^2\theta_W=1$ (where $\theta_W$ is the Weinberg angle) and correspond to embedded Abelian-Higgs strings for a particular choice of the scalar doublet. We focus on the limit where the gauge boson mass is equal to the Higgs boson mass such that the solutions fulfill the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound.
