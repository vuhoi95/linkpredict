Title: Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking, with Flavor
Authors: Nathaniel Craig and Rouven Essig and Sebastian Franco and Shamit Kachru and Gonzalo Torroba
Abstract: We explore calculable models with low-energy supersymmetry where the flavor hierarchy is generated by quark and lepton compositeness, and where the composites emerge from the same sector that dynamically breaks supersymmetry. The observed pattern of Standard Model fermion masses and mixings is obtained by identifying the various generations with composites of different dimension in the ultraviolet. These "single-sector" supersymmetry breaking models give rise to various spectra of soft masses which are, in many cases, quite distinct from what is commonly found in models of gauge or gravity mediation. In typical models which satisfy all flavor-changing neutral current constraints, both the first and second generation sparticles have masses of order 20 TeV, while the stop mass is near 1 TeV. In other cases, all sparticles obtain masses of order 1 TeV predominantly from gauge mediation, even though the first two generations are composite.
