Title: Physical significances of NL/L SUSY relation
Authors: Kazunari Shima and Motomu Tsuda
Abstract: We discuss explicitly the details and some remarkable physical consequences of the NL/L SUSY relation between N = 2 LSUSY QED and N = 2 NLSUSY in two-dimensional space-time, which may show the potential of the SUSY composite model for the theory of everything beyond the SM.
