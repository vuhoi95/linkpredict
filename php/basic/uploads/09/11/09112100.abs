Title: Cosmological Imprints of Pre-Inflationary Particles
Authors: Anastasia Fialkov and Nissan Itzhaki and Ely D. Kovetz
Abstract: We study some of the cosmological imprints of pre-inflationary particles. We show that each such particle provides a seed for a spherically symmetric cosmic defect. The profile of this cosmic defect is fixed and its magnitude is linear in a single parameter that is determined by the mass of the pre-inflationary particle. We study the CMB and peculiar velocity imprints of this cosmic defect and suggest that it could explain some of the large scale cosmological anomalies.
