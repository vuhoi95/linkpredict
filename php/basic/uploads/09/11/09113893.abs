Title: Relating chronology protection and unitarity through holography
Authors: Joris Raeymaekers and Dieter Van den Bleeken and Bert Vercnocke
Abstract: We give a simple nonsupersymmetric example in which chronology protection follows from unitarity and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider a ball of homogeneous, rotating dust in global AdS3 whose backreaction produces a region of Goedel space inside the ball. We solve the Israel matching conditions to find the geometry outside of the dust ball and compute its quantum numbers in the dual CFT. When the radius of the dust ball exceeds a certain critical value, the spacetime will contain closed timelike curves. Our main observation is that precisely when this critical radius is exceeded, a unitarity bound in the dual CFT is violated, leading to a holographic argument for chronology protection.
