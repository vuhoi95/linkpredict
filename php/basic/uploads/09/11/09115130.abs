Title: Flow by mean curvature inside a moving ambient space
Authors: Annibale Magni and Carlo Mantegazza and Efstratios Tsatis
Abstract: We show some computations related to the motion by mean curvature flow of a submanifold inside an ambient Riemannian manifold evolving by Ricci or backward Ricci flow. Special emphasis is given to the possible generalization of Huisken's monotonicity formula and its connection with the validity of some Li--Yau--Hamilton differential Harnack--type inequalities in a moving Riemannian manifold.
