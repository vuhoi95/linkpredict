Title: Transformations of triangle ladder diagrams
Authors: Igor Kondrashuk and Alvaro Vergara
Abstract: It is shown how dual space diagrammatic representation of momentum integrals corresponding to triangle ladder diagrams with an arbitrary number of rungs can be transformed to half-diamonds. In paper arXiv:0803.3420 [hep-th] the half-diamonds were related by conformal integral substitution to the diamonds which represent the dual space image of four-point ladder integrals in the four-dimensional momentum space. Acting in the way described in the present paper we do not need to use the known result for diamond (four-point) diagrams as an external input in deriving relations of arXiv:0803.3420 [hep-th], however, that result for the diamond diagram arises in the present proof as an intermediate consequence in a step-by-step diagrammatic transformation from the triangle ladder diagram to the half-diamond diagrams.
