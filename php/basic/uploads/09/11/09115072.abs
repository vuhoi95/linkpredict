Title: Maxwell Superalgebra and Superparticle in Constant Gauge Backgrounds
Authors: Sotirios Bonanos and Joaquim Gomis and Kiyoshi Kamimura and Jerzy Lukierski
Abstract: We present SuperMaxwell algebra: an N=1, D=4 algebra with two Majorana supercharges, obtained as the minimal enlargement of superPoincare containing the Maxwell algebra as a subalgebra. The new superalgebra describes the supersymmetries of generalized N=1, D=4 superspace in the presence of a constant Abelian SUSY field strength background. Applying the techniques of non-linear coset realization to the Maxwell supergroup we propose a new kappa-invariant massless superparticle model providing a dynamical realization of the SuperMaxwell algebra.
