Title: Higher Equations of Motion in Boundary Liouville Field Theory
Authors: A. Belavin and V. Belavin
Abstract: In addition to the ordinary bulk higher equations of motion in the boundary version of the Liouville conformal field theory, an infinite set of relations containing the boundary operators is found. These equations are in one-to-one correspondence with the singular representations of the Virasoro algebra. We comment on the possible applications in the context of minimal boundary Liouville gravity.
