Title: Super duality and irreducible characters of ortho-symplectic Lie  superalgebras
Authors: Shun-Jen Cheng and Ngau Lam and Weiqiang Wang
Abstract: We formulate and establish a super duality which connects parabolic categories $O$ between the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras and classical Lie algebras of $BCD$ types. This provides a complete and conceptual solution of the irreducible character problem for the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras in a parabolic category $O$, which includes all finite-dimensional irreducible modules, in terms of classical Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
