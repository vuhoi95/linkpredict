Abstract: We study correlation functions in (0+1)-dimensional maximally supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory, which represents the low-energy effective theory of D0-branes. In the large-N limit, the gauge-gravity duality predicts power-law behaviors in the infrared region for the two-point correlation functions of operators corresponding to supergravity modes. We evaluate such correlation functions on the gauge theory side by the Monte Carlo method. Clear power-law behaviors are observed at N=3, and the predicted exponents are confirmed consistently. Our results suggest that the agreement extends to the M-theory regime, where the supergravity analysis in 10 dimensions may not be justified a priori.
