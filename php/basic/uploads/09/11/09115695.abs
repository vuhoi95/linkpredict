Title: Quantum mechanics in de Sitter space
Authors: Subir Ghosh and Salvatore Mignemi
Abstract: We consider some possible phenomenological implications of the extended uncertainty principle, which is believed to hold for quantum mechanics in de Sitter spacetime. The relative size of the corrections to the standard results is however of the order of the ratio between the length scale of the quantum mechanical system and the de Sitter radius, and therefore exceedingly small. Nevertheless, the existence of effects due to the large scale curvature of spacetime in atomic experiments has a theoretical relevance.
