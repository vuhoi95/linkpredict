Title: Fermion localization on asymmetric two-field thick branes
Authors: Zhen-Hua Zhao and Yu-Xiao Liu and Hai-Tao Li
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the localization of fermions on asymmetric thick branes generated by two scalars $\phi$ and $\chi$. In order to trap fermions on the asymmetric branes with kink-like warp factors, the couplings with the background scalars $\eta\bar{\Psi}F(\chi,\phi)\Psi$ are introduced, where $F(\chi,\phi)$ is a function of $\phi$ and $\chi$. We find that the coupling $\eta\bar{\Psi}\chi\phi\Psi$ do not support the localization of 4-dimensional fermions on the branes. While, for the case $\eta\bar{\Psi}\chi\Psi+\eta'\bar{\Psi}\phi\Psi$, which is the kink-fermion coupling corresponding to one-scalar-generated brane scenarios, the zero mode of left-handed fermions could be trapped on the branes under some conditions.
