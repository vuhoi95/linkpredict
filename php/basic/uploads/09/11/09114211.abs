Title: Proper time is stochastic time in 2d quantum gravity
Authors: J. Ambjorn and R. Loll and Y. Watabiki and W. Westra and S. Zohren
Abstract: We show that proper time, when defined in the quantum theory of 2d gravity, becomes identical to the stochastic time associated with the stochastic quantization of space. This observation was first made by Kawai and collaborators in the context of 2d Euclidean quantum gravity, but the relation is even simpler and more transparent in he context of 2d gravity formulated in the framework of CDT (causal dynamical triangulations).
