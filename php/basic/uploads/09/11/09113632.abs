Title: Normalizable fermion modes in a holographic superconductor
Authors: Steven S. Gubser and Fabio D. Rocha and Pedro Talavera
Abstract: We consider fermions in a zero-temperature superconducting anti-de Sitter domain wall solution and find continuous bands of normal modes. These bands can be either partially filled or totally empty and gapped. We present a semi-classical argument which approximately captures the main features of the normal mode spectrum.
