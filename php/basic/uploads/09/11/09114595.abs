Title: On the unipotence of autoequivalences of toric complete intersection  Calabi-Yau categories
Authors: Manfred Herbst and Johannes Walcher
Abstract: We identify a class of autoequivalences of triangulated categories of singularities associated with Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties. Elements of this class satisfy relations that are directly linked to the toric data.
