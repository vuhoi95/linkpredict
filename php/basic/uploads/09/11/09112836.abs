Title: The Goldstino Field in Linear and Nonlinear Realizations of  Supersymmetry
Authors: Hui Luo and Mingxing Luo and Liucheng Wang
Abstract: A Goldstino field in the nonlinear realization of supersymmetry is constructed from an appropriate chiral super-multiplet of the linear theory, in general O'Raifeataigh-like models. The linear theories can thus be reformulated into their nonlinear versions, via the standard procedure. The Goldstino field disappears totally from the original Lagrangian in the process, but reemerges in the Jacobian of the transformation and covariant derivatives. Vertices with Goldstino fields carry at least one space-time derivative, as one would have expected.
