Title: Zhu's algebra and the $C_2$-algebra in the symplectic and the orthogonal  cases
Authors: Evgeny Feigin and Peter Littelmann
Abstract: We prove that Zhu's algebra and the $C_2$-algebra of type ${\tt C}_m$ have the same dimension, and we compute the graded character of the latter. Maximal parabolic subalgebras of the symplectic algebra play a central role in our construction. For the orthogonal algebras our methods do not allow to describe the whole $C_2$-algebras, we get only a description of a certain quotient of the algebra.
