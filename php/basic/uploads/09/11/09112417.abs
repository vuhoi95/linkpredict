Title: Semiclassical rigid strings with two spins in AdS_5
Authors: A. Tirziu and A. A. Tseytlin
Abstract: Semiclassical spinning string states in AdS_5 are, in general, characterised by the three SO(2,4) conserved charges: the energy E and the two spins S_1 and S_2. We discuss several examples of explicit classical solutions for rigid closed strings of (bended) circular shape with two non-zero spins. In particular, we identify a solution that should represent a state that has minimal energy for large values of the two equal spins. Similarly to the spiky string in AdS_3, in the large spin limit this string develops long "arcs" that stretch towards the boundary of AdS_5. This allows the string to increase the spin while having the energy growing only logarithmically with S=S_1 +S_2. The large spin asymptotics of such solutions is effectively controlled by their near-boundary parts which, as in the spiky string case, happen to be SO(2,4) equivalent to segments of the straight folded spinning string. As a result, the coefficient of the \log S term in the string energy should be given, up to an overall 3/2 coefficient, by the same universal scaling function (cusp anomaly) as in the folded string case, to all orders in the inverse string tension or strong-coupling expansion.
