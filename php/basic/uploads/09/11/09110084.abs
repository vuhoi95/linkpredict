Title: The long-range interactions between branes in diverse dimensions
Authors: Rong-Jun Wu and Zhao-Long Wang
Abstract: We calculate the long-range interactions between two simple branes placed parallel at a separation in diverse dimensions via an effective field theory approach. We also compute for the first time the explicit long-range interaction between two D-branes with each carrying a world-volume non-abelian magnetic flux in three special cases, respectively. In particular, we demonstrate that the half-string creation between a D$_0$-brane and a D$_8$-brane continues to hold even in the present context, therefore lending further support to the previous assertion of this. Our computations re-raise also the issue in one case on whether so constructed (D$_0$, D$_8$) bound state is actually a marginal one.
