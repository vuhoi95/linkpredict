Authors: Irina Ya. Aref'eva and Nikolay V. Bulatov and Sergey Yu. Vernov
Abstract: The stability of isotropic cosmological solutions for two-field models in the Bianchi I metric is considered. We prove that the sufficient conditions for the Lyapunov stability in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric provide the stability with respect to anisotropic perturbations in the Bianchi I metric and with respect to the cold dark matter energy density fluctuations. Sufficient conditions for the Lyapunov stability of the isotropic fixed points of the system of the Einstein equations have been found. We use the superpotential method to construct stable kink-type solutions and obtain sufficient conditions on the superpotential for the Lyapunov stability of the corresponding exact solutions. We analyze the stability of isotropic kink-type solutions for string field theory inspired cosmological models.
