Title: Toroidal Spiral Nambu-Goto Strings around Higher-Dimensional Black Holes
Authors: Takahisa Igata and Hideki Ishihara
Abstract: We present solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation for test strings in a shape of toroidal spiral in five-dimensional spacetimes. In particular, we show that stationary toroidal spirals exist around the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes. We also show the existence of innermost stationary toroidal spirals around the five-dimensional black holes like geodesic particles orbiting around four-dimensional black holes.
