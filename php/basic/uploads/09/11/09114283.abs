Title: Numerical determination of entanglement entropy for a sphere
Authors: R. Lohmayer and H. Neuberger and A. Schwimmer and S. Theisen
Abstract: We apply Srednicki's regularization to extract the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy produced by tracing out a real, massless, scalar field inside a three dimensional sphere in 3+1 flat spacetime. We find numerically that the coefficient of the logarithm is -1/90 to 0.2 percent accuracy, in agreement with an existing analytical result.
