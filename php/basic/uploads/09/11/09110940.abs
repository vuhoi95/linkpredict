Abstract: We consider a self-consistent Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond system in the bulk D=4 space-time interacting with a variable-tension electrically charged lightlike brane. The latter serves both as a material and charge source for gravity and electromagnetism, as well as it dynamically generates a bulk space varying cosmological constant. We find an asymmetric wormhole solution describing two "universes" with different spherically symmetric black-hole-type geometries connected through a "throat" occupied by the lightlike brane. The electrically neutral "left universe" comprises the exterior region of Schwarzschild-de-Sitter (or pure Schwarzschild) space-time above the inner (Schwarzschild-type) horizon, whereas the electrically charged "right universe" consists of the exterior Reissner-Nordstroem (or Reissner-Nordstroem-de-Sitter) black hole region beyond the outer Reissner-Nordstroem horizon. All physical parameters of the wormhole are uniquely determined by two free parameters - the electric charge and Kalb-Ramond coupling of the lightlike brane.
