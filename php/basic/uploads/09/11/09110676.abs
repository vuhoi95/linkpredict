Title: Gluon Thermodynamics at Intermediate Coupling
Authors: Jens O. Andersen and Michael Strickland and Nan Su
Abstract: We calculate the thermodynamic functions of Yang-Mills theory to three-loop order using the hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory reorganization of finite temperature quantum field theory. We show that at three-loop order hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory is compatible with lattice results for the pressure, energy density, and entropy down to temperatures T ~ 2 - 3 T_c.
