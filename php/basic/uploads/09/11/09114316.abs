Title: Effects of flavor-symmetry violation from staggered fermion lattice  simulations of graphene
Authors: Joel Giedt and Andrew Skinner and Saroj Nayak
Abstract: We analyze the effects of flavor splitting from staggered fermion lattice simulations of graphene. Both the unimproved action, and the tadpole improved action with a Naik term show significant flavor symmetry breaking in the spectrum of the Dirac operator. We also measure the average plaquette term and describe how it calls for a reinterpretation of previous lattice Monte Carlo simulation results, due to tadpole improvement. From this we infer that the simulations are indicative of a semi-metal phase for suspended graphene.
