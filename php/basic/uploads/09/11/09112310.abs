Title: Interacting Dark Matter as an Alternative to Dark Energy
Authors: Spyros Basilakos and Manolis Plionis
Abstract: We investigate the global dynamics of the universe within the framework of the Interacting Dark Matter (IDM) scenario. Considering that the dark matter obeys the collisional Boltzmann equation, we can obtain analytical solutions of the global density evolution, which can accommodate an accelerated expansion, equivalent to either the {\em quintessence} or the standard $\Lambda$ models. This is possible if there is a disequilibrium between the DM particle creation and annihilation processes with the former process dominating, which creates an effective source term with negative pressure. Comparing the predicted Hubble expansion of one of the IDM models (the simplest) with observational data, we find that the effective annihilation term is quite small, as suggested by various experiments.
