Title: Smooth Initial Conditions from Weak Gravity
Authors: Brian Greene and Kurt Hinterbichler and Simon Judes and Maulik K. Parikh
Abstract: CMB measurements reveal an unnaturally smooth early universe. We propose a mechanism to make this smoothness natural by weakening the strength of gravity at early times, and therefore altering which initial conditions have low entropy.
