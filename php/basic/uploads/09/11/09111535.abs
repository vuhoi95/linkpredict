Title: General static spherically symmetric solutions in Horava gravity
Authors: Dario Capasso and Alexios P. Polychronakos
Abstract: We derive general static spherically symmetric solutions in the Horava theory of gravity with nonzero shift field. These represent "hedgehog" versions of black holes with radial "hair" arising from the shift field. For the case of the standard de Witt kinetic term (lambda =1) there is an infinity of solutions that exhibit a deformed version of reparametrization invariance away from the general relativistic limit. Special solutions also arise in the anisotropic conformal point lambda = 1/3.
