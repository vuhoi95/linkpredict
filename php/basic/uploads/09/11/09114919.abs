Title: BRST, anti-BRST and their geometry
Authors: L. Bonora and R. P. Malik
Abstract: We continue the comparison between the field theoretical and geometrical approaches to the gauge field theories of various types, by deriving their Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST trasformation properties and comparing them with the geometrical properties of the bundles and gerbes. In particular, we provide the geometrical interpretation of the so--called Curci-Ferrari conditions that are invoked for the absolute anticommutativity of the BRST and anti-BRST symmetry transformations in the context of non-Abelian 1-form gauge theories as well as Abelian gauge theory that incorporates a 2-form gauge field. We also carry out the explicit construction of the 3-form gauge fields and compare it with the geometry of 2--gerbes.
