Title: Laplacians in polar matrix coordinates and radial fermionization in  higher dimensions
Authors: Mthokozisi Masuku and Jo√£o P. Rodrigues
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of two, space indexed, hermitean matrices. By introducing matrix valued polar coordinates, we obtain the form of the laplacian acting on invariant states. For potentials depending only on the eigenvalues of the radial matrix, we establish that the radially invariant sector is equivalent to a system of non interacting 2+1 dimensional fermions, and obtain its density description. For a larger number of matrices, the presence of a repulsive radial inter-eigenvalue potential is identified.
