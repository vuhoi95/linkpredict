Title: Electrostatics approach to closed string pair production from a decaying  D-brane
Authors: Niko Jokela and Matti Jarvinen and Esko Keski-Vakkuri
Abstract: We consider the emission of two closed string tachyons from a decaying Dp-brane in bosonic string theory. We study the high energy limit of the emission amplitude by using an analogue to electrostatics. The case where the emitted strings have equal energies is analyzed in detail, and we obtain a relatively simple result for the emission amplitude. We identify expected poles for s- and t-channel emission. In the high energy limit, the amplitude decays exponentially (~e^{-2\pi\omega}) or faster in the energies \omega of the closed strings.
