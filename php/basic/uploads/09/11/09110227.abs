Title: Three-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian and asymptotic analysis in 1+1  QED
Authors: I. Huet and D. G. C. McKeon and C. Schubert
Abstract: In recent years, the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian has been shown to be a useful tool for the analysis of the asymptotic growth of the N-photon amplitudes at large N. Moreover, certain results and conjectures on its imaginary part allow one, using Borel analysis, to make predictions for those amplitudes at large loop orders. Extending work by G.V. Dunne and one of the authors to the three-loop level, but in the simpler context of 1+1 dimensional QED, we calculate the corresponding Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, analyse its weak field expansion, and study the congruence with predictions obtained from worldline instantons. We discuss the relevance of these issues for Cvitanovic's conjecture.
