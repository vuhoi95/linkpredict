Title: Critical dynamics of decoherence
Authors: Bogdan Damski and H. T. Quan and Wojciech H. Zurek
Abstract: We study decoherence induced by a dynamic environment undergoing a quantum phase transition. Environment's susceptibility to perturbations - and, consequently, efficiency of decoherence - is amplified near a critical point. Over and above this near-critical susceptibility increase, we show that decoherence is dramatically enhanced by non-equilibrium critical dynamics of the environment. We derive a simple expression relating decoherence to the universal critical exponents exhibiting deep connections with the theory of topological defect creation in non-equilibrium phase transitions.
