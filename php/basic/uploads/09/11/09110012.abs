Title: Branes and instantons at angles and the F-theory lift of O(1) instantons
Authors: Mirjam Cvetič and Iñaki García-Etxebarria and Robert Richter
Abstract: We discuss the physics of D-branes and D-brane instantons intersecting at angles, focusing on the (non)generation of a superpotential in the worldvolume theory of the branes. This is a short review of the results in arXiv:0905.1694, where we further emphasize both the macroscopic and microscopic structure of the manifestly supersymmetric instanton action. We also comment on the lift of O(1) instantons to F-theory.
