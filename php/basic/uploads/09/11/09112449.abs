Title: The large N limit of four dimensional Yang-Mills field coupled to  adjoint fermions on a single site lattice
Authors: A. Hietanen and R. Narayanan
Abstract: We consider the large N limit of four dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills field coupled to adjoint fermions on a single site lattice. We use perturbative techniques to show that the Z^4_N center-symmetries are broken with naive fermions but they are not broken with overlap fermions. We use numerical techniques to support this result. Furthermore, we present evidence for a non-zero chiral condensate for one and two Majorana flavors at one value of the lattice gauge coupling.
