Title: On the renormalization of gauge theories in curved space-time
Authors: Peter M. Lavrov and Ilya L. Shapiro
Abstract: We consider the renormalization of general gauge theories on curved space-time background, with the main assumption being the existence of a gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism invariant regularization. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism one can show that the theory possesses gauge invariant and diffeomorphism invariant renormalizability at quantum level, up to an arbitrary order of the loop expansion. Starting from this point we discuss the locality of the counterterms and the general prescription for constructing the power-counting renormalizable theories on curved background.
