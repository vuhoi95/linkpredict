Title: An A_r threesome: Matrix models, 2d CFTs and 4d N=2 gauge theories
Authors: Ricardo Schiappa and Niclas Wyllard
Abstract: We explore the connections between three classes of theories: A_r quiver matrix models, d=2 conformal A_r Toda field theories and d=4 N=2 supersymmetric conformal A_r quiver gauge theories. In particular, we analyse the quiver matrix models recently introduced by Dijkgraaf and Vafa and make detailed comparisons with the corresponding quantities in the Toda field theories and the N=2 quiver gauge theories. We also make a speculative proposal for how the matrix models should be modified in order for them to reproduce the instanton partition functions in quiver gauge theories in five dimensions.
