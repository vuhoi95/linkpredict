Title: Perturbative quantization of two-dimensional space-time noncommutative  QED
Authors: M. Ghasemkhani and N. Sadooghi
Abstract: Using the method of perturbative quantization in the first order approximation, we quantize a non-local QED-like theory including fermions and bosons whose interactions are described by terms containing higher order space-time derivatives. As an example, the two-dimensional space-time noncommutative QED (NC-QED) is quantized perturbatively up to O(e^2,\theta^3), where e is the NC-QED coupling constant and \theta is the noncommutativity parameter. The resulting modified Lagrangian density is shown to include terms consisting of first order time-derivative and higher order space-derivatives of the modified field variables that satisfy the ordinary equal-time commutation relations up to O(e^2,\theta^3. Using these commutation relations, the canonical current algebra of the modified theory is also derived.
