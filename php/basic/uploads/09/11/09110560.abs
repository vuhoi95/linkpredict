Title: Holographic calculation of hadronic contributions to muon g-2
Authors: Deog Ki Hong and Doyoun Kim and Shinya Matsuzaki
Abstract: Using the gauge/gravity duality, we compute the leading order hadronic (HLO) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon, amu(HLO). Holographic renormalization is used to obtain a finite vacuum polarization. We find amu(HLO) =470.5 x 10^{-10} in AdS/QCD with two light flavors, which is compared with the currently revised BABAR data estimated from e^+ e^- -> pi^+ pi^- events, amu(HLO)[pipi]=(514.1 +- 3.8) x 10^{-10}.
