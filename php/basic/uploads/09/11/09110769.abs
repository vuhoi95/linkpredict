Abstract: We consider an exactly solvable model for production of fermions in the Friedman flat universe with a scale factor linearly growing with time. Exact solution expressed through the special functions admit an analytical calculation of the number density of created particles. We also discuss in general the role of the phenomenon of the cosmological particle production in the history of universe.
