Title: AdS_3/LCFT_2 - Correlators in New Massive Gravity
Authors: Daniel Grumiller and Olaf Hohm
Abstract: We calculate 2-point correlators for New Massive Gravity at the chiral point and find that they behave precisely as those of a logarithmic conformal field theory, which is characterized in addition to the central charges c_L = c_R = 0 by `new anomalies' b_L = b_R = -\sigma\frac{12\ell}{G_N}, where \sigma is the sign of the Einstein-Hilbert term, \ell the AdS radius and G_N Newton's constant.
