Title: Orthonormal Frame and SO(3) Kaluza-Klein Dyon
Authors: Hsiang-Lin Lou and Pei-Hsuan Li
Abstract: In previous paper, we present an SO(3) Wu-Yang-like Kaluza-Klein dyon so- lution satisfies the Einstein equation in the seven-dimensional spacetimes. In this note, we will show an alternative approach using an orthonormal frame, the Cartan's structure equations, and calculating the affine spin connection one-form,curvature tensor and Ricci tensor. The results from these two different methods are coincident.
