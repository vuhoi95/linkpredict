Title: Thermodynamics of SU(2) N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
Authors: Steve Paik and Laurence G. Yaffe
Abstract: The thermodynamics of four-dimensional SU(2) N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory is examined in both high and low temperature regimes. At low temperatures, compelling evidence is found for two distinct equilibrium states related by a spontaneously broken discrete R-symmetry. These equilibrium states exist because the quantum moduli space of the theory has two singular points where extra massless states appear. At high temperature, a unique R-symmetry-preserving equilibrium state is found. Discrepancies with previous results in the literature are explained.
