Title: On the aether-like Lorentz-breaking actions
Authors: M. Gomes and J. R. Nascimento and A. Yu. Petrov and A. J. da Silva
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of the CPT-even, aether-like Lorentz-breaking actions for the scalar and electromagnetic fields via their appropriate Lorentz-breaking coupling to spinor fields in three, four and five space-time dimensions. Besides, we show that the aether-like terms for the spinor field also can be generated as a consequence of the same couplings. Also we discuss the dispersion relations in the theories with aether-like Lorentz-breaking terms and find the tree-level effective (Breit) potential for fermion scattering and the one-loop effective potential corresponding to the action of the scalar field.
