Title: Strong coupling in extended Horava-Lifshitz gravity
Authors: Antonios Papazoglou and Thomas P. Sotiriou
Abstract: An extension of Horava-Lifshitz gravity was recently proposed in order to address the pathological behavior of the scalar mode all previous versions of the theory exhibit. We show that even in this new extension the strong coupling persists, casting doubts on whether such a model can constitute an interesting alternative to general relativity (GR).
