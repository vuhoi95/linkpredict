Title: Edge modes in the fractional quantum Hall effect without extra edge  fermions
Authors: Gabriel Di Lemos Santiago Lima and Sebastiao Alves Dias
Abstract: We show that the Chern-Simons-Landau-Ginsburg theory that describes the quantum Hall effect on a bounded sample is anomaly free and thus does not require the addition of extra chiral fermions on the boundary to restore local gauge invariance.
