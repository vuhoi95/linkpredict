Title: Reciprocity and integrability in the sl(2) sector of N=4 SYM
Authors: Matteo Beccaria and Guido Macorini
Abstract: We analyze the higher conserved charges of type IIB superstring on AdS5 x S5 from the perspective of a recently discovered generalized Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity. We provide several evidences that reciprocity holds for all the higher charges and not only for the energy. This is discussed in the simple case of twist L=2, and 3 operators in the sl(2) subsector at (a) multi-loop level in weak coupling, (b) classical level at strong coupling for the dual folded string.
