Title: WMAP5 Observationnal Constraints on Braneworld New Inflation Model
Authors: R. Zarrouki and Z. Sakhi and M. Bennai
Abstract: We study a new inflation potential in the framework of the Randall-Sundrum type 2 Braneworld model. Using the technic developped in(Phys. Rev. D75, 123504 (2007).1), we consider both an monomial and a new inflation potentials and apply the Slow-Roll approximation in high energy limit, to derive analytical expression of relevant perturabtion spectrum. We show that for some values of the parameter n of the potential, we obtain an perturbation spectrum wich present a good agreement with recent WMAP5 observations.
