Title: Solvable Critical Dense Polymers on the Cylinder
Authors: Paul A. Pearce and Jorgen Rasmussen and Simon P. Villani
Abstract: A lattice model of critical dense polymers is solved exactly on a cylinder with finite circumference. The model is the first member LM(1,2) of the Yang-Baxter integrable series of logarithmic minimal models. The cylinder topology allows for non-contractible loops with fugacity alpha that wind around the cylinder or for an arbitrary number ell of defects that propagate along the full length of the cylinder. Using an enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra, we set up commuting transfer matrices acting on states whose links are considered distinct with respect to connectivity around the front or back of the cylinder. These transfer matrices satisfy a functional equation in the form of an inversion identity. For even N, this involves a non-diagonalizable braid operator J and an involution R=-(J^3-12J)/16=(-1)^{F} with eigenvalues R=(-1)^{ell/2}. The number of defects ell separates the theory into sectors. For the case of loop fugacity alpha=2, the inversion identity is solved exactly for the eigenvalues in finite geometry. The eigenvalues are classified by the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the complex spectral-parameter plane yielding selection rules. The finite-size corrections are obtained from Euler-Maclaurin formulas. In the scaling limit, we obtain the conformal partition functions and confirm the central charge c=-2 and conformal weights Delta_t=(t^2-1)/8. Here t=ell/2 and t=2r-s in the ell even sectors with Kac labels r=1,2,3,...; s=1,2 while t is half-integer in the ell odd sectors. Strikingly, the ell/2 odd sectors exhibit a W-extended symmetry but the ell/2 even sectors do not. Moreover, the naive trace summing over all ell even sectors does not yield a modular invariant.
