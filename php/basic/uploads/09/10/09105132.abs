Title: Viscosity to entropy ratio at extremality
Authors: Sayan K. Chakrabarti and Sachin Jain and Sudipta Mukherji
Abstract: Assuming gauge theory realization at the boundary, we show that the viscosity to entropy ratio is 1/(4 pi) where the bulk is represented by a large class of extremal black holes in anti-de Sitter space. In particular, this class includes multiple R-charged black holes in various dimensions.
