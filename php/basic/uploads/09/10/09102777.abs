Title: Gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric stars in noncommutative  general relativity
Authors: Wen Sun and Ding Wang and Naqing Xie and R. B. Zhang and Xiao Zhang
Abstract: Gravitational collapse of a class of spherically symmetric stars are investigated. We quantise the geometries describing the gravitational collapse by a deformation quantisation procedure. This gives rise to noncommutative spacetimes with gravitational collapse.
