Title: Some remarks on the observational constraints on the self-interacting  scalar field model for dark energy
Authors: Julio C. Fabris and Deborah F. Jardim
Abstract: The dark energy component of the cosmic budget is represented by a self-interacting scalar field. The violation of the null energy condition is allowed. Hence, such component can also represent a phantom fluid. The model is tested using supernova type Ia and matter power spectrum data. The supernova test leads to preferred values for configurations representing the phantom fluid. The matter power spectrum constraints for the dark energy equation of state parameter are highly degenerated. In both cases, values for the equation of state parameter corresponding to the phantom fluid are highly admitted if no particular prior is used.
