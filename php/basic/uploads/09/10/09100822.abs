Title: Thermodynamics of dark energy interacting with dark matter and radiation
Authors: Mubasher Jamil and Emmanuel N. Saridakis and M. R. Setare
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics, in the cosmological scenario where dark energy interacts with both dark matter and radiation. Calculating separately the entropy variation for each fluid component and for the apparent horizon itself, we show that the generalized second law is always and generally valid, independently of the specific interaction form, of the fluids equation-of-state parameters and of the background geometry.
