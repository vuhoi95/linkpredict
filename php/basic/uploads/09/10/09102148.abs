Abstract: The one- and the two-particle propagators for an infinite non-interacting Fermi system are studied as functions of space-time coordinates. Their behaviour at the origin and in the asymptotic region is discussed, as is their scaling in the Fermi momentum. Both propagators are shown to have a divergence at equal times. The impact of the interaction among the fermions on their momentum distribution, on their pair correlation function and, hence, on the Coulomb sum rule is explored using a phenomenological model. Finally the problem of how the confinement is reflected in the momentum distribution of the system's constituents is briefly addressed.
