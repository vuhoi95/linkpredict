Authors: Marco Chiodaroli and Michael Gutperle and Darya Krym
Abstract: Type IIB superstring theory has AdS_3 x S^3 x M_4 (where the manifold M_4 is either K_3 or T^4) solutions which preserve sixteen supersymmetries. In this paper we consider half-BPS solutions which are locally asymptotic to AdS_3 x S^3 x M_4 and preserve eight of the sixteen supersymmetries. We reduce the BPS equations and the Bianchi identity for the self-dual five-form field to a set of four differential equations. The complete local solution can be parameterized in terms of two harmonic and two holomorphic functions and all bosonic fields have explicit expressions in terms of these functions. We analyze the conditions for global regularity and construct new half-BPS Janus-solutions which have two asymptotic AdS_3 regions. In addition, our analysis proves the global regularity of a class of solutions with more than two asymptotic AdS_3 regions. Finally, we discuss the dual interpretation as a supersymmetric interface theory for the half-BPS Janus solutions carrying only Ramond-Ramond three-form charge.
