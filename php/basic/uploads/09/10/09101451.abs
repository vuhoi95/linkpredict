Title: Generalized Octonion Electrodynamics
Authors: B. C. Chanyal and P. S. Bisht and O. P. S. Negi
Abstract: We have made an attempt to reformulate the generalized field equation of dyons in terms of octonion variables. Octonion forms of generalized potential and current equations are discussed in consistent manner. It has been shown that due to the non associativity of octonion variables it is necessary to impose certain constraints to describe generalized octonion electrodynamics in manifestly covariant and consistent manner.
