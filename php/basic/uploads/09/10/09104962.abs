Authors: John Davey and Amihay Hanany and Noppadol Mekareeya and Giuseppe Torri
Abstract: We investigate (2+1)-dimensional quiver Chern-Simons theories that arise from the study of M2-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. These theories can be elegantly described using brane tilings. We present several theories that admit a tiling description and give details of these theories including the toric data of their mesonic moduli space and the structure of both their Master space and baryonic moduli space. Where different toric phases are known, we exhibit the equivalence between the vacua. We identify some of the mesonic moduli spaces as cones over smooth toric Fano 3-folds.
