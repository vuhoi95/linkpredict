Title: On "Schwinger Mechanism for Gluon Pair Production in the Presence of  Arbitrary Time Dependent Chromo-Electric Field"
Authors: S. P. Gavrilov and D. M. Gitman
Abstract: Recently the paper "Schwinger Mechanism for Gluon Pair Production in the Presence of Arbitrary Time Dependent Chromo-Electric Field" by G. C. Nayak was published [Eur. Phys. J. C 59, 715 (2009); arXiv:0708.2430]. Its aim is to obtain an exact expression for the probability of non-perturbative gluon pair production per unit time per unit volume and per unit transverse momentum in an arbitrary time-dependent chromo-electric background field. We believe that the obtained expression is open to question. We demonstrate its inconsistency on some well-known examples. We think that this is a consequence of using the so-called "shift theorem" [arXiv:hep-th/0609192] in deriving the expression for the probability. We make some critical comments on the theorem and its applicability to the problem in question.
