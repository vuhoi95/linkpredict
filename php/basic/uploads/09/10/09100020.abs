Title: Phase diagram for non-axisymmetric plasma balls
Authors: Vitor Cardoso and Oscar J. C. Dias and Jorge V. Rocha
Abstract: Plasma balls and rings emerge as fluid holographic duals of black holes and black rings in the hydrodynamic/gravity correspondence for the Scherk-Schwarz AdS system. Recently, plasma balls spinning above a critical rotation were found to be unstable against m-lobed perturbations. In the phase diagram of stationary solutions the threshold of the instability signals a bifurcation to a new phase of non-axisymmetric configurations. We find explicitly this family of solutions and represent them in the phase diagram. We discuss the implications of our results for the gravitational system. Rotating non-axisymmetric black holes necessarily radiate gravitational waves. We thus emphasize that it would be important, albeit possibly out of present reach, to have a better understanding of the hydrodynamic description of gravitational waves and of the gravitational interaction between two bodies. We also argue that it might well be that a non-axisymmetric m-lobed instability is also present in Myers-Perry black holes for rotations below the recently found ultraspinning instability.
