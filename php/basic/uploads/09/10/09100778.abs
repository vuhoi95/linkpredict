Title: Current observational constraints on holographic dark energy model
Authors: L. N. Granda and W. Cardona and A. Oliveros
Abstract: We consider the cosmological constraints on the holographic dark energy model by using the data set available from the type Ia supernovae (SNIa), CMB and BAO observations. The constrained parameters are critical to determine the quintessence or quintom character the model. The SNIa and joint SNIa+CMB+BAO analysis give the best-fit results for $\beta$ with priors on $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\omega_0$. Using montecarlo we obtained the best-fit values for $\beta$, $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\omega_0$. The statefinder and $Om$ diagnosis have been used to characterize the model over other DE models.
