Title: Blackbody radiation with compact and non-compact extra dimensions
Authors: Ramaton Ramos and Henrique Boschi-Filho
Abstract: The problem of blackbody radiation in flat space with non-compact extra dimensions was analysed recently. In the present article we reanalyse this problem with compact (and non-compact) extra dimensions in flat space to observe the consequences of this approach upon Wien's displacement and Stefan-Boltzmann law.
