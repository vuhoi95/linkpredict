Title: On Horava-Lifshitz "Black Holes"
Authors: Elias Kiritsis and Georgios Kofinas
Abstract: The most general spherically symmetric solution with zero shift is found in the non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz class of theories with general coupling constants. It contains as special cases, spherically symmetric solutions found by other authors earlier. It is found that the generic solution has conventional (AdS, dS or flat) asymptotics with a universal 1/r tail. There are several special cases where the asymptotics differ, including the detailed balance choice of couplings. The conventional thermodynamics of this general class of solutions is established by calculating the energy, temperature and entropy. Although several of the solutions have conventional horizons, for particles with ultra-luminal dispersion relations such solutions appear to be horizonless.
