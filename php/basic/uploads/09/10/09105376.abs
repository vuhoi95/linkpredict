Title: Quantum Back Reaction to asymptotically AdS Black Holes
Authors: Kazumi Kashiyama and Norihiro Tanahashi and Antonino Flachi and Takahiro Tanaka
Abstract: We analyze the effects of the back reaction due to a conformal field theory (CFT) on a black hole spacetime with negative cosmological constant. We study the geometry numerically obtained by taking into account the energy momentum tensor of CFT approximated by a radiation fluid. We find a sequence of configurations without a horizon in thermal equilibrium (CFT stars), followed by a sequence of configurations with a horizon. We discuss the thermodynamic properties of the system and how back reaction effects alter the space-time structure. We also provide an interpretation of the above sequence of solutions in terms of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The dual five-dimensional description is given by the Karch-Randall model, in which a sequence of five-dimensional floating black holes followed by a sequence of brane localized black holes correspond to the above solutions.
